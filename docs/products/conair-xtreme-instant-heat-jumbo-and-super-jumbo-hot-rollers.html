    <ol>
            <li>My best friend loves them!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the U-shaped pins and have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>When I got them into my hair as best as I could adjust them to STAY, I had a headache within a minute just from the weight alone.</li>
            <li>and these worked great!</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for the style I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do the best job of creating curls.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let their size intimidate you, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>After searching for the best rollers I couldn&#x27;t believe I kept running into this set...</li>
            <li>My hair looks perfect every time</li>
            <li>(hairspray - tresemme is the lightest and best).</li>
            <li>Spray and you&#x27;re done!You&#x27;re welcome!</li>
            <li>Think they would be perfect for ALOT of people tho.</li>
            <li>I am VERY happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me, attempting to get the Gisele Bundchen waves then the jumbo size curlers are perfect for that!</li>
            <li>DO NOT straighten your hair before curling because although it may still work you are decreasing your chances of a perfect result.</li>
            <li>IF the correct clips were included I&#x27;d be very happy!</li>
            <li>But for people who have thinner and longer hair, you should try it out because the curls would look beautiful on you!</li>
            <li>It is a great buy!</li>

            <li>A great buy for a great price!</li>
            <li>I use TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray (One of Allures Greatest Products) with the rollers since I the rollers do get very warm.     </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I loved these rollers!  </li>
            <li>Good luck ladies!</li>
            <li>The curls came out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>when you do get it to work, the hair styles it produces are beautiful.</li>
            <li>It calms my hair, gives me shiny beautiful curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, hopefully you would be too!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product !</li>
            <li>Really happy with them.  </li>
            <li>use them all the time and they work great</li>
            <li>These, however, work great on my hair.</li>
            <li>These do not \\&quot;curl\\&quot; my hair but adds great bounce and fullness to it.</li>
            <li>The curls come out great.  </li>
            <li>I would be happy if you sent the plastic clips.</li>
            <li>Great price point as well.</li>
            <li>but great from someone who has longer hair.        </li>
            <li>I was hoping to get volume on the fly.  </li>
            <li>They work great.  </li>
            <li>My hair is medium length and the bouncy curls I get from using these rollers is great.  </li>
            <li>but I have a plastic clips from another/old set that I use which work great.  </li>
            <li>The clips are great and made no marks on my hair.</li>
            <li>They are great.</li>
            <li>The price was great.  </li>
            <li>They still work great</li>
            <li>this product gives great volume to layered looks.</li>
            <li>This is a great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found them to work great too.  </li>
            <li>I found this awesome powder stuff that works AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Then the curls look great.      </li>
            <li>I bought this to curl my hair because it got great reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>Maybe i&#x27;m just not getting it lol.</li>
            <li>Great curl.  </li>
            <li>ARE A GREAT ALTERNATIVE.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the curlers and the type of curl they produce.</li>
            <li>When I took the curlers out my hair looked great, for about 45 minutes...  </li>
            <li>Hers were ceramic and gave great body that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>The velvet around the roller is great but,</li>
            <li>but the clip would either fly off, or the hair would unravel.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this set.  </li>
            <li>have been using this product for about six months now, and am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>A GREAT LOOK  </li>
            <li>GREAT CURLERS</li>
            <li>The size of the rollers are great.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service.    </li>
            <li>I bought these rollers a month ago and they work really great.</li>
            <li>Works best if you let it warm up for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>These rollers are great.</li>
            <li>and it looks great and</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>Size of rollers is great.  </li>
            <li>the pins are not convienient at all, the conair roller clips will be a great advantage.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, after a 7 minute warm up, and a 10-ish minute set, I had perfect curls with shine &amp; bounce!</li>
            <li>I was really happy just with that.</li>
            <li>works great in both my hair and my kids.</li>
            <li>They work great to give hair a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li>This is replacement it works great.</li>
            <li>This product is great__</li>
            <li>These Rollers are great for volume, but they DO NOT curl your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and these rollers are great for smoothing out frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Great curlers.</li>
            <li>but I do think it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I am basically happy with them.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re a great product.</li>
            <li>these are great, the velvety surface holds them in well</li>
            <li>these work great.</li>
            <li>the pins that hold the curler in place dont do a great job.  </li>
            <li>They work great</li>
            <li>Great price and service with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Comes with pins instead of clips, which is great.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are great.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described purchased clips to use with rollers and happy with them.</li>
            <li>The rollers are great...</li>
            <li>This could have been a great product.</li>
            <li>Ordered these rollers 5 years ago and they still work great.</li>
            <li>It work great except for the clips that are included</li>
            <li>GREAT</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these.  </li>
            <li>Great buy at a great price.</li>
            <li>I immediately contacted Amazon customer service to tell them of these problems I experienced from seller Bargains AAA.  </li>
            <li>Great rollers...</li>
            <li>Purchased to add to set I already have ... works great ...</li>
            <li>Great set.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, work well, a great buy!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>They are FABULOUS!!!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the results!!</li>
            <li>Conair can do MUCH better than this!!  </li>
            <li>very nice set...works well</li>
            <li>These rollers are very nice.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out amazing!  </li>
            <li>and they are amazing!</li>
            <li>I thought for sure I would be spending an obscene amount for a best set.</li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>I love them, they are the best investment.</li>
            <li>Best of all my friends love the way my hair looks</li>
            <li>No way of putting it in seemed to be all that effective at holding the roller in place!</li>
            <li>Love these - still have them after 2+ years, work great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I wanted more volume and these rollers work great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the best results when I allow the rollers to heat up for more than 5 minutes (manufacturer states 2 as a minimum).</li>
            <li>so will use infrequently, but sure makes hair look nice!!)</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!</li>
            <li>But it made no difference; might as well have set my hair in ice cubes for all the good it did.</li>
            <li>I like the rollers as they do a good job with creating volume in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought on Amazon, shipping was good</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size and the velvet covering keeps your air smooth with no frizz.</li>
            <li>They are really good but don&#x27;t leave them \\&quot;unsupervised\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It truly seems like the good folks at Conair never even tried these before shipping them out.  </li>
            <li>Hassle-free, effective design - except for the fact that the pins often pop, rather, fly off the rolls once I&#x27;ve fastened them.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look good me.</li>
            <li>It definalty will look good on anyone elses but for anyone who has hair like mine, I wouldn&#x27;t reconmend it.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be gorgeous.</li>
            <li>did look good and had the body I wanted.</li>
            <li>Loved the way my hair curls.</li>
            <li>But all in all, a good product for temporary curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those of you who didn&#x27;t have good luck,  try that.  </li>
            <li>This set is quite nice, and it&#x27;s a great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>It still works good.  </li>
            <li>but if you have a lot of curly hair and are looking to smooth it with these the four largest ones are the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>I have shorter hair and this makes it look good.</li>
            <li>She said she really loved these rollers and they were sufficient to work for her and the tons of hair she has.</li>
            <li>The curlers work good however</li>
            <li>I like the rollers, and Conair has always had good products.  </li>
            <li>Conair puts out a good product and these are no exception.</li>
            <li>I have allways used Conair products and these rollers are just as good as all the others I have bought over the years.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to review the curlers under 4 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the best rollers for full hair with body.  </li>
            <li>Since I have seen so many posts about people not knowing how to use the wire clips, I thought I would share :)     Happy rolling!</li>
            <li>You need to play around with this many many times to see what positioning of the curls works best for you..</li>
            <li>It comes with 4 super jumbo rollers, which are perfect for shorter layers or shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>The fact that it heats up so quickly is also wonderful.</li>
            <li>This has been the best set of hot rollers for a newbie like me to get used to trying out!</li>
            <li>and they are great for when you want to have a more relaxed style.</li>
            <li>, if I could suggest IMPROVEMENTS to make these great rollers even greater for version 2.0, here&#x27;s what I would suggest to the design/engineering team:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the most part, these rollers have worked great.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I have been very pleased with them</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these rollers.</li>
            <li>All in all though I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure those of you who are experienced must already know.</li>
            <li>they heat up real quick and allow for a great look.</li>
            <li>The rollers looked nice and they looked like a good size but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this was just a dud unit, as the curlers had produced good volume and nice curls.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to my best friend who has very long hair, so the size of the rollers were perfect!</li>
            <li>But the rollers themselves are awesome, they heat quickly and create nice curls.</li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly, and create beautiful body and curls.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I just bought these a couple days ago and i absolutely love them!  </li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Even my grandmother&#x27;s foam rollers (that have no heat) work better than these things!  </li>
            <li>These are THE BEST hot rollers for longer hair that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I love the look that I get on those \\&quot;no shampoo\\&quot; days!  </li>
            <li>Bait and Switch for sure!</li>
            <li>These hot curlers work excellent!</li>
            <li>I love these and would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>excellent sizes and heats up fast!  </li>
            <li>I love this rollers!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>These things are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>But two more rollers would have been nice!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this product!</li>
            <li>Although it takes some getting used to for me, i love it!</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t explain in words much more than this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>These work much better!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, Worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>the rollers are not too hot to handle, i feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t break b/c of the velcro lining on the rollers, and i think the 1.5 in size is great!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll look even better!</li>
            <li>I am in love with these rollers!</li>
            <li>I love these rollers!</li>
            <li>These hot rollers are perfect!</li>

            <li>and my wife still uses these almost every day, and I still love how her hair looks!</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this purchase in 2009!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m definetly satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>So glad I found what I needed on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li>They turn out great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>The front row got so hot the silver plastic started to melt!!!!     </li>
            <li>rollers are fine, and work great for the money.</li>
            <li>Finding this set,  with all large and jumbo rollers was so awesome.  </li>
            <li>the ease of using this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>hair looks amazing for the rest of the day (provided it&#x27;s not humid).  </li>
            <li>A great smooth curling device..</li>
            <li>My hair is cap-sleeve level, and these rollers give nice body, volume and curl.  </li>
            <li>so they heat up nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather amusing, though not so efficient.</li>
            <li>What a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I thought it was an honest mistake, so I returned them and had them send a replacement explaining my dilemma.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are okay, good for volume, which is all I want</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying them these are a good catch :)</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size and my hair looks so much healthier when I pop these in my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>they were just barely warm to touch when i removed them.</li>
            <li>Yes I know what you&#x27;re thinking but honestly, take my word for it I do.</li>
            <li>Anyway, once it&#x27;s all on, I just wait until all the rollers are no longer warm.    </li>
            <li>It would be nice addition</li>
            <li>would have liked it if there was a temperature adjustment setting.</li>
            <li>The really nice thing about Conair is, if you purchase this, and not like the clips: call them.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li>They take out the frizz and give my hair a nice bounce.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t even own a blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>They arrived, and I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give these a 4 for the nice curls, but a 1-2 for convenience.</li>
            <li>This one, however, really made me happy!</li>
            <li>This means the rollers weren&#x27;t totally effective at smoothing frizz and imparting body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice..</li>
            <li>Honestly I have had my set for almost 5 years now and it still works well.  </li>
            <li>the kind that are all over the magazines.</li>
            <li>Also, for travel, it would be nice to have a place to store the clips.</li>
            <li>I thougt they were nice.</li>
            <li>I like to let it warm up for about 10</li>
            <li>I really am loving these curlers.</li>
            <li>Having two sized rollers is nice - and if you can&#x27;t get the clips in, practice.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still just not getting a nice grip with them.  </li>
            <li>The curls are still holding nicely 3 hours after setting them.  </li>
            <li>They are just the hook wire kind</li>
            <li>very nice big curls, still the best hair styling tool,...</li>
            <li>At first I thought these curlers would be great as they give good body to the hair.</li>
            <li>They are extremely fast and they model my hair which is very fine perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very good hot rollers for longer hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect size and high Quality.</li>
            <li>The good news is that that these rollers create nice strong bouncy curls and waves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my new purchase.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set of curlers from seller &amp;#34;Bargains AAA,&amp;#34; and received the item perfectly on time, but in used condition instead of new as it had been advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is good product, easy to use, and your hair looks like you spend a lot of time curling.</li>
            <li>Great Price and Quick Ship</li>
            <li>The jumbo rollers are perfect for the top for volume and the rest give a gentle wave.  </li>
            <li>My goal was to have nice, soft curls towards the bottom of my hair and great volume...don&#x27;t forget the volume!</li>
            <li>They come with hair pins, not clips, but very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very easy to use, and they stay put in your hair until you remove them.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, even for someone like me who has zero talent in managing hair.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! &#x3D;</li>
            <li>, im glad I took the chance, I love em!</li>
            <li>They heat up fine and curl good but</li>
            <li>I agree with others that the rollers themselves are fine and a good size for thicker hair</li>
            <li>I do have a good amount of hair, but it is fine and silky.</li>
            <li>I guess I am more of a curling iron kind of girl.</li>
            <li>This set works near perfectly to give my the look that I want.</li>
            <li>If you want then spray it with a good light hairspray for the finishing touch.</li>
            <li>But these are by far the best rollers I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>but this is the best set so far.</li>
            <li>You will be a sexy new you, and these are the best, so get them!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is so easy and fast</li>
            <li>Although due to the size, they don&#x27;t make the best travel set - but it would be great to be able to set these to both 110 and 240</li>
            <li>Heat up time is very quick!</li>
            <li>,I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR</li>
            <li>But in my situation I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and works gorgeously!</li>
            <li>This set is great, gives you that happy big curl waves.  </li>
            <li>I could not get a good curl for the special event I had that evening.</li>
            <li>Best for medium length hair...heats up quickly and stays hot....</li>
            <li>The curlers themselves are great - very large compared to most you will find.  </li>
            <li>The product is, actually, pretty great.  </li>
            <li>I used it today for the first time and have bouncy curls that have already lasted for 7 hours and look great.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT SET OF HOT CURLERS;IT</li>
            <li>Seller was great but product not so hot.</li>
            <li>This product is great that is why I bought it online rather than driving around trying to find that exact model in the stores.  </li>
            <li>these hot rollers work great-</li>
            <li>Works well fast to beautiful curls in 5 min</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so jealous of all the girls that have had great experiences with these rollers ;)</li>
            <li>They give my hair great shape and wave and are easy to use and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, heats up quickly and do a great job of giving my hair volume.</li>
            <li>Depending on the look I&#x27;m looking for, I use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair, keep them on for 10 minutes while I put on my makeup, and voila!</li>
            <li>The roller part is very comfortable but the metal slot burns the scalp.</li>
            <li>The one good thing that comes out of using these rollers was actually nice  non frizzy hair with very gentle curls.</li>
            <li>Nice body, beautiful, soft curls.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to set my hair, remove, and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style.</li>
            <li>I LOVED that this set had just jumbo and super jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>This set warms up fast and produces wonderful full curls.  </li>
            <li>These heat up quickly and do a good job curling hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice curl that lasts and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>The texture of the rollers grip my hair nicely and make it easy to wrap my hair around the roller.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews about the in-styler and that it often breaks quickly, I searched for good rollers and bought these.  </li>
            <li>this unit is fine and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>The product is great, but keep in mind that while some people complain that the rollers are too large, these are medium to me.  </li>
            <li>There are four jumbo rollers and eight large rollers, this is great</li>
            <li>When you do that, you get a HUGE dent in your hair!  </li>
            <li>It does make a huge difference in the results!</li>
            <li>I love these hair rollers.  </li>
            <li>Would probably work better for someone with finer/thinner hair.    </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the job the rollers does.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the item is doing ok.</li>
            <li>I also love the wire clips, they don&#x27;t leave an indent in the curl.  </li>
            <li>I love these rollers, I would have rated them a 5 if not for the metal clips.</li>
            <li>so glad I have them.</li>
            <li>But watch out for cracks in top.  </li>
            <li>will promote cracks in the plastic top withing a year.  </li>
            <li>You used to be able to order that part</li>
            <li>This was a replacement item and I absolutely love these curlers.  </li>
            <li>No accident, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re okay with having 10 clips for 12 rollers and paying $10-15 more than you thought you would, these might be the rollers for you.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the clips aren&#x27;t the greatest in the world but that hasn&#x27;t affected the way the curlers have worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Great rollers that heat up fast but who invented the clips???</li>
            <li>They are ok but</li>
            <li>love the concept, but my hair does not hold the curls.</li>
            <li>The top of all of the sets I&#x27;ve had have eventually warped from the heat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but until I find something better</li>
            <li>They were supposed to create wavy sexy hair and they might of</li>
            <li>but these rollers are so big they aren&#x27;t perfect either.     </li>
            <li>If you are trying to achieve lots of curls and your hair is on the shorter side, than the smaller sized rollers are perfect for you.</li>
            <li>The longer they heat, the better they will hold your hair.</li>
            <li>No matter what way I put the pins in or how many I used</li>
            <li>If you want wavy sexy curls this set of rollers is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I LOVE these rollers.  </li>
            <li>I myself have to admit I am able to create bouncy sexy curls and waves with these rollers and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>It works better for me if I leave the lid up after they heat up.  </li>
            <li>I love this product as it does not burn your fingers or scalp.</li>
            <li>I was able to get around the rollers</li>
            <li>I felt it works OK.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I wanted more of a wavy effect instead of the perm effect and these rollers do just that.  </li>
            <li>Who can argue with that?  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would be better with them if I did my hair more often.</li>
            <li>This Conair Instant Heat curlers are the best!  </li>
            <li>Sure makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I like these rollers they heat up fast and work great in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Put the clip OVER the curler on top and rotate it into the best possible position.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>USE ALL THE CURLERS (or most of them, there are 12, plenty for all your hair, won&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li>They are ok, I use the curling iron more now that I appreciate the outcome.</li>
            <li>The pin things that they come with do NOT work unless you stand perfectly still for the next 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Also, to get better results, I would get two sets, as I think the amount of hair I put on the rollers dilutes the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun because I know it&#x27;s going to look good in about 30 minutes.    </li>
            <li>But in order to get it to work and hold the curl, I needed more.  </li>
            <li>(I make it lightly damp, not dripping or anything!)    </li>
            <li>On the top of my head, all of them are claw clips that I use</li>
            <li>(make sure you put them on correctly, and they won&#x27;t let your hair fall out of the roller or flop around on your head.)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the wire clips on the top of my head, but I will use them around the sides/back.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t decide if I like the claw clips or the wire clips better.  </li>
            <li>When you watch the video, you see how she does the top, then when you go to the sides, there are two \\&quot;special\\&quot; spots on each side ofyour head that she says to go ahead and put rollers in.  </li>
            <li>I realize most of the products I&#x27;m suggesting are from them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these rollers in combo with the hair products I mentioned.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>So I do recommend buying a better set of clips for these.</li>
            <li>Most of them hold the roller in place but the rollers by my ears tend to slip.  </li>
            <li>The top of the case cracked from traveling.  </li>
            <li>FYI, I am Jim Pomm&#x27;s partner, Sara;  he is not the one using the rollers! :)</li>
            <li>I love the size and number of rollers in this set.</li>
            <li>Reasons why I love these curlers...</li>
            <li>They give me wonderful volume and curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>and I sometimes need more than 5 rollers.</li>
            <li>so haven&#x27;t used these types of rollers for many, many</li>
            <li>, it was just the cracked plastic top.</li>
            <li>sure there has to be a better product out there somewhere.</li>
            <li>so I could add some sexy waves to my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have softer hair than most, but they do not hold on to my hair at all.</li>
            <li>The ion curlers from Conair worked better for me.</li>
            <li>When I received the set I was pleased with the quality and flocking on the rollers, although the metal pins would not hold at all in my hair, so I purchased some Conair Pro Clips instead.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say it enough -- I LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li>but they leave your hair so style and sexy</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would give my hair more volume and curl.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such excellent service and[[ASIN:B00005A441</li>
            <li>The one downside, as many have mentioned is the clips.</li>
            <li>Love this rollers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used!I got a better deal here in Amazon than purchasing it from Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many sets where there were all sizes and</li>
            <li>I love these curlers.</li>
            <li>These heat up fast and curl great.</li>
            <li>Maybe better with a coarser type hair.</li>
            <li>And I really love the curls.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>If I want more body, I just leave the rollers in longer.</li>
            <li>I like using these rollers much better than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I bought it hoping it would give me cute curly hair</li>
            <li>I love these rollers.</li>
            <li>It is more of an annoyance that anything else, but I felt it deserved mentioning.</li>
            <li>It will set and hold better that way</li>
            <li>OK?</li>
            <li>I really love this set</li>
            <li>so it is touching the top of the roller facing your feet.</li>
            <li>I just wish they had better clips.</li>
            <li>If the set had 4 more rollers I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>work better for someone with more manageable hair.</li>
            <li>they did their job, most of the hair stayed in the roller while i did my make up, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend the metal clips if you&#x27;re going to go around the house waiting for it to set.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of any creative way to avoid the crimp, so I got rid of the rollers.</li>
            <li>Love the clips as well--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure once my hair is longer</li>
            <li>and it was slightly better</li>
            <li>I set with lots of hair spray, and my curls will last all day, so happy I purchased these!</li>
            <li>I love the heat that it produces in the rollers.</li>
            <li>so I get more curl than I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of these type and they never worked well.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s basically like a mortal mermaid with all that succulent, sexy hair whipped up like steam from a roiling pasta pot.  </li>
            <li>am so glad, because these rollers are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>now I know to allot more time to heating them up.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a spot for the clips, even just a magnetic surface on the top.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>but I wish they were more sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I love the curlers.</li>
            <li>Love the sizes of the rollers for longer hair.</li>
            <li>I had room to wrap more hair around the rollers.</li>
            <li>I used ItsJudysTime video on YouTube as a guide. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My hair looked fantastic!</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>The top cracked, but that was after years of use.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I love these.  </li>
            <li>i love this set.</li>
            <li>it is great thanks</li>
            <li>Conair you need to develop a better system.</li>
            <li>This is the largest size of heated rollers I&#x27;ve been able to find on the market.</li>
            <li>I expect to use these for many years.  </li>
            <li>And I love that they come with the old-style pins</li>
            <li>- they hold the rollers better than the newer clips.</li>
            <li>But if you buy them, I hope they work, and that you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>I have another set that has clips that heat up w/ the rollers and that type of set seems to hold the curl for most of the day, but I just wished it had as many jumbo rollers as this one.</li>
            <li>yet it looks relaxed--not too poofy on top.</li>
            <li>I love this aspect.</li>
            <li>I can turn my rollers on, walk my dog, roll my hair upon my return :)    </li>
            <li>I love love LOVE these curlers.</li>
            <li>Love the set.</li>
            <li>Love the jumbo size and love the metal pin/clips.</li>
            <li>Purchased a curved straight iron instead and that works great</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let hem heat for more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need to use curlers on the top of your head (or for bangs)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get the rollers to work with the clips provided ever, NOT ONCE.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get them to stay in for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they will work better with another hair type.  </li>
            <li>Thought they would hold more curl.</li>
            <li>I really love the results that I get from this product.</li>
            <li>It did save time but would probably have been better if I used stronger clips</li>
            <li>but they work much better.</li>
            <li>and I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>but okay.</li>
            <li>They make my hair look goofy.</li>
            <li>and sometimes if the curlers are just  hanging there, thats okay too.</li>
            <li>well I love the size of the curlers</li>
            <li>, I can do my hair in 15 minutes while doing things around the house, and they&#x27;re affordable :)</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Love the rollers but buy the clamps to hold them on.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I love the results I get when I use it</li>
            <li>In place better</li>
            <li>I purchased these thinking they would be better for my hair than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Some elastic band may hold the rollers better.</li>
            <li>This made my hair more curly than the relaxed waves I wanted</li>
            <li>Thought these jumbo rollers would help give me more volume but the heat just seemed to flatten my hair even more.</li>
            <li>For the top \\&quot;mo-hawk\\&quot; section, these pins do not work as well.</li>
            <li>Instead of using the pins, I used duck-bill clips for the top section.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t unplug my stove top or oven every time I finish using, so I think I can handle the Conair.</li>
            <li>This was not the magic bullet.</li>
            <li>which I had been satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s just a learning curve</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll get better with them</li>
            <li>Others have reported better results with the heat</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure hair type has a LOT to do with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the speedy way they heat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking the clamp clips would work a lot better.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t over pay for these.</li>
            <li>Could use more rollers.</li>
            <li>Could use more rollers.</li>
            <li>I saw a video on using metal hair clips vs the clips that came with the rollers that worked better</li>
            <li>Rollers produce awesome, glamorous big curls.</li>
            <li>and I love these rollers.</li>
            <li>I am able to have lots of body with my roller sets.</li>
            <li>There has GOT to be something better out there.</li>
            <li>While those aren&#x27;t the results I would like, they still give me very pretty, full, wavy hair, so I am happy with the way they work.</li>
            <li>they are very large and good for longer or curlier hair to redirect the curl.</li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas 2006 and was very excited on using it.  </li>
            <li>like I need more volume up there to balance out the curls and make it look really nice and full.  </li>
            <li>These were OK, they curled my hair pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The rollers were cool and the outsides of the sections of hair never got more than warm.</li>
            <li>They smooth out my hair very easily.</li>
            <li>These are great rollers and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that instead of that, I just have much more volume and bounce in my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>i love the way it makes my hair look, very full</li>
            <li>I have another hot curler set that has an attached compartment for the pins, which is a really good</li>
            <li>A good purchase if hot rollers are needed.</li>
            <li>Hot rollers were what everyone used 20 years ago, but were they as good as an iron?  </li>
            <li>Theses rollers are especially good for those with lots of long hair.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old, with good hair still (I love and recommend Wen products!)  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a large roller set for body and volume and thought this would be good after reading many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>These rollers are very easy to use and definitely do a nice job of providing fast curls!</li>
            <li>I love the clips instead of the pins and am growing my hair out even longer so that I can get the full benefit of these rollers!</li>
            <li>However, I tend to turn them on well before I need them, so they are super nice and</li>
            <li>As far as being quick and easy, these are some of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the manufacturer make the pins in more easily (and rapidly) differentiated colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love their compact package that is easy to stow away.  </li>
            <li>(i used giovanni, which i just discovered, love it, all natural stuff and smells great) and work in my hair.      </li>
            <li>I was sooo excited to get these because it seemed to have lots of jumbo rollers (more than most sets), but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this set, several sizes including the super jumbo (perfect!)</li>
            <li>Curlers are large, which is good; however, they don&#x27;t grip hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>The plastic roller clips are comfortable, and rather ingeniously shaped.  </li>
            <li>but Im sure that they will be fabulous becuz</li>
            <li>These hot rollers are the most amazing tool for styling your hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product - my first set lasted me many years until I had finally dropped them all one too many times.</li>
            <li>,it took three of those to be able to secure one roller in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The curlers did a great job as far as giving body to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these hot rollers...</li>
            <li>Also great for busy mommies.</li>
            <li>and most importantly - metal clips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real worth it fifteen or twenty minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat up fast and work good</li>
            <li>This has been a good set for my very</li>
            <li>They warm up quickly and get very hot (watch out!).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but I can freshen my hair with 2 or three quick hot rollers on the top..FAST FREE DELIVERY WITH AMAZON-EASY and great.</li>
            <li>As for the rollers, they are nothing special - but the size is good, curl is nice and not overboard.  </li>
            <li>So be prepared to buy the Super Clips, which are somewhat better (and you gotta love Conair -</li>
            <li>so I could have mostly all super jumbo or mostly jumbo depending on my hair length.  </li>
            <li>For me, ths jumbos are just perfect, the super jumbos are way too big for my shoulder length</li>
            <li>The super jumbo sized rollers are perfect for that effect, but there are only 4 of them in this set.</li>
            <li>The rollers were right in their own slots</li>
            <li>They are a dream come true for my type of hair!  </li>
            <li>The most significant difference was the ends that were curled, but otherwise I would not see a difference at all.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time for my senior portraits and I looked stunning!</li>
            <li>other all I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Okay, for starters, I bought this item at Walmart (about 28 bucks), excited to have soft,wavy,bouncy, voluminous, \\&quot;Hollywood\\&quot; curls.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for beginning of an updo or other fancy style.  </li>
            <li>I have other velvet curlers made by Remington, that are AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Pros: heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>they did heat up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very quick to heat up</li>
            <li>and they have a coating that makes the rolling of the hair easy to do.  </li>
            <li>These rollers heat quickly..and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>On the bright side they did heat up really fast and they are extremely easy to wrap around your hair and secure.</li>
            <li>The rollers get hot very quickly which is great and stay hot.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to curl and even after hairspraying it, and keeping the rollers in for 20 minutes, while the metal clips burned my scalp and neck</li>
            <li>So worth the practice to have such great results!</li>
            <li>Well, they do the job, but they are not all that easy to use.</li>
            <li>THESE CURLERS HEAT UP VERY QUICKLY</li>
            <li>They take awhile to heat up but are easy to get in and out.</li>
            <li>it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>#4: the pins are easy to use and don&#x27;t leave marks in my hair like some brand&#x27;s clips do.</li>
            <li>really easy to roll my hair in</li>
            <li>Easy to use and heats evenly.  </li>
            <li>so they dont burn my hair and easy to put in yourself</li>
            <li>They are fairly easy to fix</li>
            <li>The curlers are easy to handle and don&#x27;t burn your fingers if you grab them correctly.  </li>
            <li>Easy on the hair</li>
            <li>These rollers are easy to use and provide the result I wanted.  </li>
            <li>They work incredibly well with my very pin straight hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, they work, and produce good curls, but I wish they would make a set in this size that are designed like the classic ConAir Rollers -</li>
            <li>My hair is long and layered, and while my original Conair set was nice, these rollers are a great improvement.</li>
            <li>They do add a sexy wave if I do it right, though!</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to use the product right away.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the curlers they heat up fast and are easy to use..</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly &amp; are perfect for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li>These hot rollers are amazing.  </li>
            <li>On the whole, though, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I always liked Conair hot rollers and</li>
            <li>(they warm up so fast!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to get full use of them because of the pins....</li>
            <li>I use full over the roller clips with teeth, they stay in place much better.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully, however, there are not enough rollers.</li>
            <li>They are sometimes kind of hot to handle if I let them heat up any longer</li>
            <li>Not too hot to the touch and a nice size curl..</li>
            <li>Just be sure to let the rollers completely cool once applied to your hair before removing them.</li>
            <li>I loved these hot rollers from Conair!&lt;br /&gt;These are great for girls with long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The set is good except for two things that they changed with the new model.  </li>
            <li>This could just be that my hair is so fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, medium-long hair.</li>
            <li>They stay in just fine - thank you to the reviewer who supplied the technique of putting them in at 90 degrees then pivoting them underneath.  </li>
            <li>However, the ones that come with the set are perfectly fine if you know how to use them.  </li>
            <li>Thus, if you have fine hair, they burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I bought a set of the conair superclips and they work fine.</li>
            <li>The pins are fine</li>
            <li>The pins work fine, but the clips are under $9 and just easier and quicker to use, so do get them.</li>
            <li>I used the wire clips today and they held fine.  </li>
            <li>The clips don&#x27;t keep them in my hair (shoulder length and fine -</li>
            <li>The rollers were fine but the clips that came with them don&#x27;t even hold the rollers nor are they made for them.  </li>
            <li>but my hairdresser says I have \\&quot;a lot of fine hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for about an hour but goes straight pretty soon after unless I use a ton of hairspray.</li>
            <li>the hairsetter is fine - otherwise, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>Maybe they work for coarser, thicker hair, but not for my fine locks.  </li>
            <li>These are not bad rollers, just wish they can stay on more secure.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and they don&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li>These rollers are just fine.....</li>
            <li>Then, they work just fine.</li>
            <li>I did get the super clips and they are OK</li>
            <li>That day, my hair looked like a super model!</li>
            <li>These hit the mark with 6 Jumbo rollers and 4 SUPER jumbo rollers, which I have found myself using more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heat level is probably adequate for most, but sometimes I  wish I could ratchet it up a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I bought the Conair Super Clips and they stay much better.</li>
            <li>I will even take this with me traveling as it is a quick fix after completing makeup, you just unroll hair and go!</li>
            <li>up quick - fairly comfortable (as comfortable as hot rollers can be) - good purchase.</li>
            <li>would be ok for a quick touch up if you use sprays or gels</li>
            <li>Love these rollers They heat up quick and</li>
            <li>I love this product, it heats up quickly and does its job.</li>
            <li>so learn to act quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to hold your hair in a certain shape and be able to let it cool.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, warm up fast, and love the super jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>They are nice, get nice and hot fairly fast</li>
            <li>I liked the flocking on the rollers so my straight hair didn&#x27;t slip out so easily, BUT the wire clips scrape off the flocking.</li>
            <li>The clips if you put them straight up hold super good and don&#x27;t leave any marks on your hair.   </li>
            <li>Looks great when I first remove them but the curl fades away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are nice and large.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have them all large and</li>
            <li>I love my hot rollers!</li>
            <li>that still work great and have similar clips, which hold the rollers in just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do my hair but 1 or 2 times a year, but could used more curlers (my hair almost to waist) needs more hair pins in all the sizes, esp for the large curlers.</li>
            <li>They give frizzy hair a smooth look that lasts all day no matter the weather.</li>
            <li>These newer clips do not work and one would think in the instruction booklet they would have a drawing to show you how to put them in securely.</li>
            <li>I had to purchase another type of clip to securely hold the roller in place.</li>
            <li>Plugged &#x27;em in, the place filled up with noxious fumes and smoke that I could taste for hours.</li>
            <li>Also, the clips are an important part of this product and they SUCK.</li>
            <li>so I use these to straighten with a light wave to it...</li>
            <li>Overall happy with my Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>The bigger size is great for longer hair.  </li>
            <li>I get great, big curls and my hair is softer and shinier.  </li>
            <li>i am happy with the product and use it several times a week</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t stay in place with the cheap clips.  </li>
            <li>Your Hair looks so smooth and it don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having used Conair rollers for over twenty years I am very used to and adept at the wire pin holders.</li>
            <li>They got such great reviews</li>
            <li>In just a few minutes she had awesome curls!</li>
            <li>I have had these for a few years and they still work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I could find that nowhere, but someone suggested I use a light mousse.</li>
            <li>The larger curler is great.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I use them primarily at home.  </li>
            <li>These rollers heat fast and create a nice curl.</li>
            <li>Conair Champion Salon Pro Roller Clips] which are 10 clips for about $7 and available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>This product fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I have used this type of clip-roller before with no problems, but on this set the clips do not hold the rollers securely and they tend to droop or even fall out.</li>
            <li>I want them to smooth out the kinks, add some lift, and finish the ends, and these rollers do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I ended up letting the curlers heat for 30 minutes because the light never changed colors...</li>
            <li>It also looked great the next day.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit the jumbo rollers once you get your hair wrapped around it</li>
            <li>These are fabulous.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS product.    </li>
            <li>Then some of the rollers I have dropped on the floor did not seem to fit smoothly into the slot they heat up in and and the stress of pushing them in and pulling them out started to cause the rollers to break apart.    </li>
            <li>Dropped one of the rollers and it didn&#x27;t fit on the bar</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps, I depend greatly on reviews personally.</li>
            <li>this works great for when I am short on time in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I have now used this product three times and overall, I am happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I just hope they continue to be available.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so reasonably priced and are so amazing.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants amazing curls!!!</li>
            <li>They create gorgeous soft curls.</li>
            <li>The soft covering on the rollers is kind to your hair as well, and I think gives a better curl than an iron.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy and a really nice hot roller size for long hair.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t heat up to super hot, which is much healthier for my hair, not to mention they are a great price and Amazon shipped them to me for free.  </li>
            <li>I just used the rollers for the first time on my shoulder-length, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Also, once you purchase this full set, you will find with the directions, an address and cost for buying more Super Jumbo rollers--which I have done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because they do get hot quickly and are nicely sized.</li>
            <li>Go to a beauty store and get some, but bring one of these in, so that you can make sure that you buy the right size.</li>
            <li>And, I got these at Target, but Amazon has a better price right now.  </li>
            <li>It got hot within minutes of turn the unit on, the hair came out shiny and the curl held for a couple of days!!  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat quickly, are a nice large size that works great on long hair, and they are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are large and perfect for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I would love to have a set of ALL super size, but the large work ok.  </li>
            <li>I have been happy with this set of hot rollers so far.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, heats quickly, roller material is easy on the hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is full, shiny, soft and gorgeous looking.  </li>
            <li>Its quick and easy to use and Im</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the choice, it&#x27;s inexpensive, heats up pretty fast, rolls up nice (especially for we who are less experienced in rollers)</li>
            <li>These rollers are quick and easy - on days when there isn&#x27;t time for fussing, I heat them up, put them in and I am done in minutes.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, and</li>
            <li>They are no-fuss and clamp onto the rollers quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I think the ceramic just doesn&#x27;t hold the heat like the older style where each curler sat on its own rod.  </li>
            <li>They do heat up quickly, and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair is very manageable, and it is making the growing out process very easy.  </li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with her new Instant Heat Jumbo Rollers!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty good at this sort of thing, but I have never been able to use the wire clips that the old fashioned rollers had, and the \\&quot;super</li>
            <li>I bought this product with the hope that I would FINALLY be able to turn my long straight hair into some beautiful flowing curls.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this product, and would not hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Works like magic ;)</li>
            <li>These JUMBO rollers are great for long hair.</li>
            <li>Great for Long Hair.  </li>
            <li>When I cut my hair just past my shoulders, the curls were PERFECT!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I&#x27;ve been to learn about them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun to do my hair every morning!  </li>
            <li>Great for long hair.</li>
            <li>Got the chi iron instead and so worth it!</li>
            <li>I was never before able to use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try them out when I got them.</li>
            <li>Great for long hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using hot rollers for years, and this set is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try them.</li>
            <li>They are so worth the price!</li>
            <li>So the wait for it was totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Really glad I purchased these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>On humid days I spray each piece of hair with hair spray first before I wrap it around the curler and the curl stays better.</li>
            <li>I bought mine for $10 at a yard sale unused and still in the original box.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and the pins work just fine without bumps.  </li>
            <li>So I was really excited when I found them.</li>
            <li>It is the only product of its kind I have found that will hold all my hair!</li>
            <li>Love these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>When I looked for the original online, they were no longer selling on the site.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It makes for lovely hair, for the first 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with how these foam rollers hold my hair, and with how hot they get.</li>
            <li>these work better than any of these hot irons,&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li>I also looked around and found you can buy a set of claw-like clips made by Conair for the rollers that are much easier to use and typically more secure (for my hair thickness).</li>
            <li>I give this a solid four stars because I am still waiting for CHI or Sedu to come out with an awesome professional set that has no flaws, whatsoever.</li>
            <li>To be even more honest you increased the size of four rollers and yet some how couldn&#x27;t possible figure out how to create a receptacle for the clips?</li>
            <li>YOU LET THE CURLERS COMPLETELY HEAT UP FOR 5 MINUTES AND THEN LEAVE THEM IN FOR 20 MINUTES FOR BEST POSSIBLE RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li>I wanted more professional, stylish look for work.</li>
            <li>The first set lasted me about 4 years, and were still working although not heating as hot as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>They heat up super quick and create great big waves of hair.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to use these rollers, buy the plastic clip-on clips that hold the roller more securely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open for a nice set of 3 inch curlers, but in the meantime, I&#x27;m in love with these.</li>
            <li>Without good pins to keep the rollers in place, the curler really are not of much use.  </li>
            <li>I own an older set of Conair rollers, and there is a little compartment to hold the metal pins, but surprisingly, this one does not!    </li>
            <li>I was looking for some new hot rollers and felt that these would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These rollers are dependable and great for adding volume and loose curls to hair.</li>
            <li>Rollers get hot quickly and are hotter than most electric curlers but the pins do not keep the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li>These rollers heat up quickly and work great for long hair.</li>
            <li>These heated up quickly and the size was great for my long hair.</li>
            <li>I like the way they heat up fast and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I just love these hot rollers, so easy and fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone using these has very pretty curls, but they&#x27;re probably also walking around with crimps in funny places all over their heads.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;smart clip&#x27; is meant to be better than the metal pins, but they truly aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Anticipating problems based on reading some of the reviews, I ordered special clips.  </li>
            <li>This product was used by me in Denmark, so I had to use special electrical connectors.</li>
            <li>will use on special occasions</li>
            <li>I cannot get them to hold for nothing in my hair and it normally curls very easily.</li>
            <li>To Go\\&quot; rollers that work beautiful, I&#x27;ll just have to get another set as these only come with 5 large rollers.    </li>
            <li>Was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the rollers, it would look great initially, but then it would fall out within 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with how fast they get hot and how well they work.  </li>
            <li>Overall good quality.</li>
            <li>Cool to the touch with a velvety covering.  </li>
            <li>Let it completely cool</li>
            <li>I wish I could find my old Clairol set I used to own....</li>
            <li>I leave them in for maybe 20 minutes - until cool -</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this set is the size of the rollers - just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>i really wanted to love these</li>
            <li>also I have thick hair and these worked perfect with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it would be nice if they could be stored with the rollers like my old set.</li>
            <li>I make sure to spray the whole strand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lifting up and full looking -</li>
            <li>They create a nice natural curl that hold for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am sure the lid will crack too, but I like the results so much</li>
            <li>The rollers were cool in my hair after 15 - 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Full, bouncy body with these rollers.  </li>
            <li>They also come with the metal wire clips that keep the curlers in your hair very well, unlike those plastic clips that come with most curlers I see.     </li>
            <li>best results I&#x27;ve gotten have been when my hair has a ton of product in it and has not been washed in at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Rather than being able to walk around and put on makeup or get dressed, this product forces one to stay absolutely stationary to have any prayer of getting the rollers to stay in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>item was returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li>the curls are so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Loved the fact that the rollers were big.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product, well built.</li>
            <li>The velvet flocking on the rollers seems to be much gentler and I love the quick heat-up time.  </li>
            <li>The rollers themselves do heat up very quickly, but they get too hot.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for rollers that would be easy to use as I was a first time user.</li>
            <li>Great quality, though - long lasting and my hair is super healthy despite using these!</li>
            <li>Every set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned had a place to put these things in because they&#x27;re so easy to lose.</li>
            <li>These rollers are perfect when I want some volume and soft, loose curls.  </li>
            <li>I definately recommend this product for people like me and even, as I have seen, for people who have very straight baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a whole set of 12-14 large (purple) rollers.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its a really great product, just not for my hair.</li>
            <li>It does heat up nice and quick and stays hot for a long time, but the best part is that it makes my hair shiny gives it a nice bounce and last all day long with a bit of hairspray and mousse.   </li>
            <li>Love my new set!  </li>
            <li>Heat up fairly quickly</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I waited until I tried the rollers and then immediately ordered the Conair Super Clips.  </li>
            <li>Quick to heat up and</li>
            <li>I needed Conair SPC10R Super Clips to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>They create voluminous curls and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I quickly unplugged it.</li>
            <li>They heated quickly and were super velvety.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews before purchasing my first set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>It takes practice to be able to use these properly, and yes the clips could be more convenient to use, but they are doable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set after reading many reviews on many different products.</li>
            <li>The rollers do heat up quickly and work</li>
            <li>Add curl or body to your hair in a quick fashion.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly         </li>
            <li>The set heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>The super clips work well once you figure out that the clips need to grap the hair closest to the head.</li>
            <li>They do curl hair, so that&#x27;s a point on their side, and they are quick to heat up -- to a burning temp.</li>
            <li>It does heat up quickly, as promised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped tremendously).  </li>
            <li>The claw clips I bought are the Conair SPC10X Super Clips.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;super jumbo\\&quot; curlers are cumbersom....</li>
            <li>and they heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also invested in the Conair SPC10X Super Clips, to use insead of the pins.  </li>
            <li>I like these rollers, but i would love them if they included 3-4 more rollers because 12 is not enough to do all my hair.</li>
            <li>have been using super jumbo velcro rollers after shampooing my hair - drying it and then setting - leaving them in as I do my makeup and then removing the rollers.  </li>
            <li>below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set comes with 6 jumbo rollers and 4 super jumbos.</li>
            <li>I bought these hot rollers after reading the reviews on Amazon and finding that they were higher rated than most.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and curl my hair well.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly, but the clips don&#x27;t hold the curler in my hair, Consequently, I felt my ear and neck burning.</li>
            <li>The hair curled, but fell quickly.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and they don&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>Heat up quick, lots of volume and my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>Conair SPC10R Super Clips]]</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leave marks, and they hold the rollers in place far more securely.  </li>
            <li>It heated  quickly, in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>or \\&quot;Super Jumbo\\&quot;, they are not.</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly, but the clips do not stay on.  </li>
            <li>for a quick fix or shorter hair i would use the 5 roller travel set.</li>
            <li>you turn it on, it has a mild plastic-y odor and it does steam up so</li>
            <li>I ordered plastic super clips and will update my review after I try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Conair SPC10X 10 Super Clips] or [ASIN:B001DCE1JU</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 extra jumbo rollers from the company and they fit nicely in the container.</li>
            <li>My oldest has super strait hair and for hers it doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>If you purchase this set you need to buy the Conair SPC10X Super Clips (also sold on Amazon).</li>
            <li>This CHV14 heats up quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li>So I had to buy the Conair SPC10R Super Clips which do the job without denting my hair.  </li>
            <li>it heats up quick.  </li>
            <li>I like my older set better.</li>
            <li>I bought these for the Super Jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>And the bonus is that they do heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>and they are quick to heat up.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly which</li>
            <li>You can quickly put them in and take them out, with no hassle.</li>
            <li>but I find if you roll them quickly they don&#x27;t singe your fingers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using a curling iron takes me a hour if I&#x27;m lucky and keeps me attached to the sink.  </li>
            <li>I may try them one more time (3 is a charm) just to make sure that they don&#x27;t work, and then I am going to return them and buy a traditional 1\\&quot; curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly, makes hair smoother.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Okay, now that I have been using hot rollers on my hair for almost 2 years, I thought I should give my opinion about these hot rollers and the metal pins that are included.</li>
            <li>but they fall out too quickly.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super nice..I would recommend them</li>
            <li>decided to go with these Conair Rollers, as they were flocked, jumbo, and heated quickly, like my Remington Pearls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love that this set includes different sized rollers to create a more natural-look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>After many years, I have finally retired my old hot rollers and am very glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I put them in, wait for them to cool after about 20 min., and I have the shiniest bouncy curls that are so pretty!</li>
            <li>easy to use and warms up fast, excellent for styling with little time highly recommend !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Earlier this year I decided that I wanted some of the vanity space back that was being taken up by the enormous footprint of my wonderful and beloved [[ASIN:B003V27RB4 Remington H9000 Pearl Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers]], which I had been using for over two years, and never had any issues with, other than the huge space they require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see people with gorgeous, full hair, and they don&#x27;t even have to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>and I think the rollers are too hot for my fine hair, but they are fun and quick to use.</li>
            <li>The rollers get very hot.  </li>
            <li>The ends get very hot and burn your scalp while are in.</li>
            <li>The rollers didn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hot curlers.</li>
            <li>Very hot to set hair</li>
            <li>The size of the rollers is good for long hair.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly and were easy to use, even for someone who didn&#x27;t really know what she was doing.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Love the large size but the first day I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in.</li>
            <li>With these, the curls were soft, extrememly easy to use and lasted all day!  </li>
            <li>I would love for my hair to have more body, but this is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>These are really good if you have long hair!</li>
            <li>Maybe I should experiment more, or just get some new clips.</li>
            <li>I love the new \\&quot;straighter\\</li>
            <li>Today, I went to Walmart (which I abhor) and purchased a brand new set, I made sure the box was unopened before I purchased.  </li>
            <li>They give wonderful waves without looking like you tried too hard!</li>
            <li>First, the cloth cover of the roller makes it slide right through my hair (which is somewhat fine in texture.)</li>
            <li>These hot rollers really work like magic .</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and roll easily.</li>
            <li>I love these rollers they leave a full bouncy and soft look.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and cool pretty quick once shut off.</li>
            <li>My hair has a good bit of body and is shoulder length, thick, but very fine.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, fine hair that tends to get great, lasting curl from hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Not the fanciest hot rollers but perfect for a teen or someone who only uses them every so often.</li>
            <li>You will appreciate how much better the curls set when you give it just a little more time to heat up!      </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve always used hot rollers to \\&quot;uncurl\\&quot; our hair!</li>
            <li>I promise I don&#x27;t work for Big &amp; Sexy hair products!  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers are a godsend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done and pretty!</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well they would work on long hair, but several review said that it did a great job</li>
            <li>later the body/waves in my hair looked even better and sexy than it did when I first styled it.</li>
            <li>I am sure there are other hot rollers on the market that would be a lot more convenient!</li>
            <li>You would think Conair would have enough experience to know better!</li>
            <li>I like that the rollers are 1.5 inches -- good for loose, bouncy</li>
            <li>They hold the best and are VERY hard to find.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and the flocked rollers are just the right size and don&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li>To give some context, my hair is fine and pin straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the ConairPro Pro Clips with 2 other types of hot rollers and they worked great, so</li>
            <li>Rollers do heat up fast and the pins work just fine.</li>
            <li>I wish they were all Jumbo because the Super ones are really only good for  volume (you don&#x27;t get much curl from them) but</li>
            <li>Great for those days when my hair needs a little boost.  </li>
            <li>IONIC shine is optimum, the velvet flocking protective to the hair and just a handy set to have with all of the same sized rollers instead of having a bunch of loose rollers that you never use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine, and these rollers give it incredible body, yet not curly - just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>They work very well, however they give more of a body wave than a curl because the rollers are so large.</li>
            <li>Good, but only for a certain hair length.  </li>
            <li>The large size leaves nice natural curls.  </li>
            <li>The large ones are good but there are only 4.</li>
            <li>Of course, our hair does not come out curl free, but with nice gentle smooth loose curves.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is a very good set of big and jumbo rollers .</li>
            <li>Overall, my hair did turn out curly and looked nice, but the curls were a little kinky and with all the struggling with the rollers, it turned in to more of a 80&#x27;s Dynasty curl than a nice wave.</li>
            <li>she uses them everyday and they make her hair look great.  </li>
            <li>AND THIS HELPS TO CALM</li>
            <li>These rollers really help smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li>Work well but would be nice if they would add an extra clip.</li>
            <li>I only gave them 4 stars because the clips that hold them in aren&#x27;t totally effective</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO FUN to have my hair looking fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice looking curler set, but the actual job it does is not what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>rollers are nice and big and helps straighten my curly hair.</li>
            <li>The smaller ones are nice</li>
            <li>To improve the design, Conair should make a hinge that will stay open when required, and a clear plastic top that will not crack on its own.</li>
            <li>Definintely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Liked the size of the curlers although the felt on each curler feels like it will come off after several uses</li>
            <li>I wanted them mostly to just add a soft \\&quot;Kardashian\\&quot; wave.</li>
            <li>Maybe, but they were barely warm enough to create a curl.</li>
            <li>The results after 10 minutes were nice, big curls.</li>
            <li>i have always wanted that sexy soft curl/</li>
            <li>wavy (most near the end of the hair)</li>
            <li>These sizes work great with my independent, unruly, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the clips - the old ones are better.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked is an automatic shutoff after a period of time.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair but a lot if it, so it is not the best set of rollers for me.</li>
            <li>I bought these because my old Conair rollers had seen better days.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the clips as sometimes they leave marks on my hair</li>
            <li>They are too short to be effective.</li>
            <li>There are two size rollers in this set- big and jumbo, and each has its own sized pins.</li>
            <li>Although the box says it only takes 2 minutes to warm up</li>
            <li>And the clips work best going up under the curl, not from behind.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you leave them on until your hair has completely cooled or the curl will not hold or be as bouncy.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the clips, but they work</li>
            <li>They make nice big curls.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else was worth using.  </li>
            <li>I looked on utube, but couldn&#x27;t find anything useful.</li>
            <li>This product does NOT get warm enough!!!</li>
            <li>They bounce everywhere...on tile floors and granite countertops - fun, and boy can they hide.</li>
            <li>The rollers gave me a nice curl to the root and left me with a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>I also bought them because they come with the old fashioned metal clips which work so much better than plastic clamps.</li>
            <li>I did not have the significant problems that some experienced making the curlers stay in---but my hair is thick and medium-long.  </li>
            <li>These curlers heat up very quickly and are the normal warm-to-the-touch when putting them in.</li>
            <li>The unit did heat up quickly and didn&#x27;t seem to burn my hair although rollers were briefly hot to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit heats up pretty quickly -- within 3-4 minutes, the curlers are at maximum heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They get hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and stays hot.  </li>
            <li>While these rollers do heat up quickly, I found them to be too hot to use.  </li>
            <li>The rollers grip my hair unlike other types of rollers that are smooth, my hair just slips right off of those kind.  </li>
            <li>I bought the jumbo hair curlers as a quick and easy way to give my hair body during the busy morning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything aye or nay towards the dropping of curlers and how they don&#x27;t fit in just right afterwards, but I have noticed that there are certain ones that fit in certain spots better than others, so if you purchase these and are having difficulties putting them back in the slots, try moving them around before you give up and just try to force them in.    </li>
            <li>needs a hole to hold the hair clips but good product other then that.</li>
            <li>I think the suggestion that one other reviewer had, to wear a shower cap, is a good one.</li>
            <li>They get very hot, so hot</li>
            <li>These get very hot, &amp; work very well!  </li>
            <li>I love this things and highly recommend them to anyone who wants to be a curly girly.</li>
            <li>Everything else about the set is great--the right amount of the two sizes to suit me.</li>
            <li>I put curls in quotes because my hair does not turn out curly - but waves isn&#x27;t the right word either because waves makes me think of a perm.      </li>
            <li>and I think I made the right selection.  </li>
            <li>The roller just flipped right over the clip and fell out.</li>
            <li>right?).    </li>
            <li>you might need longer rollers (my hair is about 4 inches below my shoulder and fits just right)    </li>
            <li>it just never looks right.  </li>
            <li>GIVES MY HAIR LOTS OF BODY AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CURL</li>
            <li>Im rating 4 stars right now</li>
            <li>I think the &#x27;velvet&#x27; finish makes them just slide right out.</li>
            <li>My hair just unrolls right out of them.  </li>
            <li>It has taken some time to get the clip in there just right to hold the roller in my hair.</li>
            <li>look that is so in right now.  </li>
            <li>and they were right.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Some times people want to over price things which isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, rolls up easily (doesn&#x27;t slip like old-school hot rollers used to), and stays on with the right hot roller clips.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and when I previously used the \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; kind of rollers they stayed in well.  </li>
            <li>so my hair falls out and its thining, I have tried every thing and these rollers make my short hair look full and healthy.</li>
            <li>These hot rollers are a snap to use, don&#x27;t have to stay in my hair long at all to curl, and warm up quickly.  </li>
            <li>How To: Soft, Sexy Curls with Hot</li>
            <li>I honestly just think they don&#x27;t get hot enough for me.</li>
            <li>i unrolled probably after 15 minutes, and my hair had the soft big curls, super bouncy, loved it.</li>
            <li>They tame my frizzy hair and give me large beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more like clamps, so if you have fine hair, they will literally clamp wide ridges into the roots of your hair - exactly where you&#x27;re trying to create volume!</li>
            <li>I like to use a little hairspray at the roots and then some redkin curl starch (amazing stuff!)</li>
            <li>The case is nice and slim, the cord is a good enough length to be convenient, and in general the black and purple looks cute.  </li>
            <li>I have fine to medium straight hair, and think I need to experiment with different products to see if I can give my hair more texture before I put the curlers in.</li>
            <li>have medium length fine hair and have always found that electric curlers give me nice soft body in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Easy to clip on, but the roller has to be level on your head; otherwise the grip will not be secure enough to keep the hair or the roller in place.  </li>
            <li>If you order this product be sure to order the super clips at the same time.  </li>
            <li>They set quickly, and give you sexy waves and body that will last all day.      </li>
            <li>I feel like a super model with my big piles of lovely waves.</li>
            <li>If I were to make recommendations to the manufacturer, it would be to offer 6 (instead of 4) super jumbo curlers and make them larger and offer the remaining 6 (instead of 8)</li>
            <li>The four Super Jumbo rollers make spending time on my hair so much faster, it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>heated the rollers up for 10 minutes and used all the rollers to curl my combed,long, fine hair and let the rollers cool before removing them; my hair curled up in big wavy curls that I quickly covered in hairspray.</li>
            <li>These curlers heat quickly, are large in size, and work well.</li>
            <li>Very easy, heats up fast, and seems to be very durable so far!</li>
            <li>This product is good if you are looking for very loose large curls.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and you don&#x27;t have to leave them in for long in order to get nice soft curls.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and comes to about the middle of my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>This is the only set that I have seen that comes with super jumbo sized rollers (over 1.5\\&quot;) which is really great for people with long hair.</li>
            <li>The case is a little smaller than I was expecting, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>An important tip when using any hot roller is to make sure your hair is completely dry before using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as I practice with them a little more things will improve.</li>
            <li>I have been using Conair&#x27;s older model with large rollers similar to this one and have loved them.  </li>
            <li>I love the size of these rollers they are perfect for long thick hair!</li>
            <li>I have a set of VS hot rollers that are not covered, and my hair slips right off of them.     </li>
            <li>#3: plenty of curlers, all one size (large!).  </li>
            <li>You have to attach it exactly the right place for it to hold.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my girlfriend, because she really wanted a quick alternative to a curling iron, something she could leave in her hair while she does her make-up.</li>
            <li>While these do heat up quickly they do not work very well.</li>
            <li>Super fast heating time.</li>
            <li>The super jumbo size rollers work very well for both.  </li>
            <li>it shows the curls on the bottom if your going for easy and soft curls</li>
            <li>But these curlers gently (and quickly) style my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>it would have been a better product if they left the super jumbos out of the case and added more regular jumbo curlers.    </li>
            <li>the curl stays but its the messiest curl near the root or its completely straight up top and curled at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used them a few times, but have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Well,I&#x27;m glad they were not expensive because I barely get a wave!Guess</li>
            <li>I got a package of 10 for less than $10 and they do a good job of holding the curlers and not leaving a mark.</li>
            <li>These rollers really do heat up quickly as claimed, under 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way down, no longer horizontal, but becoming more vertical.&lt;br /&gt;Solution?  </li>
            <li>these curlers worked great- nice and soft and made my hair nice and soft with big silky bouncy curls- just a dream to run my fingers through or walk down the street looking side to side with my big soft bouncy curls bouncing off of the top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li>They are good quality, heat quickly, and provide a natural loose curl look.</li>
            <li>The larger size is perfect for adding body and volume, plus they heat up in less than a minute!  </li>
            <li>I have tons of very fine wavy hair and smaller hot rollers make me look like an elderly poodle.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair and was very excited to receive this product.  </li>
            <li>They get super hot super fast and work really well.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it four stars is although the curls are beautiful, they don&#x27;t seem to stay for very long.</li>
            <li>and it gives me the kind of loose curl that I am looking for.</li>
            <li>And its very fast.  </li>
            <li>Perfect number of rollers not too big not too small great for small storage spaces  </li>
            <li>and it also did heat up very fast, but.....</li>
            <li>Very fast heat up.</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>Great rollers, less damage to hair and awesome for my long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>But on the bright side they are made well and when I want just a little wave</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference if you really let them heat up for a good 8 minutes, yes, they are hot after 2 or 3 minutes, but you notice that they get hotter as you are using them up, causing one side to have tigher curls than the other, so just plug it in while you are blow drying or doing your makeup.  </li>
            <li>The rollars are fine in that they heat up fast and do what they are supposed to do, but those clips leave huge dents in my hair that do not come out until the next washing.  </li>
            <li>The little metal clips that come with it hold pretty good</li>
            <li>There are 8 large rollers and 4 super large rollers.  </li>
            <li>Love the two different sizes.</li>
            <li>The curlers seem pretty durable (as I just got them and already dropped one on the tile...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers on a regular basis for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Once rollers are heated leave the top open.  </li>
            <li>but the rollers are so incredibly HOT to the touch (of both fingers and scalp) that they heat up the clips to the point of singeing hair and skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was as straight as ever!      </li>
            <li>I purchased these rollers and just tried them today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Especially on the top of your head...</li>
            <li>When she told me hot rollers, the memories of my repressed childhood nightmares came to mind.</li>
            <li>so I find it most difficult to achieve the perfect curl (and actually last all day)</li>
            <li>They get way too hot sometimes.</li>
            <li>The last set I had got so hot and overheated that the top melted and the plastic part of the curlers literally liquified.</li>
            <li>These hot rollers don&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>This is the first set I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>The hot rollers I received came with wire clips.</li>
            <li>I had been concerned about whether I had time for hot rollers, but it takes me maybe 5  minutes to insert them.</li>
            <li>FAST!    </li>
            <li>They are plenty hot by that time.</li>
            <li>but these work really well!</li>
            <li>How are you supposed to use them if the rollers themselves get so hot?     </li>
            <li>The first time I used them I got compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>They do exactly that</li>
            <li>This would seem obvious to most people.  </li>
            <li>Ends are too hot to touch and they burn my scalp unless I pad with cotton squares.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s back to wearing 5 jumbo velcro rollers overnight on top of my head</li>
            <li>The curlers get extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t believe the frustration that comes with this is worth that much money.</li>
            <li>I love the big rollers.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly pleased with my recent purchase of the Conair Jumbo-Sized Heat Rollers.  </li>
            <li>By the time I finished rolling my hair, the rollers were so hot as to burn my hands.</li>
            <li>so i need to leave hot rollers in a bit longer than shorter-haired people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid user of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>i have super curly hair, but fine, not coarse</li>
            <li>I had this problem with my old set and must admit that I see a big improvement with far fewer split ends and frizzy fly away strands.</li>
            <li>Having watched my mom use hot rollers as a child, the clips were no mystery to me, and the product is well priced on Amazon.      </li>
            <li>I LOVE it and constantly get complements on my hair</li>
            <li>Funny thing, I roll 90% on my hair UP on the rollers,  not under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen similar sets for $50 and more.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering Conair&#x27;s smaller rollers for when I want more curl.  </li>
            <li>I believe that there are better quality product out there for the same price.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any discomfort using it, it was not that hot at all.</li>
            <li>, they do work and give volume, but you better get some hair spray (or the curls last like 10 minutes)!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s almost too hot to hold them.  </li>
            <li>With each bunch of hair that I gather to put in a roller, I spray it first with \\&quot;Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>- Once I get all of the rollers out, I will spray it with \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair Spray &amp; Play Volumizing Hairspray\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing &amp; Texturizing Powder\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Bought these because I wanted the hot roller effect, but not 1980&#x27;s prom hair...</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had almost given up on curling my hair until I heard about using hot rollers.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what these do.</li>
            <li>So I bought the hot rollers a couple days ago.</li>
            <li>I attempted to use the rollers for the first time over the weekend.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Bouncy hair using hot rollers.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used conair hot rollers for about 15 years.  </li>
            <li>but that was most likely a shipping problem.</li>
            <li>I started the process over and heated the curlers up again, left them in a long time, took them out and they looked great, for another 45 minutes.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is just my hair type since my curling iron has the same affect.  </li>
            <li>I used to use my mom&#x27;s hot rollers from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the rollers and I ordered extra</li>
            <li>The rollers get pretty hot but they ARE called Heat Rollers</li>
            <li>Before my first use, I practice rolling my hair and securly getting the clip on.  </li>
            <li>So I began thinking what about hot rollers again and did research here on Amazon.....</li>
            <li>I really like that they are economical and they heat up fast!  </li>
            <li>I have always used hot rollers, never a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HEAT SET OF HOT CURLERS TO MY CLOSEST FRIENDS AND SISTERS.ALSO</li>
            <li>They took forever to heat up, they are almost too hot to hold while trying to wrap your hair around them and</li>
            <li>I am returning these and will never buy hot rollers again.</li>
            <li>I followed all the directions exactly, even looking up videos on You Tube for suggestions on how to achieve the look I wanted, but every time I tried them, my hair didn&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li>I just bought this yesterday at Walmart and tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Much better deal for the same item</li>
            <li>Look for hot rollers that have a claw to hold the curler in place as this product does not and doesn&#x27;t keep curler in place.  </li>
            <li>I really love these rollers, and I would totally recommend it!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and it was very helpful!  </li>
            <li>Also the edges and the clips also heat up - but way too hot for my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the remington h-1015 hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them my hair came out with no curl.  </li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for over 15 years now, so</li>
            <li>The downside is that it&#x27;s difficult to get the hair on the roller itself (and keep it on while trying to roll it up) and the pins that keep them on get hot themselves from the heat of the roller and aren&#x27;t the greatest at keeping attached.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the clips that came with it, but Conair also sells clips for hot curlers.   </li>
            <li>No waiting around for 10-15 minutes for the rollers to get hot.  </li>
            <li>The rollers were not too hot to handle.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair OVER curled, like a hot curler might do sometimes.</li>
            <li>I have used this type of clip years ago with my first set of hot rollers, and did not have this problem with the clips.  </li>
            <li>the edges are plastic and will be quite hot to the touch , just bearable.</li>
            <li>I have never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li>But like I said it was my first time.</li>
            <li>And the price was really a steal too!</li>
            <li>(And yes, I did notice that they were way too hot to hold on the plastic ends).    </li>
            <li>I bought this product tonight and just used the hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I have never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li>These are the first hot rollers I&#x27;ve bought in years.</li>
            <li>(People are amazed when I tell them my smooth hair is actually naturally curly.)  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product when my hair was curly</li>
            <li>first set of these rollers arrived, but I had to return them because they were damaged.  </li>
            <li>Despite the concerns expressed by others, I went ahead and purchased these since I needed some large/jumbo hot rollers to help de-frizz/straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>: rollers are hot to touch and the pins are a struggle.</li>
            <li>Too hot on the scalp.</li>
            <li>but without the felt became too hot to handle.</li>
            <li>Once, the heated rollers were so hot it almost burnt my scalp.</li>
            <li>First off, these aren&#x27;t the rollers to use if you want curls.  </li>
            <li>It arrived timely and is exactly as it was advertised.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well.</li>
            <li>All in all, I do really like what they do for my hair!</li>
            <li>Just remember it&#x27;s really hot on metal bars.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick and curly hair and these work so great.  </li>
            <li>They heat up fast!  </li>
            <li>I ordered two of the hot collers</li>
            <li>After having luck with a pervious set of Conair hot rollers I decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>The first time these rollers were shipped, I thought an error had been made.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a better guide&#x3D;&#x3D;albeit a simple one, would help users with this product.</li>
            <li>I add a product like Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing (or a spray-on heat protector) to my hair first and then roll my hair.</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>I am thinking of returning these hot rollers because they are so hot that they burn my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten SO MANY compliments and they only take like 10 minutes to put in</li>
            <li>There is no storage spot that I could locate for the pins, so I just threw them in a cute tray next to the rollers on my countertop.</li>
            <li>and it is too hot on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Overall, the curlers are ok.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I get the exact curls I want...</li>
            <li>Burned my fingers, burned my scalp, and too much curl!</li>
            <li>Basically, just too hot.</li>
            <li>My first time buying hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Personally I love big curls.</li>
            <li>I spritzed hair spray all over after blow drying, let curlers get hot</li>
            <li>They get so hot</li>
            <li>Hi,  I bought the hot rollers for my daughter and she loves them.  </li>
            <li>These curlers are way too hot.</li>
            <li>I like them alot though sometimes they got too hot and burned my head.</li>
            <li>When I first got these this summer</li>
            <li>After 1 use, I decided I needed smaller rollers just for the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>The curlers will get hot</li>
            <li>If you use curlers on top of your head (from the forehead back to the top-middle)</li>
            <li>These do get EXTREMELY hot - to the point that my scalp and forehead were burned by them.  </li>
            <li>and they work really well!  </li>
            <li>And, get the Chi Silk Fusion to use with the hot rollers...</li>
            <li>This product gave me exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for years</li>
            <li>I get SO many compliments when I actually take the time to put them in...</li>
            <li>The rollers get hot</li>
            <li>and they get hotter, unlike the plastic one that get just so hot &amp; no</li>
            <li>but they almost get too hot.  </li>
            <li>How do you manage this hot curler in your hand?</li>
            <li>it is way too hot.</li>
            <li>Sizes are great if you don&#x27;t really use the small ones.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Conair hot roller clips along with this product.</li>
            <li>Fast!</li>
            <li>This products does exactly what is promised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hot rollers before but not like this, the rubber ones that fold over....</li>
            <li>But what i&#x27;m most upset about is the fact that I can get the same roller set, for a cheaper price with CLIPS....</li>
            <li>The rollers get pretty hot, I&#x27;ve burned my finge, so I would definetly recommend the plastic clips you can purchase in addition.</li>
            <li>It has gotten &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; since the first one I bought.  </li>
            <li>These got me into using hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Hair looks good for the first few hours</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work very well in keeping the rollers in place !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do what I like first.  </li>
            <li>The actual curlers work quite well, just be sure that you don&#x27;t use the seller Bargains AAA.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I still love Amazon and will continue to purchase from them, but not from Bargains AAA.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first two rollers were *</li>
            <li>I have used them everyday since receiving them for Christmas and everyone has commented on my gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li>too much trouble, so ordered the clips... need to figure that into your price, but still a good deal...</li>
            <li>Be aware, what they call jumbo are really the large size velcro and their super jumbo would equate to jumbo size in velcro rollers.</li>
            <li>They heat up quick and I love being able to put them up right after I&#x27;m done (they are not hot on the outside).  </li>
            <li>More importantly, I wanted volume and loose curls for my fine Asian hair that is mid-back in length.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying the conair SPC10R super clips.  </li>
            <li>I called Conair and they sent me wire clips which fit the jumbo rollers, but not the super jumbo which leaves me with 4 rollers which are unusable and 8 rollers aren&#x27;t enough to do my hair.</li>
            <li>It is easier to get tighter  fit and better results with less hair on the roller.</li>
            <li>First, I think it is important that I say that I have long, straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The rollers are nice, the machine heats up quickly, but the steel clips have a slick finish and slide right out of my hair causing</li>
            <li>If you have long hair you know how hard it can keep your hair from flattening out at the top, but these rollers did a great job.</li>
            <li>I ordered this model because of the good reviews but this machine is not for fine or thin hair textures which I have.  </li>
            <li>the smart clips that come with them won&#x27;t hold especially on the top of my head and they leave marks and dents.</li>
            <li>I took 4 of the large rollers from my most recent set of Conair rollers and put them in place of 4 of the jumbos in this set.</li>
            <li>You can buy them seperately - which I would recommend as they also hold the curler a little bit off your head which is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They gave my thin hair, extreme volume, bounciness , shine and looks like my beautiful healthy hair has returned !</li>
            <li>I also loved that all the rollers were the same size and there were enough for my whole head!  </li>
            <li>Often on the top of my head, I feel like it&#x27;s a bit flat -</li>
            <li>They do what they&#x27;re supposed to.. if I want tighter curls, I&#x27;ll stick with my flat iron :)</li>
            <li>If the hard top was replaced with a flexible material it would travel better.   </li>
            <li>I liked these rollers but they don&#x27;t heat up as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li>They added in four super huge rollers which really don&#x27;t do much because they are so big.  2)</li>
            <li>They get VERY HOT- much more so than any other</li>
            <li>It worked for many others, so you may want to give it a chance, but I much rather a regular curler!</li>
            <li>This set is perfect for someone with long hair and no bangs, therefore not needing the small curlers.</li>
            <li>Not only can this female look good wearing a trash bag</li>
            <li>For the life of me I cannot use a curling iron and my stylist is able to do these Victoria Secret model waves in my hair and I&#x27;ve been yearning to do this on my own.</li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to use the clips.  </li>
            <li>This product was just what I wanted big curls and they stayed curly all day and even the next day after using them my hair was still bouncy and looked good.  </li>
            <li>Brought this thinking wow nice big size curlers for nothing!</li>
            <li>They are big rollers, bigger than normal, so I love it!!</li>
            <li>so I have 12 large rollers hot.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use these hot rollers, I swear I will never use them again, and promise myself I am going to buy a new set immediately!!</li>
            <li>It comes out nice and smooth with big loose waves.</li>
            <li>I would LOVE these curlers (as they heat us fast and work well), except for one rather significant issue:  there is NO place to put the holders (whatever you use to hold the curlers down).  </li>
            <li>i love that they are flocked (with the velvet fabric over the roller for less damage) and how they get hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>They get hot very quickly, which is a big plus when you&#x27;re trying to get out in the morning.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the curlers and they become hot in minutes, all positive.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re hot and ready to go in seconds.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that is very fine, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it is to set my hair with these.  </li>
            <li>Well i bought these because they were one of the top rated ones for people with long hair.</li>
            <li>I already have a Conair hot rollers (which I really like) with plastic clips the ones pictured on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I would say this is a great buy especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried hot rollers before and really did my research before purchasing these.</li>
            <li>The Conair jumbo rollers are exactly what I needed and work very well.  </li>
            <li>straight so I opt for hot rollers.    </li>
            <li>My salon brand more expensive ones were getting old &amp; I lived the color of these conair ones but worried the reviews werent great</li>
            <li>These hot rollers work very well for my over shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>I found that if you pinch them in a bit between the ends and the curve, they hold better, and so long as you push them through some of the hair that is wrapped around the roller, they will get the job</li>
            <li>I read the reviews here, and at first, the pins that everyone talks about drove me absolutely nuts.</li>
            <li>One thing that would be nice is some kind of container to hold the clips, but that&#x27;s the only negative thing I can say.</li>
            <li>I ordered a set last year and loved them so much, I ordered a second set.</li>
            <li>Also, it holds a curl for most of the day, but when I wake up the next morning, my hair will be pin straight again no matter how much hairspray I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- they heat up very fast (they get VERY hot), and because they&#x27;re large, they provide a lot of volume and wave, not little spiral curls that look unnatural.</li>
            <li>The look, size, pins - those are all just fine - but the rollers do NOT get HOT enough!</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use, I like the clips better, people complain about the clips not holding, but this is not true, just try to place the clip on a different angle</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it after about 2 tries, it will be so easy!</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to use as long as you do what the first reviewer Joanna suggested.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth paying for professional products because they really work better if you&#x27;re needing something specific.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good hot rollers that don&#x27;t create power-perm &#x27;80s \\&quot;Dallas\\&quot; style curls.</li>
            <li>The clips are easy but don&#x27;t hold super tight, which is fine since I want waves not tight curls.</li>
            <li>I was excited to have only JUMBO rollers to us for styling and more than only 6 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clips pop apart when dropped, and go back together easily.  </li>
            <li>I would secure one and when reaching for the next one, the first one would fall out.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to do -- and I&#x27;ve got two left hands</li>
            <li>Easy to use and store away for later.</li>
            <li>But even with half fell-out rollers, it still makes nice curls or waves.</li>
            <li>I certainly would NOT have ordered it.</li>
            <li>that they came in large sizes</li>
            <li>There are 8 medium size rollers and 4 large in this set so...</li>
            <li>I end up using two clips on certain areas of my head.</li>
            <li>Pros: Large roller sizes</li>
            <li>They are all large rollers, which is what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>I noticed some feedback about the metal roll clasps that come with them, they do stay in your hair, but you have to do it in a certain way.  </li>
            <li>The product has 4 jumbo, and 8 large rolls.  </li>
            <li>They are large, plasitc, hinged clips so storage is a pain as well, there is no storage for these clips on the set itself</li>
            <li>The large size also helps soften the curl.</li>
            <li>I wanted large rollers, but these are a bit large for my hair.  </li>
            <li>a set of electric rollers that were all large.</li>
            <li>I like the large size.  </li>
            <li>This is a true large roller set &amp; is perfect for longer thick heavy hair.</li>
            <li>All they did was make the very ends of my hair a little wavy, and didn&#x27;t do a thing to the top of my hair!  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that they come with the traditional wire clips vs. the new palstic clips.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, they&#x27;re only in large sizes for the sultry waves look, and holds your hair very well with the velvet coating.    </li>
            <li>I was looking for those loose Kim Kardashian/Jennifer Love Hewitt curls.</li>
            <li>I am new to rollers and I haven;t quite mastered getting the pins right each time.</li>
            <li>Second, while it has a light to let you know the unit is turned on, it doesn&#x27;t have any indicator light to let you know when the rollers are hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>I use a shampoo/conditioner that is not super moisturizing as this helps the curl hold better, and I end up with big, wavy curls that with hairspray stay in most</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair, but a ton of it -</li>
            <li>I had some relatively low expectations when I got this, as I have fine hair</li>
            <li>There is no on and off button, so it is not as safe as other hot roller sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses these (she has fine hair) to get the same effect but save time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a steam set with more super larger rollers and smaller case.  </li>
            <li>I really like that they are large and jumbo.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a large curling iron but these are much easier and save me a lot of time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine but not thin, so I guess I&#x27;m putting enough hair on each curler</li>
            <li>I have superfine hair and need as much volume as possible.</li>
            <li>I was inspired by this amazing video on youtube where a girl uses these rollers, and her hair comes out shiny and well curled; I tried these curlers twice, and even left them in for 30 minutes, and I got some waves, but they only lasted an hour or so, even with use of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They heat up incredibly fast and have those metal clips instead of the plastic clamps that leave crimps in your hair.</li>
            <li>they are just too short to secure the roller because of the weight of the roller.  </li>
            <li>I think products should be ready to use out of the box</li>
            <li>These rollers work really well for me.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls fast too.</li>
            <li>She said that they heat up fast.</li>
            <li>My hair returned to its completely straight form within an hour.  </li>
            <li>I will go back to my cheap clairol \\&quot;Set</li>
            <li>- also being that my hair is straight as a board.</li>
            <li>Remove from the bottom hairline up gently turning the rollers with the curl as you unwind it.</li>
            <li>I have so much hair that I need two boxes of hair dye just to cover it all...  </li>
            <li>You really have to work fast.</li>
            <li>Really?     </li>
            <li>i.e. I secure a pin over a roller, move on to the next roll, and - swoosh!</li>
            <li>I reccomend these rollers highly!  </li>
            <li>The curlers heat up fast.</li>
            <li>However, when removing curler from hair the curler can get caught in hair and it is a real pain to get off.</li>
            <li>so no one really noticed except for me of course.</li>
            <li>I was ready to cut all my hair off, that&#x27;s how damaged my hair was....</li>
            <li>Sometimes I could get as many as three in if I was careful with my movements.</li>
            <li>but the wire clips that come with them alone have caused me so much frustration I can&#x27;t even put in words.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to leave them in for anytime at all.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li>i bought 2 sets to cover my whole head.</li>
            <li>The larger size of rollers leaves my past-shoulder-length hair wavy and smooth.      </li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviewer who linked to a how-to on Youtube.com</li>
            <li>Very well made product.</li>
            <li>They heat fast too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>I spray it on both sides of my hair as I hold it up getting ready to put it in the roller.  </li>
            <li>it looks MUCH thicker.    </li>
            <li>And, they really work.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really have bangs.  </li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>Also, got the jaw clips to use because they are just so much easier.</li>
            <li>&#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; saying, but the reviews I read really helped in making my decision.</li>
            <li>I really did not know how to use the hooks that are to go over the rollers, and the instructions in the box are very unhelpful as they do not describe how to use them either.  </li>
            <li>They heat up fast.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m done blow drying my curlers are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>All I can report is that they do what is claimed at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>TO USE AND HEATS FAST.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly!</li>
            <li>These rollers did not curl my hair much at all.</li>
            <li>they do the job very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to just curl your hair with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s much cheaper online</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I found Target and Walmart sells them at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much volume and curls really well.</li>
            <li>Rollers put a lot of curl in my straight, almost waist length</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t stay in well, so I&#x27;d recommend the plastic clips as others mentioned.</li>
            <li>The velvety covering really helps protect the hair.</li>
            <li>I love the shine it leaves in my hair and absolutely no frizz.</li>
            <li>When I unroll them my hair is totally straight except for the very end.  </li>
            <li>The clips are much easier to keep in place.</li>
            <li>and I really like this set.  </li>
            <li>do recommend the ConairPro Pro Clips, but highly discourage anyone to purchase these rollers! &lt;</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but it keeps my waves in without too much hair product.  </li>
            <li>The clips do not stay in my hair very well</li>
            <li>what I was doing, so I watched this video per another users suggestion and it really, really helped:    </li>
            <li>#2: they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>In that case, they do work very well and my hair will hold the \\&quot;body\\&quot; for almost a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might</li>
            <li>highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>They were ready to go in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore these.</li>
            <li>These rollers heat up so fast</li>
            <li>I do take one set of these rollers on trips with me, and they do not take up that much space as they are very compact.  </li>
            <li>only thing I would change is that I wish the curler would light up when it is heated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the instructions went with my product because there was only one light bulb in there and the cover over it was orange anyway</li>
            <li>Does heat up fast, though.</li>
            <li>I get big, smooth bouncy curls instead of</li>
            <li>It really depends on what you like though.</li>
            <li>THANKS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to need to buy the claw ones because the ones that come just do not hold the rollers in very well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they&#x27;re tricky to get in properly and the rollers don&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, cut in a shoulder-length layered cut, and colored.  </li>
            <li>I have asian hair and it looks great in big big curls.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make your hair look really curly.</li>
            <li>Very maddening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely stunned that this product ever made it to the marketplace as it exists.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast, really fast, and don&#x27;t snag my hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>My hair is just below my shoulders and when I use these curlers my hair is very wavy.  </li>
            <li>but I can never game them to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>Put these in, do makeup, put my outfit on and then its ready.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very helpful - heat them</li>
            <li>but it might be because my hair is really silky straight.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is gentle for my hair.</li>
            <li>They also work really well with the layers cut in my hair and really makes them stand out.</li>
            <li>They tend to leave a crease in my hair and do not hold the rollers in place while I am getting ready and eating breakfast.</li>
            <li>After you own for a few weeks all the smaller dollies melt and break and won&#x27;t fit in the slots.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is garbage</li>
            <li>they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was very helpful and offered to have me return the item to them for a refund, or I could keep it</li>
            <li>up fast..</li>
            <li>Fast thinking on the unplug reaction as well - I read how issues like this from Conair products develop into full-blown house</li>
            <li>Fast thinking on the unplug reaction as well - I read how issues like this from Conair products develop into full-blown house</li>
            <li>Very bummed.</li>
            <li>I really like using these rollers.</li>
            <li>I got them because my hair is really damaged from heat and rollers</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with the pins.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this kind of body forever, and finally got the guts to try these big rollers.  </li>
            <li>Just work out your natural part with your fingers only touching your scalp.</li>
            <li>so when I needed to replace my old set I purchased more of the same.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally use my flat iron and/or Instyler instead (when I have more time to fuss over my hair!)</li>
            <li>It didnt feel much hotter than normal hot rollers, but when I took them out of my hair I found that the plastic had melted, and the rollers were deformed.  </li>
            <li>After trying it a few times, I just gave up on it, and quite honestly, I dont even know where I stored it.</li>
            <li>The curlers burn your hands and head as you try and put them in place which would make you think you would end up with at least a good curl.  </li>
            <li>I also let the hot-curlers warm up for 20 minutes and tried it three times, and on the third try I left them in my hair for over an hour.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled with the rollers as she has smaller sized ones but wanted this size to make a different sized curl.</li>
            <li>It was easy to wrap my long hair onto it and used the large clips (sold separetly) to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the roller world, but although this product is exactly as described, it is way too much of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>I have long layered hair and this set is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>As a newbie to hot rollers, I didn&#x27;t find it too hard to put the rollers in, but I was sure stymied by that clip!</li>
            <li>Having naturally straight and flat hair, I would love a change with soft waves.</li>
            <li>I scoured the site for recommendations and these were pretty high plus a friend had an older version of the product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin, and this is an easy way to add volume.</li>
            <li>I agree that the set heats up very fast, but I find that the rollers placed in last (that are a bit uncomfortable to handle because of the heat) set the best curls, so</li>
            <li>I have been using Remington&#x27;s heated rollers and I love them, but I have been wanting to have bigger rollers to create Victoria Secret models&#x27; big, beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>have long, straight, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered other clips and hope they will work better.  </li>
            <li>Also, it would be better if the heater had an auto-off (as some other models do).</li>
            <li>Finally, I was pretty surprised to discover that there is no place available on the unit designed to store the clips when the machine isn&#x27;t in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that I get sooooo sooooo many compliments about my hair.</li>
            <li>But I love them and have not found any other rollers that compare to this set.</li>
            <li>So glad I spent the money on these!</li>
            <li>Where it normally takes me 5 minutes to put them in my hair, it took triple the amount of time, more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.   </li>
            <li>I think there are other sets that may be much more</li>
            <li>My hair is really long and the big curlers allow me to curl my hair without having to double up the curlers which is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure I would buy again due to those factors.</li>
            <li>but because I have that much hair;) I love them and would recommend them to anyone I use both sets almost everyday.</li>
            <li>so I bought other ones that hold the rollers in place better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this set had the clips instead of jaw clamps, as other reviewers have said that the jaw clamps leave indents in the hair.</li>
            <li>They heat up in just a few minutes and are plenty hot enough to get the right kind of curl that you want.  </li>
            <li>She has very thick long hair &amp; says this is the best curl that she ever had.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re like me and have long, fine hair you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li>I have long, below shoulder length hair, that is fine.  </li>
            <li>I have long baby fine hair that is layered</li>
            <li>For reference I have long hair that is on the fine side.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine so this is saying a lot.</li>
            <li>My hair is a few inches past my shoulders and the size of the rollers were perfect for it</li>
            <li>They did produce nice big curls that lasted reasonably long, but with these clips they&#x27;re not usable.  </li>
            <li>I love having full, thick looking hair.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly and are large enough to not cause frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>If this is your first time using hot rollers, I highly recommend watching this video as it shows you how to use them with the exact same set:</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for these.</li>
            <li>Also, I highly recommend purchsing separate clips because the ones that come with it don&#x27;t hold your hair very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Then I reach for a pin and get it on there all right, begin work on the next clump of hair when the first roller starts to creep</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair, so purchasing these rollers was worth it because I don&#x27;t have to spend 2 hours just making sure every strand in my hair is curled with a curling iron!</li>
            <li>These worked really well and heated up quickly, although there weren&#x27;t enough rollers to get all of my hair, so I had to buy two.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use the smart clips and the new rollers for a week but then gave up.  </li>
            <li>I honestly think that the people who gave this product bad reviews are just impatient and are expecting a perfect product, when one just does not exist in this category.</li>
            <li>I have long, superfine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after a few more tries I&#x27;ll master it,</li>
            <li>Point the clip prong end first directly at your scalp around the roller and then pivot the clip around the roller.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for full, extra body, soft looking hair, you need to buy these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>The KEY is HOW you position and roll your hair to get that full,  </li>
            <li>The rollers got far too hot for my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, but the hot rollers take about 20 minutes to get hot enough for the hair</li>
            <li>My hair has a pretty, soft curl</li>
            <li>have it still look \\&quot;done\\&quot; the next day after wearing it for a full day and sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave away all the old hot roller wire clips years ago...</li>
            <li>But I no longer liked that old style look, curls too tight, concerned about damage</li>
            <li>They work fine, and ultimately I like them so far, but</li>
            <li>work much better at keeping the roller and hair from hanging down.</li>
            <li>These curlers are perfect-- hot to the  touch in a minute or less, big enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li>My new rollers have disappeared into the cabinet underneath my wash basin!</li>
            <li>These products are a life saver (or will be, once this new baby is born!).    </li>
            <li>The pins were not long enough to keep the rollers in my hair, the rollers didn&#x27;t fit well on the hot metal bar.  </li>
            <li>First I would hardly call these rollers jumbo size, they are more like large size rollers</li>
            <li>, I still ended up with just slightly wavy hair and NO body nor curl at the top..</li>
            <li>I tried using more hair, less hair, etc</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is EVER SO SLIGHTLY DAMP before you use the curlers.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of the rollers, they are felt covered, helps hair stay and less damage to hair.</li>
            <li>These rollers do not provide a decent curl.  </li>
            <li>the Super Clips come in a set of TEN, although the roller set has TWELVE rollers).</li>
            <li>They are a disaster; I am using my older clips for a tighter hold.</li>
            <li>: The super jumber rollers (1.75\\&quot;) were too big for me</li>
            <li>I sent it back and am searching for something similar with more pros.</li>
            <li>I only wish it had more larger rollers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found letting the unit heat too long or leaving the rollers in too long produces not as nice results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never even heard of these Big &amp; Sexy products until the last couple weeks, and for those will bodiless hair - these are THE products to try!  </li>
            <li>so you just have to be careful and they leave a nice big curl.</li>
            <li>These have been great for my thick, mid lenth hair.  </li>
            <li>These heat up quickly and the curl lasts the entire day.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are much larger and they heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CHV14J Instant Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo-Sized</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and the directions say to keep them in only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I tried to use smaller Jumbo pin on Super Jumbo roller</li>
            <li>also run out of super clips and had to use metal ones fot last two rollers</li>
            <li>These are like the largest size in the classic three-size roller set my mom used.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a few more to cover my whole head, but this is close.</li>
            <li>I have the older Conair  rollers, which did take longer.  </li>
            <li>I gave these a 4 star rating simply because I would rather have all Super Jumbo rollers, and am buying a product where I am wasting money on rollers I am not using.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and the sizes are the only ones you use anyway!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t particularly recommend these curlers.</li>
            <li>(I bought the separate Conair roller clamps - 10 pk - not enough for 1 of these sets) and more rollers (purchase a second set).</li>
            <li>There are lots of youtube tutorials on how to use this particular product.</li>
            <li>I was going to purchase at Target, but this particular item was lower in price, so I purchase online instead.</li>
            <li>The older models ALL had a built in clip holder - and this model even has TWO sized clips.</li>
            <li>It does heat up faster than the older models, but again - doing away with the built-in clip holder is going to be a disaster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting plenty of time, they&#x27;re hot to the touch, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough to roll my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this set, just wish I had gotten smaller ones.</li>
            <li>The rollers didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything but make my head warm and the little pokies ripped my hair out (youch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>The curlers are all big, with 8 large and 4 very large.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say you should wait until the light on the front of the case is white, indicating they are hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>The second thing is they get very hot at the ends</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast and holds the heat a long time.</li>
            <li>It did fall pretty easy after a few hours</li>
            <li>They take up so much room, that the only way to fit the next roller is to put the clip straight up away from your head.  </li>
            <li>if you know that your hair requires high heat, don&#x27;t be hasty.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting the suggested pro clips - as I resorted to mine to set my hair.     </li>
            <li>This seller sold them at a high price.</li>
            <li>they are flocked with velvet to avoid a high % of damage.however</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>The curlers do not reach a high heat, and therefore do not curl your hair.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super fine, nor is it super thick, it is just right in the middle, but apparently my hair is too \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; for the wire clips to hold the rollers in it.</li>
            <li>my old rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the manufactor created this clips to avoid other issues, but it just does not hold the curler to my head and my hair ends up frizzy within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; I think Conair would be smart to direct a customer to a video</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to complain when my hair has wound its way around these curlers a b&#x27;jillion times and come out gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t easily fall out like some other curlers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do get hot fairly quickly, but you need to get other clips to hold them on.</li>
            <li>I really like the results I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li>I am sorry I bought these and wish for a great replacement.  </li>
            <li>They heat up fast and in 5 minutes you take them out and just run your fingers through or use a soft brush to style  your hair.</li>
            <li>(i do not blow out straight, just blow it to natural curls, then set).</li>
            <li>I am using the clips from the old set which work very well on these.</li>
            <li>They fly off, don&#x27;t hold the hair, totally useless.   </li>
            <li>overall, they are worth every penny and it makes difficult hair look great.  </li>
            <li>These do not heat up as fast as the old ones.  </li>
            <li>The big rollers smooth out my coarse, frizz-prone hair really well.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, but for someone who normally has no problem with getting curls to stay, these were sorry.</li>
            <li>Curlers are covered with a soft velvet material which is gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a ton of bounce, volume and a soft wave that frames my face and really makes my layers stand out.  </li>
            <li>Plus I am constantly complimented on my hair and find that these fit in really well with a low maintenance routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long hair and would love some rollers that would allow me to add volume and curl under the ends without creating massive curls.  </li>
            <li>other wise the curler would drop due to gravity.  </li>
            <li>It takes some practice to use the pins, especially for someone like myself, who doesn&#x27;t have much experience with using hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>If you leave them on for a long time before using them, it does get pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve used a few more rollers to set all of my hair... had to finish the look with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I try to avoid heavy hair sprays, but maybe I need to use more to get the curls to hold longer.    </li>
            <li>In fact, it pretty much straightened it; which was the opposite of the look I was trying for.</li>
            <li>I have tried these rollers a few times and I really love them.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different sets of hot rollers recently, and I love these ones.   </li>
            <li>And lastly, they don&#x27;t really get that hot.</li>
            <li>They are heavy and it takes many adjustments to try and keep them in place.</li>
            <li>Definitely get hot fast.</li>
            <li>I normally can even get away</li>
            <li>I used to not be able to get all of my hair in the rollers in one round.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really thick, super fine, and wavy.  </li>
            <li>, I just didn&#x27;t notice as I put them in and apparently there was a surge of heat through this unit as I was wrapping those first two rollers into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I just didn&#x27;t notice as I put them in and apparently there was a surge of heat through this unit as I was wrapping those first two rollers into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the current pins provided do not hold roller in place very well, and sometimes you end up having to use two pins ( which lengthens the whole process! )</li>
            <li>But other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li>I couldnt do ANYTHING with my hair for volume due to it being baby fine</li>
            <li>Other than that the product woks fine.</li>
            <li>Well the rollers weren&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;Jumbo and Super Jumbo&amp;#34; but I did curl my entire head and still have one roller left.</li>
            <li>I truly can&#x27;t live without them, especially if I&#x27;m flying across the country for business, fun, etc.  </li>
            <li>Great for bad hair days or when you need a quick fix.</li>
            <li>Your hair MUST be blown dry and even better if it was not recently washed.</li>
            <li>Luckily my hair was not fried completely, but it did take about a week of conditioning treatments daily to repair the damage.    </li>
            <li>&quot; position is to the left, kind of odd for a product sold in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>The pins work just fine, but they do not get hot enough to make a lasting curl that is worth the effort or the money spent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to be aware that these cause BIG, LOOSE curls (that stay, if your hair is like mine, and you do what I suggested).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand these rollers, and they&#x27;re going back right away.</li>
            <li>I have a shoulder length bob hairstyle and These larger rollers give it just the right amount of body for this style.</li>
            <li>These could be considered large and extra large .... \\&quot;Jumbo\\</li>
            <li>I am keeping the product because I like the large and extra large rollers.</li>
            <li>They very quickly sent me a new one, but it was THE SAME LESSER MODEL.    </li>
            <li>Dear Conair: What took you so long to make super jumbo rollers?  </li>
            <li>and i got the hang of these after a couple tries, though my hair still managed to look pretty decent after the first try.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers are unusable - it is not possible to set a heat setting so they get too hot to handle very quickly; the clip to hold the roller in the hair is too flimsy to work, even if two are used, so the only way to really use the rollers is to simply hold it in place manually for several minutes and hope it takes.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times i mess with these curlers it just doesnt hold!</li>
            <li>The 12 BIG rollers add a nice bouncy wave (as opposed to tight curls) to my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I had the other Conaire hot rollers in the multiple sizes but wanted the large and jumbo size for more volume and larger curls.</li>
            <li>I sure wish that Conair had included hinge clips with this set; the pins are practically useless for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased these largely because of a video review of this set on YouTube; a major selling point for me was the clips shown (with a hinge).  </li>
            <li>Firstly, the the metal U-pins my set came with did absolutely nothing to hold the roller in my hair and were a wonky fit on the barrel itself.</li>
            <li>While this causes endless entertainment for my cat, it&#x27;s not so fabulous for my coiff.</li>
            <li>With almost-shoulder length curly but frizzy hair (not pretty), I needed something to smooth and defriz for 48hours.  </li>
            <li>I love these rollers because I have long hair and the rollers are big which make soft curls.</li>
            <li>The curls are not tight they fall more like waterfall curls (unless you want tight curls)</li>
            <li>The size of the curlers are awesome if they did get hot enough, I&#x27;ve even tried using less hair in each section even though I have thin hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a new set of clips soon.  </li>
            <li>I have not had a problem at all with this new set.</li>
            <li>The problem are the new clips that come with the set.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a new one.</li>
            <li>but seems to live up to expectations.</li>
            <li>it may be the new technology.</li>
            <li>But I noticed that NONE of the new curler sets had the pins but new type of clips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m either going to buy a new set of rollers or look for a clip that clips easier.</li>
            <li>so I bought this new set.  </li>
            <li>so I guess Goodwill get a new set.  </li>
            <li>May be time to order a new set.</li>
            <li>BUT, this new set heats up in seconds.  </li>
            <li>Cant live without them</li>
            <li>The curl lasts twice as long if the rollers are allowed to cool completely before removing.     </li>
            <li>The rollers have a big slot running through the middle of them so that they fit over the heating element</li>
            <li>Also, I heard the pink, regular sized rollers have a better outcome.</li>
            <li>The plastic clips hold it in one place and fit both the bigger and the smaller rollers!</li>
            <li>I waited and waited for the red light to go off, then reread it and realized one of the rollers has a tiny dot that turns off.</li>
            <li>I just dry my hair quickly and pop these rollers in.  </li>
            <li>After trial and error, I discovered that if I let the curlers heat up for about 10 minutes (rather than the two that are advertized), I end up with fantastic curls that will last until the next time I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>But the rollers will work very well and heat up extremely fast so overall</li>
            <li>I am an absolute glamour girl, to the core, and have had hot rollers in my life for as long as I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do not stay hot for long, once on the hair, and the clips are absolutely junk.</li>
            <li>These heat up pretty quickly and are a good size but the clips are tragic.  </li>
            <li>- this gives me a very natural, up-to-the-minute look.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get all my hair in the 12 rollers with my first try and with my second try</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t mind overlooking the fact that some team in Conair R&amp;D clip department must have been sleeping on the job and you are willing to find another solution for the clips and you are looking for big curls, these may be for you.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy them at first, but went back and purchased them after one use.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those of us with long hair who are frustrated with the small size rollers that come in most hot roller sets.  </li>
            <li>Other than that they work as well as any others and they are larger than most.  </li>
            <li>The product that came is the same set, but I got regular U-clips which I have never had success with!  </li>
            <li>&quot; look, as i&#x27;ve never really been able to get the look i want from using a blow dryer or flat iron to straigthen my hair.</li>
            <li>I like these because I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out and dont want alot of curl like the smaller hot rollers gives my hair.</li>
            <li>If you want a basic hot roller that does the job, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>back first and work my way up.  </li>
            <li>and they just are never hot enough to do more than put a fuzzy dimple in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had the travel set (five rollers), but they don&#x27;t get as hot and there aren&#x27;t enough rollers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted \\&quot;hot rollers\\&quot; for several years.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when they get too hot it sometimes hurts your skin, but usually it&#x27;s not a problem</li>
            <li>First the hinge broke on my current one, and then the plastic itself.</li>
            <li>This makes it difficult to roll up successfully.</li>
            <li>With these, the curls are soft, and lasted all day!</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>So I finally ordered this set of hot rollers after wanting them for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who is looking for larger hot rollers.</li>
            <li>As a tip to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know how to use the two different sized rollers... larger rollers go on the top part of your head, and use smaller rollers on the sides.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for BIG hot rollers, this is the set for you.</li>
            <li>so it anchors the hair supporting it from the bottom of the individual roll.    </li>
            <li>Also, these curlers do get pretty hot, so be careful when handling them!</li>
            <li>But in the end when I took them out i had much more volume than usual and some wave.</li>
            <li>I had my first set for about 10 years, as they simply don&#x27;t wear out.  </li>
            <li>Another plus was that the set heated up instantly and the rollers weren&#x27;t unwieldy or too blazing hot to handle.</li>
            <li>I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for any curls to stay.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product and I would recommend it to anyone wanting lasting curls.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and have tried several different rollers and these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the Xtreme Instant Heat(tm)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had different hot rollers before</li>
            <li>The curl never lasts more than an hour or 2, even with excessive hair spray.</li>
            <li>I recently had to retire a set of Conair hot rollers...</li>
            <li>But the barrels don&#x27;t get hot enough to maintain the curls.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>These do not get hot enough to set a curl.  </li>
            <li>these are blacklisted as far as i am concerned.!</li>
            <li>These curlers do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The rollers are way too hot next to your scalp and if a roller touches your ear</li>
            <li>but the rods that hold them in place get extremely hot, to the point I actually have to lift the roller off my scalp for relief.  </li>
            <li>Soft, strokeable voluminous hair!</li>
            <li>I kept the curlers in for about 25 minutes, and when I took them out, my hair was exactly the same.</li>
            <li>had tried about 6 different hot roller sets</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this model!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough, either.  </li>
            <li>It took me about an hour to do the first two, but after I educated myself, it took about 10 minutes to redo my entire head.</li>
            <li>Get just hot enough, but not super hot, they cool down too quick.</li>
            <li>This is important because at first I only did one side, and I also tried using less of the spray.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use a curling iron &amp; good hot rollers are not easy to find in stores except for the small size.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair, so if my hair can&#x27;t hold the \\&quot;super jumbo\\&quot; roller...not many others could.  </li>
            <li>The clips were fine, held tight, however there&#x27;s NO place to &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; them.</li>
            <li>i have long hair (right up to the tops of my breasts)</li>
            <li>You have to purchase clips separately or use some from previous sets hoping they fit the jumbo roller.  </li>
            <li>Leaving the top closed while heating for long periods of time</li>
            <li>This takes less than 10 minutes of effort on my part and gives me a fabulous every day look.</li>
            <li>These absolutely would not stay in my hair which is pretty thin and fine.</li>
            <li>I immediately pictured that family photo where my mother fixed my hair in hot rollers only to have my bob look like a mushroom.</li>
            <li>jumbo and super jumbo clips are much harder to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works as expected and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Pros:  12 very large rollers, heats up quickly, stays hot, rollers easy to handle, works well to de-frizz thick &amp; wavy hair, left hair smooth  Cons: because rollers are so large, difficult to keep on head, had to use clips (purchased separately) wire clips don&#x27;t hold roller, even using big plastic clips had to roll a section 3 or 4 times to get roller positioned right for clip to hold  Overall:  </li>
            <li>I returned to my very old Conair Travel set of 5 Jumbo rollers with my old fashioned metal clips.  </li>
            <li>I love finally finding hot rollers that are large enough for my longer hair as large roller sets are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I personally like their rollers that have the actual hinged clips (easier to secure, slide less), but I like having more than 5 rollers (my hair is long).</li>
            <li>I used to curl my hair with a flat iron and self grip rollers, basically warming up sections of hair, then rolling them, so I decided to get a set of hot rollers to make the process easier.</li>
            <li>Really  excided to get these jumbo rollers  only to find out they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li>Do be careful not to touch any of the metal parts as they do get very hot.</li>
            <li>I like to set my hair and walk away to do other things while they cool in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was actually fed up with the previous model, which did a lovely job until I broke the lid.</li>
            <li>The clips simply do not hold the roller in place - let alone the larger super jumbo roller.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Arrgh, anyway, I don&#x27;t know how to get big bouncy (and quickly styled hair) without having giant can rollers and a blow dryer</li>
            <li>.Arrgh, anyway, I don&#x27;t know how to get big bouncy (and quickly styled hair) without having giant can rollers and a blow dryer</li>
            <li>clamps\\&quot; that hold the roller and hair in tight secure place.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the set of hot rollers hoping to find an easier/quicker way than a curling iron to smooth out my naturally curly hair and add back some curl after blow drying it with a round brush.     </li>
            <li>My previous set of Conair hot rollers was pretty similar to this one except all of the curlers were the large size</li>
            <li>The disappointment comes in that the rollers just don&#x27;t get hot enough to make good lasting curls (they are limp at best) - and with my hair being so fine and usually curling too much - I can&#x27;t imagine that they would work very well on someone&#x27;s hair that is thick or coarse.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and have always had trouble creating volume.</li>
            <li>like everyone else said, the slot on the roller leaves crimps and the dumb metal clips they give you do not keep the rollers taut enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with the pins that come with these rollers, it is worth the cost, in my opinion, to order the Conair super clips/ pro clips (multiple purpose clips)</li>
            <li>but please keep in mind that the hair pins come in two different sizes (one for the jumbo and one for the large rollers).</li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve purchased only had three or four large rollers.  </li>
            <li>only needed the large and extra large roller size so this was</li>
            <li>the little indicator dot on the one roller is accurate).</li>
            <li>After reading previous raves on this product, I was so excited to buy it.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have pins and hinged clips from other roller sets (also Conair)</li>
            <li>I mean thirteen years ago we didn&#x27;t have Ipods, super colliders and bedazzlers, surely something as simple as big bouncy curls</li>
            <li>B00005A441 Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]]    </li>
            <li>Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]]</li>
            <li>It heats up in about 5 minutes (when the red spot on the large roller turns white then its ready), I set my hair (7 minutes), do my makeup, eat breakfast, then take them out</li>
            <li>I specifically purchased this set, based not only on near-stellar reviews but because of the high temp max (compared to other sets) which is necessary for my fine hair to achieve a decent curl.</li>
            <li>You should now have a wide row of hair on top - sort of like a wide mohawk...</li>
            <li>Overall a great product, Conair has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li>I normally curl my hair with a Hot Tools 1 1/4 inch barrel curling iron and have NO problem getting curls to stay all day , with a spritz of hair spray, not much at all.</li>
            <li>The clips that come with the rollers work really well in keeping the rollers in your hair - however, for my hair they left indentions.  </li>
            <li>They are equivalent to the old curlers from the &#x27;70s..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m too busy</li>
            <li>What the roller giveth, the clip completely taketh away.</li>
            <li>I travel frequently and must find a separate container to hold the pins.      </li>
            <li>The clips that come with these are a complete joke.  </li>
            <li>This design as been around for at least 30 years and requires more functionality.</li>
            <li>You must also wait until the rollers have completely cooled before taking them out.  </li>
            <li>You really have to play with it, especially on how to pin them to stay on your head.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have to use the old clips from my old curler set, but I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>I really like these because they are \\&quot;big only\\&quot; rollers &amp; I can use all of them.  </li>
            <li>If not, I will be scouring the internet looking for those old curlers with the metal pin.</li>
            <li>These rollers gave me bouncy soft curls that lasted for days.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>So, about the time I&#x27;m ready to use them, I&#x27;ll open the lid for a minute or two before using them, and it helps not burn my fingers.    </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried different hairsprays, and for whatever reason, they really don&#x27;t work as well.)    </li>
            <li>They just give a whole lot of body and big curls.  </li>
            <li>Not a waste of money, but not a hair miracle either....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t rate it a whole 5 stars simply because of the \\&quot;clips\\</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Now I am getting ready to order my 3rd set</li>
            <li>My stylist told me to buy a hot roller set for my long layered hair.  </li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve found works really well is to roll up your hair and put the pin in horizontally, then turn it up parallel with your scalp.</li>
            <li>I remember and used the old style Clairol electric, steam rollers and making what I called &amp;#34;pageant hair&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>And even without using styling products my hair is soft and wavy, not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and bouncy after each use.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I didn&#x27;t think the clip was holding very well, but I left the rollers in for twenty minutes and none of them fell out any sooner.</li>
            <li>I sometimes get a crimp in my hair from the clips, but that seems to happen only when the clip is very close to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>They give soft curls without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>First: My hair is about 2 inches below my bra strap-I have fairly long hair.    </li>
            <li>i never went near rollers before</li>
            <li>you can go for the va-va-voom or natural look with these.  </li>
            <li>(i have an old remington est</li>
            <li>So naturally I went looking around on the internet trying to figure out how to use these rollers and found this video on youtube.     </li>
            <li>, there wouldn&#x27;t be enough rollers to cover a whole head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I did the straight thing for a while, and have recently started venturing into the world of curls.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, and these rollers keep the frizz from taking over.  </li>
            <li>Considering either buying different types of clips or just returning the whole thing.</li>
            <li>but so far I have not found anything that keeps a curl in her hair.</li>
            <li>-- I had hair like The Venus De Milo or a young Bridget Bardot frolicking on the beach in St Tropez.</li>
            <li>they are soft</li>
            <li>The one listed above I received does not have an on/off switch on the unit, which is a real inconvenience to have to plug and unplug each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>My hair does not curl nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>Soft waves.  </li>
            <li>I have used Conair hot rollers for a long time.</li>
            <li>The rollers heated promptly and I like the look of the soft curls that are the result of using these rollers</li>
            <li>I had another Conair set that I bought around 1990 that was still working, but old and breaking apart, so I decided to replace it.  </li>
            <li>they were about 10 years old and the flocking was coming off.</li>
            <li>so my curls would look natural and have lots of body.</li>
            <li>and I really needed something to give me big curls.</li>
            <li>The shipping, however, was very speedy, so they get an extra star for that.</li>
            <li>The pins do not hold the rollers in place and they frequently pop off and shoot across the room.  </li>
            <li>The ones they come with are the old wire ones that do not hold some hair types.</li>
            <li>I use them nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>Soft roller coating doesn&#x27;t burn your hair.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Then when you finally get them to stay, after much frustration, they poke at your scalp to the point where it is unbareable for them to remain in any longer.</li>
            <li>Actually I haven&#x27;t used this that much since I bought.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I am very, very satisfied and these TOTALLY beat using a traditional curling iron on long hair to get the same results.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair, so I did not have enough rollers to do my whole head at one time, but I love the product</li>
            <li>The clips do not seem to be heavy enough or able to be positioned so that the curlers to not fall forward.</li>
            <li>if I had more rollers or if my hair was not as thick.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed but thick African-American hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if the \\&quot;velvety\\&quot; surface would interfere.</li>
            <li>Ive got shoulder length, thick hair and am confident were it longer</li>
            <li>rollers are good but clips pop out and are somewhat difficult to position correctly so roller is snug.</li>
            <li>The heating and roller placement is a little different than my first set, but they do heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say to leave the rollers in your hair until the rollers cool down.</li>
            <li>It does take a little more than 2 minutes to heat but is much faster than my other curling set.</li>
            <li>The smart clips that came with these rollers are not in the least bit user friendly.  </li>
            <li>but ultimately I exchanged it for the jumbo (and SUPER jumbo) curlers because I have long hair.</li>
            <li>Though they do heat up quickly, I can&#x27;t get them to stay in my hair long enough to work well.</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly and the curls last a long time.  </li>
            <li>This was a good purchase, item is as described, heat up very quickly and are less expensive than the same product in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hot rollers have come a long way since my last set was new!</li>
            <li>blow dry your hair (upside down for more volume)...</li>
            <li>I hoped to solve that problem by purchasing separately a pack of plastic clamps/clips and it did work better, but I kept having to adjust them due to slipping.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, I have been using them everyday since I got them!</li>
            <li>- I towel dry my hair, and then add 3-4 squirts of \\&quot;Big and Sexy Blow Dry and Volume Gel\\</li>
            <li>At first I was confused because in the instructions it says the light will turn red when plugged in and will turn a white/iridescent color when ready.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some other rollers that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I finally got a super jumbo shower cap and put in on over the whole mess.</li>
            <li>I have similar clips from previous sets of rollers which I just use instead, but still these clips seem to separate quite easily.</li>
            <li>I wanted a set of hot rollers to give my thin hair volume, and these work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I quickly disconnected them from the wall socket and they continued to melt down.</li>
            <li>It took me 3-4 tries before finally getting it right, now curling my hair is a cinch!</li>
            <li>These heat up quickly and give big loose curls, but forget using the clips they come with.</li>
            <li>I only wish they were easy to travel with, but the hard plastic box takes too much space in luggage.</li>
            <li>Having had short hair for a long time, I&#x27;m new to the hot roller world.</li>
            <li>But I waited about a half hour without the light changing, and eventually used them without the light changing, because I was already late to the party I was going to.</li>
            <li>I purchased these rollers to replace an older different brand name set.</li>
            <li>Love the compactness of the set but the rollers are too small especially now that my hair is longer.  </li>
            <li>Finally, there are larger hot rollers.</li>
            <li>The flocked surface is nice, but the design overall is not good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many different rollers in the past but this has never happened to me</li>
            <li>This product works really well, and it is really easy to get the hang of after a few tries.</li>
            <li>i heat them up for 5 minutes, spritz a little styling lotion (i use bumble and bumble), make sure your hair is dry, then roll.  </li>
            <li>but I have frizzy, super thick, super long hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get the kids ready with the curlers in my hair, even though they are a little heavy because they are ceramic.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could buy enough rollers to roll all of my hair all in one size and with clips that actually secure the rollers for less than $80.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have 30 instead of 10, so after using my first 10 for ten years and my new 10 for two years, I finally ordered that 3rd set.  </li>
            <li>I needed more of the purple and not the black, so I ordered 2 sets and replaced the black with the new purple ones</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a bit over a foot long all over, but curing iorns were giving me too much damage and lots of split ends.</li>
            <li>I have long ramrod straight hair that has NEVER curled.</li>
            <li>However, as long as you don&#x27;t break-dance, the curlers stay put reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine-to-medium straight hair, and have tried curling it with these rollers 3-4 times now.</li>
            <li>Not thick and coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li>First of all, it took FOREVER to be delivered-4 days after the posted expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li>Big bouncy curls in my normally wavy-ish frizzball.</li>
            <li>Be careful when you pull the rollers out of their slots since the edge of the rollers are a bit hot.</li>
            <li>I spray them a few different times with the Big &amp; Sexy hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I am guessing people with normal hair would only need one.</li>
            <li>Multisized Hot Rollers (the set with the pink rollers)</li>
            <li>The only thing I would caution is to watch how you set them on your head--I tend to secure them too tightly</li>
            <li>I have a toddler boy and little tolerance for spending too much time to get ready.  </li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly hair, you know that after having your hair up all day it tends to be a little straighter/smoother than after a fresh blow-dry</li>
            <li>With the large rollers included, the wave is loose and yet bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick long hair and wanted more large rollers.</li>
            <li>will look for some new fangled larger clips that they sell seperately to see if this solves my issue.  </li>
            <li>This new set has 4 extra jumbo, which I haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li>if I put too much in, it wouldn&#x27;t dry in time, but it does.  </li>
            <li>but I wish the rollers were half as many and Bigger, Bigger, Bigger</li>
            <li>Only negative for me is I wish there were more rollers in the set</li>
            <li>Most of the women I know have been wanting larger heated rollers for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the set is about 3 times larger than the remington and takes up too much room in my gym bag.  </li>
            <li>, I could use at least 4 more rollers since my hair is longer but the pamphlet that comes with the rollers states you can buy extra sets.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay that hot long, but it&#x27;s enough to cause discomfort.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Super Jumbo\\&quot; curlers are too heavy to roll up...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thick Asian hair, highlights, relatively healthy.      </li>
            <li>However, on the second try, I experimented a little with the clips and they work fine but are nonetheless a little tricky to get just right.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that there is no compartment for the pins like in the very old models...</li>
            <li>It takes all the rollers to curl my entire head, and the curl is very natural.  </li>
            <li>use them every other day, the large 4 in the middle add nice body to my thick hair, this is my second set.  </li>
            <li>like I said alot of hair, and need every single curler to do my whole head, but the clips are a joke.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this set overall, my only complaint is that the pins do not keep rollers tight in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I usually do the front and top layers of my hair with the larger ones and the rest with the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally noticeable and completely unacceptable!  </li>
            <li>No waiting around like other brands for the rollers to get hot.</li>
            <li>But then to navigate the clip away from these 2 openings is a major pain.  </li>
            <li>If you want other women to glare at you with a look that screams &amp;#34;Bitch with hot hair!&amp;#34; you must try this set.</li>
            <li>My hair is so flat normally, that I&#x27;ve been using these just about every day now.  </li>
            <li>After looking at higher priced brands I decided to stick with Conair and try the Extreme Heat set.</li>
            <li>This model has some major advantages.    </li>
            <li>If you have a vanity that holds the product with outlets out of sight, this is a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li>If you want a few extra curls on the side or/and top try also if you have the time and inclination the conair curling iron, 1 inch for bigger curls and 1/2 inch or even 3/8 inch for smaller.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and I didn&#x27;t mind the split down the middle.</li>
            <li>I have long, really thick hair &amp; the rollers are not big enough &amp; there are not enough of them to do a good job.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought maybe I had put too much hair on each curler, so I tried just curling HALF of my hair with all 12 rollers, but got the same result: No curls, just a tiny bit of body at the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like that there are big &amp; smaller rollers BUT, be careful as the rollers get very hot and could burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have the older set of these rollers but there just weren&#x27;t enough rollers to do my entire hair</li>
            <li>I have very long wild, frizzy kinky hair that never wants to cooperate and is neither straight nor nicely curled naturally, but I get tired of just pulling it back in a bun.</li>
            <li>after reading all the reviews of the various sets - I certainly can afford more expensive ones -</li>
            <li>Fits right next to my sink, and there&#x27;s still room for other bathroom essentials.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend these rollers for those with medium to short hair who are looking for a smooth look with little to no curl.</li>
            <li>I have medium long hair and the 12 rollers is just enough to set my whole head .</li>
            <li>so I have to tell you that I was amazed that it only took me 10 minutes to set my whole head of long hair.  </li>
            <li>(I wanted to fancy up my long straight hair occasionally...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, just long.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using the old school simple metal U clips from my old set last night.  </li>
            <li>way too short to hold the curler to your head, I had to use the clips from an old set</li>
            <li>There was barely a wave</li>
            <li>Considering I have very coarse hair, I was surprised it curled myhair the way it did.  </li>
            <li>and I get big, lush, bouncy &#x27;curls&#x27;.</li>
            <li>i went back to my set that is 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>soft surface eliminates those \\&quot;kinked\\&quot; ends on hair that the regular plastic rollers leave.</li>
            <li>They held floppy in my hair and I have to be careful not to move too much once they are in.  </li>
            <li>5/16/09&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly two years of almost daily use, this product went beserk on me.</li>
            <li>I bought these rollers and they barely heat up or curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I have naturally curly hair to began with but wanted larger curls and read that this would do the trick.</li>
            <li>My hair was barely turned under after leaving them in for almost an hour.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The slit in the rollers for the heating element allows your hair to get underneath the edge of the roller, and if you are not careful, you can pull your hair out or break it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Left them in until they completely cooled.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is the metal wire devices that are like the old ones of years gone by...</li>
            <li>I went back to the old reliable velcro rolls which you can&#x27;t heat up</li>
            <li>I have purchase the conair multiple set which is the hot pink one</li>
            <li>Although I am getting better putting those clips in, it is not uncommon for it to go flying across the room.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of concerned about the clips when I purchased them because the description is somewhat vague.</li>
            <li>I usually just comb through with my fingers after removing the rollers and allowing my hair to cool</li>
            <li>The curls didn&#x27;t hold, they were really hard to put in, they didn&#x27;t get very hot, and they were hard to take out, to the point that I was tugging pretty hard on my own hair, which isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They sure are, in fact they make the iron look like a poor choice in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty hair-styling challenged but after a few tries, I finally got this down and use it frequently because it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>While the rollers themselves are great - heat up VERY quickly and hold the heat for a long time - the metal clips that come with it to hold the rollers are AWFUL.</li>
            <li>Not a single kink to be found!</li>
            <li>However, with a little practice I learned how to slide the clips in so that they would keep the roller tight (and the metal clips work so much better than the plastic things.)</li>
            <li>The problem is that the lid keeps cracking right down the middle.   </li>
            <li>Since my older Conair rollers are several years old and still working, I expect these will last for a long time as well.</li>
            <li>The single negative thing I find with this product is that the plastic hinged top breaks.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble right off the bat getting my hair to stay in place while rolling it up.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, straight, smooth Asian hair that is prone to not curling (and when it does it holds for only 20 minutes).</li>
            <li>Overall these rollers are fine, but several small things keep them from greatness.  </li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t get as hot as my previous set</li>
            <li>have just started having problems where half of the rollers get hot and the others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The rollers due stay hot enough to set your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have had several stellar hair days due to this product.</li>
            <li>Smaller sets take forever, if you are being careful not to overload the roller, but this set can handle my large amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair really can do that naturally with a little oomp provided by electric rollers.  </li>
            <li>would have been great to have been given the larger, claw type of clips that would accommodate the larger sized rollers sans the metal that becomes very uncomfortable to sport for longer than 30</li>
            <li>At least I have another unit if something happens to the original one.</li>
            <li>The curl lasts....except in very humid weather...same as other methods.  </li>
            <li>The rollers do add volume, but usually not for long.</li>
            <li>it was more like a flop of limp hair with one puny little wave.</li>
            <li>The first time I use it, I need to practice 2-3 times to tight the rollers.</li>
            <li>And, the new way I do my hair, I never have to blow dry it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I chose the latter option, as I live in a fairly rural area and shipping something back is a bit of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>and I keep them in my hair for at least 30 minutes while I make lunch, iron, and clean</li>
            <li>just purchased this set of rollers after the last set went bust on me and nearly gave me second degree burns</li>
            <li>, I actually don&#x27;t need a shutoff, since I need to get my hair fixed as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the one big downfall for me as far as the actual make of the product.</li>
            <li>Heat up quickly, a little tricky at first curling hair around curler, but get easier.</li>
            <li>These rollers are a major upgrade from my last set.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, just to give you a little background, this isn&#x27;t my first ride on the jumbo-roller-express.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would recommend is buying the plastic roller clips separately, since the metal clips that come with the hot rollers absolutely do not hold my hair!!</li>
            <li>they were larger than other rollers that claimed to be large.</li>
            <li>heats quickly  ample rollers for big and small curls    </li>
            <li>I wanted the look of smooth hair, but I&#x27;m no good at using a blow dryer or a curling iron.</li>
            <li>As my hair is also pretty wavy, it generally holds curl all day long quite well, so with other brands of rollers, I only have to leave them in for 5 minutes or so to get my desired result.</li>
            <li>[...]     I have longer (about mid-chest), thicker, naturally curly hair cut into long layers.  </li>
            <li>You dont need them in for a long time, for natural styles.</li>
            <li>and as I wrapped my hair around them, I thought, \\&quot;well, that&#x27;s strange - wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, I googled Conair complaints and defects, and apparently this sort of things happens with a lot of their products, especially hair dryers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, I googled Conair complaints and defects, and apparently this sort of things happens with a lot of their products, especially hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for over thirty years - I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble with a set.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve gotten them to consistently work for me, once I practiced with them a few times.  </li>
            <li>so I was anxious to see how they would come out after a fresh wash/blow-dry.  </li>
            <li>I plug them in and within a few minutes thay are HOT.  </li>
            <li>Are all hot rollers this heavy?</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot enough, and after leaving them in my hair for about 10 minutes, I barely had a limp curl.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used my new rollers they worked amazingly, but the next few times I was disappointed that the curl would fall right out of my thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick yet fine hair and was looking for a solution to getting shape and volume on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>you just have to put the clip straight up and down against your scalp so that they can&#x27;t unroll...</li>
            <li>The clips that are included work very well in keeping the rollers in, if you put it in with the curved side down.</li>
            <li>it is a little hot to handle but not that big of a deal        </li>
            <li>I had another set with the hinge clips and they left funny little dents in my curl.</li>
            <li>and I wish they would make the super jumbo with 12 rollers instead of have the big ones mixed with the small ones</li>
            <li>They sent them to me, but they were the next model down that doesn&#x27;t have the new clips (it has the old metal pins)</li>
            <li>i have extremely straight, long, dyed asian hair that&#x27;s not too full or too thin</li>
            <li>My mother has an old set of hard plastic Conair hot rollers from the 70s (maybe 80s?)</li>
            <li>but I REALLY wanted to try them out, so I rolled one side, left it for 5 minutes, brushed my teeth and did make-up while they reheated, and then rolled the other side for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Some brands have a slick surface on the roller, and my hair slides right off.</li>
            <li>people who have never used electric curlers, it takes some getting used to the wire clips, but they leave no funny bump, which is highly preferable.</li>
            <li>So much easier than curling and seems less damaging than straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>This hair setter is modestly priced and has the larger barrels I like for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of consistent trying, I gave up and sent them back.</li>
            <li>They heat up in just a few minutes and are plenty hot enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that with my hair (maybe other people&#x27;s hair is different), I need two more rollers.  </li>
            <li>Work fine my only complaint Is there is no where to store the roller clips!</li>
            <li>This is not a good product -- doesn&#x27;t heat up much -- isn&#x27;t worth the time of rolling your hair on the rollers!</li>
            <li>One row of rollers does not heat up at all, and the other row is at such high heat, that I burned a finger.</li>
            <li>I have very long naturally curly blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>this video says to do (thanks to the previous poster who left this video!  </li>
            <li>I had to supplement my purchase with round makeup sponges, which I cut in half to fit between each roller and my head.</li>
            <li>To get it tight I have to aim the clip straight down-like a nail-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually fairly straight with only a slight wave, but now I&#x27;ve got big, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Also, the wire clips for the super-jumbo rollers are not long enough to stick out beyond the roller enough to hold the hair!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, somewhat thin shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li>They did not stay put with the included clips in my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>CONS: there is a bit of a burning plastic smell each time you heat them up, you&#x27;re given the pins which are a bit difficult to use at first, there is nowhere for the pins to be held (no compartment or anything), if you have super long hair</li>
            <li>really, really hot* and didn&#x27;t slide up off their base as easily as they normally do,</li>
            <li>They are constantly falling apart, as easily as it is to put them back together, but doing it repeatedly every morning, especially when you&#x27;re in a rush is just irritating.</li>
            <li>they provide more longevity to the curl lasting throughout the day - and I mean body with slight curl as I desired.  </li>
            <li>The metal, u-shaped clips are a little tricky and can push back the hair a bit when pushed on, but didn&#x27;t really matter in the end.</li>
            <li>The other way is to blow dry it as straight as I can and then roll it.  </li>
            <li>I have flat hair, but in my experience they only work if your hair is dryed naturally, if you dry your hair with heat</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now about those metal pins, I have had good luck with them and bad luck.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> My best friend loves them!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the U-shaped pins and have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> When I got them into my hair as best as I could adjust them to STAY, I had a headache within a minute just from the weight alone.</li>
            <li> and these worked great!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the style I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do the best job of creating curls.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let their size intimidate you, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> After searching for the best rollers I couldn&#x27;t believe I kept running into this set...</li>
            <li> My hair looks perfect every time</li>
            <li> (hairspray - tresemme is the lightest and best).</li>

            <li> Think they would be perfect for ALOT of people tho.</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me, attempting to get the Gisele Bundchen waves then the jumbo size curlers are perfect for that!</li>
            <li> DO NOT straighten your hair before curling because although it may still work you are decreasing your chances of a perfect result.</li>
            <li> IF the correct clips were included I&#x27;d be very happy!</li>
            <li> But for people who have thinner and longer hair, you should try it out because the curls would look beautiful on you!</li>
            <li> It is a great buy!</li>

            <li> and it still looks great!</li>

            <li> Play with it, learn where the metal clip goes best to hold your hair in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am honestly impressed.</li>

            <li> A great buy for a great price!</li>
            <li> I use TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray (One of Allures Greatest Products) with the rollers since I the rollers do get very warm.     </li>

            <li> I loved these rollers!  </li>
            <li> Good luck ladies!</li>
            <li> The curls came out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> when you do get it to work, the hair styles it produces are beautiful.</li>
            <li> It calms my hair, gives me shiny beautiful curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, hopefully you would be too!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product !</li>
            <li> Really happy with them.  </li>
            <li> use them all the time and they work great</li>
            <li> These, however, work great on my hair.</li>
            <li> These do not \\&quot;curl\\&quot; my hair but adds great bounce and fullness to it.</li>
            <li> The curls come out great.  </li>
            <li> I would be happy if you sent the plastic clips.</li>
            <li> Great price point as well.</li>
            <li> but great from someone who has longer hair.        </li>
            <li> I was hoping to get volume on the fly.  </li>
            <li> They work great.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and the bouncy curls I get from using these rollers is great.  </li>
            <li> but I have a plastic clips from another/old set that I use which work great.  </li>
            <li> The clips are great and made no marks on my hair.</li>
            <li> They are great.</li>
            <li> The price was great.  </li>
            <li> They still work great</li>
            <li> this product gives great volume to layered looks.</li>
            <li> This is a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them to work great too.  </li>
            <li> I found this awesome powder stuff that works AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Then the curls look great.      </li>
            <li> I bought this to curl my hair because it got great reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m just not getting it lol.</li>
            <li> Great curl.  </li>
            <li> ARE A GREAT ALTERNATIVE.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the curlers and the type of curl they produce.</li>
            <li> When I took the curlers out my hair looked great, for about 45 minutes...  </li>
            <li> Hers were ceramic and gave great body that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> The velvet around the roller is great but,</li>
            <li> but the clip would either fly off, or the hair would unravel.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this set.  </li>
            <li> have been using this product for about six months now, and am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> A GREAT LOOK  </li>
            <li> GREAT CURLERS</li>
            <li> The size of the rollers are great.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service.    </li>
            <li> I bought these rollers a month ago and they work really great.</li>
            <li> Works best if you let it warm up for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> These rollers are great.</li>
            <li> and it looks great and</li>
            <li> Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Size of rollers is great.  </li>
            <li> the pins are not convienient at all, the conair roller clips will be a great advantage.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, after a 7 minute warm up, and a 10-ish minute set, I had perfect curls with shine &amp; bounce!</li>
            <li> I was really happy just with that.</li>
            <li> works great in both my hair and my kids.</li>
            <li> They work great to give hair a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> This is replacement it works great.</li>
            <li> This product is great__</li>
            <li> These Rollers are great for volume, but they DO NOT curl your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and these rollers are great for smoothing out frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Great curlers.</li>
            <li> but I do think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I am basically happy with them.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re a great product.</li>
            <li> these are great, the velvety surface holds them in well</li>
            <li> these work great.</li>
            <li> the pins that hold the curler in place dont do a great job.  </li>
            <li> They work great</li>
            <li> Great price and service with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Comes with pins instead of clips, which is great.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are great.  </li>
            <li> Product was as described purchased clips to use with rollers and happy with them.</li>
            <li> The rollers are great...</li>
            <li> This could have been a great product.</li>
            <li> Ordered these rollers 5 years ago and they still work great.</li>
            <li> It work great except for the clips that are included</li>
            <li> GREAT</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these.  </li>
            <li> Great buy at a great price.</li>
            <li> I immediately contacted Amazon customer service to tell them of these problems I experienced from seller Bargains AAA.  </li>
            <li> Great rollers...</li>
            <li> Purchased to add to set I already have ... works great ...</li>
            <li> Great set.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, work well, a great buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> They are FABULOUS!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the results!!</li>
            <li> Conair can do MUCH better than this!!  </li>
            <li> very nice set...works well</li>
            <li> These rollers are very nice.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out amazing!  </li>
            <li> and they are amazing!</li>
            <li> I thought for sure I would be spending an obscene amount for a best set.</li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> I love them, they are the best investment.</li>
            <li> Best of all my friends love the way my hair looks</li>
            <li> No way of putting it in seemed to be all that effective at holding the roller in place!</li>
            <li> Love these - still have them after 2+ years, work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I wanted more volume and these rollers work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the best results when I allow the rollers to heat up for more than 5 minutes (manufacturer states 2 as a minimum).</li>
            <li> so will use infrequently, but sure makes hair look nice!!)</li>
            <li> Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> But it made no difference; might as well have set my hair in ice cubes for all the good it did.</li>
            <li> I like the rollers as they do a good job with creating volume in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought on Amazon, shipping was good</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size and the velvet covering keeps your air smooth with no frizz.</li>
            <li> They are really good but don&#x27;t leave them \\&quot;unsupervised\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It truly seems like the good folks at Conair never even tried these before shipping them out.  </li>
            <li> Hassle-free, effective design - except for the fact that the pins often pop, rather, fly off the rolls once I&#x27;ve fastened them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look good me.</li>
            <li> It definalty will look good on anyone elses but for anyone who has hair like mine, I wouldn&#x27;t reconmend it.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be gorgeous.</li>
            <li> did look good and had the body I wanted.</li>
            <li> Loved the way my hair curls.</li>
            <li> But all in all, a good product for temporary curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those of you who didn&#x27;t have good luck,  try that.  </li>
            <li> This set is quite nice, and it&#x27;s a great value for the price.  </li>
            <li> It still works good.  </li>
            <li> but if you have a lot of curly hair and are looking to smooth it with these the four largest ones are the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and this makes it look good.</li>
            <li> She said she really loved these rollers and they were sufficient to work for her and the tons of hair she has.</li>
            <li> The curlers work good however</li>
            <li> I like the rollers, and Conair has always had good products.  </li>
            <li> Conair puts out a good product and these are no exception.</li>
            <li> I have allways used Conair products and these rollers are just as good as all the others I have bought over the years.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to review the curlers under 4 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are the best rollers for full hair with body.  </li>
            <li> Since I have seen so many posts about people not knowing how to use the wire clips, I thought I would share :)     Happy rolling!</li>
            <li> You need to play around with this many many times to see what positioning of the curls works best for you..</li>
            <li> It comes with 4 super jumbo rollers, which are perfect for shorter layers or shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> The fact that it heats up so quickly is also wonderful.</li>
            <li> This has been the best set of hot rollers for a newbie like me to get used to trying out!</li>
            <li> and they are great for when you want to have a more relaxed style.</li>
            <li> , if I could suggest IMPROVEMENTS to make these great rollers even greater for version 2.0, here&#x27;s what I would suggest to the design/engineering team:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the most part, these rollers have worked great.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I have been very pleased with them</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these rollers.</li>
            <li> All in all though I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure those of you who are experienced must already know.</li>
            <li> they heat up real quick and allow for a great look.</li>
            <li> The rollers looked nice and they looked like a good size but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this was just a dud unit, as the curlers had produced good volume and nice curls.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my best friend who has very long hair, so the size of the rollers were perfect!</li>
            <li> But the rollers themselves are awesome, they heat quickly and create nice curls.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly, and create beautiful body and curls.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I just bought these a couple days ago and i absolutely love them!  </li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Even my grandmother&#x27;s foam rollers (that have no heat) work better than these things!  </li>
            <li> These are THE BEST hot rollers for longer hair that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I love the look that I get on those \\&quot;no shampoo\\&quot; days!  </li>
            <li> Bait and Switch for sure!</li>
            <li> These hot curlers work excellent!</li>
            <li> I love these and would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> excellent sizes and heats up fast!  </li>
            <li> I love this rollers!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> These things are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> But two more rollers would have been nice!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product!</li>
            <li> Although it takes some getting used to for me, i love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain in words much more than this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> These work much better!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, Worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> the rollers are not too hot to handle, i feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t break b/c of the velcro lining on the rollers, and i think the 1.5 in size is great!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll look even better!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these rollers!</li>
            <li> I love these rollers!</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are perfect!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and my wife still uses these almost every day, and I still love how her hair looks!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this purchase in 2009!</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered and very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definetly satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> So glad I found what I needed on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> They turn out great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> The front row got so hot the silver plastic started to melt!!!!     </li>
            <li> rollers are fine, and work great for the money.</li>
            <li> Finding this set,  with all large and jumbo rollers was so awesome.  </li>
            <li> the ease of using this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> hair looks amazing for the rest of the day (provided it&#x27;s not humid).  </li>
            <li> A great smooth curling device..</li>
            <li> My hair is cap-sleeve level, and these rollers give nice body, volume and curl.  </li>
            <li> so they heat up nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather amusing, though not so efficient.</li>
            <li> What a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I thought it was an honest mistake, so I returned them and had them send a replacement explaining my dilemma.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are okay, good for volume, which is all I want</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying them these are a good catch :)</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size and my hair looks so much healthier when I pop these in my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> they were just barely warm to touch when i removed them.</li>
            <li> Yes I know what you&#x27;re thinking but honestly, take my word for it I do.</li>
            <li> Anyway, once it&#x27;s all on, I just wait until all the rollers are no longer warm.    </li>
            <li> It would be nice addition</li>
            <li> would have liked it if there was a temperature adjustment setting.</li>
            <li> The really nice thing about Conair is, if you purchase this, and not like the clips: call them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> They take out the frizz and give my hair a nice bounce.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t even own a blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> They arrived, and I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give these a 4 for the nice curls, but a 1-2 for convenience.</li>
            <li> This one, however, really made me happy!</li>
            <li> This means the rollers weren&#x27;t totally effective at smoothing frizz and imparting body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice..</li>
            <li> Honestly I have had my set for almost 5 years now and it still works well.  </li>
            <li> the kind that are all over the magazines.</li>
            <li> Also, for travel, it would be nice to have a place to store the clips.</li>
            <li> I thougt they were nice.</li>
            <li> I like to let it warm up for about 10</li>
            <li> I really am loving these curlers.</li>
            <li> Having two sized rollers is nice - and if you can&#x27;t get the clips in, practice.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still just not getting a nice grip with them.  </li>
            <li> The curls are still holding nicely 3 hours after setting them.  </li>
            <li> They are just the hook wire kind</li>
            <li> very nice big curls, still the best hair styling tool,...</li>
            <li> At first I thought these curlers would be great as they give good body to the hair.</li>
            <li> They are extremely fast and they model my hair which is very fine perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very good hot rollers for longer hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and high Quality.</li>
            <li> The good news is that that these rollers create nice strong bouncy curls and waves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of curlers from seller &amp;#34;Bargains AAA,&amp;#34; and received the item perfectly on time, but in used condition instead of new as it had been advertised.  </li>
            <li> This is good product, easy to use, and your hair looks like you spend a lot of time curling.</li>
            <li> Great Price and Quick Ship</li>
            <li> The jumbo rollers are perfect for the top for volume and the rest give a gentle wave.  </li>
            <li> My goal was to have nice, soft curls towards the bottom of my hair and great volume...don&#x27;t forget the volume!</li>
            <li> They come with hair pins, not clips, but very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very easy to use, and they stay put in your hair until you remove them.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, even for someone like me who has zero talent in managing hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! &#x3D;</li>
            <li> , im glad I took the chance, I love em!</li>
            <li> They heat up fine and curl good but</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the rollers themselves are fine and a good size for thicker hair</li>
            <li> I do have a good amount of hair, but it is fine and silky.</li>
            <li> I guess I am more of a curling iron kind of girl.</li>
            <li> This set works near perfectly to give my the look that I want.</li>
            <li> If you want then spray it with a good light hairspray for the finishing touch.</li>
            <li> But these are by far the best rollers I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> but this is the best set so far.</li>
            <li> You will be a sexy new you, and these are the best, so get them!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it is so easy and fast</li>
            <li> Although due to the size, they don&#x27;t make the best travel set - but it would be great to be able to set these to both 110 and 240</li>
            <li> Heat up time is very quick!</li>
            <li> ,I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR</li>
            <li> But in my situation I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and works gorgeously!</li>
            <li> This set is great, gives you that happy big curl waves.  </li>
            <li> I could not get a good curl for the special event I had that evening.</li>
            <li> Best for medium length hair...heats up quickly and stays hot....</li>
            <li> The curlers themselves are great - very large compared to most you will find.  </li>
            <li> The product is, actually, pretty great.  </li>
            <li> I used it today for the first time and have bouncy curls that have already lasted for 7 hours and look great.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SET OF HOT CURLERS;IT</li>
            <li> Seller was great but product not so hot.</li>
            <li> This product is great that is why I bought it online rather than driving around trying to find that exact model in the stores.  </li>
            <li> these hot rollers work great-</li>
            <li> Works well fast to beautiful curls in 5 min</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so jealous of all the girls that have had great experiences with these rollers ;)</li>
            <li> They give my hair great shape and wave and are easy to use and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, heats up quickly and do a great job of giving my hair volume.</li>
            <li> Depending on the look I&#x27;m looking for, I use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair, keep them on for 10 minutes while I put on my makeup, and voila!</li>
            <li> The roller part is very comfortable but the metal slot burns the scalp.</li>
            <li> The one good thing that comes out of using these rollers was actually nice  non frizzy hair with very gentle curls.</li>
            <li> Nice body, beautiful, soft curls.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to set my hair, remove, and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style.</li>
            <li> I LOVED that this set had just jumbo and super jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> This set warms up fast and produces wonderful full curls.  </li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and do a good job curling hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice curl that lasts and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> The texture of the rollers grip my hair nicely and make it easy to wrap my hair around the roller.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews about the in-styler and that it often breaks quickly, I searched for good rollers and bought these.  </li>
            <li> this unit is fine and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> The product is great, but keep in mind that while some people complain that the rollers are too large, these are medium to me.  </li>
            <li> There are four jumbo rollers and eight large rollers, this is great</li>
            <li> When you do that, you get a HUGE dent in your hair!  </li>
            <li> It does make a huge difference in the results!</li>
            <li> I love these hair rollers.  </li>
            <li> Would probably work better for someone with finer/thinner hair.    </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the job the rollers does.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the item is doing ok.</li>
            <li> I also love the wire clips, they don&#x27;t leave an indent in the curl.  </li>
            <li> I love these rollers, I would have rated them a 5 if not for the metal clips.</li>
            <li> so glad I have them.</li>
            <li> But watch out for cracks in top.  </li>
            <li> will promote cracks in the plastic top withing a year.  </li>
            <li> You used to be able to order that part</li>
            <li> This was a replacement item and I absolutely love these curlers.  </li>
            <li> No accident, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re okay with having 10 clips for 12 rollers and paying $10-15 more than you thought you would, these might be the rollers for you.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the clips aren&#x27;t the greatest in the world but that hasn&#x27;t affected the way the curlers have worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Great rollers that heat up fast but who invented the clips???</li>
            <li> They are ok but</li>
            <li> love the concept, but my hair does not hold the curls.</li>
            <li> The top of all of the sets I&#x27;ve had have eventually warped from the heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but until I find something better</li>
            <li> They were supposed to create wavy sexy hair and they might of</li>
            <li> but these rollers are so big they aren&#x27;t perfect either.     </li>
            <li> If you are trying to achieve lots of curls and your hair is on the shorter side, than the smaller sized rollers are perfect for you.</li>
            <li> The longer they heat, the better they will hold your hair.</li>
            <li> No matter what way I put the pins in or how many I used</li>
            <li> If you want wavy sexy curls this set of rollers is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I LOVE these rollers.  </li>
            <li> I myself have to admit I am able to create bouncy sexy curls and waves with these rollers and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> It works better for me if I leave the lid up after they heat up.  </li>
            <li> I love this product as it does not burn your fingers or scalp.</li>
            <li> I was able to get around the rollers</li>
            <li> I felt it works OK.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I wanted more of a wavy effect instead of the perm effect and these rollers do just that.  </li>
            <li> Who can argue with that?  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would be better with them if I did my hair more often.</li>
            <li> This Conair Instant Heat curlers are the best!  </li>
            <li> Sure makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I like these rollers they heat up fast and work great in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Put the clip OVER the curler on top and rotate it into the best possible position.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> USE ALL THE CURLERS (or most of them, there are 12, plenty for all your hair, won&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> They are ok, I use the curling iron more now that I appreciate the outcome.</li>
            <li> The pin things that they come with do NOT work unless you stand perfectly still for the next 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Also, to get better results, I would get two sets, as I think the amount of hair I put on the rollers dilutes the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun because I know it&#x27;s going to look good in about 30 minutes.    </li>
            <li> But in order to get it to work and hold the curl, I needed more.  </li>
            <li> (I make it lightly damp, not dripping or anything!)    </li>
            <li> On the top of my head, all of them are claw clips that I use</li>
            <li> (make sure you put them on correctly, and they won&#x27;t let your hair fall out of the roller or flop around on your head.)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the wire clips on the top of my head, but I will use them around the sides/back.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide if I like the claw clips or the wire clips better.  </li>
            <li> When you watch the video, you see how she does the top, then when you go to the sides, there are two \\&quot;special\\&quot; spots on each side ofyour head that she says to go ahead and put rollers in.  </li>
            <li> I realize most of the products I&#x27;m suggesting are from them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE these rollers in combo with the hair products I mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> So I do recommend buying a better set of clips for these.</li>
            <li> Most of them hold the roller in place but the rollers by my ears tend to slip.  </li>
            <li> The top of the case cracked from traveling.  </li>
            <li> FYI, I am Jim Pomm&#x27;s partner, Sara;  he is not the one using the rollers! :)</li>
            <li> I love the size and number of rollers in this set.</li>
            <li> Reasons why I love these curlers...</li>
            <li> They give me wonderful volume and curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes need more than 5 rollers.</li>
            <li> so haven&#x27;t used these types of rollers for many, many</li>
            <li> , it was just the cracked plastic top.</li>
            <li> sure there has to be a better product out there somewhere.</li>
            <li> so I could add some sexy waves to my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have softer hair than most, but they do not hold on to my hair at all.</li>
            <li> The ion curlers from Conair worked better for me.</li>
            <li> When I received the set I was pleased with the quality and flocking on the rollers, although the metal pins would not hold at all in my hair, so I purchased some Conair Pro Clips instead.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say it enough -- I LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> but they leave your hair so style and sexy</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would give my hair more volume and curl.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such excellent service and[[ASIN:B00005A441</li>
            <li> The one downside, as many have mentioned is the clips.</li>
            <li> Love this rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used!I got a better deal here in Amazon than purchasing it from Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many sets where there were all sizes and</li>
            <li> I love these curlers.</li>
            <li> These heat up fast and curl great.</li>
            <li> Maybe better with a coarser type hair.</li>
            <li> And I really love the curls.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> If I want more body, I just leave the rollers in longer.</li>
            <li> I like using these rollers much better than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought it hoping it would give me cute curly hair</li>
            <li> I love these rollers.</li>
            <li> It is more of an annoyance that anything else, but I felt it deserved mentioning.</li>
            <li> It will set and hold better that way</li>
            <li> OK?</li>
            <li> I really love this set</li>
            <li> so it is touching the top of the roller facing your feet.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had better clips.</li>
            <li> If the set had 4 more rollers I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> work better for someone with more manageable hair.</li>
            <li> they did their job, most of the hair stayed in the roller while i did my make up, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend the metal clips if you&#x27;re going to go around the house waiting for it to set.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any creative way to avoid the crimp, so I got rid of the rollers.</li>
            <li> Love the clips as well--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure once my hair is longer</li>
            <li> and it was slightly better</li>
            <li> I set with lots of hair spray, and my curls will last all day, so happy I purchased these!</li>
            <li> I love the heat that it produces in the rollers.</li>
            <li> so I get more curl than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these type and they never worked well.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s basically like a mortal mermaid with all that succulent, sexy hair whipped up like steam from a roiling pasta pot.  </li>
            <li> am so glad, because these rollers are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> now I know to allot more time to heating them up.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a spot for the clips, even just a magnetic surface on the top.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> but I wish they were more sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I love the curlers.</li>
            <li> Love the sizes of the rollers for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I had room to wrap more hair around the rollers.</li>
            <li> I used ItsJudysTime video on YouTube as a guide. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My hair looked fantastic!</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> The top cracked, but that was after years of use.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I love these.  </li>
            <li> i love this set.</li>
            <li> it is great thanks</li>
            <li> Conair you need to develop a better system.</li>
            <li> This is the largest size of heated rollers I&#x27;ve been able to find on the market.</li>
            <li> I expect to use these for many years.  </li>
            <li> And I love that they come with the old-style pins</li>
            <li> - they hold the rollers better than the newer clips.</li>
            <li> But if you buy them, I hope they work, and that you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I have another set that has clips that heat up w/ the rollers and that type of set seems to hold the curl for most of the day, but I just wished it had as many jumbo rollers as this one.</li>
            <li> yet it looks relaxed--not too poofy on top.</li>
            <li> I love this aspect.</li>
            <li> I can turn my rollers on, walk my dog, roll my hair upon my return :)    </li>
            <li> I love love LOVE these curlers.</li>
            <li> Love the set.</li>
            <li> Love the jumbo size and love the metal pin/clips.</li>
            <li> Purchased a curved straight iron instead and that works great</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let hem heat for more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need to use curlers on the top of your head (or for bangs)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get the rollers to work with the clips provided ever, NOT ONCE.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get them to stay in for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they will work better with another hair type.  </li>
            <li> Thought they would hold more curl.</li>
            <li> I really love the results that I get from this product.</li>
            <li> It did save time but would probably have been better if I used stronger clips</li>
            <li> but they work much better.</li>
            <li> and I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> but okay.</li>
            <li> They make my hair look goofy.</li>
            <li> and sometimes if the curlers are just  hanging there, thats okay too.</li>
            <li> well I love the size of the curlers</li>
            <li> , I can do my hair in 15 minutes while doing things around the house, and they&#x27;re affordable :)</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Love the rollers but buy the clamps to hold them on.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> I love the results I get when I use it</li>
            <li> In place better</li>
            <li> I purchased these thinking they would be better for my hair than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Some elastic band may hold the rollers better.</li>
            <li> This made my hair more curly than the relaxed waves I wanted</li>
            <li> Thought these jumbo rollers would help give me more volume but the heat just seemed to flatten my hair even more.</li>
            <li> For the top \\&quot;mo-hawk\\&quot; section, these pins do not work as well.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the pins, I used duck-bill clips for the top section.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t unplug my stove top or oven every time I finish using, so I think I can handle the Conair.</li>
            <li> This was not the magic bullet.</li>
            <li> which I had been satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s just a learning curve</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll get better with them</li>
            <li> Others have reported better results with the heat</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure hair type has a LOT to do with it.  </li>
            <li> I love the speedy way they heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking the clamp clips would work a lot better.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t over pay for these.</li>
            <li> Could use more rollers.</li>
            <li> Could use more rollers.</li>
            <li> I saw a video on using metal hair clips vs the clips that came with the rollers that worked better</li>
            <li> Rollers produce awesome, glamorous big curls.</li>
            <li> and I love these rollers.</li>
            <li> I am able to have lots of body with my roller sets.</li>
            <li> There has GOT to be something better out there.</li>
            <li> While those aren&#x27;t the results I would like, they still give me very pretty, full, wavy hair, so I am happy with the way they work.</li>
            <li> they are very large and good for longer or curlier hair to redirect the curl.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas 2006 and was very excited on using it.  </li>
            <li> like I need more volume up there to balance out the curls and make it look really nice and full.  </li>
            <li> These were OK, they curled my hair pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The rollers were cool and the outsides of the sections of hair never got more than warm.</li>
            <li> They smooth out my hair very easily.</li>
            <li> These are great rollers and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that instead of that, I just have much more volume and bounce in my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> i love the way it makes my hair look, very full</li>
            <li> I have another hot curler set that has an attached compartment for the pins, which is a really good</li>
            <li> A good purchase if hot rollers are needed.</li>
            <li> Hot rollers were what everyone used 20 years ago, but were they as good as an iron?  </li>
            <li> Theses rollers are especially good for those with lots of long hair.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old, with good hair still (I love and recommend Wen products!)  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a large roller set for body and volume and thought this would be good after reading many of the reviews.</li>
            <li> These rollers are very easy to use and definitely do a nice job of providing fast curls!</li>
            <li> I love the clips instead of the pins and am growing my hair out even longer so that I can get the full benefit of these rollers!</li>
            <li> However, I tend to turn them on well before I need them, so they are super nice and</li>
            <li> As far as being quick and easy, these are some of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the manufacturer make the pins in more easily (and rapidly) differentiated colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love their compact package that is easy to stow away.  </li>
            <li> (i used giovanni, which i just discovered, love it, all natural stuff and smells great) and work in my hair.      </li>
            <li> I was sooo excited to get these because it seemed to have lots of jumbo rollers (more than most sets), but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this set, several sizes including the super jumbo (perfect!)</li>
            <li> Curlers are large, which is good; however, they don&#x27;t grip hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> The plastic roller clips are comfortable, and rather ingeniously shaped.  </li>
            <li> but Im sure that they will be fabulous becuz</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are the most amazing tool for styling your hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product - my first set lasted me many years until I had finally dropped them all one too many times.</li>
            <li> ,it took three of those to be able to secure one roller in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The curlers did a great job as far as giving body to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these hot rollers...</li>
            <li> Also great for busy mommies.</li>
            <li> and most importantly - metal clips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real worth it fifteen or twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> Heat up fast and work good</li>
            <li> This has been a good set for my very</li>
            <li> They warm up quickly and get very hot (watch out!).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but I can freshen my hair with 2 or three quick hot rollers on the top..FAST FREE DELIVERY WITH AMAZON-EASY and great.</li>
            <li> As for the rollers, they are nothing special - but the size is good, curl is nice and not overboard.  </li>
            <li> So be prepared to buy the Super Clips, which are somewhat better (and you gotta love Conair -</li>
            <li> so I could have mostly all super jumbo or mostly jumbo depending on my hair length.  </li>
            <li> For me, ths jumbos are just perfect, the super jumbos are way too big for my shoulder length</li>
            <li> The super jumbo sized rollers are perfect for that effect, but there are only 4 of them in this set.</li>
            <li> The rollers were right in their own slots</li>
            <li> They are a dream come true for my type of hair!  </li>
            <li> The most significant difference was the ends that were curled, but otherwise I would not see a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time for my senior portraits and I looked stunning!</li>
            <li> other all I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Okay, for starters, I bought this item at Walmart (about 28 bucks), excited to have soft,wavy,bouncy, voluminous, \\&quot;Hollywood\\&quot; curls.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for beginning of an updo or other fancy style.  </li>
            <li> I have other velvet curlers made by Remington, that are AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Pros: heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> they did heat up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very quick to heat up</li>
            <li> and they have a coating that makes the rolling of the hair easy to do.  </li>
            <li> These rollers heat quickly..and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> On the bright side they did heat up really fast and they are extremely easy to wrap around your hair and secure.</li>
            <li> The rollers get hot very quickly which is great and stay hot.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to curl and even after hairspraying it, and keeping the rollers in for 20 minutes, while the metal clips burned my scalp and neck</li>
            <li> So worth the practice to have such great results!</li>
            <li> Well, they do the job, but they are not all that easy to use.</li>
            <li> THESE CURLERS HEAT UP VERY QUICKLY</li>
            <li> They take awhile to heat up but are easy to get in and out.</li>
            <li> it so easy to use.</li>
            <li> #4: the pins are easy to use and don&#x27;t leave marks in my hair like some brand&#x27;s clips do.</li>
            <li> really easy to roll my hair in</li>
            <li> Easy to use and heats evenly.  </li>
            <li> so they dont burn my hair and easy to put in yourself</li>
            <li> They are fairly easy to fix</li>
            <li> The curlers are easy to handle and don&#x27;t burn your fingers if you grab them correctly.  </li>
            <li> Easy on the hair</li>
            <li> These rollers are easy to use and provide the result I wanted.  </li>
            <li> They work incredibly well with my very pin straight hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, they work, and produce good curls, but I wish they would make a set in this size that are designed like the classic ConAir Rollers -</li>
            <li> My hair is long and layered, and while my original Conair set was nice, these rollers are a great improvement.</li>
            <li> They do add a sexy wave if I do it right, though!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to use the product right away.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the curlers they heat up fast and are easy to use..</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly &amp; are perfect for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are amazing.  </li>
            <li> On the whole, though, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I always liked Conair hot rollers and</li>
            <li> (they warm up so fast!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to get full use of them because of the pins....</li>
            <li> I use full over the roller clips with teeth, they stay in place much better.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, however, there are not enough rollers.</li>
            <li> They are sometimes kind of hot to handle if I let them heat up any longer</li>
            <li> Not too hot to the touch and a nice size curl..</li>
            <li> Just be sure to let the rollers completely cool once applied to your hair before removing them.</li>
            <li> I loved these hot rollers from Conair!&lt;br /&gt;These are great for girls with long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The set is good except for two things that they changed with the new model.  </li>
            <li> This could just be that my hair is so fine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, medium-long hair.</li>
            <li> They stay in just fine - thank you to the reviewer who supplied the technique of putting them in at 90 degrees then pivoting them underneath.  </li>
            <li> However, the ones that come with the set are perfectly fine if you know how to use them.  </li>
            <li> Thus, if you have fine hair, they burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I bought a set of the conair superclips and they work fine.</li>
            <li> The pins are fine</li>
            <li> The pins work fine, but the clips are under $9 and just easier and quicker to use, so do get them.</li>
            <li> I used the wire clips today and they held fine.  </li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t keep them in my hair (shoulder length and fine -</li>
            <li> The rollers were fine but the clips that came with them don&#x27;t even hold the rollers nor are they made for them.  </li>
            <li> but my hairdresser says I have \\&quot;a lot of fine hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for about an hour but goes straight pretty soon after unless I use a ton of hairspray.</li>
            <li> the hairsetter is fine - otherwise, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Maybe they work for coarser, thicker hair, but not for my fine locks.  </li>
            <li> These are not bad rollers, just wish they can stay on more secure.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and they don&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers are just fine.....</li>
            <li> Then, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I did get the super clips and they are OK</li>
            <li> That day, my hair looked like a super model!</li>
            <li> These hit the mark with 6 Jumbo rollers and 4 SUPER jumbo rollers, which I have found myself using more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heat level is probably adequate for most, but sometimes I  wish I could ratchet it up a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I bought the Conair Super Clips and they stay much better.</li>
            <li> I will even take this with me traveling as it is a quick fix after completing makeup, you just unroll hair and go!</li>
            <li> up quick - fairly comfortable (as comfortable as hot rollers can be) - good purchase.</li>
            <li> would be ok for a quick touch up if you use sprays or gels</li>
            <li> Love these rollers They heat up quick and</li>
            <li> I love this product, it heats up quickly and does its job.</li>
            <li> so learn to act quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to hold your hair in a certain shape and be able to let it cool.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, warm up fast, and love the super jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> They are nice, get nice and hot fairly fast</li>
            <li> I liked the flocking on the rollers so my straight hair didn&#x27;t slip out so easily, BUT the wire clips scrape off the flocking.</li>
            <li> The clips if you put them straight up hold super good and don&#x27;t leave any marks on your hair.   </li>
            <li> Looks great when I first remove them but the curl fades away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are nice and large.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have them all large and</li>
            <li> I love my hot rollers!</li>
            <li> that still work great and have similar clips, which hold the rollers in just fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my hair but 1 or 2 times a year, but could used more curlers (my hair almost to waist) needs more hair pins in all the sizes, esp for the large curlers.</li>
            <li> They give frizzy hair a smooth look that lasts all day no matter the weather.</li>
            <li> These newer clips do not work and one would think in the instruction booklet they would have a drawing to show you how to put them in securely.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase another type of clip to securely hold the roller in place.</li>
            <li> Plugged &#x27;em in, the place filled up with noxious fumes and smoke that I could taste for hours.</li>
            <li> Also, the clips are an important part of this product and they SUCK.</li>
            <li> so I use these to straighten with a light wave to it...</li>
            <li> Overall happy with my Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> The bigger size is great for longer hair.  </li>
            <li> I get great, big curls and my hair is softer and shinier.  </li>
            <li> i am happy with the product and use it several times a week</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t stay in place with the cheap clips.  </li>
            <li> Your Hair looks so smooth and it don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used Conair rollers for over twenty years I am very used to and adept at the wire pin holders.</li>
            <li> They got such great reviews</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes she had awesome curls!</li>
            <li> I have had these for a few years and they still work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I could find that nowhere, but someone suggested I use a light mousse.</li>
            <li> The larger curler is great.</li>
            <li> Consequently, I use them primarily at home.  </li>
            <li> These rollers heat fast and create a nice curl.</li>
            <li> Conair Champion Salon Pro Roller Clips] which are 10 clips for about $7 and available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> This product fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of clip-roller before with no problems, but on this set the clips do not hold the rollers securely and they tend to droop or even fall out.</li>
            <li> I want them to smooth out the kinks, add some lift, and finish the ends, and these rollers do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I ended up letting the curlers heat for 30 minutes because the light never changed colors...</li>
            <li> It also looked great the next day.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit the jumbo rollers once you get your hair wrapped around it</li>
            <li> These are fabulous.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS product.    </li>
            <li> Then some of the rollers I have dropped on the floor did not seem to fit smoothly into the slot they heat up in and and the stress of pushing them in and pulling them out started to cause the rollers to break apart.    </li>
            <li> Dropped one of the rollers and it didn&#x27;t fit on the bar</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps, I depend greatly on reviews personally.</li>
            <li> this works great for when I am short on time in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have now used this product three times and overall, I am happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I just hope they continue to be available.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so reasonably priced and are so amazing.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants amazing curls!!!</li>
            <li> They create gorgeous soft curls.</li>
            <li> The soft covering on the rollers is kind to your hair as well, and I think gives a better curl than an iron.  </li>
            <li> This is a great buy and a really nice hot roller size for long hair.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t heat up to super hot, which is much healthier for my hair, not to mention they are a great price and Amazon shipped them to me for free.  </li>
            <li> I just used the rollers for the first time on my shoulder-length, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Also, once you purchase this full set, you will find with the directions, an address and cost for buying more Super Jumbo rollers--which I have done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because they do get hot quickly and are nicely sized.</li>
            <li> Go to a beauty store and get some, but bring one of these in, so that you can make sure that you buy the right size.</li>
            <li> And, I got these at Target, but Amazon has a better price right now.  </li>
            <li> It got hot within minutes of turn the unit on, the hair came out shiny and the curl held for a couple of days!!  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat quickly, are a nice large size that works great on long hair, and they are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are large and perfect for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I would love to have a set of ALL super size, but the large work ok.  </li>
            <li> I have been happy with this set of hot rollers so far.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, heats quickly, roller material is easy on the hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is full, shiny, soft and gorgeous looking.  </li>
            <li> Its quick and easy to use and Im</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the choice, it&#x27;s inexpensive, heats up pretty fast, rolls up nice (especially for we who are less experienced in rollers)</li>
            <li> These rollers are quick and easy - on days when there isn&#x27;t time for fussing, I heat them up, put them in and I am done in minutes.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, and</li>
            <li> They are no-fuss and clamp onto the rollers quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I think the ceramic just doesn&#x27;t hold the heat like the older style where each curler sat on its own rod.  </li>
            <li> They do heat up quickly, and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair is very manageable, and it is making the growing out process very easy.  </li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with her new Instant Heat Jumbo Rollers!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty good at this sort of thing, but I have never been able to use the wire clips that the old fashioned rollers had, and the \\&quot;super</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hope that I would FINALLY be able to turn my long straight hair into some beautiful flowing curls.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product, and would not hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Works like magic ;)</li>
            <li> These JUMBO rollers are great for long hair.</li>
            <li> Great for Long Hair.  </li>
            <li> When I cut my hair just past my shoulders, the curls were PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I&#x27;ve been to learn about them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun to do my hair every morning!  </li>
            <li> Great for long hair.</li>
            <li> Got the chi iron instead and so worth it!</li>
            <li> I was never before able to use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try them out when I got them.</li>
            <li> Great for long hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers for years, and this set is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try them.</li>
            <li> They are so worth the price!</li>
            <li> So the wait for it was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Really glad I purchased these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> On humid days I spray each piece of hair with hair spray first before I wrap it around the curler and the curl stays better.</li>
            <li> I bought mine for $10 at a yard sale unused and still in the original box.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and the pins work just fine without bumps.  </li>
            <li> So I was really excited when I found them.</li>
            <li> It is the only product of its kind I have found that will hold all my hair!</li>
            <li> Love these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> When I looked for the original online, they were no longer selling on the site.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It makes for lovely hair, for the first 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with how these foam rollers hold my hair, and with how hot they get.</li>
            <li> these work better than any of these hot irons,&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> I also looked around and found you can buy a set of claw-like clips made by Conair for the rollers that are much easier to use and typically more secure (for my hair thickness).</li>
            <li> I give this a solid four stars because I am still waiting for CHI or Sedu to come out with an awesome professional set that has no flaws, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> To be even more honest you increased the size of four rollers and yet some how couldn&#x27;t possible figure out how to create a receptacle for the clips?</li>
            <li> YOU LET THE CURLERS COMPLETELY HEAT UP FOR 5 MINUTES AND THEN LEAVE THEM IN FOR 20 MINUTES FOR BEST POSSIBLE RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted more professional, stylish look for work.</li>
            <li> The first set lasted me about 4 years, and were still working although not heating as hot as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> They heat up super quick and create great big waves of hair.  </li>
            <li> If you really want to use these rollers, buy the plastic clip-on clips that hold the roller more securely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open for a nice set of 3 inch curlers, but in the meantime, I&#x27;m in love with these.</li>
            <li> Without good pins to keep the rollers in place, the curler really are not of much use.  </li>
            <li> I own an older set of Conair rollers, and there is a little compartment to hold the metal pins, but surprisingly, this one does not!    </li>
            <li> I was looking for some new hot rollers and felt that these would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These rollers are dependable and great for adding volume and loose curls to hair.</li>
            <li> Rollers get hot quickly and are hotter than most electric curlers but the pins do not keep the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quickly and work great for long hair.</li>
            <li> These heated up quickly and the size was great for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I like the way they heat up fast and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I just love these hot rollers, so easy and fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone using these has very pretty curls, but they&#x27;re probably also walking around with crimps in funny places all over their heads.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;smart clip&#x27; is meant to be better than the metal pins, but they truly aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Anticipating problems based on reading some of the reviews, I ordered special clips.  </li>
            <li> This product was used by me in Denmark, so I had to use special electrical connectors.</li>
            <li> will use on special occasions</li>
            <li> I cannot get them to hold for nothing in my hair and it normally curls very easily.</li>
            <li> To Go\\&quot; rollers that work beautiful, I&#x27;ll just have to get another set as these only come with 5 large rollers.    </li>
            <li> Was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the rollers, it would look great initially, but then it would fall out within 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with how fast they get hot and how well they work.  </li>
            <li> Overall good quality.</li>
            <li> Cool to the touch with a velvety covering.  </li>
            <li> Let it completely cool</li>
            <li> I wish I could find my old Clairol set I used to own....</li>
            <li> I leave them in for maybe 20 minutes - until cool -</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this set is the size of the rollers - just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> i really wanted to love these</li>
            <li> also I have thick hair and these worked perfect with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it would be nice if they could be stored with the rollers like my old set.</li>
            <li> I make sure to spray the whole strand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lifting up and full looking -</li>
            <li> They create a nice natural curl that hold for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am sure the lid will crack too, but I like the results so much</li>
            <li> The rollers were cool in my hair after 15 - 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Full, bouncy body with these rollers.  </li>
            <li> They also come with the metal wire clips that keep the curlers in your hair very well, unlike those plastic clips that come with most curlers I see.     </li>
            <li> best results I&#x27;ve gotten have been when my hair has a ton of product in it and has not been washed in at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Rather than being able to walk around and put on makeup or get dressed, this product forces one to stay absolutely stationary to have any prayer of getting the rollers to stay in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> item was returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li> the curls are so nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Loved the fact that the rollers were big.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product, well built.</li>
            <li> The velvet flocking on the rollers seems to be much gentler and I love the quick heat-up time.  </li>
            <li> The rollers themselves do heat up very quickly, but they get too hot.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for rollers that would be easy to use as I was a first time user.</li>
            <li> Great quality, though - long lasting and my hair is super healthy despite using these!</li>
            <li> Every set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned had a place to put these things in because they&#x27;re so easy to lose.</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect when I want some volume and soft, loose curls.  </li>
            <li> I definately recommend this product for people like me and even, as I have seen, for people who have very straight baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a whole set of 12-14 large (purple) rollers.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its a really great product, just not for my hair.</li>
            <li> It does heat up nice and quick and stays hot for a long time, but the best part is that it makes my hair shiny gives it a nice bounce and last all day long with a bit of hairspray and mousse.   </li>
            <li> Love my new set!  </li>
            <li> Heat up fairly quickly</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I waited until I tried the rollers and then immediately ordered the Conair Super Clips.  </li>
            <li> Quick to heat up and</li>
            <li> I needed Conair SPC10R Super Clips to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> They create voluminous curls and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I quickly unplugged it.</li>
            <li> They heated quickly and were super velvety.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing my first set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> It takes practice to be able to use these properly, and yes the clips could be more convenient to use, but they are doable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set after reading many reviews on many different products.</li>
            <li> The rollers do heat up quickly and work</li>
            <li> Add curl or body to your hair in a quick fashion.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly         </li>
            <li> The set heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> The super clips work well once you figure out that the clips need to grap the hair closest to the head.</li>
            <li> They do curl hair, so that&#x27;s a point on their side, and they are quick to heat up -- to a burning temp.</li>
            <li> It does heat up quickly, as promised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped tremendously).  </li>
            <li> The claw clips I bought are the Conair SPC10X Super Clips.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;super jumbo\\&quot; curlers are cumbersom....</li>
            <li> and they heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also invested in the Conair SPC10X Super Clips, to use insead of the pins.  </li>
            <li> I like these rollers, but i would love them if they included 3-4 more rollers because 12 is not enough to do all my hair.</li>
            <li> have been using super jumbo velcro rollers after shampooing my hair - drying it and then setting - leaving them in as I do my makeup and then removing the rollers.  </li>
            <li> below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set comes with 6 jumbo rollers and 4 super jumbos.</li>
            <li> I bought these hot rollers after reading the reviews on Amazon and finding that they were higher rated than most.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and curl my hair well.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, but the clips don&#x27;t hold the curler in my hair, Consequently, I felt my ear and neck burning.</li>
            <li> The hair curled, but fell quickly.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and they don&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> Heat up quick, lots of volume and my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> Conair SPC10R Super Clips]]</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leave marks, and they hold the rollers in place far more securely.  </li>
            <li> It heated  quickly, in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> or \\&quot;Super Jumbo\\&quot;, they are not.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, but the clips do not stay on.  </li>
            <li> for a quick fix or shorter hair i would use the 5 roller travel set.</li>
            <li> you turn it on, it has a mild plastic-y odor and it does steam up so</li>
            <li> I ordered plastic super clips and will update my review after I try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conair SPC10X 10 Super Clips] or [ASIN:B001DCE1JU</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 extra jumbo rollers from the company and they fit nicely in the container.</li>
            <li> My oldest has super strait hair and for hers it doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> If you purchase this set you need to buy the Conair SPC10X Super Clips (also sold on Amazon).</li>
            <li> This CHV14 heats up quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li> So I had to buy the Conair SPC10R Super Clips which do the job without denting my hair.  </li>
            <li> it heats up quick.  </li>
            <li> I like my older set better.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the Super Jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> And the bonus is that they do heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> and they are quick to heat up.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly which</li>
            <li> You can quickly put them in and take them out, with no hassle.</li>
            <li> but I find if you roll them quickly they don&#x27;t singe your fingers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using a curling iron takes me a hour if I&#x27;m lucky and keeps me attached to the sink.  </li>
            <li> I may try them one more time (3 is a charm) just to make sure that they don&#x27;t work, and then I am going to return them and buy a traditional 1\\&quot; curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, makes hair smoother.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Okay, now that I have been using hot rollers on my hair for almost 2 years, I thought I should give my opinion about these hot rollers and the metal pins that are included.</li>
            <li> but they fall out too quickly.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super nice..I would recommend them</li>
            <li> decided to go with these Conair Rollers, as they were flocked, jumbo, and heated quickly, like my Remington Pearls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love that this set includes different sized rollers to create a more natural-look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> After many years, I have finally retired my old hot rollers and am very glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I put them in, wait for them to cool after about 20 min., and I have the shiniest bouncy curls that are so pretty!</li>
            <li> easy to use and warms up fast, excellent for styling with little time highly recommend !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Earlier this year I decided that I wanted some of the vanity space back that was being taken up by the enormous footprint of my wonderful and beloved [[ASIN:B003V27RB4 Remington H9000 Pearl Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers]], which I had been using for over two years, and never had any issues with, other than the huge space they require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see people with gorgeous, full hair, and they don&#x27;t even have to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> and I think the rollers are too hot for my fine hair, but they are fun and quick to use.</li>
            <li> The rollers get very hot.  </li>
            <li> The ends get very hot and burn your scalp while are in.</li>
            <li> The rollers didn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hot curlers.</li>
            <li> Very hot to set hair</li>
            <li> The size of the rollers is good for long hair.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and were easy to use, even for someone who didn&#x27;t really know what she was doing.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Love the large size but the first day I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in.</li>
            <li> With these, the curls were soft, extrememly easy to use and lasted all day!  </li>
            <li> I would love for my hair to have more body, but this is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> These are really good if you have long hair!</li>
            <li> Maybe I should experiment more, or just get some new clips.</li>
            <li> I love the new \\&quot;straighter\\</li>
            <li> Today, I went to Walmart (which I abhor) and purchased a brand new set, I made sure the box was unopened before I purchased.  </li>
            <li> They give wonderful waves without looking like you tried too hard!</li>
            <li> First, the cloth cover of the roller makes it slide right through my hair (which is somewhat fine in texture.)</li>
            <li> These hot rollers really work like magic .</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and roll easily.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers they leave a full bouncy and soft look.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and cool pretty quick once shut off.</li>
            <li> My hair has a good bit of body and is shoulder length, thick, but very fine.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, fine hair that tends to get great, lasting curl from hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Not the fanciest hot rollers but perfect for a teen or someone who only uses them every so often.</li>
            <li> You will appreciate how much better the curls set when you give it just a little more time to heat up!      </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve always used hot rollers to \\&quot;uncurl\\&quot; our hair!</li>
            <li> I promise I don&#x27;t work for Big &amp; Sexy hair products!  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers are a godsend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done and pretty!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well they would work on long hair, but several review said that it did a great job</li>
            <li> later the body/waves in my hair looked even better and sexy than it did when I first styled it.</li>
            <li> I am sure there are other hot rollers on the market that would be a lot more convenient!</li>
            <li> You would think Conair would have enough experience to know better!</li>
            <li> I like that the rollers are 1.5 inches -- good for loose, bouncy</li>
            <li> They hold the best and are VERY hard to find.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and the flocked rollers are just the right size and don&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> To give some context, my hair is fine and pin straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the ConairPro Pro Clips with 2 other types of hot rollers and they worked great, so</li>
            <li> Rollers do heat up fast and the pins work just fine.</li>
            <li> I wish they were all Jumbo because the Super ones are really only good for  volume (you don&#x27;t get much curl from them) but</li>
            <li> Great for those days when my hair needs a little boost.  </li>
            <li> IONIC shine is optimum, the velvet flocking protective to the hair and just a handy set to have with all of the same sized rollers instead of having a bunch of loose rollers that you never use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine, and these rollers give it incredible body, yet not curly - just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> They work very well, however they give more of a body wave than a curl because the rollers are so large.</li>
            <li> Good, but only for a certain hair length.  </li>
            <li> The large size leaves nice natural curls.  </li>
            <li> The large ones are good but there are only 4.</li>
            <li> Of course, our hair does not come out curl free, but with nice gentle smooth loose curves.</li>
            <li> But overall, this is a very good set of big and jumbo rollers .</li>
            <li> Overall, my hair did turn out curly and looked nice, but the curls were a little kinky and with all the struggling with the rollers, it turned in to more of a 80&#x27;s Dynasty curl than a nice wave.</li>
            <li> she uses them everyday and they make her hair look great.  </li>
            <li> AND THIS HELPS TO CALM</li>
            <li> These rollers really help smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Work well but would be nice if they would add an extra clip.</li>
            <li> I only gave them 4 stars because the clips that hold them in aren&#x27;t totally effective</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO FUN to have my hair looking fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice looking curler set, but the actual job it does is not what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> rollers are nice and big and helps straighten my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones are nice</li>
            <li> To improve the design, Conair should make a hinge that will stay open when required, and a clear plastic top that will not crack on its own.</li>
            <li> Definintely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Liked the size of the curlers although the felt on each curler feels like it will come off after several uses</li>
            <li> I wanted them mostly to just add a soft \\&quot;Kardashian\\&quot; wave.</li>
            <li> Maybe, but they were barely warm enough to create a curl.</li>
            <li> The results after 10 minutes were nice, big curls.</li>
            <li> i have always wanted that sexy soft curl/</li>
            <li> wavy (most near the end of the hair)</li>
            <li> These sizes work great with my independent, unruly, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the clips - the old ones are better.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked is an automatic shutoff after a period of time.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot if it, so it is not the best set of rollers for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my old Conair rollers had seen better days.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about the clips as sometimes they leave marks on my hair</li>
            <li> They are too short to be effective.</li>
            <li> There are two size rollers in this set- big and jumbo, and each has its own sized pins.</li>
            <li> Although the box says it only takes 2 minutes to warm up</li>
            <li> And the clips work best going up under the curl, not from behind.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you leave them on until your hair has completely cooled or the curl will not hold or be as bouncy.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the clips, but they work</li>
            <li> They make nice big curls.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else was worth using.  </li>
            <li> I looked on utube, but couldn&#x27;t find anything useful.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT get warm enough!!!</li>
            <li> They bounce everywhere...on tile floors and granite countertops - fun, and boy can they hide.</li>
            <li> The rollers gave me a nice curl to the root and left me with a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> I also bought them because they come with the old fashioned metal clips which work so much better than plastic clamps.</li>
            <li> I did not have the significant problems that some experienced making the curlers stay in---but my hair is thick and medium-long.  </li>
            <li> These curlers heat up very quickly and are the normal warm-to-the-touch when putting them in.</li>
            <li> The unit did heat up quickly and didn&#x27;t seem to burn my hair although rollers were briefly hot to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit heats up pretty quickly -- within 3-4 minutes, the curlers are at maximum heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They get hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and stays hot.  </li>
            <li> While these rollers do heat up quickly, I found them to be too hot to use.  </li>
            <li> The rollers grip my hair unlike other types of rollers that are smooth, my hair just slips right off of those kind.  </li>
            <li> I bought the jumbo hair curlers as a quick and easy way to give my hair body during the busy morning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything aye or nay towards the dropping of curlers and how they don&#x27;t fit in just right afterwards, but I have noticed that there are certain ones that fit in certain spots better than others, so if you purchase these and are having difficulties putting them back in the slots, try moving them around before you give up and just try to force them in.    </li>
            <li> needs a hole to hold the hair clips but good product other then that.</li>
            <li> I think the suggestion that one other reviewer had, to wear a shower cap, is a good one.</li>
            <li> They get very hot, so hot</li>
            <li> These get very hot, &amp; work very well!  </li>
            <li> I love this things and highly recommend them to anyone who wants to be a curly girly.</li>
            <li> Everything else about the set is great--the right amount of the two sizes to suit me.</li>
            <li> I put curls in quotes because my hair does not turn out curly - but waves isn&#x27;t the right word either because waves makes me think of a perm.      </li>
            <li> and I think I made the right selection.  </li>
            <li> The roller just flipped right over the clip and fell out.</li>
            <li> right?).    </li>
            <li> you might need longer rollers (my hair is about 4 inches below my shoulder and fits just right)    </li>
            <li> it just never looks right.  </li>
            <li> GIVES MY HAIR LOTS OF BODY AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CURL</li>
            <li> Im rating 4 stars right now</li>
            <li> I think the &#x27;velvet&#x27; finish makes them just slide right out.</li>
            <li> My hair just unrolls right out of them.  </li>
            <li> It has taken some time to get the clip in there just right to hold the roller in my hair.</li>
            <li> look that is so in right now.  </li>
            <li> and they were right.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> Some times people want to over price things which isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, rolls up easily (doesn&#x27;t slip like old-school hot rollers used to), and stays on with the right hot roller clips.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and when I previously used the \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; kind of rollers they stayed in well.  </li>
            <li> so my hair falls out and its thining, I have tried every thing and these rollers make my short hair look full and healthy.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are a snap to use, don&#x27;t have to stay in my hair long at all to curl, and warm up quickly.  </li>
            <li> How To: Soft, Sexy Curls with Hot</li>
            <li> I honestly just think they don&#x27;t get hot enough for me.</li>
            <li> i unrolled probably after 15 minutes, and my hair had the soft big curls, super bouncy, loved it.</li>
            <li> They tame my frizzy hair and give me large beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more like clamps, so if you have fine hair, they will literally clamp wide ridges into the roots of your hair - exactly where you&#x27;re trying to create volume!</li>
            <li> I like to use a little hairspray at the roots and then some redkin curl starch (amazing stuff!)</li>
            <li> The case is nice and slim, the cord is a good enough length to be convenient, and in general the black and purple looks cute.  </li>
            <li> I have fine to medium straight hair, and think I need to experiment with different products to see if I can give my hair more texture before I put the curlers in.</li>
            <li> have medium length fine hair and have always found that electric curlers give me nice soft body in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Easy to clip on, but the roller has to be level on your head; otherwise the grip will not be secure enough to keep the hair or the roller in place.  </li>
            <li> If you order this product be sure to order the super clips at the same time.  </li>
            <li> They set quickly, and give you sexy waves and body that will last all day.      </li>
            <li> I feel like a super model with my big piles of lovely waves.</li>
            <li> If I were to make recommendations to the manufacturer, it would be to offer 6 (instead of 4) super jumbo curlers and make them larger and offer the remaining 6 (instead of 8)</li>
            <li> The four Super Jumbo rollers make spending time on my hair so much faster, it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> heated the rollers up for 10 minutes and used all the rollers to curl my combed,long, fine hair and let the rollers cool before removing them; my hair curled up in big wavy curls that I quickly covered in hairspray.</li>
            <li> These curlers heat quickly, are large in size, and work well.</li>
            <li> Very easy, heats up fast, and seems to be very durable so far!</li>
            <li> This product is good if you are looking for very loose large curls.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and you don&#x27;t have to leave them in for long in order to get nice soft curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and comes to about the middle of my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> This is the only set that I have seen that comes with super jumbo sized rollers (over 1.5\\&quot;) which is really great for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> The case is a little smaller than I was expecting, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> An important tip when using any hot roller is to make sure your hair is completely dry before using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as I practice with them a little more things will improve.</li>
            <li> I have been using Conair&#x27;s older model with large rollers similar to this one and have loved them.  </li>
            <li> I love the size of these rollers they are perfect for long thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have a set of VS hot rollers that are not covered, and my hair slips right off of them.     </li>
            <li> #3: plenty of curlers, all one size (large!).  </li>
            <li> You have to attach it exactly the right place for it to hold.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, because she really wanted a quick alternative to a curling iron, something she could leave in her hair while she does her make-up.</li>
            <li> While these do heat up quickly they do not work very well.</li>
            <li> Super fast heating time.</li>
            <li> The super jumbo size rollers work very well for both.  </li>
            <li> it shows the curls on the bottom if your going for easy and soft curls</li>
            <li> But these curlers gently (and quickly) style my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> it would have been a better product if they left the super jumbos out of the case and added more regular jumbo curlers.    </li>
            <li> the curl stays but its the messiest curl near the root or its completely straight up top and curled at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used them a few times, but have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Well,I&#x27;m glad they were not expensive because I barely get a wave!Guess</li>
            <li> I got a package of 10 for less than $10 and they do a good job of holding the curlers and not leaving a mark.</li>
            <li> These rollers really do heat up quickly as claimed, under 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way down, no longer horizontal, but becoming more vertical.&lt;br /&gt;Solution?  </li>
            <li> these curlers worked great- nice and soft and made my hair nice and soft with big silky bouncy curls- just a dream to run my fingers through or walk down the street looking side to side with my big soft bouncy curls bouncing off of the top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, heat quickly, and provide a natural loose curl look.</li>
            <li> The larger size is perfect for adding body and volume, plus they heat up in less than a minute!  </li>
            <li> I have tons of very fine wavy hair and smaller hot rollers make me look like an elderly poodle.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair and was very excited to receive this product.  </li>
            <li> They get super hot super fast and work really well.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it four stars is although the curls are beautiful, they don&#x27;t seem to stay for very long.</li>
            <li> and it gives me the kind of loose curl that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> And its very fast.  </li>
            <li> Perfect number of rollers not too big not too small great for small storage spaces  </li>
            <li> and it also did heat up very fast, but.....</li>
            <li> Very fast heat up.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> Great rollers, less damage to hair and awesome for my long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> But on the bright side they are made well and when I want just a little wave</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference if you really let them heat up for a good 8 minutes, yes, they are hot after 2 or 3 minutes, but you notice that they get hotter as you are using them up, causing one side to have tigher curls than the other, so just plug it in while you are blow drying or doing your makeup.  </li>
            <li> The rollars are fine in that they heat up fast and do what they are supposed to do, but those clips leave huge dents in my hair that do not come out until the next washing.  </li>
            <li> The little metal clips that come with it hold pretty good</li>
            <li> There are 8 large rollers and 4 super large rollers.  </li>
            <li> Love the two different sizes.</li>
            <li> The curlers seem pretty durable (as I just got them and already dropped one on the tile...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers on a regular basis for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Once rollers are heated leave the top open.  </li>
            <li> but the rollers are so incredibly HOT to the touch (of both fingers and scalp) that they heat up the clips to the point of singeing hair and skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was as straight as ever!      </li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers and just tried them today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Especially on the top of your head...</li>
            <li> When she told me hot rollers, the memories of my repressed childhood nightmares came to mind.</li>
            <li> so I find it most difficult to achieve the perfect curl (and actually last all day)</li>
            <li> They get way too hot sometimes.</li>
            <li> The last set I had got so hot and overheated that the top melted and the plastic part of the curlers literally liquified.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers don&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> This is the first set I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> The hot rollers I received came with wire clips.</li>
            <li> I had been concerned about whether I had time for hot rollers, but it takes me maybe 5  minutes to insert them.</li>
            <li> FAST!    </li>
            <li> They are plenty hot by that time.</li>
            <li> but these work really well!</li>
            <li> How are you supposed to use them if the rollers themselves get so hot?     </li>
            <li> The first time I used them I got compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> They do exactly that</li>
            <li> This would seem obvious to most people.  </li>
            <li> Ends are too hot to touch and they burn my scalp unless I pad with cotton squares.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s back to wearing 5 jumbo velcro rollers overnight on top of my head</li>
            <li> The curlers get extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> I really like these!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe the frustration that comes with this is worth that much money.</li>
            <li> I love the big rollers.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly pleased with my recent purchase of the Conair Jumbo-Sized Heat Rollers.  </li>
            <li> By the time I finished rolling my hair, the rollers were so hot as to burn my hands.</li>
            <li> so i need to leave hot rollers in a bit longer than shorter-haired people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> i have super curly hair, but fine, not coarse</li>
            <li> I had this problem with my old set and must admit that I see a big improvement with far fewer split ends and frizzy fly away strands.</li>
            <li> Having watched my mom use hot rollers as a child, the clips were no mystery to me, and the product is well priced on Amazon.      </li>
            <li> I LOVE it and constantly get complements on my hair</li>
            <li> Funny thing, I roll 90% on my hair UP on the rollers,  not under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen similar sets for $50 and more.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering Conair&#x27;s smaller rollers for when I want more curl.  </li>
            <li> I believe that there are better quality product out there for the same price.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any discomfort using it, it was not that hot at all.</li>
            <li> , they do work and give volume, but you better get some hair spray (or the curls last like 10 minutes)!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s almost too hot to hold them.  </li>
            <li> With each bunch of hair that I gather to put in a roller, I spray it first with \\&quot;Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> - Once I get all of the rollers out, I will spray it with \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair Spray &amp; Play Volumizing Hairspray\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing &amp; Texturizing Powder\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Bought these because I wanted the hot roller effect, but not 1980&#x27;s prom hair...</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had almost given up on curling my hair until I heard about using hot rollers.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what these do.</li>
            <li> So I bought the hot rollers a couple days ago.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use the rollers for the first time over the weekend.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Bouncy hair using hot rollers.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used conair hot rollers for about 15 years.  </li>
            <li> but that was most likely a shipping problem.</li>
            <li> I started the process over and heated the curlers up again, left them in a long time, took them out and they looked great, for another 45 minutes.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is just my hair type since my curling iron has the same affect.  </li>
            <li> I used to use my mom&#x27;s hot rollers from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the rollers and I ordered extra</li>
            <li> The rollers get pretty hot but they ARE called Heat Rollers</li>
            <li> Before my first use, I practice rolling my hair and securly getting the clip on.  </li>
            <li> So I began thinking what about hot rollers again and did research here on Amazon.....</li>
            <li> I really like that they are economical and they heat up fast!  </li>
            <li> I have always used hot rollers, never a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HEAT SET OF HOT CURLERS TO MY CLOSEST FRIENDS AND SISTERS.ALSO</li>
            <li> They took forever to heat up, they are almost too hot to hold while trying to wrap your hair around them and</li>
            <li> I am returning these and will never buy hot rollers again.</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions exactly, even looking up videos on You Tube for suggestions on how to achieve the look I wanted, but every time I tried them, my hair didn&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday at Walmart and tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Much better deal for the same item</li>
            <li> Look for hot rollers that have a claw to hold the curler in place as this product does not and doesn&#x27;t keep curler in place.  </li>
            <li> I really love these rollers, and I would totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and it was very helpful!  </li>
            <li> Also the edges and the clips also heat up - but way too hot for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the remington h-1015 hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them my hair came out with no curl.  </li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for over 15 years now, so</li>
            <li> The downside is that it&#x27;s difficult to get the hair on the roller itself (and keep it on while trying to roll it up) and the pins that keep them on get hot themselves from the heat of the roller and aren&#x27;t the greatest at keeping attached.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the clips that came with it, but Conair also sells clips for hot curlers.   </li>
            <li> No waiting around for 10-15 minutes for the rollers to get hot.  </li>
            <li> The rollers were not too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair OVER curled, like a hot curler might do sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of clip years ago with my first set of hot rollers, and did not have this problem with the clips.  </li>
            <li> the edges are plastic and will be quite hot to the touch , just bearable.</li>
            <li> I have never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li> But like I said it was my first time.</li>
            <li> And the price was really a steal too!</li>
            <li> (And yes, I did notice that they were way too hot to hold on the plastic ends).    </li>
            <li> I bought this product tonight and just used the hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I have never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li> These are the first hot rollers I&#x27;ve bought in years.</li>
            <li> (People are amazed when I tell them my smooth hair is actually naturally curly.)  </li>
            <li> I first tried this product when my hair was curly</li>
            <li> first set of these rollers arrived, but I had to return them because they were damaged.  </li>
            <li> Despite the concerns expressed by others, I went ahead and purchased these since I needed some large/jumbo hot rollers to help de-frizz/straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> : rollers are hot to touch and the pins are a struggle.</li>
            <li> Too hot on the scalp.</li>
            <li> but without the felt became too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> Once, the heated rollers were so hot it almost burnt my scalp.</li>
            <li> First off, these aren&#x27;t the rollers to use if you want curls.  </li>
            <li> It arrived timely and is exactly as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well.</li>
            <li> All in all, I do really like what they do for my hair!</li>
            <li> Just remember it&#x27;s really hot on metal bars.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and curly hair and these work so great.  </li>
            <li> They heat up fast!  </li>
            <li> I ordered two of the hot collers</li>
            <li> After having luck with a pervious set of Conair hot rollers I decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> The first time these rollers were shipped, I thought an error had been made.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a better guide&#x3D;&#x3D;albeit a simple one, would help users with this product.</li>
            <li> I add a product like Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing (or a spray-on heat protector) to my hair first and then roll my hair.</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> I am thinking of returning these hot rollers because they are so hot that they burn my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten SO MANY compliments and they only take like 10 minutes to put in</li>
            <li> There is no storage spot that I could locate for the pins, so I just threw them in a cute tray next to the rollers on my countertop.</li>
            <li> and it is too hot on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Overall, the curlers are ok.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I get the exact curls I want...</li>
            <li> Burned my fingers, burned my scalp, and too much curl!</li>
            <li> Basically, just too hot.</li>
            <li> My first time buying hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Personally I love big curls.</li>
            <li> I spritzed hair spray all over after blow drying, let curlers get hot</li>
            <li> They get so hot</li>
            <li> Hi,  I bought the hot rollers for my daughter and she loves them.  </li>
            <li> These curlers are way too hot.</li>
            <li> I like them alot though sometimes they got too hot and burned my head.</li>
            <li> When I first got these this summer</li>
            <li> After 1 use, I decided I needed smaller rollers just for the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> The curlers will get hot</li>
            <li> If you use curlers on top of your head (from the forehead back to the top-middle)</li>
            <li> These do get EXTREMELY hot - to the point that my scalp and forehead were burned by them.  </li>
            <li> and they work really well!  </li>
            <li> And, get the Chi Silk Fusion to use with the hot rollers...</li>
            <li> This product gave me exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for years</li>
            <li> I get SO many compliments when I actually take the time to put them in...</li>
            <li> The rollers get hot</li>
            <li> and they get hotter, unlike the plastic one that get just so hot &amp; no</li>
            <li> but they almost get too hot.  </li>
            <li> How do you manage this hot curler in your hand?</li>
            <li> it is way too hot.</li>
            <li> Sizes are great if you don&#x27;t really use the small ones.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Conair hot roller clips along with this product.</li>
            <li> Fast!</li>
            <li> This products does exactly what is promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hot rollers before but not like this, the rubber ones that fold over....</li>
            <li> But what i&#x27;m most upset about is the fact that I can get the same roller set, for a cheaper price with CLIPS....</li>
            <li> The rollers get pretty hot, I&#x27;ve burned my finge, so I would definetly recommend the plastic clips you can purchase in addition.</li>
            <li> It has gotten &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; since the first one I bought.  </li>
            <li> These got me into using hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Hair looks good for the first few hours</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work very well in keeping the rollers in place !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do what I like first.  </li>
            <li> The actual curlers work quite well, just be sure that you don&#x27;t use the seller Bargains AAA.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I still love Amazon and will continue to purchase from them, but not from Bargains AAA.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first two rollers were *</li>
            <li> I have used them everyday since receiving them for Christmas and everyone has commented on my gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li> too much trouble, so ordered the clips... need to figure that into your price, but still a good deal...</li>
            <li> Be aware, what they call jumbo are really the large size velcro and their super jumbo would equate to jumbo size in velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> They heat up quick and I love being able to put them up right after I&#x27;m done (they are not hot on the outside).  </li>
            <li> More importantly, I wanted volume and loose curls for my fine Asian hair that is mid-back in length.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying the conair SPC10R super clips.  </li>
            <li> I called Conair and they sent me wire clips which fit the jumbo rollers, but not the super jumbo which leaves me with 4 rollers which are unusable and 8 rollers aren&#x27;t enough to do my hair.</li>
            <li> It is easier to get tighter  fit and better results with less hair on the roller.</li>
            <li> First, I think it is important that I say that I have long, straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice, the machine heats up quickly, but the steel clips have a slick finish and slide right out of my hair causing</li>
            <li> If you have long hair you know how hard it can keep your hair from flattening out at the top, but these rollers did a great job.</li>
            <li> I ordered this model because of the good reviews but this machine is not for fine or thin hair textures which I have.  </li>
            <li> the smart clips that come with them won&#x27;t hold especially on the top of my head and they leave marks and dents.</li>
            <li> I took 4 of the large rollers from my most recent set of Conair rollers and put them in place of 4 of the jumbos in this set.</li>
            <li> You can buy them seperately - which I would recommend as they also hold the curler a little bit off your head which is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> They gave my thin hair, extreme volume, bounciness , shine and looks like my beautiful healthy hair has returned !</li>
            <li> I also loved that all the rollers were the same size and there were enough for my whole head!  </li>
            <li> Often on the top of my head, I feel like it&#x27;s a bit flat -</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to.. if I want tighter curls, I&#x27;ll stick with my flat iron :)</li>
            <li> If the hard top was replaced with a flexible material it would travel better.   </li>
            <li> I liked these rollers but they don&#x27;t heat up as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li> They added in four super huge rollers which really don&#x27;t do much because they are so big.  2)</li>
            <li> They get VERY HOT- much more so than any other</li>
            <li> It worked for many others, so you may want to give it a chance, but I much rather a regular curler!</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for someone with long hair and no bangs, therefore not needing the small curlers.</li>
            <li> Not only can this female look good wearing a trash bag</li>
            <li> For the life of me I cannot use a curling iron and my stylist is able to do these Victoria Secret model waves in my hair and I&#x27;ve been yearning to do this on my own.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to use the clips.  </li>
            <li> This product was just what I wanted big curls and they stayed curly all day and even the next day after using them my hair was still bouncy and looked good.  </li>
            <li> Brought this thinking wow nice big size curlers for nothing!</li>
            <li> They are big rollers, bigger than normal, so I love it!!</li>
            <li> so I have 12 large rollers hot.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use these hot rollers, I swear I will never use them again, and promise myself I am going to buy a new set immediately!!</li>
            <li> It comes out nice and smooth with big loose waves.</li>
            <li> I would LOVE these curlers (as they heat us fast and work well), except for one rather significant issue:  there is NO place to put the holders (whatever you use to hold the curlers down).  </li>
            <li> i love that they are flocked (with the velvet fabric over the roller for less damage) and how they get hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> They get hot very quickly, which is a big plus when you&#x27;re trying to get out in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the curlers and they become hot in minutes, all positive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hot and ready to go in seconds.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is very fine, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it is to set my hair with these.  </li>
            <li> Well i bought these because they were one of the top rated ones for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> I already have a Conair hot rollers (which I really like) with plastic clips the ones pictured on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would say this is a great buy especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried hot rollers before and really did my research before purchasing these.</li>
            <li> The Conair jumbo rollers are exactly what I needed and work very well.  </li>
            <li> straight so I opt for hot rollers.    </li>
            <li> My salon brand more expensive ones were getting old &amp; I lived the color of these conair ones but worried the reviews werent great</li>
            <li> These hot rollers work very well for my over shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I found that if you pinch them in a bit between the ends and the curve, they hold better, and so long as you push them through some of the hair that is wrapped around the roller, they will get the job</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here, and at first, the pins that everyone talks about drove me absolutely nuts.</li>
            <li> One thing that would be nice is some kind of container to hold the clips, but that&#x27;s the only negative thing I can say.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set last year and loved them so much, I ordered a second set.</li>
            <li> Also, it holds a curl for most of the day, but when I wake up the next morning, my hair will be pin straight again no matter how much hairspray I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - they heat up very fast (they get VERY hot), and because they&#x27;re large, they provide a lot of volume and wave, not little spiral curls that look unnatural.</li>
            <li> The look, size, pins - those are all just fine - but the rollers do NOT get HOT enough!</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use, I like the clips better, people complain about the clips not holding, but this is not true, just try to place the clip on a different angle</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it after about 2 tries, it will be so easy!</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to use as long as you do what the first reviewer Joanna suggested.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s worth paying for professional products because they really work better if you&#x27;re needing something specific.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good hot rollers that don&#x27;t create power-perm &#x27;80s \\&quot;Dallas\\&quot; style curls.</li>
            <li> The clips are easy but don&#x27;t hold super tight, which is fine since I want waves not tight curls.</li>
            <li> I was excited to have only JUMBO rollers to us for styling and more than only 6 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clips pop apart when dropped, and go back together easily.  </li>
            <li> I would secure one and when reaching for the next one, the first one would fall out.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to do -- and I&#x27;ve got two left hands</li>
            <li> Easy to use and store away for later.</li>
            <li> But even with half fell-out rollers, it still makes nice curls or waves.</li>
            <li> I certainly would NOT have ordered it.</li>
            <li> that they came in large sizes</li>
            <li> There are 8 medium size rollers and 4 large in this set so...</li>
            <li> I end up using two clips on certain areas of my head.</li>
            <li> Pros: Large roller sizes</li>
            <li> They are all large rollers, which is what we wanted.  </li>
            <li> I noticed some feedback about the metal roll clasps that come with them, they do stay in your hair, but you have to do it in a certain way.  </li>
            <li> The product has 4 jumbo, and 8 large rolls.  </li>
            <li> They are large, plasitc, hinged clips so storage is a pain as well, there is no storage for these clips on the set itself</li>
            <li> The large size also helps soften the curl.</li>
            <li> I wanted large rollers, but these are a bit large for my hair.  </li>
            <li> a set of electric rollers that were all large.</li>
            <li> I like the large size.  </li>
            <li> This is a true large roller set &amp; is perfect for longer thick heavy hair.</li>
            <li> All they did was make the very ends of my hair a little wavy, and didn&#x27;t do a thing to the top of my hair!  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that they come with the traditional wire clips vs. the new palstic clips.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, they&#x27;re only in large sizes for the sultry waves look, and holds your hair very well with the velvet coating.    </li>
            <li> I was looking for those loose Kim Kardashian/Jennifer Love Hewitt curls.</li>
            <li> I am new to rollers and I haven;t quite mastered getting the pins right each time.</li>
            <li> Second, while it has a light to let you know the unit is turned on, it doesn&#x27;t have any indicator light to let you know when the rollers are hot enough to use.</li>
            <li> I use a shampoo/conditioner that is not super moisturizing as this helps the curl hold better, and I end up with big, wavy curls that with hairspray stay in most</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair, but a ton of it -</li>
            <li> I had some relatively low expectations when I got this, as I have fine hair</li>
            <li> There is no on and off button, so it is not as safe as other hot roller sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses these (she has fine hair) to get the same effect but save time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer a steam set with more super larger rollers and smaller case.  </li>
            <li> I really like that they are large and jumbo.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a large curling iron but these are much easier and save me a lot of time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine but not thin, so I guess I&#x27;m putting enough hair on each curler</li>
            <li> I have superfine hair and need as much volume as possible.</li>
            <li> I was inspired by this amazing video on youtube where a girl uses these rollers, and her hair comes out shiny and well curled; I tried these curlers twice, and even left them in for 30 minutes, and I got some waves, but they only lasted an hour or so, even with use of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They heat up incredibly fast and have those metal clips instead of the plastic clamps that leave crimps in your hair.</li>
            <li> they are just too short to secure the roller because of the weight of the roller.  </li>
            <li> I think products should be ready to use out of the box</li>
            <li> These rollers work really well for me.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls fast too.</li>
            <li> She said that they heat up fast.</li>
            <li> My hair returned to its completely straight form within an hour.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to my cheap clairol \\&quot;Set</li>
            <li> - also being that my hair is straight as a board.</li>
            <li> Remove from the bottom hairline up gently turning the rollers with the curl as you unwind it.</li>
            <li> I have so much hair that I need two boxes of hair dye just to cover it all...  </li>
            <li> You really have to work fast.</li>
            <li> Really?     </li>
            <li> i.e. I secure a pin over a roller, move on to the next roll, and - swoosh!</li>
            <li> I reccomend these rollers highly!  </li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fast.</li>
            <li> However, when removing curler from hair the curler can get caught in hair and it is a real pain to get off.</li>
            <li> so no one really noticed except for me of course.</li>
            <li> I was ready to cut all my hair off, that&#x27;s how damaged my hair was....</li>
            <li> Sometimes I could get as many as three in if I was careful with my movements.</li>
            <li> but the wire clips that come with them alone have caused me so much frustration I can&#x27;t even put in words.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to leave them in for anytime at all.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li> i bought 2 sets to cover my whole head.</li>
            <li> The larger size of rollers leaves my past-shoulder-length hair wavy and smooth.      </li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviewer who linked to a how-to on Youtube.com</li>
            <li> Very well made product.</li>
            <li> They heat fast too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> I spray it on both sides of my hair as I hold it up getting ready to put it in the roller.  </li>
            <li> it looks MUCH thicker.    </li>
            <li> And, they really work.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really have bangs.  </li>
            <li> Fast.</li>
            <li> Also, got the jaw clips to use because they are just so much easier.</li>
            <li> &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; saying, but the reviews I read really helped in making my decision.</li>
            <li> I really did not know how to use the hooks that are to go over the rollers, and the instructions in the box are very unhelpful as they do not describe how to use them either.  </li>
            <li> They heat up fast.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m done blow drying my curlers are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> All I can report is that they do what is claimed at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> TO USE AND HEATS FAST.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly!</li>
            <li> These rollers did not curl my hair much at all.</li>
            <li> they do the job very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to just curl your hair with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s much cheaper online</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I found Target and Walmart sells them at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My hair has so much volume and curls really well.</li>
            <li> Rollers put a lot of curl in my straight, almost waist length</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t stay in well, so I&#x27;d recommend the plastic clips as others mentioned.</li>
            <li> The velvety covering really helps protect the hair.</li>
            <li> I love the shine it leaves in my hair and absolutely no frizz.</li>
            <li> When I unroll them my hair is totally straight except for the very end.  </li>
            <li> The clips are much easier to keep in place.</li>
            <li> and I really like this set.  </li>
            <li> do recommend the ConairPro Pro Clips, but highly discourage anyone to purchase these rollers! &lt;</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but it keeps my waves in without too much hair product.  </li>
            <li> The clips do not stay in my hair very well</li>
            <li> what I was doing, so I watched this video per another users suggestion and it really, really helped:    </li>
            <li> #2: they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> In that case, they do work very well and my hair will hold the \\&quot;body\\&quot; for almost a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might</li>
            <li> highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> They were ready to go in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up so fast</li>
            <li> I do take one set of these rollers on trips with me, and they do not take up that much space as they are very compact.  </li>
            <li> only thing I would change is that I wish the curler would light up when it is heated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the instructions went with my product because there was only one light bulb in there and the cover over it was orange anyway</li>
            <li> Does heat up fast, though.</li>
            <li> I get big, smooth bouncy curls instead of</li>
            <li> It really depends on what you like though.</li>
            <li> THANKS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to need to buy the claw ones because the ones that come just do not hold the rollers in very well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they&#x27;re tricky to get in properly and the rollers don&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, cut in a shoulder-length layered cut, and colored.  </li>
            <li> I have asian hair and it looks great in big big curls.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make your hair look really curly.</li>
            <li> Very maddening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely stunned that this product ever made it to the marketplace as it exists.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast, really fast, and don&#x27;t snag my hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> My hair is just below my shoulders and when I use these curlers my hair is very wavy.  </li>
            <li> but I can never game them to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Put these in, do makeup, put my outfit on and then its ready.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very helpful - heat them</li>
            <li> but it might be because my hair is really silky straight.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is gentle for my hair.</li>
            <li> They also work really well with the layers cut in my hair and really makes them stand out.</li>
            <li> They tend to leave a crease in my hair and do not hold the rollers in place while I am getting ready and eating breakfast.</li>
            <li> After you own for a few weeks all the smaller dollies melt and break and won&#x27;t fit in the slots.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is garbage</li>
            <li> they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was very helpful and offered to have me return the item to them for a refund, or I could keep it</li>
            <li> up fast..</li>
            <li> Fast thinking on the unplug reaction as well - I read how issues like this from Conair products develop into full-blown house</li>
            <li> Fast thinking on the unplug reaction as well - I read how issues like this from Conair products develop into full-blown house</li>
            <li> Very bummed.</li>
            <li> I really like using these rollers.</li>
            <li> I got them because my hair is really damaged from heat and rollers</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with the pins.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this kind of body forever, and finally got the guts to try these big rollers.  </li>
            <li> Just work out your natural part with your fingers only touching your scalp.</li>
            <li> so when I needed to replace my old set I purchased more of the same.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally use my flat iron and/or Instyler instead (when I have more time to fuss over my hair!)</li>
            <li> It didnt feel much hotter than normal hot rollers, but when I took them out of my hair I found that the plastic had melted, and the rollers were deformed.  </li>
            <li> After trying it a few times, I just gave up on it, and quite honestly, I dont even know where I stored it.</li>
            <li> The curlers burn your hands and head as you try and put them in place which would make you think you would end up with at least a good curl.  </li>
            <li> I also let the hot-curlers warm up for 20 minutes and tried it three times, and on the third try I left them in my hair for over an hour.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled with the rollers as she has smaller sized ones but wanted this size to make a different sized curl.</li>
            <li> It was easy to wrap my long hair onto it and used the large clips (sold separetly) to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the roller world, but although this product is exactly as described, it is way too much of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> I have long layered hair and this set is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to hot rollers, I didn&#x27;t find it too hard to put the rollers in, but I was sure stymied by that clip!</li>
            <li> Having naturally straight and flat hair, I would love a change with soft waves.</li>
            <li> I scoured the site for recommendations and these were pretty high plus a friend had an older version of the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin, and this is an easy way to add volume.</li>
            <li> I agree that the set heats up very fast, but I find that the rollers placed in last (that are a bit uncomfortable to handle because of the heat) set the best curls, so</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington&#x27;s heated rollers and I love them, but I have been wanting to have bigger rollers to create Victoria Secret models&#x27; big, beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> have long, straight, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered other clips and hope they will work better.  </li>
            <li> Also, it would be better if the heater had an auto-off (as some other models do).</li>
            <li> Finally, I was pretty surprised to discover that there is no place available on the unit designed to store the clips when the machine isn&#x27;t in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that I get sooooo sooooo many compliments about my hair.</li>
            <li> But I love them and have not found any other rollers that compare to this set.</li>
            <li> So glad I spent the money on these!</li>
            <li> Where it normally takes me 5 minutes to put them in my hair, it took triple the amount of time, more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.   </li>
            <li> I think there are other sets that may be much more</li>
            <li> My hair is really long and the big curlers allow me to curl my hair without having to double up the curlers which is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure I would buy again due to those factors.</li>
            <li> but because I have that much hair;) I love them and would recommend them to anyone I use both sets almost everyday.</li>
            <li> so I bought other ones that hold the rollers in place better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this set had the clips instead of jaw clamps, as other reviewers have said that the jaw clamps leave indents in the hair.</li>
            <li> They heat up in just a few minutes and are plenty hot enough to get the right kind of curl that you want.  </li>
            <li> She has very thick long hair &amp; says this is the best curl that she ever had.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me and have long, fine hair you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have long, below shoulder length hair, that is fine.  </li>
            <li> I have long baby fine hair that is layered</li>
            <li> For reference I have long hair that is on the fine side.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and fine so this is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair is a few inches past my shoulders and the size of the rollers were perfect for it</li>
            <li> They did produce nice big curls that lasted reasonably long, but with these clips they&#x27;re not usable.  </li>
            <li> I love having full, thick looking hair.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and are large enough to not cause frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> If this is your first time using hot rollers, I highly recommend watching this video as it shows you how to use them with the exact same set:</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for these.</li>
            <li> Also, I highly recommend purchsing separate clips because the ones that come with it don&#x27;t hold your hair very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Then I reach for a pin and get it on there all right, begin work on the next clump of hair when the first roller starts to creep</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so purchasing these rollers was worth it because I don&#x27;t have to spend 2 hours just making sure every strand in my hair is curled with a curling iron!</li>
            <li> These worked really well and heated up quickly, although there weren&#x27;t enough rollers to get all of my hair, so I had to buy two.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use the smart clips and the new rollers for a week but then gave up.  </li>
            <li> I honestly think that the people who gave this product bad reviews are just impatient and are expecting a perfect product, when one just does not exist in this category.</li>
            <li> I have long, superfine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after a few more tries I&#x27;ll master it,</li>
            <li> Point the clip prong end first directly at your scalp around the roller and then pivot the clip around the roller.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for full, extra body, soft looking hair, you need to buy these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> The KEY is HOW you position and roll your hair to get that full,  </li>
            <li> The rollers got far too hot for my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, but the hot rollers take about 20 minutes to get hot enough for the hair</li>
            <li> My hair has a pretty, soft curl</li>
            <li> have it still look \\&quot;done\\&quot; the next day after wearing it for a full day and sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave away all the old hot roller wire clips years ago...</li>
            <li> But I no longer liked that old style look, curls too tight, concerned about damage</li>
            <li> They work fine, and ultimately I like them so far, but</li>
            <li> work much better at keeping the roller and hair from hanging down.</li>
            <li> These curlers are perfect-- hot to the  touch in a minute or less, big enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li> My new rollers have disappeared into the cabinet underneath my wash basin!</li>
            <li> These products are a life saver (or will be, once this new baby is born!).    </li>
            <li> The pins were not long enough to keep the rollers in my hair, the rollers didn&#x27;t fit well on the hot metal bar.  </li>
            <li> First I would hardly call these rollers jumbo size, they are more like large size rollers</li>
            <li> , I still ended up with just slightly wavy hair and NO body nor curl at the top..</li>
            <li> I tried using more hair, less hair, etc</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is EVER SO SLIGHTLY DAMP before you use the curlers.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of the rollers, they are felt covered, helps hair stay and less damage to hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers do not provide a decent curl.  </li>
            <li> the Super Clips come in a set of TEN, although the roller set has TWELVE rollers).</li>
            <li> They are a disaster; I am using my older clips for a tighter hold.</li>
            <li> : The super jumber rollers (1.75\\&quot;) were too big for me</li>
            <li> I sent it back and am searching for something similar with more pros.</li>
            <li> I only wish it had more larger rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found letting the unit heat too long or leaving the rollers in too long produces not as nice results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never even heard of these Big &amp; Sexy products until the last couple weeks, and for those will bodiless hair - these are THE products to try!  </li>
            <li> so you just have to be careful and they leave a nice big curl.</li>
            <li> These have been great for my thick, mid lenth hair.  </li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and the curl lasts the entire day.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are much larger and they heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CHV14J Instant Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo-Sized</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and the directions say to keep them in only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried to use smaller Jumbo pin on Super Jumbo roller</li>
            <li> also run out of super clips and had to use metal ones fot last two rollers</li>
            <li> These are like the largest size in the classic three-size roller set my mom used.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer a few more to cover my whole head, but this is close.</li>
            <li> I have the older Conair  rollers, which did take longer.  </li>
            <li> I gave these a 4 star rating simply because I would rather have all Super Jumbo rollers, and am buying a product where I am wasting money on rollers I am not using.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and the sizes are the only ones you use anyway!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t particularly recommend these curlers.</li>
            <li> (I bought the separate Conair roller clamps - 10 pk - not enough for 1 of these sets) and more rollers (purchase a second set).</li>
            <li> There are lots of youtube tutorials on how to use this particular product.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase at Target, but this particular item was lower in price, so I purchase online instead.</li>
            <li> The older models ALL had a built in clip holder - and this model even has TWO sized clips.</li>
            <li> It does heat up faster than the older models, but again - doing away with the built-in clip holder is going to be a disaster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting plenty of time, they&#x27;re hot to the touch, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough to roll my hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this set, just wish I had gotten smaller ones.</li>
            <li> The rollers didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything but make my head warm and the little pokies ripped my hair out (youch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> The curlers are all big, with 8 large and 4 very large.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say you should wait until the light on the front of the case is white, indicating they are hot enough to use.</li>
            <li> The second thing is they get very hot at the ends</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast and holds the heat a long time.</li>
            <li> It did fall pretty easy after a few hours</li>
            <li> They take up so much room, that the only way to fit the next roller is to put the clip straight up away from your head.  </li>
            <li> if you know that your hair requires high heat, don&#x27;t be hasty.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting the suggested pro clips - as I resorted to mine to set my hair.     </li>
            <li> This seller sold them at a high price.</li>
            <li> they are flocked with velvet to avoid a high % of damage.however</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> The curlers do not reach a high heat, and therefore do not curl your hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super fine, nor is it super thick, it is just right in the middle, but apparently my hair is too \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; for the wire clips to hold the rollers in it.</li>
            <li> my old rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the manufactor created this clips to avoid other issues, but it just does not hold the curler to my head and my hair ends up frizzy within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; I think Conair would be smart to direct a customer to a video</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to complain when my hair has wound its way around these curlers a b&#x27;jillion times and come out gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t easily fall out like some other curlers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do get hot fairly quickly, but you need to get other clips to hold them on.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought these and wish for a great replacement.  </li>
            <li> They heat up fast and in 5 minutes you take them out and just run your fingers through or use a soft brush to style  your hair.</li>
            <li> (i do not blow out straight, just blow it to natural curls, then set).</li>
            <li> I am using the clips from the old set which work very well on these.</li>
            <li> They fly off, don&#x27;t hold the hair, totally useless.   </li>
            <li> overall, they are worth every penny and it makes difficult hair look great.  </li>
            <li> These do not heat up as fast as the old ones.  </li>
            <li> The big rollers smooth out my coarse, frizz-prone hair really well.</li>
            <li> The idea is great, but for someone who normally has no problem with getting curls to stay, these were sorry.</li>
            <li> Curlers are covered with a soft velvet material which is gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a ton of bounce, volume and a soft wave that frames my face and really makes my layers stand out.  </li>
            <li> Plus I am constantly complimented on my hair and find that these fit in really well with a low maintenance routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long hair and would love some rollers that would allow me to add volume and curl under the ends without creating massive curls.  </li>
            <li> other wise the curler would drop due to gravity.  </li>
            <li> It takes some practice to use the pins, especially for someone like myself, who doesn&#x27;t have much experience with using hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> If you leave them on for a long time before using them, it does get pretty hot.  </li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve used a few more rollers to set all of my hair... had to finish the look with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid heavy hair sprays, but maybe I need to use more to get the curls to hold longer.    </li>
            <li> In fact, it pretty much straightened it; which was the opposite of the look I was trying for.</li>
            <li> I have tried these rollers a few times and I really love them.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different sets of hot rollers recently, and I love these ones.   </li>
            <li> And lastly, they don&#x27;t really get that hot.</li>
            <li> They are heavy and it takes many adjustments to try and keep them in place.</li>
            <li> Definitely get hot fast.</li>
            <li> I normally can even get away</li>
            <li> I used to not be able to get all of my hair in the rollers in one round.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really thick, super fine, and wavy.  </li>
            <li> , I just didn&#x27;t notice as I put them in and apparently there was a surge of heat through this unit as I was wrapping those first two rollers into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I just didn&#x27;t notice as I put them in and apparently there was a surge of heat through this unit as I was wrapping those first two rollers into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the current pins provided do not hold roller in place very well, and sometimes you end up having to use two pins ( which lengthens the whole process! )</li>
            <li> But other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> I couldnt do ANYTHING with my hair for volume due to it being baby fine</li>
            <li> Other than that the product woks fine.</li>
            <li> Well the rollers weren&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;Jumbo and Super Jumbo&amp;#34; but I did curl my entire head and still have one roller left.</li>
            <li> I truly can&#x27;t live without them, especially if I&#x27;m flying across the country for business, fun, etc.  </li>
            <li> Great for bad hair days or when you need a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Your hair MUST be blown dry and even better if it was not recently washed.</li>
            <li> Luckily my hair was not fried completely, but it did take about a week of conditioning treatments daily to repair the damage.    </li>
            <li> &quot; position is to the left, kind of odd for a product sold in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> The pins work just fine, but they do not get hot enough to make a lasting curl that is worth the effort or the money spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to be aware that these cause BIG, LOOSE curls (that stay, if your hair is like mine, and you do what I suggested).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand these rollers, and they&#x27;re going back right away.</li>
            <li> I have a shoulder length bob hairstyle and These larger rollers give it just the right amount of body for this style.</li>
            <li> These could be considered large and extra large .... \\&quot;Jumbo\\</li>
            <li> I am keeping the product because I like the large and extra large rollers.</li>
            <li> They very quickly sent me a new one, but it was THE SAME LESSER MODEL.    </li>
            <li> Dear Conair: What took you so long to make super jumbo rollers?  </li>
            <li> and i got the hang of these after a couple tries, though my hair still managed to look pretty decent after the first try.  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers are unusable - it is not possible to set a heat setting so they get too hot to handle very quickly; the clip to hold the roller in the hair is too flimsy to work, even if two are used, so the only way to really use the rollers is to simply hold it in place manually for several minutes and hope it takes.</li>
            <li> no matter how many times i mess with these curlers it just doesnt hold!</li>
            <li> The 12 BIG rollers add a nice bouncy wave (as opposed to tight curls) to my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I had the other Conaire hot rollers in the multiple sizes but wanted the large and jumbo size for more volume and larger curls.</li>
            <li> I sure wish that Conair had included hinge clips with this set; the pins are practically useless for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased these largely because of a video review of this set on YouTube; a major selling point for me was the clips shown (with a hinge).  </li>
            <li> Firstly, the the metal U-pins my set came with did absolutely nothing to hold the roller in my hair and were a wonky fit on the barrel itself.</li>
            <li> While this causes endless entertainment for my cat, it&#x27;s not so fabulous for my coiff.</li>
            <li> With almost-shoulder length curly but frizzy hair (not pretty), I needed something to smooth and defriz for 48hours.  </li>
            <li> I love these rollers because I have long hair and the rollers are big which make soft curls.</li>
            <li> The curls are not tight they fall more like waterfall curls (unless you want tight curls)</li>
            <li> The size of the curlers are awesome if they did get hot enough, I&#x27;ve even tried using less hair in each section even though I have thin hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a new set of clips soon.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a problem at all with this new set.</li>
            <li> The problem are the new clips that come with the set.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> but seems to live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> it may be the new technology.</li>
            <li> But I noticed that NONE of the new curler sets had the pins but new type of clips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m either going to buy a new set of rollers or look for a clip that clips easier.</li>
            <li> so I bought this new set.  </li>
            <li> so I guess Goodwill get a new set.  </li>
            <li> May be time to order a new set.</li>
            <li> BUT, this new set heats up in seconds.  </li>
            <li> Cant live without them</li>
            <li> The curl lasts twice as long if the rollers are allowed to cool completely before removing.     </li>
            <li> The rollers have a big slot running through the middle of them so that they fit over the heating element</li>
            <li> Also, I heard the pink, regular sized rollers have a better outcome.</li>
            <li> The plastic clips hold it in one place and fit both the bigger and the smaller rollers!</li>
            <li> I waited and waited for the red light to go off, then reread it and realized one of the rollers has a tiny dot that turns off.</li>
            <li> I just dry my hair quickly and pop these rollers in.  </li>
            <li> After trial and error, I discovered that if I let the curlers heat up for about 10 minutes (rather than the two that are advertized), I end up with fantastic curls that will last until the next time I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> But the rollers will work very well and heat up extremely fast so overall</li>
            <li> I am an absolute glamour girl, to the core, and have had hot rollers in my life for as long as I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do not stay hot for long, once on the hair, and the clips are absolutely junk.</li>
            <li> These heat up pretty quickly and are a good size but the clips are tragic.  </li>
            <li> - this gives me a very natural, up-to-the-minute look.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get all my hair in the 12 rollers with my first try and with my second try</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t mind overlooking the fact that some team in Conair R&amp;D clip department must have been sleeping on the job and you are willing to find another solution for the clips and you are looking for big curls, these may be for you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy them at first, but went back and purchased them after one use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those of us with long hair who are frustrated with the small size rollers that come in most hot roller sets.  </li>
            <li> Other than that they work as well as any others and they are larger than most.  </li>
            <li> The product that came is the same set, but I got regular U-clips which I have never had success with!  </li>
            <li> &quot; look, as i&#x27;ve never really been able to get the look i want from using a blow dryer or flat iron to straigthen my hair.</li>
            <li> I like these because I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out and dont want alot of curl like the smaller hot rollers gives my hair.</li>
            <li> If you want a basic hot roller that does the job, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> back first and work my way up.  </li>
            <li> and they just are never hot enough to do more than put a fuzzy dimple in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the travel set (five rollers), but they don&#x27;t get as hot and there aren&#x27;t enough rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted \\&quot;hot rollers\\&quot; for several years.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when they get too hot it sometimes hurts your skin, but usually it&#x27;s not a problem</li>
            <li> First the hinge broke on my current one, and then the plastic itself.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to roll up successfully.</li>
            <li> With these, the curls are soft, and lasted all day!</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> So I finally ordered this set of hot rollers after wanting them for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who is looking for larger hot rollers.</li>
            <li> As a tip to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know how to use the two different sized rollers... larger rollers go on the top part of your head, and use smaller rollers on the sides.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for BIG hot rollers, this is the set for you.</li>
            <li> so it anchors the hair supporting it from the bottom of the individual roll.    </li>
            <li> Also, these curlers do get pretty hot, so be careful when handling them!</li>
            <li> But in the end when I took them out i had much more volume than usual and some wave.</li>
            <li> I had my first set for about 10 years, as they simply don&#x27;t wear out.  </li>
            <li> Another plus was that the set heated up instantly and the rollers weren&#x27;t unwieldy or too blazing hot to handle.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for any curls to stay.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and I would recommend it to anyone wanting lasting curls.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and have tried several different rollers and these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I first bought the Xtreme Instant Heat(tm)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had different hot rollers before</li>
            <li> The curl never lasts more than an hour or 2, even with excessive hair spray.</li>
            <li> I recently had to retire a set of Conair hot rollers...</li>
            <li> But the barrels don&#x27;t get hot enough to maintain the curls.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> These do not get hot enough to set a curl.  </li>
            <li> these are blacklisted as far as i am concerned.!</li>
            <li> These curlers do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> The rollers are way too hot next to your scalp and if a roller touches your ear</li>
            <li> but the rods that hold them in place get extremely hot, to the point I actually have to lift the roller off my scalp for relief.  </li>
            <li> Soft, strokeable voluminous hair!</li>
            <li> I kept the curlers in for about 25 minutes, and when I took them out, my hair was exactly the same.</li>
            <li> had tried about 6 different hot roller sets</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this model!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough, either.  </li>
            <li> It took me about an hour to do the first two, but after I educated myself, it took about 10 minutes to redo my entire head.</li>
            <li> Get just hot enough, but not super hot, they cool down too quick.</li>
            <li> This is important because at first I only did one side, and I also tried using less of the spray.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a curling iron &amp; good hot rollers are not easy to find in stores except for the small size.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, so if my hair can&#x27;t hold the \\&quot;super jumbo\\&quot; roller...not many others could.  </li>
            <li> The clips were fine, held tight, however there&#x27;s NO place to &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; them.</li>
            <li> i have long hair (right up to the tops of my breasts)</li>
            <li> You have to purchase clips separately or use some from previous sets hoping they fit the jumbo roller.  </li>
            <li> Leaving the top closed while heating for long periods of time</li>
            <li> This takes less than 10 minutes of effort on my part and gives me a fabulous every day look.</li>
            <li> These absolutely would not stay in my hair which is pretty thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I immediately pictured that family photo where my mother fixed my hair in hot rollers only to have my bob look like a mushroom.</li>
            <li> jumbo and super jumbo clips are much harder to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as expected and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Pros:  12 very large rollers, heats up quickly, stays hot, rollers easy to handle, works well to de-frizz thick &amp; wavy hair, left hair smooth  Cons: because rollers are so large, difficult to keep on head, had to use clips (purchased separately) wire clips don&#x27;t hold roller, even using big plastic clips had to roll a section 3 or 4 times to get roller positioned right for clip to hold  Overall:  </li>
            <li> I returned to my very old Conair Travel set of 5 Jumbo rollers with my old fashioned metal clips.  </li>
            <li> I love finally finding hot rollers that are large enough for my longer hair as large roller sets are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I personally like their rollers that have the actual hinged clips (easier to secure, slide less), but I like having more than 5 rollers (my hair is long).</li>
            <li> I used to curl my hair with a flat iron and self grip rollers, basically warming up sections of hair, then rolling them, so I decided to get a set of hot rollers to make the process easier.</li>
            <li> Really  excided to get these jumbo rollers  only to find out they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Do be careful not to touch any of the metal parts as they do get very hot.</li>
            <li> I like to set my hair and walk away to do other things while they cool in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was actually fed up with the previous model, which did a lovely job until I broke the lid.</li>
            <li> The clips simply do not hold the roller in place - let alone the larger super jumbo roller.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Arrgh, anyway, I don&#x27;t know how to get big bouncy (and quickly styled hair) without having giant can rollers and a blow dryer</li>
            <li> .Arrgh, anyway, I don&#x27;t know how to get big bouncy (and quickly styled hair) without having giant can rollers and a blow dryer</li>
            <li> clamps\\&quot; that hold the roller and hair in tight secure place.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the set of hot rollers hoping to find an easier/quicker way than a curling iron to smooth out my naturally curly hair and add back some curl after blow drying it with a round brush.     </li>
            <li> My previous set of Conair hot rollers was pretty similar to this one except all of the curlers were the large size</li>
            <li> The disappointment comes in that the rollers just don&#x27;t get hot enough to make good lasting curls (they are limp at best) - and with my hair being so fine and usually curling too much - I can&#x27;t imagine that they would work very well on someone&#x27;s hair that is thick or coarse.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and have always had trouble creating volume.</li>
            <li> like everyone else said, the slot on the roller leaves crimps and the dumb metal clips they give you do not keep the rollers taut enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with the pins that come with these rollers, it is worth the cost, in my opinion, to order the Conair super clips/ pro clips (multiple purpose clips)</li>
            <li> but please keep in mind that the hair pins come in two different sizes (one for the jumbo and one for the large rollers).</li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve purchased only had three or four large rollers.  </li>
            <li> only needed the large and extra large roller size so this was</li>
            <li> the little indicator dot on the one roller is accurate).</li>
            <li> After reading previous raves on this product, I was so excited to buy it.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have pins and hinged clips from other roller sets (also Conair)</li>
            <li> I mean thirteen years ago we didn&#x27;t have Ipods, super colliders and bedazzlers, surely something as simple as big bouncy curls</li>
            <li> B00005A441 Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]]    </li>
            <li> Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]]</li>
            <li> It heats up in about 5 minutes (when the red spot on the large roller turns white then its ready), I set my hair (7 minutes), do my makeup, eat breakfast, then take them out</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased this set, based not only on near-stellar reviews but because of the high temp max (compared to other sets) which is necessary for my fine hair to achieve a decent curl.</li>
            <li> You should now have a wide row of hair on top - sort of like a wide mohawk...</li>
            <li> Overall a great product, Conair has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> I normally curl my hair with a Hot Tools 1 1/4 inch barrel curling iron and have NO problem getting curls to stay all day , with a spritz of hair spray, not much at all.</li>
            <li> The clips that come with the rollers work really well in keeping the rollers in your hair - however, for my hair they left indentions.  </li>
            <li> They are equivalent to the old curlers from the &#x27;70s..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m too busy</li>
            <li> What the roller giveth, the clip completely taketh away.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and must find a separate container to hold the pins.      </li>
            <li> The clips that come with these are a complete joke.  </li>
            <li> This design as been around for at least 30 years and requires more functionality.</li>
            <li> You must also wait until the rollers have completely cooled before taking them out.  </li>
            <li> You really have to play with it, especially on how to pin them to stay on your head.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have to use the old clips from my old curler set, but I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> I really like these because they are \\&quot;big only\\&quot; rollers &amp; I can use all of them.  </li>
            <li> If not, I will be scouring the internet looking for those old curlers with the metal pin.</li>
            <li> These rollers gave me bouncy soft curls that lasted for days.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> So, about the time I&#x27;m ready to use them, I&#x27;ll open the lid for a minute or two before using them, and it helps not burn my fingers.    </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried different hairsprays, and for whatever reason, they really don&#x27;t work as well.)    </li>
            <li> They just give a whole lot of body and big curls.  </li>
            <li> Not a waste of money, but not a hair miracle either....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate it a whole 5 stars simply because of the \\&quot;clips\\</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Now I am getting ready to order my 3rd set</li>
            <li> My stylist told me to buy a hot roller set for my long layered hair.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve found works really well is to roll up your hair and put the pin in horizontally, then turn it up parallel with your scalp.</li>
            <li> I remember and used the old style Clairol electric, steam rollers and making what I called &amp;#34;pageant hair&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> And even without using styling products my hair is soft and wavy, not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and bouncy after each use.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I didn&#x27;t think the clip was holding very well, but I left the rollers in for twenty minutes and none of them fell out any sooner.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get a crimp in my hair from the clips, but that seems to happen only when the clip is very close to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> They give soft curls without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> First: My hair is about 2 inches below my bra strap-I have fairly long hair.    </li>
            <li> i never went near rollers before</li>
            <li> you can go for the va-va-voom or natural look with these.  </li>
            <li> (i have an old remington est</li>
            <li> So naturally I went looking around on the internet trying to figure out how to use these rollers and found this video on youtube.     </li>
            <li> , there wouldn&#x27;t be enough rollers to cover a whole head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I did the straight thing for a while, and have recently started venturing into the world of curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and these rollers keep the frizz from taking over.  </li>
            <li> Considering either buying different types of clips or just returning the whole thing.</li>
            <li> but so far I have not found anything that keeps a curl in her hair.</li>
            <li> -- I had hair like The Venus De Milo or a young Bridget Bardot frolicking on the beach in St Tropez.</li>
            <li> they are soft</li>
            <li> The one listed above I received does not have an on/off switch on the unit, which is a real inconvenience to have to plug and unplug each time I use it.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not curl nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> Soft waves.  </li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot rollers for a long time.</li>
            <li> The rollers heated promptly and I like the look of the soft curls that are the result of using these rollers</li>
            <li> I had another Conair set that I bought around 1990 that was still working, but old and breaking apart, so I decided to replace it.  </li>
            <li> they were about 10 years old and the flocking was coming off.</li>
            <li> so my curls would look natural and have lots of body.</li>
            <li> and I really needed something to give me big curls.</li>
            <li> The shipping, however, was very speedy, so they get an extra star for that.</li>
            <li> The pins do not hold the rollers in place and they frequently pop off and shoot across the room.  </li>
            <li> The ones they come with are the old wire ones that do not hold some hair types.</li>
            <li> I use them nearly every day.  </li>
            <li> Soft roller coating doesn&#x27;t burn your hair.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Then when you finally get them to stay, after much frustration, they poke at your scalp to the point where it is unbareable for them to remain in any longer.</li>
            <li> Actually I haven&#x27;t used this that much since I bought.</li>
            <li> Overall though, I am very, very satisfied and these TOTALLY beat using a traditional curling iron on long hair to get the same results.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, so I did not have enough rollers to do my whole head at one time, but I love the product</li>
            <li> The clips do not seem to be heavy enough or able to be positioned so that the curlers to not fall forward.</li>
            <li> if I had more rollers or if my hair was not as thick.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed but thick African-American hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if the \\&quot;velvety\\&quot; surface would interfere.</li>
            <li> Ive got shoulder length, thick hair and am confident were it longer</li>
            <li> rollers are good but clips pop out and are somewhat difficult to position correctly so roller is snug.</li>
            <li> The heating and roller placement is a little different than my first set, but they do heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to leave the rollers in your hair until the rollers cool down.</li>
            <li> It does take a little more than 2 minutes to heat but is much faster than my other curling set.</li>
            <li> The smart clips that came with these rollers are not in the least bit user friendly.  </li>
            <li> but ultimately I exchanged it for the jumbo (and SUPER jumbo) curlers because I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Though they do heat up quickly, I can&#x27;t get them to stay in my hair long enough to work well.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and the curls last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This was a good purchase, item is as described, heat up very quickly and are less expensive than the same product in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hot rollers have come a long way since my last set was new!</li>
            <li> blow dry your hair (upside down for more volume)...</li>
            <li> I hoped to solve that problem by purchasing separately a pack of plastic clamps/clips and it did work better, but I kept having to adjust them due to slipping.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, I have been using them everyday since I got them!</li>
            <li> - I towel dry my hair, and then add 3-4 squirts of \\&quot;Big and Sexy Blow Dry and Volume Gel\\</li>
            <li> At first I was confused because in the instructions it says the light will turn red when plugged in and will turn a white/iridescent color when ready.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some other rollers that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I finally got a super jumbo shower cap and put in on over the whole mess.</li>
            <li> I have similar clips from previous sets of rollers which I just use instead, but still these clips seem to separate quite easily.</li>
            <li> I wanted a set of hot rollers to give my thin hair volume, and these work just fine.  </li>
            <li> I quickly disconnected them from the wall socket and they continued to melt down.</li>
            <li> It took me 3-4 tries before finally getting it right, now curling my hair is a cinch!</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and give big loose curls, but forget using the clips they come with.</li>
            <li> I only wish they were easy to travel with, but the hard plastic box takes too much space in luggage.</li>
            <li> Having had short hair for a long time, I&#x27;m new to the hot roller world.</li>
            <li> But I waited about a half hour without the light changing, and eventually used them without the light changing, because I was already late to the party I was going to.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers to replace an older different brand name set.</li>
            <li> Love the compactness of the set but the rollers are too small especially now that my hair is longer.  </li>
            <li> Finally, there are larger hot rollers.</li>
            <li> The flocked surface is nice, but the design overall is not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many different rollers in the past but this has never happened to me</li>
            <li> This product works really well, and it is really easy to get the hang of after a few tries.</li>
            <li> i heat them up for 5 minutes, spritz a little styling lotion (i use bumble and bumble), make sure your hair is dry, then roll.  </li>
            <li> but I have frizzy, super thick, super long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get the kids ready with the curlers in my hair, even though they are a little heavy because they are ceramic.</li>
            <li> I just wish I could buy enough rollers to roll all of my hair all in one size and with clips that actually secure the rollers for less than $80.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have 30 instead of 10, so after using my first 10 for ten years and my new 10 for two years, I finally ordered that 3rd set.  </li>
            <li> I needed more of the purple and not the black, so I ordered 2 sets and replaced the black with the new purple ones</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a bit over a foot long all over, but curing iorns were giving me too much damage and lots of split ends.</li>
            <li> I have long ramrod straight hair that has NEVER curled.</li>
            <li> However, as long as you don&#x27;t break-dance, the curlers stay put reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine-to-medium straight hair, and have tried curling it with these rollers 3-4 times now.</li>
            <li> Not thick and coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li> First of all, it took FOREVER to be delivered-4 days after the posted expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> Big bouncy curls in my normally wavy-ish frizzball.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you pull the rollers out of their slots since the edge of the rollers are a bit hot.</li>
            <li> I spray them a few different times with the Big &amp; Sexy hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I am guessing people with normal hair would only need one.</li>
            <li> Multisized Hot Rollers (the set with the pink rollers)</li>
            <li> The only thing I would caution is to watch how you set them on your head--I tend to secure them too tightly</li>
            <li> I have a toddler boy and little tolerance for spending too much time to get ready.  </li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, you know that after having your hair up all day it tends to be a little straighter/smoother than after a fresh blow-dry</li>
            <li> With the large rollers included, the wave is loose and yet bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair and wanted more large rollers.</li>
            <li> will look for some new fangled larger clips that they sell seperately to see if this solves my issue.  </li>
            <li> This new set has 4 extra jumbo, which I haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li> if I put too much in, it wouldn&#x27;t dry in time, but it does.  </li>
            <li> but I wish the rollers were half as many and Bigger, Bigger, Bigger</li>
            <li> Only negative for me is I wish there were more rollers in the set</li>
            <li> Most of the women I know have been wanting larger heated rollers for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the set is about 3 times larger than the remington and takes up too much room in my gym bag.  </li>
            <li> , I could use at least 4 more rollers since my hair is longer but the pamphlet that comes with the rollers states you can buy extra sets.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay that hot long, but it&#x27;s enough to cause discomfort.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Super Jumbo\\&quot; curlers are too heavy to roll up...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick Asian hair, highlights, relatively healthy.      </li>
            <li> However, on the second try, I experimented a little with the clips and they work fine but are nonetheless a little tricky to get just right.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that there is no compartment for the pins like in the very old models...</li>
            <li> It takes all the rollers to curl my entire head, and the curl is very natural.  </li>
            <li> use them every other day, the large 4 in the middle add nice body to my thick hair, this is my second set.  </li>
            <li> like I said alot of hair, and need every single curler to do my whole head, but the clips are a joke.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this set overall, my only complaint is that the pins do not keep rollers tight in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually do the front and top layers of my hair with the larger ones and the rest with the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally noticeable and completely unacceptable!  </li>
            <li> No waiting around like other brands for the rollers to get hot.</li>
            <li> But then to navigate the clip away from these 2 openings is a major pain.  </li>
            <li> If you want other women to glare at you with a look that screams &amp;#34;Bitch with hot hair!&amp;#34; you must try this set.</li>
            <li> My hair is so flat normally, that I&#x27;ve been using these just about every day now.  </li>
            <li> After looking at higher priced brands I decided to stick with Conair and try the Extreme Heat set.</li>
            <li> This model has some major advantages.    </li>
            <li> If you have a vanity that holds the product with outlets out of sight, this is a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li> If you want a few extra curls on the side or/and top try also if you have the time and inclination the conair curling iron, 1 inch for bigger curls and 1/2 inch or even 3/8 inch for smaller.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and I didn&#x27;t mind the split down the middle.</li>
            <li> I have long, really thick hair &amp; the rollers are not big enough &amp; there are not enough of them to do a good job.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought maybe I had put too much hair on each curler, so I tried just curling HALF of my hair with all 12 rollers, but got the same result: No curls, just a tiny bit of body at the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like that there are big &amp; smaller rollers BUT, be careful as the rollers get very hot and could burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have the older set of these rollers but there just weren&#x27;t enough rollers to do my entire hair</li>
            <li> I have very long wild, frizzy kinky hair that never wants to cooperate and is neither straight nor nicely curled naturally, but I get tired of just pulling it back in a bun.</li>
            <li> after reading all the reviews of the various sets - I certainly can afford more expensive ones -</li>
            <li> Fits right next to my sink, and there&#x27;s still room for other bathroom essentials.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend these rollers for those with medium to short hair who are looking for a smooth look with little to no curl.</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair and the 12 rollers is just enough to set my whole head .</li>
            <li> so I have to tell you that I was amazed that it only took me 10 minutes to set my whole head of long hair.  </li>
            <li> (I wanted to fancy up my long straight hair occasionally...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick, just long.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using the old school simple metal U clips from my old set last night.  </li>
            <li> way too short to hold the curler to your head, I had to use the clips from an old set</li>
            <li> There was barely a wave</li>
            <li> Considering I have very coarse hair, I was surprised it curled myhair the way it did.  </li>
            <li> and I get big, lush, bouncy &#x27;curls&#x27;.</li>
            <li> i went back to my set that is 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> soft surface eliminates those \\&quot;kinked\\&quot; ends on hair that the regular plastic rollers leave.</li>
            <li> They held floppy in my hair and I have to be careful not to move too much once they are in.  </li>
            <li> 5/16/09&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly two years of almost daily use, this product went beserk on me.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers and they barely heat up or curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I have naturally curly hair to began with but wanted larger curls and read that this would do the trick.</li>
            <li> My hair was barely turned under after leaving them in for almost an hour.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The slit in the rollers for the heating element allows your hair to get underneath the edge of the roller, and if you are not careful, you can pull your hair out or break it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Left them in until they completely cooled.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is the metal wire devices that are like the old ones of years gone by...</li>
            <li> I went back to the old reliable velcro rolls which you can&#x27;t heat up</li>
            <li> I have purchase the conair multiple set which is the hot pink one</li>
            <li> Although I am getting better putting those clips in, it is not uncommon for it to go flying across the room.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of concerned about the clips when I purchased them because the description is somewhat vague.</li>
            <li> I usually just comb through with my fingers after removing the rollers and allowing my hair to cool</li>
            <li> The curls didn&#x27;t hold, they were really hard to put in, they didn&#x27;t get very hot, and they were hard to take out, to the point that I was tugging pretty hard on my own hair, which isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They sure are, in fact they make the iron look like a poor choice in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty hair-styling challenged but after a few tries, I finally got this down and use it frequently because it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> While the rollers themselves are great - heat up VERY quickly and hold the heat for a long time - the metal clips that come with it to hold the rollers are AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Not a single kink to be found!</li>
            <li> However, with a little practice I learned how to slide the clips in so that they would keep the roller tight (and the metal clips work so much better than the plastic things.)</li>
            <li> The problem is that the lid keeps cracking right down the middle.   </li>
            <li> Since my older Conair rollers are several years old and still working, I expect these will last for a long time as well.</li>
            <li> The single negative thing I find with this product is that the plastic hinged top breaks.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble right off the bat getting my hair to stay in place while rolling it up.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight, smooth Asian hair that is prone to not curling (and when it does it holds for only 20 minutes).</li>
            <li> Overall these rollers are fine, but several small things keep them from greatness.  </li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t get as hot as my previous set</li>
            <li> have just started having problems where half of the rollers get hot and the others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The rollers due stay hot enough to set your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had several stellar hair days due to this product.</li>
            <li> Smaller sets take forever, if you are being careful not to overload the roller, but this set can handle my large amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair really can do that naturally with a little oomp provided by electric rollers.  </li>
            <li> would have been great to have been given the larger, claw type of clips that would accommodate the larger sized rollers sans the metal that becomes very uncomfortable to sport for longer than 30</li>
            <li> At least I have another unit if something happens to the original one.</li>
            <li> The curl lasts....except in very humid weather...same as other methods.  </li>
            <li> The rollers do add volume, but usually not for long.</li>
            <li> it was more like a flop of limp hair with one puny little wave.</li>
            <li> The first time I use it, I need to practice 2-3 times to tight the rollers.</li>
            <li> And, the new way I do my hair, I never have to blow dry it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I chose the latter option, as I live in a fairly rural area and shipping something back is a bit of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> and I keep them in my hair for at least 30 minutes while I make lunch, iron, and clean</li>
            <li> just purchased this set of rollers after the last set went bust on me and nearly gave me second degree burns</li>
            <li> , I actually don&#x27;t need a shutoff, since I need to get my hair fixed as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the one big downfall for me as far as the actual make of the product.</li>
            <li> Heat up quickly, a little tricky at first curling hair around curler, but get easier.</li>
            <li> These rollers are a major upgrade from my last set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, just to give you a little background, this isn&#x27;t my first ride on the jumbo-roller-express.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would recommend is buying the plastic roller clips separately, since the metal clips that come with the hot rollers absolutely do not hold my hair!!</li>
            <li> they were larger than other rollers that claimed to be large.</li>
            <li> heats quickly  ample rollers for big and small curls    </li>
            <li> I wanted the look of smooth hair, but I&#x27;m no good at using a blow dryer or a curling iron.</li>
            <li> As my hair is also pretty wavy, it generally holds curl all day long quite well, so with other brands of rollers, I only have to leave them in for 5 minutes or so to get my desired result.</li>
            <li> [...]     I have longer (about mid-chest), thicker, naturally curly hair cut into long layers.  </li>
            <li> You dont need them in for a long time, for natural styles.</li>
            <li> and as I wrapped my hair around them, I thought, \\&quot;well, that&#x27;s strange - wow</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, I googled Conair complaints and defects, and apparently this sort of things happens with a lot of their products, especially hair dryers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, I googled Conair complaints and defects, and apparently this sort of things happens with a lot of their products, especially hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for over thirty years - I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble with a set.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve gotten them to consistently work for me, once I practiced with them a few times.  </li>
            <li> so I was anxious to see how they would come out after a fresh wash/blow-dry.  </li>
            <li> I plug them in and within a few minutes thay are HOT.  </li>
            <li> Are all hot rollers this heavy?</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot enough, and after leaving them in my hair for about 10 minutes, I barely had a limp curl.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used my new rollers they worked amazingly, but the next few times I was disappointed that the curl would fall right out of my thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick yet fine hair and was looking for a solution to getting shape and volume on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> you just have to put the clip straight up and down against your scalp so that they can&#x27;t unroll...</li>
            <li> The clips that are included work very well in keeping the rollers in, if you put it in with the curved side down.</li>
            <li> it is a little hot to handle but not that big of a deal        </li>
            <li> I had another set with the hinge clips and they left funny little dents in my curl.</li>
            <li> and I wish they would make the super jumbo with 12 rollers instead of have the big ones mixed with the small ones</li>
            <li> They sent them to me, but they were the next model down that doesn&#x27;t have the new clips (it has the old metal pins)</li>
            <li> i have extremely straight, long, dyed asian hair that&#x27;s not too full or too thin</li>
            <li> My mother has an old set of hard plastic Conair hot rollers from the 70s (maybe 80s?)</li>
            <li> but I REALLY wanted to try them out, so I rolled one side, left it for 5 minutes, brushed my teeth and did make-up while they reheated, and then rolled the other side for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Some brands have a slick surface on the roller, and my hair slides right off.</li>
            <li> people who have never used electric curlers, it takes some getting used to the wire clips, but they leave no funny bump, which is highly preferable.</li>
            <li> So much easier than curling and seems less damaging than straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair setter is modestly priced and has the larger barrels I like for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of consistent trying, I gave up and sent them back.</li>
            <li> They heat up in just a few minutes and are plenty hot enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that with my hair (maybe other people&#x27;s hair is different), I need two more rollers.  </li>
            <li> Work fine my only complaint Is there is no where to store the roller clips!</li>
            <li> This is not a good product -- doesn&#x27;t heat up much -- isn&#x27;t worth the time of rolling your hair on the rollers!</li>
            <li> One row of rollers does not heat up at all, and the other row is at such high heat, that I burned a finger.</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> this video says to do (thanks to the previous poster who left this video!  </li>
            <li> I had to supplement my purchase with round makeup sponges, which I cut in half to fit between each roller and my head.</li>
            <li> To get it tight I have to aim the clip straight down-like a nail-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually fairly straight with only a slight wave, but now I&#x27;ve got big, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Also, the wire clips for the super-jumbo rollers are not long enough to stick out beyond the roller enough to hold the hair!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, somewhat thin shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li> They did not stay put with the included clips in my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> CONS: there is a bit of a burning plastic smell each time you heat them up, you&#x27;re given the pins which are a bit difficult to use at first, there is nowhere for the pins to be held (no compartment or anything), if you have super long hair</li>
            <li> really, really hot* and didn&#x27;t slide up off their base as easily as they normally do,</li>
            <li> They are constantly falling apart, as easily as it is to put them back together, but doing it repeatedly every morning, especially when you&#x27;re in a rush is just irritating.</li>
            <li> they provide more longevity to the curl lasting throughout the day - and I mean body with slight curl as I desired.  </li>
            <li> The metal, u-shaped clips are a little tricky and can push back the hair a bit when pushed on, but didn&#x27;t really matter in the end.</li>
            <li> The other way is to blow dry it as straight as I can and then roll it.  </li>
            <li> I have flat hair, but in my experience they only work if your hair is dryed naturally, if you dry your hair with heat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now about those metal pins, I have had good luck with them and bad luck.</li>
            <li> Also, the clips are color-coded at the tip to match the size of the roller, but the colors are so close, it&#x27;s hard to get the right one.</li>
            <li> Conair Super Clips, Hold Hot And Cold Rollers 10 Pack]]  </li>
            <li> The main problem is that they are flocked instead of having teeth, so they seem to slip out of my hair if I don&#x27;t wrap them tightly.  </li>
            <li> But Conair Extreme Heat with Jumbo and Superjumbo rollers create big, soft waves that last all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the slit down the middle, but could live with it.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the second unit I bought has done exactly the same - and the 4 large curlers have had to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair and these rollers worked just fine.</li>
            <li> There were two too many of the metal pins for holding the black curlers, since it was missing the two black curlers.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try something new, but my set is getting so broke down</li>
            <li> How hard would it be to create a few holes to hold the clips?&lt;br /&gt;The curlers do heat up pretty fast</li>
            <li> &quot; I do have very thick, coarse, hard to manage hair, but I have used other brands of rollers successfully before.</li>
            <li> and I was about to give up completely when I stumbled across the Conair Extreme.</li>
            <li> these rollers need to have larger edges to hang onto and to keep hair in the roller area instead of being so flat and the clips are too fat, do not snug-up the roller to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is keeping the rollers in your hair long enough to put the cap on because when you&#x27;re done doing the front and start on the back, the rollers in the front start to fall out, even with the additional clips!</li>
            <li> I do have to curl part of my hair with my flat iron because there are not enough curlers for all of my hair</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers looking for curlers that would give me softer, larger curls than I get with my hot sticks (those end up very tight and spiral-y!).  </li>
            <li> However, due to the drawbacks with the rollers themselves, I can&#x27;t really recommend this product to anyone other than those who are gluttons for punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only minor issue is that they don&#x27;t seem to make lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use the bigger rollers because I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get them to stay in long enough to curl the hair.</li>
            <li> The Clips aren&#x27;t quite long enough to hold the rollers in place, so you will need some different clips, like the jumbo clips you can buy seperately.</li>
            <li> the rollers get hot and your fingers can be tender to touch, but after a few tries mine became used to the heat.</li>
            <li> and I actually spend way less time than I ever did with a blow dryer and round brush on my super long locks.    </li>
            <li> it - result is very soft subdued waves, not the big messy look I had with smaller rollers.  </li>
            <li> I have long (to the middle of my back) wavy-ish hair that is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> The hair pins are a bit hard to get used to at first</li>
            <li> First of alll had hard time keeping the rollers in with the clips that were sent with the set.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find hot rollers that are big enough to work on my very long hair.  </li>
            <li> They take the frizz out and are so much easier than using a curling iron or trying to blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I do suggest getting the little plastic clips (mine are white) for bang areas or odd little layered sections, but the wire ones work just fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders some and straight with a teeny bit of wave.  </li>
            <li> my hair - meaning take it from small curls to waves, and these curlers do that very well.  </li>
            <li> So I run out of rollers with small section left in the back and my hait is not thick at all.</li>
            <li> It took some time to figure out how to use it and I&#x27;m not sure it is really holding the roller</li>
            <li> But the curls don&#x27;t last long, even though i put on the rollers for longer duration.</li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to be really flat.  </li>
            <li> My hair is no longer flat.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want actual curls, you can work them out, or just leave the curlers in for a shorter amount of time (or don&#x27;t let them heat up so long).    </li>
            <li> In 2 seconds my hair was completely flat.</li>
            <li> Maybe they aren&#x27;t long enough to create tension.</li>
            <li> By the way, my hair is almost long enough to sit on.  </li>
            <li> I am someone who gets bed hair no matter how long my hair is and the next morning</li>
            <li> I have long hair, &amp; I only use the jumbo rollers.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t damage hair like a curling or flat iron.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep them in my hair long enough to get a curl so can&#x27;t rate how well my hair curled.</li>
            <li> but maybe I left them in too long</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t last long, just couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It does not have to be flat like when you use an iron - just twist it and wrap it around then roll the thing toward your head.</li>
            <li> I had the curlers heated properly, in for a long time, and my curls were flat.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to longer hair that isnt exactly what you would call thick</li>
            <li> I have hot rollers however by the time I twist my hair almost to the root, its too thick to get any of the heat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, and works on dry hair (I can just wake up, style and go--I shower at night) unlike some plain rollers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased it from Walmart, recently marked down to $19.99.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my hair was very very thick</li>
            <li> The rollers are not hot enough when the dot turns white, you have to wait at least another seven or eight minutes for them to be hot enough.  </li>
            <li> My current roller set is very old and is a steam set with jumbo rollers (larger rollers than the Conair set in a small case).  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, if I used the curlers when the curlers claimed to be ready (after only two minutes of heating), it wouldn&#x27;t hardly leave a curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li> ( And I mean FREAKING hot.</li>
            <li> The rollers are just the right size (I have fairly thick hair down a few inches past my shoulders) and I love the texture on the rollers that keeps my hair from slipping off.   </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Do not feel discouraged or afraid to use these, personally, I feel that they are more efficient than a curling iron.        </li>
            <li> My second complaint is that I really need another 4-6 rollers to get all my hair rolled.  </li>
            <li> The heating elements are bars that go the length of the case, and when reaching to get another roller, it is easy to touch the heating element, which can be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> because i wanted only wide diameter rollers all the same size.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and tips, let the curlers heat up for a long time, left them in for a long time, sprayed my roots with hairspray, etc.  </li>
            <li> I am hair appliance challenged and after several tries and 30 minutes later I figured it out.</li>
            <li> The clips are a little difficult to work with and the rollers are hot to handle but that is worth the results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you buy the white plastic roller clips though because the ones that come with don&#x27;t work so well - especially with the uber thick hair that I have.</li>
            <li> But I was most frustrated because there is no little door or compartment to hold the wire holders.  </li>
            <li> I use every single roller and have enough every time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers because I felt the positive responses outweighed the negative.  </li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair and pretty long... and it works!  </li>
            <li> Roller are large which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> And lastly, the \\&quot;curl\\&quot; was far less than expected.</li>
            <li> I started out with the other Conair set,(Xtreme Instant Heat) with the different sizes.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my old set, unfortunately this set also came with the Super size which I did not really need.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;The metal clips that come with the rollers are the only negative, I took other reviewers advice and purchased Conair plastic</li>
            <li> And if you have little frizzies near your scalp like I do, don&#x27;t worry about them -</li>
            <li> Upon cutting open the taped box, I immediately noticed that two of the super-jumbo sized black curlers were missing, including the one with the red indicator dot which alerts one as to when the unit has achieved optimum heat.  </li>
            <li> The older model would look kind of cruddy after awhile.     </li>
            <li> I like having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair and flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and hard to keep a curl.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they can sometimes hard to use until you really get used to them.</li>
            <li> The rollers are big which makes them heavy and the pins provide a horrible hold at best.          </li>
            <li> If I really want to set them I blast them with a shot of hot followed with cold from my hair dryer before unrolling them.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really long (almost to bottom of my breast).</li>
            <li> The clips leave a strange crimp on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long layered hair and the rollers</li>
            <li> This maybe because I have really long hair or something.</li>
            <li> I purchased these when I had long hair</li>
            <li> Most others have medium &amp; small, which are too small for me and a waste of energy to heat.</li>
            <li> They are as long as the rest of my hair).  </li>
            <li> There is a strange dent in my hair from these rollers, they have a split in the side so that they can slide onto the heating element and the slit coincides with the dent.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews-never had a problem with the degree of hotness or slipping or not enough curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, about to my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I think I could recommend it for medium or  long hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these rollers to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long and layered</li>
            <li> Always long and sparkling.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers because I wanted an all-jumbo set for my long hair.</li>
            <li> have long hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve grown my hair long I needed something to meek it easier to style.  </li>
            <li> They can only clamp over about a 1/4\\&quot; of hair on the 2\\&quot; wide clip.</li>
            <li> My length is a long bob</li>
            <li> I ended up using hair clips that I have that open really wide</li>
            <li> how long I let the set heat up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, and it&#x27;s finally long.</li>
            <li> but they are pink and smaller.</li>
            <li> I have decently long hair, about 5 inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, these rollers work great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The curls do not stay that long</li>
            <li> The only reason they have needed replacing is that I travel a lot and am rough on the case because of that.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it on that long.</li>
            <li> I think my hair is just too long and thick for them to make much of an impact.</li>
            <li> The directions are not clear.</li>
            <li> It may be my thick course hair, these don&#x27;t give me much curl.</li>
            <li> It has been dyed some, and is slightly damaged but not extremely damaged.</li>
            <li> Does not heat well enough for hard to curl straight medium hair although we have not tried on other hair types.</li>
            <li> But the good news is we CAN have that insanely voluptuous supermodel hair thanks to the Conair Extreme.  </li>
            <li> then I was left with a gross hair sprayed mess...  </li>
            <li> i use the 4 black larger rolls for volume up top, and if i want to go curly ill use the other ones.  </li>
            <li> I have used other rollers before that keeps my hair curly long enough (and hotter) just not as wide/big as these...</li>
            <li> This item rated a 3 star as it is not exactly what I was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find anything with larger rollers.  </li>
            <li> (otherwise it&#x27;s not hot enough).  </li>
            <li> I tried other hair products/combos, and they didn&#x27;t do the same thing at all.  </li>
            <li> If you have any other conair rollers you&#x27;ll see the only difference in the sets of clips is their color...</li>
            <li> In the future i will buy other clips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other curlers and by the time they are heated enough I can no longer touch them to roll my hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I got the desired results -- a little body and fullness in a relatively short time.</li>
            <li> After giving them several tries, I returned these and went back to using my old curlers -- they&#x27;re smaller but at least there&#x27;s noticeable curl in my hair when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> The only thing I havn&#x27;t mastered yet is the metal pins to make them stay on other</li>
            <li> Now...what to do with long hair?!</li>
            <li> it would burst into flame eventually, due to the leaking wax, if left unattended.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried the smaller ones that dominate those other sets.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that hot and the the clips do not make any sense as they are lose and weak</li>
            <li> I have let these heat up for long periods of time, and all they do is get lukewarm!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to take the other back and forth.  </li>
            <li> The box that the manufacturer had originally packed the item in was badly abused, and had obviously been torn open and taped back together.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, normal/thick hair.</li>
            <li> the cylinders burn your fingers and scalp, curl does not hold very long.</li>
            <li> Overly dry hair is a disaster.</li>
            <li> One is to air dry -</li>
            <li> when completely dry I roll</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to always have to blow dry it, and my hair lacks volume.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is already completely dry it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair didn&#x27;t dry out and it maintained it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> I blow my hair dry and then put in these rollers.  </li>
            <li> I wash and blow dry my hair, then use the rollers.  </li>
            <li> I guess because I use them everyday the velvety finish wore off after about a year 1/2 and am now on my 2nd set-which is the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> I got big loose curls with these in just a few minutes, ran a comb through, and instant waves!</li>
            <li> Tried to take a roller out of the unit but it was wayyyy too hot to the tough.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up enough, but it is difficult to get the wire clips in the right place because of the design of the roller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick to death of pink, so this is a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long hair and these rollers only give me a slight wave.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you had very, very thick fine hair, you could pull this off but even then, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> As my hair grew past my shoulders I found that the old roller set I had, with the brown velvety colored rollers (you know the type, your moms have this set</li>
            <li> the clips arent that bad at least with my type of hair (not too thin) if they didnt hold the first time, i moved the clips every way possible until they got a good hold.</li>
            <li> these rollers are just slighly larger than average size.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse long hair and while it works well enough, even after buying the conair professional clips, I still have trouble keeping the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> and it looks like you spent a long time styling your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and when I straighten it, there is not much body.</li>
            <li> I have long semi-curly hair that tries to frizz all the time.  </li>
            <li> With other hot rollers I&#x27;ve tried, the rollers were too small and made tight fuzzy curls.</li>
            <li> bouncy,  loose bodied look.  </li>
            <li> I put them in, leave them in for about 10-15 min (time to get my coffee in the morn and do my makeup) take them out, flip my hair upside down and kinda scrunch the curls, flip back over and viola.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough of a problem for mark it down from 5 stars, though.    </li>
            <li> But hey 80&#x27;s girls - you can still brush your hair upside down and get the big hair 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The initial crimp from the clip is not noticable and calms down quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for so long!!  </li>
            <li> I have long (halfway down back) and very thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them, my hair was all dry and static -- awful.</li>
            <li> And the loose curls carry over to the next day, which is typically unheard of for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> Even waiting ten minutes with the set on, the curlers are not hot enough to produce a curl -- just a limp wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited because after I have a baby, I lose a lot of hair, and it gets thin looking up on top (I HATE it, though my husband claims he can&#x27;t tell at all).  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews who complained about the rollers being too hot against the skin and to avoid that I just put a few pieces of toilet paper underneath and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears, scalp or neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After going back and reading other reviews, I think they must have changed the clips that come with this set, because other comments to not make sense.  </li>
            <li> The clip arms are 1/2 the length long than they were a few years ago when I bought a standard set of rollers.  </li>
            <li> I know I let them heat up long enough, too, because a few rollers burned my neck.      </li>
            <li> Over the past two weeks, or so, I&#x27;ve tried several different types of hair products, and combinations of them, to use with the hair rollers until I found what works for me.  </li>
            <li> Not particularly comfy, as the wire poked my scalp on a couple rollers.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought these curlers at Target for $27, not realizing I could have bought them here for $10 less.</li>
            <li> Only a SLIGHT hint of wave, which was gone in no time.  </li>
            <li> Buy both at the same time so shipping will be less.</li>
            <li> Also there are four larger than usual rollers in the middle that is not there in my Conair that I am now using.  </li>
            <li> There were NO clips included, meaning not only has it cost me $10 more; I now have to go buy clips  :(    </li>
            <li> the faceplate is open, which allows for cleaning miscellaneous hairs that would get  stuck in the previous model.</li>
            <li> They heat up in less than 2 minutes, and there are enough in one set for my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like tight springy curls, but adore big loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li> However, the biggest downfall that I can NOT live with are the clips!  </li>
            <li> With this product, I not only have to heat them up for at least a half hour to get them hot enough to do anything, but I also have to keep them in at least 20 minutes to get my hair to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> Extreme Heat means just that, and my scalp couldn&#x27;t take the heat for as long as I like to leave the rollers in (to get maximum curl).  </li>
            <li> For the first time in months my hair looked great, it was just very difficult getting there :-(</li>
            <li> To fix these small issues I simply saved the little plastic bag that the clips came in and placed them back in there and store them in between the curlers (after they&#x27;ve cooled) and I left the cord tied up like it comes to help keep is someone shorter and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IF YOU DO NOT LIKE TO BLOW DRY WITH A ROUND BRUSH OR NEED A THIRD HAND</li>
            <li> I recommend having a few big claws on hand to clamp down the bigger rollers of the set, they tend to slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li> tight, boingy curls that smaller rollers make.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that the clips for the four large rollers are too small so hair doesn&#x27;t remain firmly gripped while the curler is in.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally brown hair, down to the middle of my back,  that is killed by bleaching highlights.  </li>
            <li> but it is only a little longer than shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I wish the curlers were a little bigger, but I&#x27;m not complaining about that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after the first time, the side of the rollers which was made up of the silver velvety material started to burn!</li>
            <li> The velvety surface of the modern rollers and the weaker wires are a bad combo in this modern set.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t horrible but they didn&#x27;t work that great for me.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, maybe about an inch past my bra strap in the back.  </li>
            <li> I think that my only complaint is that I wish I&#x27;d bought this sooner, versus always going to my stylist for the retro look and paying big $$$ for roller sets in a salon!</li>
            <li> My second qualm is that the rollers themselves are ridiculously heavy.</li>
            <li> The curls lasted a few hours considering I left them on for about 20 minutes maximum.</li>
            <li> I just jammed packed each roller.</li>
            <li> I have used them several times per week since I bought them a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> This makes using the curlers much harder for me, the wire clips leave a mark in my hair.</li>
            <li> They were a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did not know how to use them, but I looked on youtube and found a few tutorials and found they were quite simple.</li>
            <li> Also, I am having trouble rolling up the back hair.  </li>
            <li> These rollers are heated through metal slots in the center.</li>
            <li> I unroll them carefully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do it a few times in different spots to get everywhere that needs some lift.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, my hair straightens but the frizz does not come back.</li>
            <li> (I guess the pokies were meant to keep your hair from slipping off the rollers).</li>
            <li> would say with this set you will need a lot of practice and patience and it does not really give you curls</li>
            <li> The only thing missing from this product is there is not a place in the case to put the pins that go with the rollers.</li>
            <li> Those that say they don&#x27;t must not be heating the set up with the lid closed.    </li>
            <li> I have to be careful to not burn my fingers or ears.)  </li>
            <li> the lid closed as it started melting the plastic.</li>
            <li> All in all though, take 5-10 minutes to put them in and it looks like you spent an hour doing your hair.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, if left in for longer the curls stay in for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a few times and the last time I used them I smelled smoke and found that the resistor was in fire and melting!</li>
            <li> I let them heat up with the lid closed for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> There were two too few of the metal pins for the smaller purple curlers, since there were two curlers replaced.  </li>
            <li> delivery was quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of my old 30-minutes-to-heat curlers.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy semi curly hair.</li>
            <li> The clips are too thin and dont hold the big rollers completely.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair that I usually use a large round brush and hairdryer to smooth/straighten.  </li>
            <li> But that is minor compared to the other problem!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that there is no place to store the clips - other curler sets I&#x27;ve had provide a little slot for the clips.</li>
            <li> Her hair is naturally curly and usually holds a curl for days, however her curls fell within minutes with this for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> They dent my hair and are not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the clips are not strong enough to hold roller in place.</li>
            <li> My hair came out without a drop of frizz in long wavy slightly curly strands.</li>
            <li> Only problem - pins are not easy to use, takes a while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I let these heat for half an hour, left them in my hair for another half an hour and nothing.</li>
            <li> Even with the recommended clips you buy separately, I could not keep these rollers in my hair even while standing still - kept slipping, sliding and falling out due to the weight of the rollers and slippery clips.  </li>
            <li> that is super hard to roll hair in, i think b/c the rollers are too small, so i have to use small sections of hair at a time).  </li>
            <li> Her old set she had for years and where in pretty bad shape.  </li>
            <li> Normally there are 6 of the larger ones in sets, always just a bit shy</li>
            <li> I ordered the second set of rollers, because I have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, long (several inches passed her shoulders) hair</li>
            <li> I really like the look and wish I could rank them higher</li>
            <li> The two missing black curlers had been replaced with two of the smaller purple jumbo curlers.  </li>
            <li> BUT I have to physically hold the rollers in my hair because the clips are not long enough and they (1) simply allow the rollers to partially fall out and (2) are almost impossible to remove if you are trying to redo a roller.  </li>
            <li> Only wish there was a small slot on rollers to hold the clips when not in use.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other than the problem with the metal clips</li>
            <li> If I wanted to, I could find some other type of clip at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li> I have other rollers that don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews...</li>
            <li> -usually I have to use 2 which means that I can&#x27;t use all of the curlers; not a problem for me because I only use 6, but some people may be upset.</li>
            <li> Other commenters mentioned they ended up with no curl.  </li>
            <li> Believe them when they say extreme heat.  </li>
            <li> ...plug-in only..but other than those two details...</li>
            <li> My sister wanted curlers for Christmas - but \\&quot;JUST the big ones, I never use the small ones\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick or thin.  </li>
            <li> As I was buying this product, I saw that some people like the \\&quot;claw\\&quot; clips and other people prefer the wire clips.  </li>
            <li> They are not going to be small curls since the rollers are so big.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise my curl would fall due to the length.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because of ye &#x27;ol</li>
            <li> Bought these the other day.</li>
            <li> I already have tons of jaw clips as it is from other roller sets I&#x27;ve used and metal</li>
            <li> I purchased two other sets, but they just weren&#x27;t what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> but perhaps that is due to the length of my hair.    </li>
            <li> I may have a somewhat defective model since no mention of this can be found in any other review.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, it takes patience.</li>
            <li> They are too small and do not hold the rollers properly.</li>
            <li> so I use other ones that I have.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they work well.</li>
            <li> So the clips basically have to be stored somewhere other than with the rollers.  </li>
            <li> I saw on youtube there is other hair curlers by conair</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of the conair extreme heat curls,</li>
            <li> so I had to buy other type of clips to help hold the roller in place</li>
            <li> This is my third set of these rollers in the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> It created weak curls in the front and the curls in the back fell out instantly.</li>
            <li> Easier and faster than curling iron because you can put them in and do other things while the curls set.</li>
            <li> other day I plugged my rollers in as usual and let them heat up while I went downstairs to get my morning cup of coffee, then I came back up and proceeded to brush my hair out in preparation for the rollers, as I do every morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> instantly unplugged the cord, and I realized then that I could hear these little crackling sounds, like a frozen pond being cracked - little crackly popping</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy some other sort of pin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product would work as well on very long or heavy hair.</li>
            <li> When I would blow dry my hair and style it with a round brush, it still didn&#x27;t look the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble curling my long, thick, asian hair, and when I do get my hair to curl</li>
            <li> - Then I go to bed with wet hair and wake up with a mess of hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend these curlers to anyone, especially people with long thick hair like me!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the rollers didn&#x27;t give me the look I was going for, as they are too large.</li>
            <li> They can be tricky when you use the pins, but after a few times, I finally can put the rollers in very tight, and they won&#x27;t fall out at all.</li>
            <li> the other set is black tipped.</li>
            <li> The colors are a bit hard to differentiate, especially when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Also find them hard to get back in place in the case</li>
            <li> The fasteners crimp your hair especially if you have very thick or long hair.</li>
            <li> I complained to Conair and they sent me different clips....</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy unless I brush it straight while blow drying and when trying to curl it, my hair is thin and silky making it difficult to roll up or keep in a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It only comes with 10, but I use 12 hair rollers, so at least two are always wire clips.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use the rollers if I am in a hurry, because at least 3 or 4 will fall off and I have to put them back on and not move.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the clip that is used to hold the curler in place.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just frustrated they don&#x27;t sell larger hot rollers like my friend has.  </li>
            <li> No more wasted tiny rollers that never get used.</li>
            <li> I am going to order some of the Conair clips and see if that will help the problem, but the clips that come with the set are useless and really need to be re-designed.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s a bit confusing because I ordered the same product about a month ago to keep as a set in our gym at work, and it came with the pins.</li>
            <li> but it is really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Average rollers but clips dont hold well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and curly hair and tend to set my hair in specific direction to maximize control and</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get them to hold the roller in place.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse and I was worried about needing the Conair jaw clips to hold these in.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Just not enough rollers for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick Asian hair and was looking for something to add some body and polish.  </li>
            <li> And, there are enough rollers for even thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I had thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li> There are enough rollers to get through a thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The clips to hold the rollers in place are not very secure although it does depend on the hair&#x27;s thickness/texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These curlers are a little heavy if you use very thin sections of hair, but they fall right out when your done, leaving the curls intact.     </li>
            <li> Although the curlers can heat up in less than five minutes, I would give them at least ten.</li>
            <li> This is the upgrade to my previous which lasted approximately 3 years with frequent use.</li>
            <li> But when I have to get stuff done before I leave, or I can lay down, I will use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Up, down, sideways....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut down my time at the gym by about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Push down and roll the clasp</li>
            <li> But when I rolled my hair with them, there were crimps in my hair from the lines down either side of the rollers.</li>
            <li> 30 dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> I will say that it takes time to get the technique down.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I did it, let my hair down</li>
            <li> I was putting them in upside down.</li>
            <li> style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed that the new fangled \\&quot;clips\\&quot; would only work correctly in a certain direction</li>
            <li> Conair has other roller sets with a little compartment space within the unit to hold the wire clips -</li>
            <li> I never used the little ones in other sets.</li>
            <li> One other &#x27;downside&#x27; is the clips that come with the set - they leave me with little crimp marks in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old with very thick, layered long hair that hangs a few inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> This works extremely well, even for someone with thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of 8 jumbo rollers thirteen years ago, they were white, hard plastic with little poky things all around</li>
            <li> If I moved my head just slightly they fell heavily down.</li>
            <li> Then a few of the other rollers melted in the set.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that the clips that hold the curlers don&#x27;t quite hold the curlers, at least with my thick, long hair rolled in them.  </li>
            <li> The metal clips don&#x27;t hold the hair tightly, which ruins the curl.</li>
            <li> Maybe a slight bend in my hair.</li>
            <li> This version of these rollers is an update from a previous one.  </li>
            <li> Start at the bottom of your hair line with three rolling under - One behind each ear then one in the center back</li>
            <li> have to replace them about every year and a half but</li>
            <li> They come with the typical u-shaped roller pins, not the clips that someone added to the photos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a month and a half and use them almost every day.</li>
            <li> These heat up very quickly, less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It saves me time, but I feel like I accomplish less with the rollers than I do with my Conair 1 1/4 inch barrel curling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that I have to curl different parts at different times and wait for the rolls to reheat....</li>
            <li> This means it doesn&#x27;t typically want to curl, but once it does, it stays all day.    </li>
            <li> I still have my wire clips from the previous sets of rollers, so I am using those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, but the pins are almost impossible to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that is negative about these rollers is that a few of my hairs always get caught between the velvet part and the plastic ends.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  Now that it&#x27;s warmer, I&#x27;ve started taking these to the gym (summer clothes take up less room in my gym bag).  </li>
            <li> There was a SLIGHT hint of wave</li>
            <li> It creates a slight wave  and a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> -- felt like the end result was less curl and limper hair.</li>
            <li> but for typical hair it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair-time in half, and now with less wear and tear on my hair.</li>
            <li> Heats in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> The previous model had a caddy for the wire clips and this model does not.</li>
            <li> You can time them if you want less heat.</li>
            <li> these are THE worst hot rollers that i have ever used, and i have been using hot rollers since they came out in the 60s.  </li>
            <li> just wish that these had an on/off switch as my previous Conair versus plugging in and they start to heat immediately.  </li>
            <li> The curl falls out after a half hour.  </li>
            <li> The set heated rather quickly (Less than 5 minutes)</li>
            <li> It is not very easy to use, and considering it may hurt my hair a lot, so I just tried twice</li>
            <li> seem to be less damaging than, say, a straightening iron.</li>
            <li> Wrap the bottom half around it and then curl it up towards your head.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am such a loyal Conair customer that it pains me to give this product such an awful review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lucky you! :-(</li>
            <li> I pour a little powder onto my fingers, flip my head down, and work it in my roots.  </li>
            <li> &quot; down but as a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; to rollers, it takes me a little time.  </li>
            <li> Learning curve is very frustrating but eventually I got it to work half decently.</li>
            <li> Second, the clips are not good at holding the roller in place.</li>
            <li> Not true now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to look as if I&#x27;m elderly quite yet with the small</li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> my hair is so thick and long that the \\&quot;velco style\\&quot; curlers do not stay in my hair, and hurt coming out.</li>
            <li> , I had to do it 2x to make it have body, I have long thick hair, I would not buy them again</li>
            <li> My complaint is that the rollers really do not retain enough heat to penetrate my thick hair all the way to the roots.</li>
            <li> I have thick &amp; long hair</li>
            <li> I have a ton of really long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a must for ladies with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Also my hair has to have some moisture in it to keep the roller tight.  </li>
            <li> This size roller gives me the body I need with a curl that is not too tight.  </li>
            <li> The rollers will be held tightly using this method.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the tight Shirley Temple style, and with these curlers you won&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li> They do curl my hair, but because of the length, the curl isn&#x27;t really tight.  </li>
            <li> The clips are usless for holding the roller tight.</li>
            <li> The curlers are wedged too tightly onto the heating grid, the glue melts, the curler starts disintegrating and the wax leaks out.</li>
            <li> that tightly</li>
            <li> I spent a half hour trying to get the first two rollers to stay put, got frustrated and gave up.  </li>
            <li> I have quite thick, long hair that is a little frizzy and</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t blow dry it, it ends up partially wavy/straight/curly, and frizzy (not nice looking!).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used these products from Conair before, you won&#x27;t know what is wrong with this new product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of wasting an hour of every other day using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to replace one that was very old and sometimes failed.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is down a little past my shoulders, and is of average thickness.  </li>
            <li> (Just basically to give the ends of my hair direction, tame down the frizz, and give it some body.)</li>
            <li> Rubbing in a little \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; hair conditioner makes my hair bouncy with these rollers and the bounce and the curl stays in ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li> but I had a little zipper makeup bag that I got with a cosmetic purchase that I keep in my bathroom drawer.    </li>
            <li> but it was a little tricky with the layers; they kept falling out as I was rolling the longer hair.</li>
            <li> For as little as I use it, it works.</li>
            <li> When I bought these curlers I was a little concerned.  </li>
            <li> There was little change to my hair.</li>
            <li> I just spritzed a little hairspray on each section and then rolled it up.</li>
            <li> the holders always fall out with little hair to a lot of hair in the roller.</li>
            <li> I have tried other rollers in the past without any luck...mostly because I had no idea</li>
            <li> and it takes a little time to get them in so my fingers burnt a bit while trying to get them in.  </li>
            <li> but they take a little practice.</li>
            <li> A little trial and error was all it took.</li>
            <li> They cause little indentations in the set of your hair and it stays because of the heat.</li>
            <li> Looking for a way to curl my hair in an even manner with little or no time.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Conair clips to go with them because those little metal things are a joke.</li>
            <li> so I had to find a little plastic bucket for them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other curlers successfully, not sure what the issue is here but the clips provided just do not hold the curlers in place.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have little hair styling coordination, ditch the wire clips that come with the rollers and buy the jaw clips.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky getting used to.</li>
            <li> Who makes a product and doesn&#x27;t include a little hole to hold clips?</li>
            <li> The little bent part has to go UNDER the roller.</li>
            <li> the heat will eventually get to those little boogers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the bother!</li>
            <li> &amp; I mean very long hair.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble getting the clips to hold.</li>
            <li> After minutes of trying different ways I finally got the mission accomplished but felt very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The downside is the center four curlers are hard to remove and replace with one hand.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick, at or above the shoulder-length hair and a really hard head, these MIGHT work for you.</li>
            <li> I liked the rollers, but the clips are terrible....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I plug in then take a shower, then put them in a few minutes after the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly dropping them....very frustrating.</li>
            <li> but these are definitely my everyday go-to choice.</li>
            <li> I tried out the curlers and, of course, had trouble getting the rollers to stay on my head - they loosen up and fall out.  </li>
            <li> Just put some type of smoothing gel or cream into hair before setting blow dried hair</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago and the lid has already broke.</li>
            <li> air dried.  </li>
            <li> if you use just a few cause</li>
            <li> The reason I gave these rollers 3/5 is two-fold; the clips that come with these rollers do NOT fit around the rollers.</li>
            <li> Either way i tried holding the round thing with my hair wrapped around it and nothing happens.</li>
            <li> Use these everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The soft felt texture of the rollers won&#x27;t hurt your scalp or crimp your hair in weird</li>
            <li> I always have trouble curling my hair, and when I do get my hair to curl</li>
            <li> I almost always have a few hairs yanked out.</li>
            <li> So the 16 jumbo rollers from the 2 sets is sufficient to roll all of my hair in one round.  </li>
            <li> and i turn quite a few heads when i use them.  </li>
            <li> few specifications to help others...</li>
            <li> I blow dried it and then set the rollers.</li>
            <li> the last one lasted over three years before the felt started to thin out, they never lost their heat</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not comfortable letting my granddaughter use this without having me in her presence.</li>
            <li> I was tired of burning my fingers with the rollers (and my head with the metal clips), so I got rid of my set after using it only 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your cash</li>
            <li> So I went to YouTube and watched a few videos, and what do you know?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean wet or damp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the rollers on newly washed and dried hair, slightly damp hair, slightly dirty hair (skipped a day of washing) and nada, didn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I said, I don&#x27;t have thin hair (unless it&#x27;s after having a baby), but I do have flat hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really flat and thin</li>
            <li> I was forced to purchase the other clips that Conair manufactures and still encounter problems with the rollers falling out.</li>
            <li> They just plain don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer shared a link to a video on putting in the rollers that helped on that score, though the clips are still pretty bad at holding them firmly in place.     </li>
            <li> Only to the point that I do not have to completely dry my hair to use these rollers so they are my preferred choice in the winter, cold weather.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned by others, it was hard to clasp in place, and kept on sliding down after I clasped it.</li>
            <li> the small ones are never used so they are a waste.  </li>
            <li> My trouble in the past was the curlers getting caught in my hair - these do not get caught.  </li>
            <li> I have long thin hair but tons of it.</li>
            <li> She has very long and VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair, and wanted something that would put voluminous curls that last all day, or at least 5 hours.</li>
            <li> the super jumbo rollers are completely worthless.  </li>
            <li> There was no curl and little body!</li>
            <li> Uncontrollable medium thick hair down past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I mean as I just said, JUST SLIGHTLY DAMP.</li>
            <li> Another thing, the pins they give to hold the hair onto the rollers \\&quot;are\\&quot; a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> When I took them out after they cooled, I had to use my curling iron to fix the crimps in my hair, and there was very little wave after an hour.</li>
            <li> These curlers created way more volume than I like, giving me terrible helmet hair.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve purchased these rollers for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this four stars is that the clips they sell with the rollers are useless.  </li>
            <li> All my sets in the past have had a place to hold the pins.  </li>
            <li> Also the clips are to small and don&#x27;t stay on head well.</li>
            <li> Forget curling irons, they cause severe hair breakage and destroy your hair!</li>
            <li> Medium-thick hair, just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> However, the rollers are so difficult to use, I finally gave up on them.</li>
            <li> It is just past my shoulders now.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m too lazy to try it, but I&#x27;ve seen movie stars in magazines with cans in their hair, so it must work,</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m too lazy to try it, but I&#x27;ve seen movie stars in magazines with cans in their hair, so it must work,</li>
            <li> Usually I turn them on and let them heat up while I&#x27;m blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I took out the first roller and was  immediately disappointed with the curl.</li>
            <li> it was too frustrating trying to get them to stay w/o slipping.</li>
            <li> However, maybe it is only my type of hair that makes this product difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I tried these rollers for the first time yesterday and was really disappointed in the instructions and handling the rollers.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the clips, but I already had plenty from my old set that I preferred.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like the metal pins that come with these.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about going back to the \\&quot;rollers\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> I do love the way my hair look (and I generally hate my hair!)</li>
            <li> Other brands have at least 4 very small curlers that I never use.  </li>
            <li> I got these from my husband for Christmas this past year.</li>
            <li> although I will say I usually use seperate plastic roller clamps instead of the clips provided.</li>
            <li> The only design flaw- no clip holder which I find just weird.</li>
            <li> ill give them another week before i return them (trying out different methods.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend though as it gives my crazy curly hair soft waves</li>
            <li> I would like to have my money back since the rollers are now useless.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, if I put a brush to my hair, its frizz central.</li>
            <li> BUT......the pins are so small they do not hold the rollers in place on your head.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint&#x27;s are, that it is somewhat difficult to keep them in place on your head.</li>
            <li> difficult to tell the clips apart, the jumbo should have been in a totally different contrasting colour, now is confusing and hard to differentiate from the others.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the roller clips are very poorly designed and don&#x27;t keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and curlers don&#x27;t usually hold.  </li>
            <li> I have very heavy hair and have always had a hard time finding curlers that work.  </li>
            <li> The waves I get are a little weak</li>
            <li> And every single time I travel I forget the pins at home (rendering the curlers useless) because there is no attached storage for them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different curlers in the past to curl my hair and these are, by far, the worst of the lot.</li>
            <li> and yes, the clips are hard to work with</li>
            <li> I have been reading reviews here from people who commented that the clips were hard to use or that the rollers fell out of their hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally really hard to curl and theses did not do a thing to change that.</li>
            <li> Also hard to keep them pinned in the hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had an automatic \\&quot;off\\&quot; switch - but they&#x27;re hard to find in electric rollers.</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl hair and</li>
            <li> The clips did not hold the roller well and were hard to place without jabbing the scalp.</li>
            <li> The clips are hard to take out.</li>
            <li> Now this was a gift for my sister who has hair like a horse thick, curly and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> The clips are my biggest complaint.  </li>
            <li> Also, even though I rolled the hair on the rollers smoothly, my hair came out with awful crimps!</li>
            <li> - Turn on my curlers for AT LEAST 15 minutes before I will use them</li>
            <li> purchased the ConairPro Pro Clips to hold the rollers because I have never liked using the wire clips.  </li>
            <li> And even then, it loses the curl after about an</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll wind up pedaling alongside Leo but at least you&#x27;ll have his girlfriend&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> I echo the concerns of others that the lid hinge is delicate (a.k.a. \\&quot;cheesy\\&quot;).    </li>
            <li> BUT...I also have a complaint about the clips.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend that any one buy this product - it is potentially quite dangerous -  </li>
            <li> She complained that she could never find them in the store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different placement, dirty hair, etc.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smoke, but it stinks.</li>
            <li> The cord will not stay wrapped around the indented base, although it looks like it should, and it would be much easier to carry the case around if it did.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair just below the shoulders</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair - lots of body.  </li>
            <li> I have thick,  medium-long hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, chin-length hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for thick hair though</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not meant for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have fairly thick hair to my mid-back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets: I have A LOT of thick hair.</li>
            <li> The Conair set is difficult to travel with due to the size.  </li>
            <li> Due to the products failed use, I even attempted to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed these came with the old fashioned wire clips instead of the newer claw type clips shown in the product image!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the box was recycled with the other Christmas boxes</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a small drawback!</li>
            <li> They are thin wire and too small for the biggest rollers and, if you can get one to stay on, it flys off, ending up somewhere across the room...  </li>
            <li> When I first tried these Conair rollers, I HATED the clips.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this rollers heater heats up the rollers in a very small amount of time, and then does not burn my head once I place them on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I put a very small amount of hair on each roller, which meant that I had to section off my hair into three parts and curl one at a time and reheat rollers in between.  </li>
            <li> The opening down the length of the roller makes it difficult to insert the pins and there is no place to hold the pins.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the roller clip things they give you to use are hard to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have preferred a temperature controlled version of this product and am sorry that I gave my sister my previous multi-sized roller set that DID have temp</li>
            <li> Seriously they are as helpful as trying to use clothes pins or scotch tape for trying to keep your rollers in place.   </li>
            <li> I ordered these rollers from Amazon because they were less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if I can do this I think anyone can.</li>
            <li> I seriously had no idea what i was doing.</li>
            <li> I even bought the white comb clips (which left horrible creases by the way.)</li>
            <li> Worst hot rollers ever!  </li>
            <li> and I am also in the middle of growing out a bad haircut.  </li>
            <li> Overall a bad design: if the rollers won&#x27;t stay in place, they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> They were an expensive waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, but I hate blow drying my hair</li>
            <li> The metal clips are completely awful and do not hold your hair at all, the end up falling right out.</li>
            <li> I am desperate to purchase additional clips like the ones that come with this set to use with other sets that came with either the wire clips or the butterfly-teeth clips.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish there was a spot somewhere in the base to store them.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of hot rollers for decades and these are the worst I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The clips that are included are pretty bad though, they are metal and yes, they burn!!  </li>
            <li> These are without a doubt the worst hot rollers I have ever owned/used.  </li>
            <li> The clips are very hard to get to stay in.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are very hard to put in because there is no room for your fingers to work without getting burned.  </li>
            <li> for the draw backs: there is no place to store the clips in the container which I find really odd and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I think the wire holder things are tough to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> They are hard to use and leave weird wrinkles in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the secret...</li>
            <li> also, the wires that were supposed to hold the hair on the curlers did a poor job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a poor design.  </li>
            <li> The cover for the curlers was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, poor product redesign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and the clips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these rollers for approximately a year.  </li>
            <li> I know that has nothing to do with the poor performance of this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair and was skeptical</li>
            <li> Then I tired it with my hair straightened, it was even worse.</li>
            <li> My hair feels thin to me</li>
            <li> hair is thin and it isn&#x27;t damaged by these curlers.  </li>
            <li> The rollers work well, but I&#x27;d suggest these for people who have thin and lank hair.</li>
            <li> They have all broken.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with this purchase because of the very poor quality of the clips.</li>
            <li> It was a very frightening situation and now I think they are dangerous and aren&#x27;t meeting the safety standards for such appliances should.</li>
            <li> - an errant little object goes flying across my bathroom in a flash, zipping discourteously off my head and onto the floor.</li>
            <li> Yeah, well... it takes me three times as long to curl my hair with these because the stupid wire clips do not hold the rollers at all.</li>
            <li> There was an awful smell when they heated, so Amazon sent me a new set, and picked up the damaged one.</li>
            <li> These were expensive and disappointing don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This makes it nearly impossible to firmly hold your rollers in place.</li>
            <li> , I bought these rollers and they suck almost as bad as the 1997 poky ones (on the plus side, they were less expensive).  </li>
            <li> Did not curl my hair and they got tangled in my hair in the process, not worth the price at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying and too cumbersome and unpredictable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as these were the only rollers I could find that were close to what I&#x27;m used to using.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Does not work well with thick heavy hair; was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The design for this product is flawed.</li>
            <li> The rollers appeared to heat up well, however, I don&#x27;t know if they would curl hair or not as the clips were 100% useless.   </li>
            <li> Needless to say those got thrown out.</li>
            <li> The ones that come with the rollers are useless.  </li>
            <li> The results came out poofy and weird looking on my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the rollers will not stay in.</li>
            <li> I know sounds weird to buy curlers to help straighten hair.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD, I would not buy them!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am using them wrong</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clips are also difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, those clips that come with the rolls are incredibly useless.</li>
            <li> i was so sad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work well with my hair.</li>
            <li> The return was difficult.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and so I didn&#x27;t find them difficult to use -</li>
            <li> The pins that hold the rollers in are difficult.</li>
            <li> Or else your curl will come out weird.</li>
            <li> A fire almost ensued within 30 seconds of my turning it on, which was quite frightening.</li>
            <li> The grove in the roller to hold the roller on the heating element makes it difficult to get the clip over the roller: the clip gets stuck in the grove.</li>
            <li> I get bored and want a change before anything has ever not worked on them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these rollers don&#x27;t stay in at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the metal clips are useless, rendering this product to be useless.</li>
            <li> *are* difficult to work with, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic tops were lifted up, they had popped upwards a bit, and when I used a towel to grab a few rollers off the base to inspect them, their bottoms were all sticky melted and literally separated from the flocked part of the roller.&lt;br /&gt;The two rollers I had in my hair</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to hold in place on my head.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair from the medication I take for diabeties</li>
            <li> and it opens up, but they are very thin and do not hold well at all.  </li>
            <li> Very poor engineering / design.....</li>
            <li> These rollers do not heat up and are the worst excuse for hair rollers I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were completely worthless, thus the rollers being worthless and figured I would send them back and try another set.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist I can tell you that dirty hair will not hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> and then people wouldn&#x27;t be so unhappy with the hooks.  </li>
            <li> sorry ladies!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a problem with the wire roller pins at all, the curlers stay in quite nicely, unfortunately, the hair rollers just don&#x27;t work well :(  </li>
            <li> I found them impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> for the price I guess it&#x27;s not too bad of an investment.</li>
            <li> Its to bad tho</li>
            <li> These clips are so bad they are offensive.  </li>
            <li> just the pins are bad.</li>
            <li> The bad news is that they&#x27;re a pain to keep in.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this product zero stars because that&#x27;s how bad it is.</li>
            <li> Bad deal.</li>
            <li> Grrrr....</li>
            <li> The rollers kept coming undone and pulling my hair which was really painful.</li>
            <li> And I often get frustrated when they won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Then I bought the Conair CHV14N Jumbo Roller set and was soon frustrated by the stupid pins included with the rollers.  </li>
            <li> i had to use clips. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these curlers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so disappointed in a product.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> While I like the jumbo-sized curlers so much, it&#x27;s a real disappointment it&#x27;s so dangerous to use it.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased :(</li>
            <li> This link taught me all I need to know: [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I did like them.</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;ll be a pain to return, I may buy claw clips and see if that helps, but I&#x27;m really disappointed that, as is, these rollers are not usable.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> They burnt my scalp and were very painful to use, had to return them since they are dangerous to continue using.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Very dangerous.</li>
            <li> I do not know how anyone can keep the curlers in with those stupid pins.</li>
            <li> These clips are completely worthless.</li>
            <li> i just hate these rollers and wish i could return them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the clips as I hate the wire things that it comes with the rollers.</li>
            <li> and I hate it.     </li>
            <li> As of now I have worthless set of rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I hate my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I want to add my agreement to the rest of the people who found the clips included with this product absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> The clips are prices of crap.</li>
            <li> looked at the rollers still in the base - they were literally MELTING and BREAKING APART!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, these rollers do have a dent/split design on them, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry that I did!</li>
            <li> The clips aren&#x27;t bad either, they&#x27;re not those chintzy pins, so bonus points for that!</li>
            <li> I find that very annoying.  :(</li>
            <li> BUT i would purchase clips too because i hated those metal fish shaped clips.     </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the results here.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But the worst thing is the clips that came with it!</li>
            <li> They leave horrible indentations....</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair-curling product I have ever come across!  </li>
            <li> The clips are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Cons:        Pins to hold in place: One of the worst things about it.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair with lots of layers and my hair is VERY THICK!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The clips however, as others have stated are awful.  </li>
            <li> I have tried giving them 5, 10, 15 and on one annoyingly boring day, 33 minutes to heat up</li>
            <li> Hair looks terrible with crimp marks.  </li>
            <li> These are horrible.</li>
            <li> Real disappointed in the pins.  </li>
            <li> The clips are horrible, horrible, horrible.</li>
            <li> the pins are terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> These rollers are awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this set on sale yesterday from Target------a horrible disapppointment!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Worst rollers ever!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this set for taming my horrible hair.  </li>
            <li> the pins are horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Heat up fairly quickly</li>
            <li> The fasteners crimp your hair especially if you have very thick or long hair. Heat up time is very quick!</li>
            <li> Love the two different sizes. I usually do the front and top layers of my hair with the larger ones and the rest with the smaller ones. Heats up quickly. Not the fanciest hot rollers but perfect for a teen or someone who only uses them every so often. Overall good quality.</li>
            <li> My best friend loves them! she uses them everyday and they make her hair look great.  She even got another set</li>
            <li> Really happy with them.  My hair comes out amazing!  I had the other Conaire hot rollers in the multiple sizes but wanted the large and jumbo size for more volume and larger curls. The best part is that it is so easy and fast and it looks like you spent a long time styling your hair.  It is so shiny and bouncy.  I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Work well but would be nice if they would add an extra clip. Cost to replace is 25-30% of the cost with freight added.</li>
            <li> use them all the time and they work great they heat up and help me curl my hair in the morning</li>
            <li> Alright so I was looking for some curlers and I found these. They heat up incredibly fast and have those metal clips instead of the plastic clamps that leave crimps in your hair. The curlers seem pretty durable (as I just got them and already dropped one on the tile...oops). I recommend these curlers to anyone, especially people with long thick hair like me!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, heats quickly, roller material is easy on the hair.  The curl lasts twice as long if the rollers are allowed to cool completely before removing.     Overall these rollers are fine, but several small things keep them from greatness.  The cord will not stay wrapped around the indented base, although it looks like it should, and it would be much easier to carry the case around if it did.  The plastic roller clips are comfortable, and rather ingeniously shaped.  Easy to clip on, but the roller has to be level on your head; otherwise the grip will not be secure enough to keep the hair or the roller in place.  The clips pop apart when dropped, and go back together easily.  There is no room in the case for clip storage, although there would have been plenty of room in the lift-off lid.     My hair is cap-sleeve level, and these rollers give nice body, volume and curl.  It&#x27;s a real worth it fifteen or twenty minutes. I think this set will be a keeper.</li>
            <li> These curlers are alright.  They heat up fine and curl good but the clips that are provided don&#x27;t hold my hair.  They need to improve those. But other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers on a regular basis for more than 10 years.  I have been using Conair&#x27;s older model with large rollers similar to this one and have loved them.  I was reluctant to try something new, but my set is getting so broke down it&#x27;s a pain to use.  This set was the closest I got find to what I&#x27;m used to.  I wish the rollers were all one size, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I don&#x27;t like the slit down the middle, but could live with it.  The rollers get much hotter than my last set and a few were burning my fingers while I put them in.  However, the biggest downfall that I can NOT live with are the clips!  After going back and reading other reviews, I think they must have changed the clips that come with this set, because other comments to not make sense.  My clips are gray, plastic, solid bulky hinge clips.  They take up so much room, that the only way to fit the next roller is to put the clip straight up away from your head.  When you do that, you get a HUGE dent in your hair!  It&#x27;s totally noticeable and completely unacceptable!  They did produce nice big curls that lasted reasonably long, but with these clips they&#x27;re not usable.  I ended up using the old school simple metal U clips from my old set last night.  I&#x27;m very disappointed as these were the only rollers I could find that were close to what I&#x27;m used to using.</li>
            <li> The rollers are exactly as described.  Cool to the touch with a velvety covering.  The clips that come with the rollers work really well in keeping the rollers in your hair - however, for my hair they left indentions.  I also bought the jumbo clips (extra) which don&#x27;t work as well as the ones that come with the rollers.  They also left indentions in my hair.  This could just be that my hair is so fine.  The disappointment comes in that the rollers just don&#x27;t get hot enough to make good lasting curls (they are limp at best) - and with my hair being so fine and usually curling too much - I can&#x27;t imagine that they would work very well on someone&#x27;s hair that is thick or coarse.</li>
            <li> I love these hair rollers.  I have been looking for jumbo rollers for years.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because for some reason the the hair clips pop apart and don&#x27;t stay together well.  I have similar clips from previous sets of rollers which I just use instead, but still these clips seem to separate quite easily.</li>
            <li> This is a true large roller set &amp; is perfect for longer thick heavy hair. They give frizzy hair a smooth look that lasts all day no matter the weather. I can&#x27;t use a curling iron &amp; good hot rollers are not easy to find in stores except for the small size. These were cheaper than the ones I bought at Walmart years ago. Very happy with this purchase. Only wish there was a small slot on rollers to hold the clips when not in use.</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair. These curlers created way more volume than I like, giving me terrible helmet hair. I tried rolling them in different directions, and nothing seemed to help. These are too jumbo for me. Would probably work better for someone with finer/thinner hair.    Pros: heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I gave this a two star simply because the clips don&#x27;t work.  I liked the rollers, but the clips are terrible....they are just too short to secure the roller because of the weight of the roller.  I like to set my hair and walk away to do other things while they cool in my hair.  Rollers just fall out.  Luckily I have pins and hinged clips from other roller sets (also Conair) or I would have returned the entire unit.  Crummy pins don&#x27;t work at all.  You have to purchase clips separately or use some from previous sets hoping they fit the jumbo roller.  The clip arms are 1/2 the length long than they were a few years ago when I bought a standard set of rollers.  Would have given 5 stars, but having to adapt clips takes a while.  I noticed that Amazon recommended that you buy the Conair Champion Salon Pro Roller Clips along with the curlers.  Feel like it&#x27;s a bit of bait and switch on this product.  I think products should be ready to use out of the box</li>
            <li> Very happy with the hot rollers.  Easy to use, warm up fast, and love the super jumbo rollers. They take the frizz out and are so much easier than using a curling iron or trying to blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I love the rollers, but the metal clips it comes with are completely useless.  They will not hold the roller in place.  If you order this product be sure to order the super clips at the same time.  I waited until I tried the rollers and then immediately ordered the Conair Super Clips.  I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  Other than the problem with the metal clips I am really pleased with the job the rollers does.  It heats up very quickly and you don&#x27;t have to leave them in for long in order to get nice soft curls.</li>
            <li> This item rated a 3 star as it is not exactly what I was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find anything with larger rollers.  My current roller set is very old and is a steam set with jumbo rollers (larger rollers than the Conair set in a small case).  The Conair set is difficult to travel with due to the size.  I would prefer a steam set with more super larger rollers and smaller case.  Otherwise, the item is doing ok.</li>
            <li> These rollers work really well for me. I have thick hair and curlers don&#x27;t usually hold.  These, however, work great on my hair. I have been using them as a second day option to make the style last.  I also love the wire clips, they don&#x27;t leave an indent in the curl.  Great product! Only negative for me is I wish there were more rollers in the set, I have a lot of hair so I will probably purchase another set so I can do all of my hair in one shot.</li>
            <li> Curlers are large, which is good; however, they don&#x27;t grip hair at all.  The pins to hold them in place burn your scalp.  I have tried them 3 times, but I plan to return them.  I would not recommend these.  They are equivalent to the old curlers from the &#x27;70s..no advances/improvements.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, medium-long hair. I let these heat for half an hour, left them in my hair for another half an hour and nothing. Maybe a slight bend in my hair. Also, the dimensions are off. They are not 1/1/2 and 1/3/4 inch diameters but about a quarter inch smaller overall.</li>
            <li> These were OK, they curled my hair pretty good.  But I was most frustrated because there is no little door or compartment to hold the wire holders.  So my curlers are in one part of my bathroom, and my holders are in a drawer.  Not convenient.</li>
            <li> First of all, it took FOREVER to be delivered-4 days after the posted expected delivery date.  The rollers have a big slot running through the middle of them so that they fit over the heating element so they heat up nicely. However this allows my hair to get caught them. But the worst thing is the clips that came with it! They are thin wire and too small for the biggest rollers and, if you can get one to stay on, it flys off, ending up somewhere across the room...  these clips DO NOT hold any of the the rollers in place.  I called the company and ordered different clips but the customer service rep sent me the SAME thing! so, now I have 20 clips that don&#x27;t work!   I called again and this time I was informed about a \\&quot;clam shell\\&quot; type clip that fits over the rollers and I would have to pay $10.00 extra to get them...so, I am now waiting for them to come.  If I had seen that this unit did not have the \\&quot;clam shell\\&quot; clips supplied with it I certainly would NOT have ordered it. I&#x27;m very sorry that I did!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s really long (almost to bottom of my breast). All my hair fits in the rollers given but I do suggest getting the white clips to use with the product. These do not \\&quot;curl\\&quot; my hair but adds great bounce and fullness to it. Heats up fast and curls fast too. I&#x27;m able to get the kids ready with the curlers in my hair, even though they are a little heavy because they are ceramic. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Love the large size but the first day I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in. If I moved my head just slightly they fell heavily down. My hair is fine and when I previously used the \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; kind of rollers they stayed in well.  However, with a little practice I learned how to slide the clips in so that they would keep the roller tight (and the metal clips work so much better than the plastic things.) To get it tight I have to aim the clip straight down-like a nail- and then take a 90 degree angle turn towards the back. Also my hair has to have some moisture in it to keep the roller tight.  Overly dry hair is a disaster. Rubbing in a little \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; hair conditioner makes my hair bouncy with these rollers and the bounce and the curl stays in ALL DAY.  Everything else about the set is great--the right amount of the two sizes to suit me. Quick to heat up and the felt on the rollers keeps me from burning my fingers (and I imagine, burning my hair.)</li>
            <li> The design for this product is flawed. The clips that hold the curlers on are: 1. way too short to hold the curler to your head, I had to use the clips from an old set or else it wouldn&#x27;t work and, 2. fall all over the place because there isn&#x27;t a place on the product to hold them. How hard would it be to create a few holes to hold the clips?&lt;br /&gt;The curlers do heat up pretty fast and I like that there are two sizes.</li>
            <li> Love my new set!  The newer version has metal U-shaped hair pins instead of the plastic hair clips.  It looks like Conair listened to customers that did not like the clips.  I&#x27;ve always used the U-shaped pins and have been very happy with them.  This set is also different as there is no on/off switch.  The only downside is that there is no compartment for the pins like in the very old models...so hopefully they will update the roller holder soon so there is somewhere to put the pins.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, because she really wanted a quick alternative to a curling iron, something she could leave in her hair while she does her make-up. She tried it for a week before returning it. Even with extra clips, the curlers would fall out. Her hair is naturally curly and usually holds a curl for days, however her curls fell within minutes with this for some odd reason. This is the second conair product we&#x27;ve had to return. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy their products again.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, at or above the shoulder-length hair and a really hard head, these MIGHT work for you. But if you&#x27;re like me and have long, fine hair you might want to keep looking. Firstly, the the metal U-pins my set came with did absolutely nothing to hold the roller in my hair and were a wonky fit on the barrel itself. I hoped to solve that problem by purchasing separately a pack of plastic clamps/clips and it did work better, but I kept having to adjust them due to slipping. My second qualm is that the rollers themselves are ridiculously heavy. When I got them into my hair as best as I could adjust them to STAY, I had a headache within a minute just from the weight alone. And lastly, the \\&quot;curl\\&quot; was far less than expected. I specifically purchased this set, based not only on near-stellar reviews but because of the high temp max (compared to other sets) which is necessary for my fine hair to achieve a decent curl. But it made no difference; might as well have set my hair in ice cubes for all the good it did. There was barely a wave and it was entirely gone after 20 mins tops. Bummer. I really had high hopes for these.</li>
            <li> I just bought these a couple days ago and i absolutely love them!  My hair is past my shoulders some and straight with a teeny bit of wave.  I couldnt do ANYTHING with my hair for volume due to it being baby fine and these worked great! The curls come out great.  And its very fast.  It takes no time at all to get them rolled.  I put them in, leave them in for about 10-15 min (time to get my coffee in the morn and do my makeup) take them out, flip my hair upside down and kinda scrunch the curls, flip back over and viola.  My hair is full, shiny, soft and gorgeous looking.  I love them!</li>
            <li> I decided to go with this set because of the jumbo/large sized rollers. I have superfine hair and need as much volume as possible. I have a set of VS hot rollers that are not covered, and my hair slips right off of them.     When I first tried these Conair rollers, I HATED the clips. I thought they were completely worthless, thus the rollers being worthless and figured I would send them back and try another set. However, on the second try, I experimented a little with the clips and they work fine but are nonetheless a little tricky to get just right. I also looked around and found you can buy a set of claw-like clips made by Conair for the rollers that are much easier to use and typically more secure (for my hair thickness). They are about $10 for 10 clips (this set has 12 rollers). I haven&#x27;t decided yet whether I will buy the additional clips for the ease of rolling, but I am going to keep these rollers. Good luck!</li>
            <li> The product is great, but keep in mind that while some people complain that the rollers are too large, these are medium to me.  I have long hair and would love some rollers that would allow me to add volume and curl under the ends without creating massive curls.  I can&#x27;t do that with these.  They do add a sexy wave if I do it right, though!</li>
            <li> I use these almost every morning. They&#x27;re hot and ready to go in seconds. I like the nonslip surface of the curlers. Makes it so easy to set my hair, remove, and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style. I like having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick, long hair. These rollers rock!</li>
            <li> Considering I have very coarse hair, I was surprised it curled myhair the way it did.  The curls lasted a few hours considering I left them on for about 20 minutes maximum.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers, I would have rated them a 5 if not for the metal clips. So I ordered some plastic clips and thats that. I have very thin hair from the medication I take for diabeties so my hair falls out and its thining, I have tried every thing and these rollers make my short hair look full and healthy. Its quick and easy to use and Im so glad I have them. China from Fla.</li>
            <li> Great rollers, less damage to hair and awesome for my long thick wavy hair. But watch out for cracks in top.  Once rollers are heated leave the top open.  The rollers due stay hot enough to set your hair.  Leaving the top closed while heating for long periods of time will promote cracks in the plastic top withing a year.  I know I&#x27;ve purchased these rollers for the past 15 years.  You used to be able to order that part but now I don&#x27;t see that information on the papers that came with the set.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement item and I absolutely love these curlers.  The price is what drew me to the Amazon site and I already knew the products so it was a win-win situation,</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift &amp; she loves them. She has very thick long hair &amp; says this is the best curl that she ever had.  She said that they heat up fast. No waiting around like other brands for the rollers to get hot. They heat up in just a few minutes and are plenty hot enough to get the right kind of curl that you want.  A++++++++++++</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hope that I would FINALLY be able to turn my long straight hair into some beautiful flowing curls. No luck there. My hair returned to its completely straight form within an hour.  Due to the products failed use, I even attempted to return. Also no luck there. Don&#x27;t even bother with a purchase. You&#x27;ll be wasting your money AND time.</li>
            <li> I was excited to have only JUMBO rollers to us for styling and more than only 6 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set MEANS well but the rollers are so incredibly HOT to the touch (of both fingers and scalp) that they heat up the clips to the point of singeing hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred a temperature controlled version of this product and am sorry that I gave my sister my previous multi-sized roller set that DID have temp control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these clips SUCK.  They leave horrible indentations....would have been great to have been given the larger, claw type of clips that would accommodate the larger sized rollers sans the metal that becomes very uncomfortable to sport for longer than 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d return this but I&#x27;m too busy and I&#x27;ve used it......buyer beware of HEAT.</li>
            <li> While these do heat up quickly they do not work very well. I have very thick long hair and wanted more large rollers. These rollers do not provide a decent curl.  The clips did not work and I had to purchase 8 butterfly clips to hold the rollers in. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these rollers.    I will go back to my cheap clairol \\&quot;Set To Go\\&quot; rollers that work beautiful, I&#x27;ll just have to get another set as these only come with 5 large rollers.    These were expensive and disappointing don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and give big loose curls, but forget using the clips they come with. They&#x27;re more like clamps, so if you have fine hair, they will literally clamp wide ridges into the roots of your hair - exactly where you&#x27;re trying to create volume! What the roller giveth, the clip completely taketh away. So be prepared to buy the Super Clips, which are somewhat better (and you gotta love Conair - the Super Clips come in a set of TEN, although the roller set has TWELVE rollers). No accident, I&#x27;m sure. So if you&#x27;re okay with having 10 clips for 12 rollers and paying $10-15 more than you thought you would, these might be the rollers for you.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is down a little past my shoulders, and is of average thickness.  I bought these rollers looking for curlers that would give me softer, larger curls than I get with my hot sticks (those end up very tight and spiral-y!).  Weeell, these didn&#x27;t give me a curl at all!  All they did was make the very ends of my hair a little wavy, and didn&#x27;t do a thing to the top of my hair!  It was as straight as ever!      At first, I thought maybe I had put too much hair on each curler, so I tried just curling HALF of my hair with all 12 rollers, but got the same result: No curls, just a tiny bit of body at the ends of my hair.  I even left them in for 20 minutes instead of the recommended 10 minutes.  I know I let them heat up long enough, too, because a few rollers burned my neck.      This is the worst hair-curling product I have ever come across!  Even my grandmother&#x27;s foam rollers (that have no heat) work better than these things!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers and just tried them today for the first time.  The rollers appeared to heat up well, however, I don&#x27;t know if they would curl hair or not as the clips were 100% useless.   They would not stay in at all, and just moving your head a fraction of an inch sent them dropping to the floor. These clips are completely worthless.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the style I am looking for.  I have long, below shoulder length hair, that is fine.  This size roller gives me the body I need with a curl that is not too tight.  The only reason I gave this four stars is that the clips they sell with the rollers are useless.  I needed Conair SPC10R Super Clips to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with this set of hot rollers so far.  They create voluminous curls and heat up quickly.  The only drawback is that the clips aren&#x27;t the greatest in the world but that hasn&#x27;t affected the way the curlers have worked for me.  If I wanted to, I could find some other type of clip at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  I would buy them again.  I really like the results I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li> I like the rollers as they do a good job with creating volume in my hair.  They don&#x27;t do the best job of creating curls.  The clips are terrible.  I will be buying a new set of clips soon.  The clips leave a strange crimp on my hair.  Maybe I should experiment more, or just get some new clips.</li>
            <li> This version of these rollers is an update from a previous one.  Pros:  It has the same sturdy, flocked rollers and soft-tipped clips.  Faster heat-up than before.  Cons:  In this version, there is now no storage spot in the case for the clips.  I find that very annoying.  :(</li>
            <li> Great rollers that heat up fast but who invented the clips???? They are a disaster; I am using my older clips for a tighter hold. These newer clips do not work and one would think in the instruction booklet they would have a drawing to show you how to put them in securely. What planet are the folks from CONAIR living on??</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this kind of body forever, and finally got the guts to try these big rollers.  Don&#x27;t let their size intimidate you, they are wonderful! I have thick hair that is very fine, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it is to set my hair with these.  Smaller sets take forever, if you are being careful not to overload the roller, but this set can handle my large amount of hair.  I even have 1 or 2 left over at the end (out of 12 total).  They set quickly, and give you sexy waves and body that will last all day.      I agree that the set heats up very fast, but I find that the rollers placed in last (that are a bit uncomfortable to handle because of the heat) set the best curls, so if you know that your hair requires high heat, don&#x27;t be hasty.  You will appreciate how much better the curls set when you give it just a little more time to heat up!      I can&#x27;t say anything aye or nay towards the dropping of curlers and how they don&#x27;t fit in just right afterwards, but I have noticed that there are certain ones that fit in certain spots better than others, so if you purchase these and are having difficulties putting them back in the slots, try moving them around before you give up and just try to force them in.    So far, I am very pleased with this product, and would not hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers at Target on clearance for 19.99.  They are ok but b/c my hair is shoulder length they were too big.  I did like that they came in large sizes thougha nd they did heat up very quickly.  The clips are these plastic clips that you squeeze the ends and it opens up, but they are very thin and do not hold well at all.  I am returning thema nd going to try another set.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the rollers themselves are fine and a good size for thicker hair but if the clips will not hold them up then why bother?  Especially on the top of your head...they simply will not stay up and the curlers flop around.  Very disappointing.  Will be returning to Ulta.</li>
            <li> Gift for a daughter who loves these and her curls last for days!</li>
            <li> I always wondered how my colleague had such voluminous curls... so I finally asked her. When she told me hot rollers, the memories of my repressed childhood nightmares came to mind. I immediately pictured that family photo where my mother fixed my hair in hot rollers only to have my bob look like a mushroom. Now that I actually know how to put them in correctly, I thought, I should give it another go. After searching for the best rollers I couldn&#x27;t believe I kept running into this set... I thought for sure I would be spending an obscene amount for a best set. Reluctantly I ordered but immediately tested them the day they arrived. My life as we know it has changed forever. My hair looks perfect every time and I actually spend way less time than I ever did with a blow dryer and round brush on my super long locks.    I have long baby fine hair that is layered so I find it most difficult to achieve the perfect curl (and actually last all day) - also being that my hair is straight as a board. Here&#x27;s the secret... blow dry your hair (upside down for more volume)... There are 8 medium size rollers and 4 large in this set so... Start at the bottom of your hair line with three rolling under - One behind each ear then one in the center back (hairspray - tresemme is the lightest and best). Then do another row of three rolled under again (medium) above the same areas of the medium size. For the last two medium rollers - put on either side of your head at your temples rolling under. You should now have a wide row of hair on top - sort of like a wide mohawk... Start with the back and section evenly one at a time working forward to your face. Roll the pieces back away from your face. Douse with hairspray.. Let it completely cool (Put your makeup on, drink your coffee, relax!).. Remove from the bottom hairline up gently turning the rollers with the curl as you unwind it. DON&#x27;T BRUSH! Just work out your natural part with your fingers only touching your scalp. Spray and you&#x27;re done!You&#x27;re welcome!</li>
            <li> I ordered this roller set and it is NOT DUAL voltage. I ordered again because I was told by Amazon was dual voltage and again (2 time) received and is ONLY 120V.  Amazon should clarify this information so the client doesn&#x27;t trash time and money sending it back.  do\\&quot;t RECOMMENDed.</li>
            <li> these rollers need to have larger edges to hang onto and to keep hair in the roller area instead of being so flat and the clips are too fat, do not snug-up the roller to the scalp.  You have to use several clips in all directions sometimes then you don&#x27;t have enough.  Does not come with any extra clips. Get just hot enough, but not super hot, they cool down too quick. I wish I could find my old Clairol set I used to own.... Bought on Amazon, shipping was good</li>
            <li> love the concept, but my hair does not hold the curls.</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion, Conair has always made so-so products, but I suppose you get what you pay for. HOWEVER, this rollers heater heats up the rollers in a very small amount of time, and then does not burn my head once I place them on my hair.  At the same time though, my hair does not stay that way - perhaps it&#x27;s the hairspray that I used, you never know.  The rollers do add volume, but usually not for long.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th set of these rollers. They are the perfect size and the velvet covering keeps your air smooth with no frizz. The con in my opinion is this:&lt;br /&gt;I have to replace them about every year and a half but for the price I guess it&#x27;s not too bad of an investment. They get way too hot sometimes. The top of all of the sets I&#x27;ve had have eventually warped from the heat. I do not leave these on for an extended period of time. I plug them in while blow drying my hair, use them, then I unplug the set and put it away. The last set I had got so hot and overheated that the top melted and the plastic part of the curlers literally liquified. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I pulled a curler out of the set and the bottom of it pulled away like melted chocolate. Then a few of the other rollers melted in the set. I quickly unplugged it. Needless to say those got thrown out. I probably should&#x27;ve called Conair to tell them. Instead I went and bought another set. They are really good but don&#x27;t leave them \\&quot;unsupervised\\&quot;. I have not had a problem at all with this new set. I&#x27;ve tried others but until I find something better I&#x27;ll keep buying this one.</li>
            <li> I always liked Conair hot rollers and so when I needed to replace my old set I purchased more of the same.  The problem are the new clips that come with the set.  The clips simply do not hold the roller in place - let alone the larger super jumbo roller.  I had to purchase another type of clip to securely hold the roller in place.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of hot rollers for decades and these are the worst I have ever owned.  The opening down the length of the roller makes it difficult to insert the pins and there is no place to hold the pins.  All my sets in the past have had a place to hold the pins.  I travel frequently and must find a separate container to hold the pins.      I will replace these as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers don&#x27;t do anything.  There are no curls in my hair.  I have long layered hair and the rollers won&#x27;t stay in.  When I take them out there isn&#x27;t even any body. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This hair setter is modestly priced and has the larger barrels I like for my long hair.  But beware!  Extreme Heat means just that, and my scalp couldn&#x27;t take the heat for as long as I like to leave the rollers in (to get maximum curl).  I had to supplement my purchase with round makeup sponges, which I cut in half to fit between each roller and my head.</li>
            <li> Well i bought these because they were one of the top rated ones for people with long hair. This is the first set I have ever purchased.  They were supposed to create wavy sexy hair and they might of if I had more rollers or if my hair was not as thick. I have long (halfway down back) and very thick straight hair. I have so much hair that I need two boxes of hair dye just to cover it all...  I couldn&#x27;t get all my hair in the 12 rollers with my first try and with my second try I just jammed packed each roller. To no avail, the curl just fell out immediately. I guess I could have done two sessions or bought two sets but I don&#x27;t have the time or money. I have a toddler boy and little tolerance for spending too much time to get ready.  Its to bad tho cause I LOVED that this set had just jumbo and super jumbo rollers. Think they would be perfect for ALOT of people tho. They heated quickly and were super velvety.  BUT i would purchase clips too because i hated those metal fish shaped clips.     :( I returned them and am still researching what one I will buy now.</li>
            <li> The curlers themselves are great - very large compared to most you will find.  Very quick to heat up and they have a coating that makes the rolling of the hair easy to do.  If taken separately, I would give the curlers themselves 5 stars in a minutes.    The clips that come with these are a complete joke.  It truly seems like the good folks at Conair never even tried these before shipping them out.  Seriously they are as helpful as trying to use clothes pins or scotch tape for trying to keep your rollers in place.   These clips are so bad they are offensive.  I did get the super clips and they are OK but these rollers are so big they aren&#x27;t perfect either.     So if you don&#x27;t mind overlooking the fact that some team in Conair R&amp;D clip department must have been sleeping on the job and you are willing to find another solution for the clips and you are looking for big curls, these may be for you.</li>
            <li> Every time I use these hot rollers, I swear I will never use them again, and promise myself I am going to buy a new set immediately!! The clips are my biggest complaint.  They simply do NOT hold the curlers properly!  Grrrr.... I end up using two clips on certain areas of my head.</li>
            <li> I already have a Conair hot rollers (which I really like) with plastic clips the ones pictured on Amazon. The hot rollers I received came with wire clips. I wanted a new one. The wire clips do not hold the curlers in, they fall out.  The picture on Amazon shows the plastic clips come with the rollers.  I received the rollers 7/8/11 and the clips are wire...I cannot use them.    I would be happy if you sent the plastic clips. Otherwise I will return the rollers.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick yet fine hair and was looking for a solution to getting shape and volume on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  I was considering buying either rollers or the in-styler. After reading many reviews about the in-styler and that it often breaks quickly, I searched for good rollers and bought these.  I am VERY happy with this purchase.  I have used them several times per week since I bought them a few weeks ago.  I had been concerned about whether I had time for hot rollers, but it takes me maybe 5  minutes to insert them. FAST!    They come with the typical u-shaped roller pins, not the clips that someone added to the photos.  They stay in just fine - thank you to the reviewer who supplied the technique of putting them in at 90 degrees then pivoting them underneath.  I plug in then take a shower, then put them in a few minutes after the shower. They are plenty hot by that time. I leave them in for maybe 20 minutes - until cool - and I get big, lush, bouncy &#x27;curls&#x27;. I put curls in quotes because my hair does not turn out curly - but waves isn&#x27;t the right word either because waves makes me think of a perm.      No, they don&#x27;t have a place for the pins but I had a little zipper makeup bag that I got with a cosmetic purchase that I keep in my bathroom drawer.    These are great rollers and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> After purchasing 3 sets of rollers and returning all of them I WILL be keeping these!  I have medium to longer hair that isnt exactly what you would call thick but these work really well! They give wonderful waves without looking like you tried too hard! Definitley recommend!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing my first set of hot rollers. I started out with the other Conair set,(Xtreme Instant Heat) with the different sizes. It worked well and yes, the clips are hard to work with but ultimately I exchanged it for the jumbo (and SUPER jumbo) curlers because I have long hair. If you are trying to achieve lots of curls and your hair is on the shorter side, than the smaller sized rollers are perfect for you. If you are like me, attempting to get the Gisele Bundchen waves then the jumbo size curlers are perfect for that! The problem is not the curlers, but how you use them.      Your hair MUST be blown dry and even better if it was not recently washed. DO NOT straighten your hair before curling because although it may still work you are decreasing your chances of a perfect result. It takes practice to be able to use these properly, and yes the clips could be more convenient to use, but they are doable. Although the curlers can heat up in less than five minutes, I would give them at least ten. The longer they heat, the better they will hold your hair. Fifteen to twenty minutes in your hair is all the time you need. I honestly think that the people who gave this product bad reviews are just impatient and are expecting a perfect product, when one just does not exist in this category. Do not feel discouraged or afraid to use these, personally, I feel that they are more efficient than a curling iron.        CONSENSUS: I give this a solid four stars because I am still waiting for CHI or Sedu to come out with an awesome professional set that has no flaws, whatsoever. This is the only set that I have seen that comes with super jumbo sized rollers (over 1.5\\&quot;) which is really great for people with long hair. Do not hesitate to invest in these.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set after reading many reviews on many different products. I&#x27;m disappointed these came with the old fashioned wire clips instead of the newer claw type clips shown in the product image! I did not get what was described. This makes using the curlers much harder for me, the wire clips leave a mark in my hair. The rollers do heat up quickly and work well IF the correct clips were included I&#x27;d be very happy!</li>
            <li> I love finally finding hot rollers that are large enough for my longer hair as large roller sets are very hard to find.  However..they burn the heck out of my hands.  I have other rollers that don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s under the velvet covering but....ouch!  You really have to work fast. I&#x27;m constantly dropping them....very frustrating.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this set is the size of the rollers - just what I was looking for.  The clips that come with the set DO NOT HOLD AT ALL!!!  I complained to Conair and they sent me different clips....which don&#x27;t hold either.  I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for over thirty years - I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble with a set.  The rollers are not hot enough when the dot turns white, you have to wait at least another seven or eight minutes for them to be hot enough.  If you&#x27;re considering this set - keep looking.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat quickly..and are easy to use.Add curl or body to your hair in a quick fashion.Great price point as well.</li>
            <li> Dear Conair: What took you so long to make super jumbo rollers?  Most of the women I know have been wanting larger heated rollers for at least 10 years. To be even more honest you increased the size of four rollers and yet some how couldn&#x27;t possible figure out how to create a receptacle for the clips? Really?     This design as been around for at least 30 years and requires more functionality.</li>
            <li> Super fast heating time. Hassle-free, effective design - except for the fact that the pins often pop, rather, fly off the rolls once I&#x27;ve fastened them. It&#x27;s rather amusing, though not so efficient. i.e. I secure a pin over a roller, move on to the next roll, and - swoosh! - an errant little object goes flying across my bathroom in a flash, zipping discourteously off my head and onto the floor. While this causes endless entertainment for my cat, it&#x27;s not so fabulous for my coiff.</li>
            <li> I finally noticed that the super jumbo black rollers go with the black tipped clips.  The rollers get a lot hotter after about 10 minutes.  I have thick curly hair just below the shoulders and I style it in 2 ways:  One is to air dry - when completely dry I roll it - result is very soft subdued waves, not the big messy look I had with smaller rollers.  The other way is to blow dry it as straight as I can and then roll it.  My hair looked like a TV commercial - curved on the sides, the back had undulating waves, my highlights shimmered.  What a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Returned - did not work whatsoever</li>
            <li> I was looking for a large roller set for body and volume and thought this would be good after reading many of the reviews. After using it a couple times, it did not work for me and I returned it    Pros: Large roller sizes: The super jumber rollers (1.75\\&quot;) were too big for me but great from someone who has longer hair.        I did like the 1.5\\&quot; rollers.         Heats up quickly         Perfect number of rollers not too big not too small great for small storage spaces  Cons:        Pins to hold in place: One of the worst things about it. No matter what way I put the pins in or how many I used I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay! The rollers are big which makes them heavy and the pins provide a horrible hold at best.          Burned my fingers on both the rollers AND when I was picking up a roller on the slats they sit on. This has NEVER happened to me with the traditional rollers that sit on pegs. How are you supposed to use them if the rollers themselves get so hot?     I sent it back and am searching for something similar with more pros.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair and these rollers worked just fine. I agree with the other reviews...buy the suggested clips!  The ones that come with the rollers are useless.  I didn&#x27;t buy them at first, but went back and purchased them after one use.</li>
            <li> I like the way they heat up fast and are very comfortable. My only minor issue is that they don&#x27;t seem to make lasting curls.</li>
            <li> With almost-shoulder length curly but frizzy hair (not pretty), I needed something to smooth and defriz for 48hours.  The super jumbo size rollers work very well for both.  The set heats up quickly.  The clips are a little difficult to work with and the rollers are hot to handle but that is worth the results.</li>
            <li> These are THE BEST hot rollers for longer hair that I have ever used.  The larger size is perfect for adding body and volume, plus they heat up in less than a minute!  The first time I used them I got compliments on my hair.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> This worked and made my hair curly and it also did heat up very fast, but..... It doesn&#x27;t look good me. I have medium length hair with lots of layers and my hair is VERY THICK!!!!!! The results came out poofy and weird looking on my hair. It definalty will look good on anyone elses but for anyone who has hair like mine, I wouldn&#x27;t reconmend it. But for people who have thinner and longer hair, you should try it out because the curls would look beautiful on you!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Works like magic ;)&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants amazing curls!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these curlers to add some body to my hair - no curl, just body.  They do exactly that and I love the look that I get on those \\&quot;no shampoo\\&quot; days!  I only gave them 4 stars because the clips that hold them in aren&#x27;t totally effective-usually I have to use 2 which means that I can&#x27;t use all of the curlers; not a problem for me because I only use 6, but some people may be upset.</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas. I have wanted these for a while and I think I made the right selection.  If you want wavy sexy curls this set of rollers is the way to go.  They heat up very quickly, and create beautiful body and curls.  I have been reading reviews here from people who commented that the clips were hard to use or that the rollers fell out of their hair.  This is because the clips were not inserted properly around the roller.  Point the clip prong end first directly at your scalp around the roller and then pivot the clip around the roller. The rollers will be held tightly using this method.  Other commenters mentioned they ended up with no curl.  As a cosmetologist I can tell you that dirty hair will not hold a curl.  You must also wait until the rollers have completely cooled before taking them out.  This would seem obvious to most people.  Anyway, I LOVE these rollers.  I have used them everyday since receiving them for Christmas and everyone has commented on my gorgeous hair.  I myself have to admit I am able to create bouncy sexy curls and waves with these rollers and could not be more pleased.  The clips could be easer to use if they were the \\&quot;clamp\\&quot; type.  However, the ones that come with the set are perfectly fine if you know how to use them.  These rollers will keep me growing longer hair now that I can create the same styles I see in fashion without the bother of having to use a curling iron.  Perfect for those of us with long hair who are frustrated with the small size rollers that come in most hot roller sets.  These JUMBO rollers are great for long hair. I reccomend these rollers highly!  THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair and pretty long... and it works!  You really have to play with it, especially on how to pin them to stay on your head. It is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered these rollers from Amazon because they were less expensive.  They sent them to me, but they were the next model down that doesn&#x27;t have the new clips (it has the old metal pins) and it doesn&#x27;t have the ion shine mechanism.  I thought it was an honest mistake, so I returned them and had them send a replacement explaining my dilemma.  They very quickly sent me a new one, but it was THE SAME LESSER MODEL.    I explained again and sent it back for a replacement.  They sent me a note saying that they were going to refund my money instead and that they couldn&#x27;t help me.    Bait and Switch for sure!</li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fast. However, when removing curler from hair the curler can get caught in hair and it is a real pain to get off. Also the clips are to small and don&#x27;t stay on head well. The super clips work well once you figure out that the clips need to grap the hair closest to the head.</li>
            <li> Believe them when they say extreme heat.  Ends are too hot to touch and they burn my scalp unless I pad with cotton squares. It works better for me if I leave the lid up after they heat up.  The U shaped clips that comes with the set are a joke. They don&#x27;t hold the rollers at all.  I&#x27;m looking to purchase the cage types clips to try with it. Other than that they work as well as any others and they are larger than most.  I&#x27;m still hoping for 2 - 2 1/2\\&quot; rollers to hit the market.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this to replace my jumbo velcro rollers I use for volume.  I was hoping to get volume on the fly.  I have baby fine, somewhat thin shoulder-length hair.  Even with the recommended clips you buy separately, I could not keep these rollers in my hair even while standing still - kept slipping, sliding and falling out due to the weight of the rollers and slippery clips.  Be aware, what they call jumbo are really the large size velcro and their super jumbo would equate to jumbo size in velcro rollers. So it&#x27;s back to wearing 5 jumbo velcro rollers overnight on top of my head (it helps to use a roll pillow so rollers are not in contact with pillow or bed). The unit did heat up quickly and didn&#x27;t seem to burn my hair although rollers were briefly hot to the scalp.  Maybe if you had very, very thick fine hair, you could pull this off but even then, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it does not burn your fingers or scalp. I only wish it had more larger rollers.</li>
            <li> They work great.  The clips that are included are pretty bad though, they are metal and yes, they burn!!  So I&#x27;d recommend ordering some alternate clips when purchasing the rollers.  But the rollers themselves are awesome, they heat quickly and create nice curls.</li>
            <li> After many years, I have finally retired my old hot rollers and am very glad I did!  The velvet flocking on the rollers seems to be much gentler and I love the quick heat-up time.  My hair is medium length and the bouncy curls I get from using these rollers is great.  I occasionally use my flat iron and/or Instyler instead (when I have more time to fuss over my hair!) but these are definitely my everyday go-to choice.</li>
            <li> The curlers get extremely hot.  Thus, if you have fine hair, they burn your scalp.  The clips are very hard to get to stay in.  I am sorry I bought these and wish for a great replacement.  They do curl hair, so that&#x27;s a point on their side, and they are quick to heat up -- to a burning temp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought electric rollers in about 20 years... Unfortunately, recently my hair became&lt;br /&gt;Very damaged from being over processed at a salon. I was devastated, I lost 40% of my hair! Luckily, my hair was very very thick so no one really noticed except for me of course. These hot curlers work excellent! They gave my thin hair, extreme volume, bounciness , shine and looks like my beautiful healthy hair has returned ! Forget curling irons, they cause severe hair breakage and destroy your hair! If you are looking for full, extra body, soft looking hair, you need to buy these hot rollers.  They heat up fast and in 5 minutes you take them out and just run your fingers through or use a soft brush to style  your hair. Your hair will be gorgeous. I was ready to cut all my hair off, that&#x27;s how damaged my hair was.... These hot rollers really work like magic . They take out all the frizz! They come with hair pins, not clips, but very easy to use. I have medium long hair and the 12 rollers is just enough to set my whole head .</li>
            <li> Every girl needs a set of these. Big bouncy curls in my normally wavy-ish frizzball. Medium-thick hair, just past my shoulders and I had two rollers that I didn&#x27;t use. The velvety texture on the rollers make your hair stick but it was a little tricky with the layers; they kept falling out as I was rolling the longer hair. The clips are easy but don&#x27;t hold super tight, which is fine since I want waves not tight curls. I really like these!</li>
            <li> The smart clips that came with these rollers are not in the least bit user friendly.  I found them impossible to use.  The rollers themselves do heat up very quickly, but they get too hot.  I tried to use the smart clips and the new rollers for a week but then gave up.  I returned to my very old Conair Travel set of 5 Jumbo rollers with my old fashioned metal clips.  My new rollers have disappeared into the cabinet underneath my wash basin!</li>
            <li> I purchased these largely because of a video review of this set on YouTube; a major selling point for me was the clips shown (with a hinge).  I also saw these clips in the pictures.  The product that came is the same set, but I got regular U-clips which I have never had success with!  These are also the clips that are pictured on the box that the product came with.  I tried out the curlers and, of course, had trouble getting the rollers to stay on my head - they loosen up and fall out.  Now I have to spend another $10 plus shipping on a pack of roller clips that only come in 10-count, and there are 12 rollers in my set!  My second complaint is that I really need another 4-6 rollers to get all my hair rolled.  I have thick hair but it is only a little longer than shoulder length.  I guess I need two sets.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for myself as a Christmas present. I have long hair and when I straighten it, there is not much body. I hoped these heated rollers would do the trick. Unfortunately, the rollers will not stay in. I would secure one and when reaching for the next one, the first one would fall out. Sometimes I could get as many as three in if I was careful with my movements. The strands of hair I was able to get around the rollers did look good and had the body I wanted. However, the rollers are so difficult to use, I finally gave up on them. They were a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product works and does not work at the same time. This maybe because I have really long hair or something. The bottom part of my hair gets the curls but the volume I should have on my hairs does not come. But I like it it shows the curls on the bottom if your going for easy and soft curls</li>
            <li> i wanted to like this product but used it one time only.  it caught and ripped my hair. also, the wires that were supposed to hold the hair on the curlers did a poor job. i went back to my set that is 10 years old.  it is a conair also but does not catch and rip my hair and the clips work well. don&#x27;t change what works conair.</li>
            <li> Plugged &#x27;em in, the place filled up with noxious fumes and smoke that I could taste for hours. Tried again, same thing. And again. Sent &#x27;em back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased this product.Arrived just in 2 days.Was super excited to try it.I felt it works OK. Loved the way my hair curls. But the curls don&#x27;t last long, even though i put on the rollers for longer duration.But all in all, a good product for temporary curls.I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
            <li> i really wanted to love these but the wire clips that come with them alone have caused me so much frustration I can&#x27;t even put in words. I used to curl my hair with a flat iron and self grip rollers, basically warming up sections of hair, then rolling them, so I decided to get a set of hot rollers to make the process easier. Yeah, well... it takes me three times as long to curl my hair with these because the stupid wire clips do not hold the rollers at all. My hair isn&#x27;t super fine, nor is it super thick, it is just right in the middle, but apparently my hair is too \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; for the wire clips to hold the rollers in it. The rollers simply drop or fall out. I read to get claw (jaw?) clips with these to combat this issue and I will. Nevertheless, this gets a 2 star rating because I paid $30 for it and I don&#x27;t believe the frustration that comes with this is worth that much money. Also, the clips are an important part of this product and they SUCK. The rollers are okay, good for volume, which is all I want (don&#x27;t get these if you want actual curls, get smaller ones instead!)</li>
            <li> I purchased these when I had long hair and they were perfect. I have a lot of hair, and thick. I just cut about five inches from my hair and now it doesn&#x27;t work as well because I also have layers - I would need smaller rollers. If you are thinking of buying them these are a good catch :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because the standard size in this set are the Jumbo .  They get VERY HOT- much more so than any other so they take some getting used to. You really don&#x27;t have to leave them in for anytime at all.  I don&#x27;t like the metal clips that come with them as they don&#x27;t hold that well depending on how the curlers are placed but I have a plastic clips from another/old set that I use which work great.  You can buy them seperately - which I would recommend as they also hold the curler a little bit off your head which is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love the big rollers. The clips are great and made no marks on my hair. It does take a little more than 2 minutes to heat but is much faster than my other curling set. They are great.</li>
            <li> I loved these rollers!  I always have trouble curling my long, thick, asian hair, and when I do get my hair to curl it looks kinky and doesn&#x27;t last.  With these, the curls were soft, extrememly easy to use and lasted all day!  I also loved that all the rollers were the same size and there were enough for my whole head!  So easy to use, I have been using them everyday since I got them!</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are a snap to use, don&#x27;t have to stay in my hair long at all to curl, and warm up quickly.  I plug in the set before I wash my face and brush my teeth then by the time I&#x27;m done they&#x27;re ready to go.  I put the rollers in and as soon as I have them in, I start taking them out in the reverse order I put them in.  I&#x27;ve found letting the unit heat too long or leaving the rollers in too long produces not as nice results. For reference I have long hair that is on the fine side.  I use a shampoo/conditioner that is not super moisturizing as this helps the curl hold better, and I end up with big, wavy curls that with hairspray stay in most the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes doing my hair a snap; only takes about 10 mins out of my morning.  I love these and would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Bought them last Thursday, and I just got them in the mail today. Tried them out and I absolutely love them. I was not a hair roller person. My straightener was the only thing I would use. I did not know how to use them, but I looked on youtube and found a few tutorials and found they were quite simple. They make your hair shiny and give you extra volume. The curls are not tight they fall more like waterfall curls (unless you want tight curls) also I have thick hair and these worked perfect with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy hair and have always had a hard time finding curlers that work.  After reading one of the reviews on this product I decided it was the one for me.  The review stated \\&quot;That it gave the look of hair that had been curled under with a brush and hairdryer\\&quot;.  That is the look I wanted and I think (depending on the time you leave them in) you get that look.  They are the perfect size and my hair looks so much healthier when I pop these in my hair in the morning.  Finally a set for me!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly pleased with my recent purchase of the Conair Jumbo-Sized Heat Rollers.  They work quite well.  The price was great.  I compared prices before purchase and Amazon had the very best price.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> No on/off switch or auto-shutoff...plug-in only..but other than those two details...excellent sizes and heats up fast!  This is the upgrade to my previous which lasted approximately 3 years with frequent use.</li>
            <li> I liked the flocking on the rollers so my straight hair didn&#x27;t slip out so easily, BUT the wire clips scrape off the flocking. Also, the wire clips for the super-jumbo rollers are not long enough to stick out beyond the roller enough to hold the hair! The roller just flipped right over the clip and fell out. I tried it different ways and couldn&#x27;t get them to work. (I used rollers with these clips for years, so I know how to use them.)    Also, even though I rolled the hair on the rollers smoothly, my hair came out with awful crimps! I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because of the slot in the middle that goes all of the way through to one side the roller. Then there&#x27;s nowhere in the case to store the clips. Where do I keep them? Couldn&#x27;t they have made a slot so I could keep them with the rollers?    By the time I finished rolling my hair, the rollers were so hot as to burn my hands. When I took them out after they cooled, I had to use my curling iron to fix the crimps in my hair, and there was very little wave after an hour. I can&#x27;t stand these rollers, and they&#x27;re going back right away.</li>
            <li> only used item once but seems to live up to expectations. no crease marks if you use spring clips rather than metal clips provided. don&#x27;t snag hair. soft surface eliminates those \\&quot;kinked\\&quot; ends on hair that the regular plastic rollers leave. hair doesn&#x27;t slide out. only question mark is the heat. they don&#x27;t get as hot as my previous set but maybe they&#x27;re not supposed to- it may be the new technology. i&#x27;ve got hair to middle of my back so i need to leave hot rollers in a bit longer than shorter-haired people. they were just barely warm to touch when i removed them. i bought 2 sets to cover my whole head. because i wanted only wide diameter rollers all the same size.</li>
            <li> I have long, superfine hair.  I&#x27;m an avid user of hot rollers.  I bought these because I wanted more of a wavy effect instead of the perm effect and these rollers do just that.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No complaints, they work excellent. They don&#x27;t heat up to super hot, which is much healthier for my hair, not to mention they are a great price and Amazon shipped them to me for free.  Who can argue with that?  :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my hair but 1 or 2 times a year, but could used more curlers (my hair almost to waist) needs more hair pins in all the sizes, esp for the large curlers. For as little as I use it, it works. I&#x27;m sure I would be better with them if I did my hair more often. Could use a set of just big curlers only. Now my hair is curly so I use these to straighten with a light wave to it...I know sounds weird to buy curlers to help straighten hair. Smaller curlers gives curls, larger curlers give wave. Depends on what you want. Heat up quickly, a little tricky at first curling hair around curler, but get easier. Overall happy with my Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and hard to keep a curl.  This Conair Instant Heat curlers are the best!  It was easy to wrap my long hair onto it and used the large clips (sold separetly) to keep it in place.  It got hot within minutes of turn the unit on, the hair came out shiny and the curl held for a couple of days!!  I am impressed with Conair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these curlers for years. i have super curly hair, but fine, not coarse and they are great for when you want to have a more relaxed style. Just put some type of smoothing gel or cream into hair before setting blow dried hair (i do not blow out straight, just blow it to natural curls, then set). I love the new \\&quot;straighter\\&quot; look, as i&#x27;ve never really been able to get the look i want from using a blow dryer or flat iron to straigthen my hair. My sister uses these for the same purpose. We&#x27;ve always used hot rollers to \\&quot;uncurl\\&quot; our hair! Of course, our hair does not come out curl free, but with nice gentle smooth loose curves.</li>
            <li> Great for Long Hair.  They get hot very quickly, which is a big plus when you&#x27;re trying to get out in the morning. The curlers are all big, with 8 large and 4 very large.  They have no teeth so you hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled out along with the curlers.  I had this problem with my old set and must admit that I see a big improvement with far fewer split ends and frizzy fly away strands. The BIG DRAWBACK are the clips that come with the set to hold the curlers in place. They just plain don&#x27;t work.  I bought this set to replace one that was very old and sometimes failed.  I am using the clips from the old set which work very well on these. I would advise using the clamp type of clips if you have them, as they hold the curlers on your head without slippage. If it were not for the clips, I would have rated these curlers five star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for so long!!  They still work great and I&#x27;ll never give them up!  They are big rollers, bigger than normal, so I love it!!</li>
            <li> I like these because I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out and dont want alot of curl like the smaller hot rollers gives my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this rollers! All i have to do is put then in and let them sit for five to seven minutes and...there done! Volume Baby!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago and the lid has already broke. I emailed conair, NO RESPONSE! Your hair gets stuck in the middle of the rollers. NOT GOOD, I would not buy them!!!</li>
            <li> These rollers are a major upgrade from my last set.  The larger size of rollers leaves my past-shoulder-length hair wavy and smooth.      Thanks to the reviewer who linked to a how-to on Youtube.com - I never knew the \\&quot;right\\&quot; placement of rollers for creating waves.  Having watched my mom use hot rollers as a child, the clips were no mystery to me, and the product is well priced on Amazon.      I only wish they were easy to travel with, but the hard plastic box takes too much space in luggage.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy unless I brush it straight while blow drying and when trying to curl it, my hair is thin and silky making it difficult to roll up or keep in a curling iron.  Then I bought the Conair CHV14N Jumbo Roller set and was soon frustrated by the stupid pins included with the rollers.  They do not stay put and the roller gradually falls off.&lt;br /&gt;Allow me to describe; first, I grab a small clump of hair and using my fingers, manipulate the roller to hold the ends of my hair while trying to keep the ends from flying out. Finally, I suceed in getting the hair to stay in the roller (the roller is rolled up to the area of my ear, just trying to curl in the ends, not all the way to the root).  Then I reach for a pin and get it on there all right, begin work on the next clump of hair when the first roller starts to creep it&#x27;s way down, no longer horizontal, but becoming more vertical.&lt;br /&gt;Solution?  I went to Meijer&#x27;s and found some roller hinge-type clips for 5 bucks in a bag of 10.  Sure makes a difference.  Also, I am having trouble rolling up the back hair.  Any tips there?  My overall hair length uncurled is just below shoulder length.  Hope this helps.  I sure wish that Conair had included hinge clips with this set; the pins are practically useless for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I like these rollers they heat up fast and work great in my hair.  I have thick wavy hair - lots of body.  The clips however, as others have stated are awful.  They do not hold the hair well at all.  I have ordered other clips and hope they will work better.  One thing to note - there is no storage for the clips anywhere on the roller unit.  I have them in a velvet bag I had but it would be nice if they could be stored with the rollers like my old set.</li>
            <li> These rollers are heated through metal slots in the center. The roller part is very comfortable but the metal slot burns the scalp. I gave them to charity.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and I am trying to grow it out.  It is just past my shoulders now.  I stopped using my CHI and started just rolling my hair after it air dried.  The KEY is HOW you position and roll your hair to get that full,  bouncy,  loose bodied look.  I LOVE it and constantly get complements on my hair now I never used to get before.  Funny thing, I roll 90% on my hair UP on the rollers,  not under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who didn&#x27;t have good luck,  try that.  I promise a difference.</li>
            <li> this product gives great volume to layered looks. it does how ever take a bit to get the hang of using them.</li>
            <li> The rollers got far too hot for my scalp.  They burnt my scalp and were very painful to use, had to return them since they are dangerous to continue using.</li>
            <li> The bigger size is great for longer hair.  I get great, big curls and my hair is softer and shinier.  It does heat up quickly, as promised.  My only qualm is that the clips that hold the curlers don&#x27;t quite hold the curlers, at least with my thick, long hair rolled in them.  I have to use the old clips from my old curler set, but I don&#x27;t mind.  This set is quite nice, and it&#x27;s a great value for the price.  I&#x27;ve seen similar sets for $50 and more.   This is a great value.</li>
            <li> These are jumbo-sized rollers.  I&#x27;m ordering Conair&#x27;s smaller rollers for when I want more curl.  But these curlers gently (and quickly) style my hair in the morning.  One of the tricks is to limit the amount of hair wrapped around each curler.</li>
            <li> I really like these because they are \\&quot;big only\\&quot; rollers &amp; I can use all of them.  Just enough rollers for me, too.  Most others have medium &amp; small, which are too small for me and a waste of energy to heat.</li>
            <li> When I bought these curlers I was a little concerned.  I grew up using electic rollers and the slim metal pins to hold the curler. And boy oh boy, did I master those clips.  But I noticed that NONE of the new curler sets had the pins but new type of clips.  I have extremely thick and curly hair and tend to set my hair in specific direction to maximize control and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed that the new fangled \\&quot;clips\\&quot; would only work correctly in a certain direction other wise the curler would drop due to gravity.  They held floppy in my hair and I have to be careful not to move too much once they are in.  In some cases the clip left a \\&quot;dent\\&quot; in my hair.  Although I am getting better putting those clips in, it is not uncommon for it to go flying across the room.  I miss my old rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the manufactor created this clips to avoid other issues, but it just does not hold the curler to my head and my hair ends up frizzy within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will look for some new fangled larger clips that they sell seperately to see if this solves my issue.  If not, I will be scouring the internet looking for those old curlers with the metal pin.</li>
            <li> I bought the jumbo hair curlers as a quick and easy way to give my hair body during the busy morning. I really like the size of the curlers and they become hot in minutes, all positive. The frustration comes with the clips that are used to hold the curlers in place (low quality). The plastic clips are held together by a circular metal piece. They are constantly falling apart, as easily as it is to put them back together, but doing it repeatedly every morning, especially when you&#x27;re in a rush is just irritating. I believe that there are better quality product out there for the same price.</li>
            <li> I have the frizziest hair on the planet. Yes I know what you&#x27;re thinking but honestly, take my word for it I do. Maybe the frizziest hair in the universe. Uncontrollable medium thick hair down past my shoulders. I used this product and it was absolutely wonderful. I did not experience any discomfort using it, it was not that hot at all. It was pretty easy to use as long as you do what the first reviewer Joanna suggested. Put the clip OVER the curler on top and rotate it into the best possible position. MAKE SURE YOU LET THE CURLERS COMPLETELY HEAT UP FOR 5 MINUTES AND THEN LEAVE THEM IN FOR 20 MINUTES FOR BEST POSSIBLE RESULTS!!! And don&#x27;t cheat. USE ALL THE CURLERS (or most of them, there are 12, plenty for all your hair, won&#x27;t work as well if you use just a few cause you&#x27;re in a rush). My hair came out without a drop of frizz in long wavy slightly curly strands. And with LOTS of volume. Looked great!! I definately recommend this product for people like me and even, as I have seen, for people who have very straight baby fine hair. Very well made product.</li>
            <li> These rollers gave me bouncy soft curls that lasted for days. They heat fast too. Be careful when you pull the rollers out of their slots since the edge of the rollers are a bit hot. The pins used are standard type roller pins. It takes some practice to use the pins, especially for someone like myself, who doesn&#x27;t have much experience with using hot rollers.  I also like the velvet outerlayer of the roller. It&#x27;s gentle on the hair. Overall a very good product. If you want a basic hot roller that does the job, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> My sister wanted curlers for Christmas - but \\&quot;JUST the big ones, I never use the small ones\\&quot;.  So when I saw these I figured it would be just the thing.  She LOVES them!  She&#x27;s been raving about them ever since.</li>
            <li> These things are pretty awesome. I have pretty long hair and it handles it. The only bad thing is that the roller clip things they give you to use are hard to use. It took me a few tries to get them to hold the roller in place.</li>
            <li> I have thick,  medium-long hair. I don&#x27;t have the patience to use a curling iron, so I thought I would try these.  They are ok, I use the curling iron more now that I appreciate the outcome. But when I have to get stuff done before I leave, or I can lay down, I will use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they do work and give volume, but you better get some hair spray (or the curls last like 10 minutes)! Also, if you put a product in your hair before you use these, the curls will stay. When I cut my hair just past my shoulders, the curls were PERFECT! I think my hair is just too long and thick for them to make much of an impact. Some of the hair keeps the curls, and some just comes out wavy. I don&#x27;t know if I am using them wrong (they warm up so fast! and I keep them in my hair for at least 30 minutes while I make lunch, iron, and clean up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They would get an extra star if they came with clips or something that could actually hold the rollers up. The pin things that they come with do NOT work unless you stand perfectly still for the next 30 minutes. Go to a beauty store and get some, but bring one of these in, so that you can make sure that you buy the right size. They are big, so you might also want to invest in a sturdy shower cap to keep them from banging around while you move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this as a gift to a tween who I feared would burn their neck with an iron. Also, I heard the pink, regular sized rollers have a better outcome. Also, to get better results, I would get two sets, as I think the amount of hair I put on the rollers dilutes the results. One day, I curled the front of my hair, while I had rollers in the back of my hair. That day, my hair looked like a super model!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, maybe about an inch past my bra strap in the back.  It&#x27;s not thick or thin.  If I don&#x27;t blow dry it, it ends up partially wavy/straight/curly, and frizzy (not nice looking!).  It&#x27;s a pain to always have to blow dry it, and my hair lacks volume.  I see people with gorgeous, full hair, and they don&#x27;t even have to blow dry it.  Why can&#x27;t my hair be like that?!      For whatever reason, I thought of trying hair rollers...    Over the past two weeks, or so, I&#x27;ve tried several different types of hair products, and combinations of them, to use with the hair rollers until I found what works for me.  I thought I would share in case it helps anyone else.      When I first started using the rollers, it would look great initially, but then it would fall out within 20 minutes.  Sometimes, if I used the curlers when the curlers claimed to be ready (after only two minutes of heating), it wouldn&#x27;t hardly leave a curl in my hair.  But I&#x27;ve figured out what works for me.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll be helpful to some people.  And, the new way I do my hair, I never have to blow dry it anymore.  It&#x27;s awesome!    Here&#x27;s what I do:  - Before bed, I shower.    - I towel dry my hair, and then add 3-4 squirts of \\&quot;Big and Sexy Blow Dry and Volume Gel\\&quot; (I&#x27;ve tried different gels, and none have worked as well as this one!)    - Then I go to bed with wet hair and wake up with a mess of hair.  It&#x27;s fun because I know it&#x27;s going to look good in about 30 minutes.    - Turn on my curlers for AT LEAST 15 minutes before I will use them (otherwise it&#x27;s not hot enough).  If you leave them on for a long time before using them, it does get pretty hot.  Sometimes it&#x27;s almost too hot to hold them.  So, about the time I&#x27;m ready to use them, I&#x27;ll open the lid for a minute or two before using them, and it helps not burn my fingers.    - I put the curlers in my hair like this video says to do (thanks to the previous poster who left this video!  It&#x27;s helped tremendously).  Here&#x27;s the video (in case the link gets deleted, the name of the you tube video is \\&quot;Beauty How To: Soft, Sexy Curls with Hot Rollers\\&quot;.  You can search on you tube for it):  &lt;...&gt;    - With each bunch of hair that I gather to put in a roller, I spray it first with \\&quot;Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray\\&quot;.  I spray it on both sides of my hair as I hold it up getting ready to put it in the roller.  I make sure to spray the whole strand.  This is important because at first I only did one side, and I also tried using less of the spray.  But in order to get it to work and hold the curl, I needed more.  I also tried doing this without the gel, and it didn&#x27;t work.  I was worried if I put too much in, it wouldn&#x27;t dry in time, but it does.  (I make it lightly damp, not dripping or anything!)    - I use a combo of clips.  As I was buying this product, I saw that some people like the \\&quot;claw\\&quot; clips and other people prefer the wire clips.  I had no idea what I would prefer, so I went ahead and bought the claw clips so I had the choice.  I use both types.  On the top of my head, all of them are claw clips that I use (make sure you put them on correctly, and they won&#x27;t let your hair fall out of the roller or flop around on your head.)  The claw clips I bought are the Conair SPC10X Super Clips.  It only comes with 10, but I use 12 hair rollers, so at least two are always wire clips.  I don&#x27;t use the wire clips on the top of my head, but I will use them around the sides/back.  I&#x27;ve found them to work great too.  I can&#x27;t decide if I like the claw clips or the wire clips better.  The video shows you how to use both of them.  Sometimes I have to use two wire clips on the same roller - coming from both directions - and it&#x27;ll help hold the roller still and in place.    My only complaint is that with my hair (maybe other people&#x27;s hair is different), I need two more rollers.  When you watch the video, you see how she does the top, then when you go to the sides, there are two \\&quot;special\\&quot; spots on each side ofyour head that she says to go ahead and put rollers in.  I don&#x27;t have enough rollers to do those spots.  So, I don&#x27;t.  It still works good.  But two more rollers would have been nice!  It&#x27;s not enough of a problem for mark it down from 5 stars, though.    - Anyway, once it&#x27;s all on, I just wait until all the rollers are no longer warm.    - Then, I take my hair out.  I start with the bottom/back first and work my way up.  I unroll them carefully so they keep the curl that was made.      - Once I get all of the rollers out, I will spray it with \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair Spray &amp; Play Volumizing Hairspray\\&quot;.  (I&#x27;ve tried different hairsprays, and for whatever reason, they really don&#x27;t work as well.)    Often on the top of my head, I feel like it&#x27;s a bit flat - like I need more volume up there to balance out the curls and make it look really nice and full.  My hair has a tendency to be really flat.  I found this awesome powder stuff that works AMAZING.  It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing &amp; Texturizing Powder\\&quot;.  I pour a little powder onto my fingers, flip my head down, and work it in my roots.  I&#x27;ll do it a few times in different spots to get everywhere that needs some lift.  I don&#x27;t know how or why it works, but it adds strength and lift to the hair.  It&#x27;s awesome stuff.  I love it!  My hair is no longer flat.  It&#x27;s lifting up and full looking - it looks MUCH thicker.    I promise I don&#x27;t work for Big &amp; Sexy hair products!  hehe.  I realize most of the products I&#x27;m suggesting are from them.  I&#x27;ve never even heard of these Big &amp; Sexy products until the last couple weeks, and for those will bodiless hair - these are THE products to try!  I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I&#x27;ve been to learn about them.  They are a dream come true for my type of hair!  And, they really work.  It&#x27;s like magic.  I&#x27;m excited because after I have a baby, I lose a lot of hair, and it gets thin looking up on top (I HATE it, though my husband claims he can&#x27;t tell at all).  These products are a life saver (or will be, once this new baby is born!).    Anyway, then I do whatever I want with the curls - whether I want to work them out a bit or not.  It&#x27;s important to be aware that these cause BIG, LOOSE curls (that stay, if your hair is like mine, and you do what I suggested).  They are not going to be small curls since the rollers are so big.  They just give a whole lot of body and big curls.  I spray them a few different times with the Big &amp; Sexy hairspray.  These products have worked awesome for me with the rollers.  I like to pull back just my bangs and clip them back (I don&#x27;t really have bangs.  They are as long as the rest of my hair).  Then the curls look great.      It&#x27;s SO FUN to have my hair looking fuller and thicker.  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never had.  As I said, I don&#x27;t have thin hair (unless it&#x27;s after having a baby), but I do have flat hair.  I LOVE these rollers in combo with the hair products I mentioned.  I tried other hair products/combos, and they didn&#x27;t do the same thing at all.  I love having full, thick looking hair.  It&#x27;s so fun to do my hair every morning!  If you don&#x27;t want actual curls, you can work them out, or just leave the curlers in for a shorter amount of time (or don&#x27;t let them heat up so long).    I might come back and show before/after pics, but I haven&#x27;t gotten there yet.  If you&#x27;re not having luck, try different hair products.  Sometimes it&#x27;s worth paying for professional products because they really work better if you&#x27;re needing something specific.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for the wife and she loves it. Heats up super fast and holds the heat a long time. Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Bought these because I wanted the hot roller effect, but not 1980&#x27;s prom hair... The reason I gave these rollers 3/5 is two-fold; the clips that come with these rollers do NOT fit around the rollers. If you have any other conair rollers you&#x27;ll see the only difference in the sets of clips is their color... no size difference at all. This makes it nearly impossible to firmly hold your rollers in place. I highly recommend getting the suggested pro clips - as I resorted to mine to set my hair.     As for the rollers, they are nothing special - but the size is good, curl is nice and not overboard.  I have fine blonde hair, but a ton of it - I could&#x27;ve used a few more rollers to set all of my hair... had to finish the look with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> These curlers are wonderful. Great for long hair. Fast. Takes out the frizz. I leave them in for 30 minutes with setting lotion and then when I remove them I use hair spray. I do not comb my hair. Only with a pick. Otherwise my curl would fall due to the length. After a few days, my hair straightens but the frizz does not come back.</li>
            <li> i am happy with the product and use it several times a week</li>
            <li> I bought this to curl my hair because it got great reviews on amazon. I tried it and it won&#x27;t curl my hair AT ALL!! i can&#x27;t even figure out how to pin the rollers to keep it rolled up. Either way i tried holding the round thing with my hair wrapped around it and nothing happens. Maybe i&#x27;m just not getting it lol. Got the chi iron instead and so worth it!</li>
            <li> When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is my experience with the Conair instant heat jumbo-sized rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, straight, baby fine hair.  As my hair grew past my shoulders I found that the old roller set I had, with the brown velvety colored rollers (you know the type, your moms have this set and it comes with three sizes of rollers and flexy metal stay put holders) wasn&#x27;t giving me the big, bouncy &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; curls I wanted so I looked around and found this set with it&#x27;s jumbo rollers and instant heat styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, just to give you a little background, this isn&#x27;t my first ride on the jumbo-roller-express.  I bought a set of 8 jumbo rollers thirteen years ago, they were white, hard plastic with little poky things all around (I guess the pokies were meant to keep your hair from slipping off the rollers). They were an expensive waste of money.  The rollers didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything but make my head warm and the little pokies ripped my hair out (youch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward thirteen years, and I thought to myself, &#x27;maybe the technology has caught up with jumbo rollers.  I mean thirteen years ago we didn&#x27;t have Ipods, super colliders and bedazzlers, surely something as simple as big bouncy curls can be achieved at home now!&#x27;  I was pretty excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought these rollers and they suck almost as bad as the 1997 poky ones (on the plus side, they were less expensive).  There is a strange dent in my hair from these rollers, they have a split in the side so that they can slide onto the heating element and the slit coincides with the dent.  Speaking of heating, they don&#x27;t.  Heat up that is.  I have tried giving them 5, 10, 15 and on one annoyingly boring day, 33 minutes to heat up and they just are never hot enough to do more than put a fuzzy dimple in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the rollers on newly washed and dried hair, slightly damp hair, slightly dirty hair (skipped a day of washing) and nada, didn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrgh, anyway, I don&#x27;t know how to get big bouncy (and quickly styled hair) without having giant can rollers and a blow dryer (I&#x27;m too lazy to try it, but I&#x27;ve seen movie stars in magazines with cans in their hair, so it must work, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search continues . . .Arrgh, anyway, I don&#x27;t know how to get big bouncy (and quickly styled hair) without having giant can rollers and a blow dryer (I&#x27;m too lazy to try it, but I&#x27;ve seen movie stars in magazines with cans in their hair, so it must work, right?).    My search continues . . .</li>
            <li> Use these everyday.  Great curl.  Love these.</li>
            <li> I had almost given up on curling my hair until I heard about using hot rollers. I have very thick, straight, smooth Asian hair that is prone to not curling (and when it does it holds for only 20 minutes). These hot rollers are a godsend! They&#x27;re perfect if you want the Gisele type of waves in your hair.    PROS: It heats up very quickly, they&#x27;re only in large sizes for the sultry waves look, and holds your hair very well with the velvet coating.    CONS: there is a bit of a burning plastic smell each time you heat them up, you&#x27;re given the pins which are a bit difficult to use at first, there is nowhere for the pins to be held (no compartment or anything), if you have super long hair you might need longer rollers (my hair is about 4 inches below my shoulder and fits just right)    If this is your first time using hot rollers, I highly recommend watching this video as it shows you how to use them with the exact same set: [...]    The hair pins are a bit hard to get used to at first but please keep in mind that the hair pins come in two different sizes (one for the jumbo and one for the large rollers). It takes practice! It took me 3-4 tries before finally getting it right, now curling my hair is a cinch!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews-never had a problem with the degree of hotness or slipping or not enough curl. I have curly hair that can be frizzy. I wanted more professional, stylish look for work. These were perfect. I had the travel set (five rollers), but they don&#x27;t get as hot and there aren&#x27;t enough rollers. I didn&#x27;t want lots of curl..just volume, anti-frizz, and that&#x27;s exactly what these do. Also, got the jaw clips to use because they are just so much easier. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but I can freshen my hair with 2 or three quick hot rollers on the top..FAST FREE DELIVERY WITH AMAZON-EASY and great.A Keeper!</li>
            <li> So I bought the hot rollers a couple days ago. They are perfect and curl my hair in no time! I put them in the morning, brush my teeth, get dressed, and then take them out. My hair lies in perfect waves! The only thing I would recommend is buying the plastic roller clips separately, since the metal clips that come with the hot rollers absolutely do not hold my hair!! The plastic clips hold it in one place and fit both the bigger and the smaller rollers! Here is the link to the clips: http://www.amazon.com/Conair-SPC10X-Super-Clips-Count/dp/B000R87B1Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1334983781&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1</li>
            <li> They are all large rollers, which is what we wanted.  They heat up quickly &amp; are perfect for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted \\&quot;hot rollers\\&quot; for several years. Finally took the plunge and made the purchase. I&#x27;m very happy with the choice, it&#x27;s inexpensive, heats up pretty fast, rolls up nice (especially for we who are less experienced in rollers) it comes with instructions on HOW TO, that was a bonus for me. Great value, wonderful product. bscrandell</li>
            <li> This is a nice looking curler set, but the actual job it does is not what I was hoping for.  The curlers are very hard to put in because there is no room for your fingers to work without getting burned.  Also, I highly recommend purchsing separate clips because the ones that come with it don&#x27;t hold your hair very well at all.  I wish they would make larger rollers, but these are teh largest I could find.  I also searched a ton of websites and this was the best price.  I haven&#x27;t traveled with this set yet either, so I&#x27;m waiting to see if it holds up.  Not a waste of money, but not a hair miracle either....sorry ladies!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND SET I HAVE PURCHASED.  IF YOU DO NOT LIKE TO BLOW DRY WITH A ROUND BRUSH OR NEED A THIRD HAND TO WORK WITH THESE ROLLERS ARE A GREAT ALTERNATIVE.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Super Jumbo\\&quot; curlers are too heavy to roll up...they don&#x27;t stay in place with the cheap clips.  I have long thick hair, so if my hair can&#x27;t hold the \\&quot;super jumbo\\&quot; roller...not many others could.  Also, the clips come lose with the case.  The clips have no storage...it&#x27;s a poor design.  The \\&quot;super jumbo\\&quot; curlers are cumbersom....it would have been a better product if they left the super jumbos out of the case and added more regular jumbo curlers.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product! I was a bit skeptical at first because of ye &#x27;ol &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; saying, but the reviews I read really helped in making my decision. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! &#x3D; ) I didn&#x27;t rate it a whole 5 stars simply because of the \\&quot;clips\\&quot; it comes with. They do NOT get the job done. They don&#x27;t grab on to the roller well enough to keep it in place. So I do recommend buying a better set of clips for these. Other than that, I would say this is a great buy especially for the price! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the roller world, but although this product is exactly as described, it is way too much of a hassle.  I attempted to use the rollers for the first time over the weekend.  I had trouble right off the bat getting my hair to stay in place while rolling it up.  When I did manage to get the strip of hair to stay in place and roll, the pins were ill-fitting and the rollers fell out almost immediately.  Additionally, I kept burning my fingers on the rollers.  I would love for my hair to have more body, but this is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  I&#x27;ll stick with my curling iron!</li>
            <li> I was looking for some new hot rollers and felt that these would be a good choice.  I like that there are 2 sizes and they heat up quickly.  The pins that come with the rollers are not as stable as I would like.  Most of them hold the roller in place but the rollers by my ears tend to slip.  I&#x27;ve been using jumbo clips for those.  All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the curlers and the type of curl they produce.</li>
            <li> Very good! rollers are nice and big and helps straighten my curly hair. Very easy to use! Works just great!</li>
            <li> This is the second set of Conair jumbo electric rollers for me.  The first set lasted me about 4 years, and were still working although not heating as hot as I would have liked.  The top of the case cracked from traveling.  So, I do like these rollers.  Especially the size of the roller.  This new set has 4 extra jumbo, which I haven&#x27;t used yet. The heating and roller placement is a little different than my first set, but they do heat up quickly.  I held back from giving this a 5 star because I wish it was easier to travel with. If the hard top was replaced with a flexible material it would travel better.   Hey Conair - Please come out with a travel sized JUMBO roller set!</li>
            <li> I really did not know how to use the hooks that are to go over the rollers, and the instructions in the box are very unhelpful as they do not describe how to use them either.  One of the reviewers mentioned a youtube video, and I found it, and it was excellent: \\&quot;Bouncy hair using hot rollers.\\&quot; I think Conair would be smart to direct a customer to a video and then people wouldn&#x27;t be so unhappy with the hooks.  The product is, actually, pretty great.  FYI, I am Jim Pomm&#x27;s partner, Sara;  he is not the one using the rollers! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used conair hot rollers for about 15 years.  These are great, but I find it really annoying that the clips do not have a holder in the case.  It is the 1st time the case does not have that.  I know it sounds petty, but I can&#x27;t stand that I need to get another holder for the clips.</li>
            <li> I love my hot rollers! They turn out great and are easy to use. Although it takes some getting used to for me, i love it!</li>
            <li> I love the size and number of rollers in this set. Perfect for my shoulder length layered hair. BUT whoever invented those clips hates women. They fly off, don&#x27;t hold the hair, totally useless.   I bought a set of the conair superclips and they work fine.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about this set I ordered it. My hair is normally really hard to curl and theses did not do a thing to change that. On the bright side they did heat up really fast and they are extremely easy to wrap around your hair and secure. The cover for the curlers was broken when I got it but that was most likely a shipping problem. Other than that its a really great product, just not for my hair.</li>
            <li> Reasons why I love these curlers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They heat up fast. Usually I turn them on and let them heat up while I&#x27;m blow drying my hair. By the time I&#x27;m done blow drying my curlers are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They create gorgeous soft curls. I&#x27;m not a fan of the tight Shirley Temple style, and with these curlers you won&#x27;t have to worry about that. They create a nice natural curl that hold for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The soft felt texture of the rollers won&#x27;t hurt your scalp or crimp your hair in weird places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when they get too hot it sometimes hurts your skin, but usually it&#x27;s not a problem and I just stick a tissue under it. Overall a great product, Conair has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice and large. I was looking for a set of the largest rollers and there are only four in this one. The smaller ones are nice but if you have a lot of curly hair and are looking to smooth it with these the four largest ones are the best. I knew when I ordered that the white clips I had received with my last Conair rollers were not included. The pins are fine but I prefer the clips. The rollers get hot very quickly which is great and stay hot.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are amazing.  They heat up super quick and create great big waves of hair.  I have naturally curly hair so i like to use these to straighten my hair - meaning take it from small curls to waves, and these curlers do that very well.  I feel like a super model with my big piles of lovely waves.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair and was very excited to receive this product.  I read the reviews and tips, let the curlers heat up for a long time, left them in for a long time, sprayed my roots with hairspray, etc.  When I took the curlers out my hair looked great, for about 45 minutes...  then I was left with a gross hair sprayed mess...  what do you do then?  I started the process over and heated the curlers up again, left them in a long time, took them out and they looked great, for another 45 minutes.    Now I only with I could return them.  I&#x27;m sure it is just my hair type since my curling iron has the same affect.  I have ordered the Caruso steam curlers now as a last hope...</li>
            <li> I used to use my mom&#x27;s hot rollers from the 70&#x27;s. Hers were ceramic and gave great body that lasted all day. I was very disappointed with the results here. There was no curl and little body! My hair is long, about to my shoulder blades. I expected more. Maybe I need to use smaller rollers?</li>
            <li> The velvet around the roller is great but, like everyone else said, the slot on the roller leaves crimps and the dumb metal clips they give you do not keep the rollers taut enough to do a good job. My hair is easy to curl and even after hairspraying it, and keeping the rollers in for 20 minutes, while the metal clips burned my scalp and neck (I literally had to lift them away from my neck so they wouldn&#x27;t burn me), I still ended up with just slightly wavy hair and NO body nor curl at the top.. I&#x27;m returning them after just one try.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 sets of these, about once a year.  I love the size of the rollers and I ordered extra so I could have mostly all super jumbo or mostly jumbo depending on my hair length.  The problem is that the lid keeps cracking right down the middle.   Now I am getting ready to order my 3rd set and I am sure the lid will crack too, but I like the results so much and since I already have the extra rollers, I just keep ordering it.  I WISH THEY WOULD FIX THE LID DESIGN!</li>
            <li> My stylist told me to buy a hot roller set for my long layered hair.  I have never used them before so I have to tell you that I was amazed that it only took me 10 minutes to set my whole head of long hair.  I noticed a difference if you really let them heat up for a good 8 minutes, yes, they are hot after 2 or 3 minutes, but you notice that they get hotter as you are using them up, causing one side to have tigher curls than the other, so just plug it in while you are blow drying or doing your makeup.  This set is great, gives you that happy big curl waves.  My only issue is that it just doesnt last in my hair.  I dont like alot of product, so I try to avoid heavy hair sprays, but maybe I need to use more to get the curls to hold longer.    I also invested in the Conair SPC10X Super Clips, to use insead of the pins.  The pins work fine, but the clips are under $9 and just easier and quicker to use, so do get them.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It heat in only 2 minutes.  Your Hair looks so smooth and it don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Bought these the other day. Lifted the cover and turned the rollers on and could smell burning! Tried to take a roller out of the unit but it was wayyyy too hot to the tough. Very dangerous. Unplugged the unit and returned it yesterday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a month and a half and use them almost every day. They give me wonderful volume and curls that last all day. I absolutely love them. I don&#x27;t often use the bigger rollers because I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get them to stay in long enough to curl the hair. The pins that the rollers come with are tricky. They take a bit of practice (five times-ish). What I&#x27;ve found works really well is to roll up your hair and put the pin in horizontally, then turn it up parallel with your scalp. This works every time for the smaller ones. So worth the practice to have such great results!</li>
            <li> I have a set of Conair Jumbo Rollers, but there are only 5 of them and I sometimes need more than 5 rollers. These hit the mark with 6 Jumbo rollers and 4 SUPER jumbo rollers, which I have found myself using more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I LIKE about this set:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEATING SPEED: These heat up very quickly, less than 2 minutes. However, I tend to turn them on well before I need them, so they are super nice and hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIRE CLIPS: There have been reviews where people complaining that these do not come with the plastics jaw type clips - I specifically wanted the wire u-shaped clips and that is what comes in these.  Yes, they can sometimes hard to use until you really get used to them. BUT, they do not leave indention marks in your hair the way plastic clips do which is why I wanted them!  I already have tons of jaw clips as it is from other roller sets I&#x27;ve used and metal jumbo and super jumbo clips are much harder to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ON/OFF SWITCH: Although I keep it unplugged when not in use, I like that this has an on/off switch. This allows you the flexibility to plug it into a timer so you can program it to turn on automatically in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if I could suggest IMPROVEMENTS to make these great rollers even greater for version 2.0, here&#x27;s what I would suggest to the design/engineering team:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLIP HOLDER: Conair has other roller sets with a little compartment space within the unit to hold the wire clips - these do not. It would be nice addition so I can keep my clips close to the set itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DUAL VOLTAGE: Although due to the size, they don&#x27;t make the best travel set - but it would be great to be able to set these to both 110 and 240 so I can use these overseas when traveling on business or vacation. For now, I&#x27;ll have to settle for my Conair Jumbo Roller Travel Set with only 5 rollers.</li>
            <li> I like these rollers, but i would love them if they included 3-4 more rollers because 12 is not enough to do all my hair. the clips arent that bad at least with my type of hair (not too thin) if they didnt hold the first time, i moved the clips every way possible until they got a good hold. In the future i will buy other clips. The rollers get pretty hot but they ARE called Heat Rollers so you just have to be careful and they leave a nice big curl.</li>
            <li> The waves I get are a little weak and I think the rollers are too hot for my fine hair, but they are fun and quick to use. It saves me time, but I feel like I accomplish less with the rollers than I do with my Conair 1 1/4 inch barrel curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips are also difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend if you have medium-thick hair and have the plastic clips.</li>
            <li> I only used this product once, because that is all the product would allow me.  The only time I used it, I heated it up, and placed the rollers in my hair.  It didnt feel much hotter than normal hot rollers, but when I took them out of my hair I found that the plastic had melted, and the rollers were deformed.  Luckily my hair was not fried completely, but it did take about a week of conditioning treatments daily to repair the damage.    DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> These just won&#x27;t hold.I called Conair and they sent me wire clips which fit the jumbo rollers, but not the super jumbo which leaves me with 4 rollers which are unusable and 8 rollers aren&#x27;t enough to do my hair. the smart clips that come with them won&#x27;t hold especially on the top of my head and they leave marks and dents. Not happy at all with these.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas 2006 and was very excited on using it.  Before my first use, I practice rolling my hair and securly getting the clip on.  Well, it was a disaster!  I read the manual word for word, but no help there.  I tried using more hair, less hair, etc but the clip would either fly off, or the hair would unravel.  I tried another day to practice again, but had the same results.  I returned this item because of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never even plugged this in.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old with very thick, layered long hair that hangs a few inches past my shoulders.  I remember and used the old style Clairol electric, steam rollers and making what I called &amp;#34;pageant hair&amp;#34;...my hair really can do that naturally with a little oomp provided by electric rollers.  But I no longer liked that old style look, curls too tight, concerned about damage so haven&#x27;t used these types of rollers for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using super jumbo velcro rollers after shampooing my hair - drying it and then setting - leaving them in as I do my makeup and then removing the rollers.  Looks great when I first remove them but the curl fades away pretty quickly.  So I began thinking what about hot rollers again and did research here on Amazon.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after reading all the reviews of the various sets - I certainly can afford more expensive ones - I decided to try these based on size; the quickness of heating; reviews; and price.  All I can report is that they do what is claimed at a very affordable price. I don&#x27;t even use all the curlers.  Do I save time at all over using velcro?  Only to the point that I do not have to completely dry my hair to use these rollers so they are my preferred choice in the winter, cold weather.  PLUS they provide more longevity to the curl lasting throughout the day - and I mean body with slight curl as I desired.  So -- I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I recommend these</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]]    I was never before able to use hot rollers.  I am pretty good at this sort of thing, but I have never been able to use the wire clips that the old fashioned rollers had, and the \\&quot;super clips\\&quot; that are like butterflies with teeth, leave crimp marks.  Hair looks terrible with crimp marks.  I am desperate to purchase additional clips like the ones that come with this set to use with other sets that came with either the wire clips or the butterfly-teeth clips.  If anyone knows where and how I can get those, please tell.  The single negative thing I find with this product is that the plastic hinged top breaks.  I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;m now purchasing a third set for that reason.  First the hinge broke on my current one, and then the plastic itself. The one I had before that, it was just the cracked plastic top. To improve the design, Conair should make a hinge that will stay open when required, and a clear plastic top that will not crack on its own. Also, it would be better if the heater had an auto-off (as some other models do).</li>
            <li> Well, they do the job, but they are not all that easy to use. First, the cloth cover of the roller makes it slide right through my hair (which is somewhat fine in texture.) This makes it difficult to roll up successfully. Second, the clips are not good at holding the roller in place. If you really want to use these rollers, buy the plastic clip-on clips that hold the roller more securely. Finally, I was pretty surprised to discover that there is no place available on the unit designed to store the clips when the machine isn&#x27;t in use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there has to be a better product out there somewhere.</li>
            <li> I am growing my hair out and I bought these rollers so I could add some sexy waves to my hair. I really like that they are economical and they heat up fast!  The problems I have are that I must have a TON of hair because I had about 3 rollers amount left on my head after using all the rollers. My hair is about 2 inches longer than my shoulders. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I have to curl different parts at different times and wait for the rolls to reheat....it just never looks right.  Also, those clips that come with the rolls are incredibly useless. Maybe I have softer hair than most, but they do not hold on to my hair at all. Within seconds my hair is falling off the rollers.  Overall, my hair did turn out curly and looked nice, but the curls were a little kinky and with all the struggling with the rollers, it turned in to more of a 80&#x27;s Dynasty curl than a nice wave.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair. My hair curls with the curling iron so i thought these rollers would work. I was so excited to try them out when I got them. The instructions say to leave the rollers in your hair until the rollers cool down. The rollers were cool in my hair after 15 - 20 minutes but I left them in my hair for 30 minutes. I took out the first roller and was  immediately disappointed with the curl. It wasn&#x27;t even a curl it was more like a flop of limp hair with one puny little wave. All of my hair turned out this way. i was so sad. I used allot of hair spray before I rolled them into my hair so next time I want to try the rollers with no hair spray. Also, I have hair that reaches to my arm pits so maybe my hair was too short for these jumbo sized rollers. I think if I had smaller ones they might have worked. Either way i&#x27;ll keep them until my hair grows longer then maybe they&#x27;ll work. Another thing, the pins they give to hold the hair onto the rollers \\&quot;are\\&quot; a little hard to use. some of them did not hold my hair onto the roller. i had to use clips. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I HAVE FRIZZY HAIR AND THIS HELPS TO CALM IT.&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO USE AND HEATS FAST. COMPACT BUT NO&lt;br /&gt;PLACE TO STORE CLIPS.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this set.  I used it today for the first time and have bouncy curls that have already lasted for 7 hours and look great.  I&#x27;ve used other curlers and by the time they are heated enough I can no longer touch them to roll my hair.  These did not burn my fingers.  My hair is thick and coarse and I was worried about needing the Conair jaw clips to hold these in.  I used the wire clips today and they held fine.  Not particularly comfy, as the wire poked my scalp on a couple rollers.  But they do hold.  And even without using styling products my hair is soft and wavy, not frizzy.  Definintely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble curling my hair, and when I do get my hair to curl it doesn&#x27;t last very long. With these, the curls are soft, and lasted all day! Very easy to use, work well, a great buy!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these curlers. They did not stay put with the included clips in my fine thin hair. I am returning them b/c it was too frustrating trying to get them to stay w/o slipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers to replace an older different brand name set. I have always used hot rollers, never a curling iron. My hair was soft and bouncy after each use. I use this product daily. It heats up really fast. Great for long hair. Would recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat coarse hair. This means it doesn&#x27;t typically want to curl, but once it does, it stays all day.    These rollers did not curl my hair much at all. The ion curlers from Conair worked better for me.</li>
            <li> Updated December 2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am such a loyal Conair customer that it pains me to give this product such an awful review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased this set of rollers after the last set went bust on me and nearly gave me second degree burns (see review below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set comes with 6 jumbo rollers and 4 super jumbos. For me, ths jumbos are just perfect, the super jumbos are way too big for my shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers don&#x27;t  heat up enough to set a curl. Even waiting ten minutes with the set on, the curlers are not hot enough to produce a curl -- just a limp wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used Conair rollers for over twenty years I am very used to and adept at the wire pin holders. This set comes with a newfangled clip that DOES NOT WORK.  It can not hold hair in place. I still have my wire clips from the previous sets of rollers, so I am using those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, poor product redesign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about six months now, and am extremely happy with it. I have been using hot rollers for years, and this set is one of the better ones. I like that the rollers are 1.5 inches -- good for loose, bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit heats up pretty quickly -- within 3-4 minutes, the curlers are at maximum heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very easy to use, and they stay put in your hair until you remove them. They don&#x27;t easily fall out like some other curlers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked it if there was a temperature adjustment setting. The heat level is probably adequate for most, but sometimes I  wish I could ratchet it up a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product. I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 5/16/09&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly two years of almost daily use, this product went beserk on me. One row of rollers does not heat up at all, and the other row is at such high heat, that I burned a finger. I can&#x27;t use them anymore, because if the roller burnt my finger, can you imagine what it would do to my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to call Conair about this, but am not optmistic since the product is off warranty.e product is off warranty.</li>
            <li> After reading previous raves on this product, I was so excited to buy it. Having naturally straight and flat hair, I would love a change with soft waves. Unfortunately, this product did not work well with my hair. As mentioned by others, it was hard to clasp in place, and kept on sliding down after I clasped it. There was little change to my hair. The most significant difference was the ends that were curled, but otherwise I would not see a difference at all. After trying it a few times, I just gave up on it, and quite honestly, I dont even know where I stored it. However, maybe it is only my type of hair that makes this product difficult to use. It worked for many others, so you may want to give it a chance, but I much rather a regular curler!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and these rollers only give me a slight wave. They just don&#x27;t get hot enough. But on the bright side they are made well and when I want just a little wave they do the job very well.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SET OF HOT CURLERS;IT GIVES MY HAIR LOTS OF BODY AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CURL,I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR AND THESE CURLERS GIVE MY HAIR A GREAT LOOK  THE BEST SET I HAVE HAD.  GREAT CURLERS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HEAT SET OF HOT CURLERS TO MY CLOSEST FRIENDS AND SISTERS.ALSO THESE CURLERS HEAT UP VERY QUICKLY WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG PLUS FOR THIS SET OF CURLERS.  MARY K</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried hot rollers before and really did my research before purchasing these. They got such great reviews I was so excited to try them. What a disaster! They took forever to heat up, they are almost too hot to hold while trying to wrap your hair around them and the metal clips that come with them do not hold the rollers in place at all. The rollers kept coming undone and pulling my hair which was really painful. These are horrible. It&#x27;s much easier to just curl your hair with a curling iron. I am returning these and will never buy hot rollers again.</li>
            <li> I bought these hot rollers after reading the reviews on Amazon and finding that they were higher rated than most. I have long (to the middle of my back) wavy-ish hair that is pretty thick. I was looking for those loose Kim Kardashian/Jennifer Love Hewitt curls. When I received the set I was pleased with the quality and flocking on the rollers, although the metal pins would not hold at all in my hair, so I purchased some Conair Pro Clips instead. I followed all the directions exactly, even looking up videos on You Tube for suggestions on how to achieve the look I wanted, but every time I tried them, my hair didn&#x27;t curl. In fact, it pretty much straightened it; which was the opposite of the look I was trying for. After a few weeks of consistent trying, I gave up and sent them back. I have since bought another set with smaller rollers that I am going to try. I would only recommend these rollers for those with medium to short hair who are looking for a smooth look with little to no curl.</li>
            <li> this unit is fine and does a nice job.  I think I could recommend it for medium or  long hair.</li>
            <li> This is good product, easy to use, and your hair looks like you spend a lot of time curling. I love it!</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday at Walmart and tried it for the first time today. I LOVE it!! It was so easy to do -- and I&#x27;ve got two left hands :o) Seriously, if I can do this I think anyone can. I just spritzed a little hairspray on each section and then rolled it up. I will admit that I didn&#x27;t think the clip was holding very well, but I left the rollers in for twenty minutes and none of them fell out any sooner. I really am impressed. My hair is very fine and comes to about the middle of my shoulder blades. It&#x27;s usually fairly straight with only a slight wave, but now I&#x27;ve got big, bouncy curls. I just can&#x27;t say it enough -- I LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for my hair at all.  I have thin hair and the clips just didn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> no matter how many times i mess with these curlers it just doesnt hold! the holders always fall out with little hair to a lot of hair in the roller. the curl stays but its the messiest curl near the root or its completely straight up top and curled at the bottom.  its the most difficult rollers i have ever worked with.  it is a little hot to handle but not that big of a deal        i just hate these rollers and wish i could return them.</li>
            <li> The size of the rollers are great.  They heat up quickly, but the pins are almost impossible to stay in place.  Haven&#x27;t been able to get full use of them because of the pins....</li>
            <li> I tried these rollers for the first time yesterday and was really disappointed in the instructions and handling the rollers. I would have to wear gloves to use the rollers if I do not want to burn my fingers. When I finally got the rollers in the hair the next problem were the clips. There are no instructions how to attach the clips to the rollers. Up, down, sideways....nothing. After minutes of trying different ways I finally got the mission accomplished but felt very disappointed. The one good thing that comes out of using these rollers was actually nice  non frizzy hair with very gentle curls. For the first time in months my hair looked great, it was just very difficult getting there :-(</li>
            <li> Im rating 4 stars right now becuz I haven&#x27;t got the item yet but Im sure that they will be fabulous becuz I have purchase the conair multiple set which is the hot pink one and they are amazing! Just not enough rollers for my thick hair. So that&#x27;s why i also order this. Plus it&#x27;s much cheaper online that your local target or cvs. I think they sell it there for $29.99 or so but here I got them for $17.00. Much better deal for the same item don&#x27;t you think. WIll update after I use them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 11.04.13&lt;br /&gt;Change the stars from 4 to 5. 10 if possible!! So I recieve the item some time last week and finally use it. They are FABULOUS!!! Definitely doesn&#x27;t give you curls for the size of those jumbo rollers but they leave your hair so style and sexy I can&#x27;t explain in words much more than this! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these rollers for approximately a year.  For the most part, these rollers have worked great.  They heat up quickly and curl my hair well.  The only thing that is negative about these rollers is that a few of my hairs always get caught between the velvet part and the plastic ends.  I almost always have a few hairs yanked out.</li>
            <li> Like the others say, the clips are tricky.  However, I&#x27;ve gotten them to consistently work for me, once I practiced with them a few times.  My only complaint is that I wish there was a spot somewhere in the base to store them.  I&#x27;m a curler novice and I&#x27;ve only used them a few times, but have been very happy with the results.  The rollers are just the right size (I have fairly thick hair down a few inches past my shoulders) and I love the texture on the rollers that keeps my hair from slipping off.   The rollers heat up quickly and were easy to use, even for someone who didn&#x27;t really know what she was doing.  Watching youtube \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos helped a lot.</li>
            <li> So I finally ordered this set of hot rollers after wanting them for quite a while.Well,I&#x27;m glad they were not expensive because I barely get a wave!Guess you get what you pay for-</li>
            <li> Full, bouncy body with these rollers.  It would be nice to have a whole set of 12-14 large (purple) rollers.  I needed more of the purple and not the black, so I ordered 2 sets and replaced the black with the new purple ones so I have 12 large rollers hot.  At least I have another unit if something happens to the original one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these rollers for a month now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My hair is thin and fine, and these rollers give it incredible body, yet not curly - just what I was hoping for. I sometimes get a crimp in my hair from the clips, but that seems to happen only when the clip is very close to my scalp.  One thing that would be nice is some kind of container to hold the clips, but that&#x27;s the only negative thing I can say.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with her new Instant Heat Jumbo Rollers!  It came with everything so all she had to do was plug it in.  In just a few minutes she had awesome curls!</li>
            <li> I just love these hot rollers, so easy and fast! I have a shoulder length bob hairstyle and These larger rollers give it just the right amount of body for this style. The clips if you put them straight up hold super good and don&#x27;t leave any marks on your hair.   I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who is looking for larger hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers because I have long hair and the rollers are big which make soft curls. I do not like the clips that come with this product. I use full over the roller clips with teeth, they stay in place much better.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would give my hair more volume and curl. The rollers heat up quickly, but the clips don&#x27;t hold the curler in my hair, Consequently, I felt my ear and neck burning. When I put one in that did hold, it would only stay put for a minute. The hair curled, but fell quickly. I guess I am more of a curling iron kind of girl. My hair is straight and shoulder length. I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so disappointed in a product.</li>
            <li> Rollers get hot quickly and are hotter than most electric curlers but the pins do not keep the rollers in place.  Real disappointed in the pins.  Without good pins to keep the rollers in place, the curler really are not of much use.  Anybody have any suggestions?  I tried the rollers clips but they leave dents in my hair.  I like the rollers i.e. size, heat,etc just the pins are bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product through Amazon and received it from the Nerds within three days.  I was pleased to be able to use the product right away.  Thank you for such excellent service and[[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]] a great product!</li>
            <li> I have had these for a few years and they still work perfectly. They give soft curls without damaging my hair. They are so worth the price!</li>
            <li> The curlers burn your hands and head as you try and put them in place which would make you think you would end up with at least a good curl.  However, curl does not keep.  Look for hot rollers that have a claw to hold the curler in place as this product does not and doesn&#x27;t keep curler in place.  Seller was great but product not so hot.</li>
            <li> Liked the size of the curlers although the felt on each curler feels like it will come off after several uses</li>
            <li> First: My hair is about 2 inches below my bra strap-I have fairly long hair.    This set works near perfectly to give my the look that I want. Nice body, beautiful, soft curls. I use TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray (One of Allures Greatest Products) with the rollers since I the rollers do get very warm.     As a tip to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know how to use the two different sized rollers... larger rollers go on the top part of your head, and use smaller rollers on the sides.    The one downside, as many have mentioned is the clips. The &#x27;smart clip&#x27; is meant to be better than the metal pins, but they truly aren&#x27;t. The really nice thing about Conair is, if you purchase this, and not like the clips: call them. They shipped me both metal and plastic clips. Great customer service.    I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> These do the job. They take awhile to heat up but are easy to get in and out.</li>
            <li> I recently bought these curlers at Target for $27, not realizing I could have bought them here for $10 less. Anyway, I have been very pleased with them - they heat up very fast (they get VERY hot), and because they&#x27;re large, they provide a lot of volume and wave, not little spiral curls that look unnatural. They also come with the metal wire clips that keep the curlers in your hair very well, unlike those plastic clips that come with most curlers I see.     The only drawback is that there is no place to store the clips - other curler sets I&#x27;ve had provide a little slot for the clips. But overall, I would definitely recommend these curlers.</li>
            <li> Love this rollers. I needed a replacement and bought these. This seller sold them at a high price. I found Target and Walmart sells them at a reasonable price. Also the box containing the set was damaged and the clips were not included. I feel cheated. Buy this set but from a retailer. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I purchased two other sets, but they just weren&#x27;t what I was looking for.  These have been great for my thick, mid lenth hair.  They heat up quick and I love being able to put them up right after I&#x27;m done (they are not hot on the outside).  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the clips, but I already had plenty from my old set that I preferred.  Great Price and Quick Ship</li>
            <li> This is the best hair rollers I&#x27;ve ever used!I got a better deal here in Amazon than purchasing it from Target or Walmart. So the wait for it was totally worth it! It heats up really fast and works gorgeously! My hair has so much volume and curls really well. I have very thick hair, so purchasing these rollers was worth it because I don&#x27;t have to spend 2 hours just making sure every strand in my hair is curled with a curling iron! I just pop these babies in, do my makeup, and voila! I&#x27;m done and pretty! I really love these rollers, and I would totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> These rollers are very easy to use and definitely do a nice job of providing fast curls! I can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present.  She was always talking about getting some, but never would.  She&#x27;s happy now!</li>
            <li> They are nice, get nice and hot fairly fast</li>
            <li> I tried these as soon as I received them. They get hot quickly.  Puchased the conair pro clips which made the job easier.  I don&#x27;t usually like the metal pins that come with these.  Bought a second set for my mom.  ;)</li>
            <li> Rollers put a lot of curl in my straight, almost waist length hair/ I am really pleased with these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I think these are awesome.  I was a bit skeptical about going back to the \\&quot;rollers\\&quot;....for fear of Rodeo Queen hair.  But!  I am happy to say that instead of that, I just have much more volume and bounce in my fine, straight hair.  Before I used these, I watched the video that another reviewer posted (thank you for that J Cimenski!!!!) and it was very helpful!  [...]  And, I got these at Target, but Amazon has a better price right now.  PS--I think the wire holder things are tough to use.  They really don&#x27;t stay in well, so I&#x27;d recommend the plastic clips as others mentioned.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find hot rollers that are big enough to work on my very long hair.  The jumbo rollers are perfect for the top for volume and the rest give a gentle wave.  I&#x27;ve had so many sets where there were all sizes and the small ones are never used so they are a waste.  Finding this set,  with all large and jumbo rollers was so awesome.  I am thrilled with how fast they get hot and how well they work.  I would recommend these rollers to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> The directions are not clear. I waited and waited for the red light to go off, then reread it and realized one of the rollers has a tiny dot that turns off. My next challenge was learning how to use the metal clips. There are no instructions, no photos, nothing on the web site, and no help from the company. I finally learned how, through trial and error. The first time I used them, my hair was all dry and static -- awful. Then I read on the internet that I should use setting lotion. I could find that nowhere, but someone suggested I use a light mousse. Finally, I got the desired results -- a little body and fullness in a relatively short time. No burning either.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are the most amazing tool for styling your hair.  I have flat hair, but in my experience they only work if your hair is dryed naturally, if you dry your hair with heat the curls will last 1 hour (in my hair). Other than that I get sooooo sooooo many compliments about my hair. They are very easy to use, I like the clips better, people complain about the clips not holding, but this is not true, just try to place the clip on a different angle and it holds perfectly. I love them, they are the best investment.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers. I have long hair. The larger curler is great. I like having all the same size curlers. I never used the little ones in other sets. These heat up fast and curl great. The velvety covering really helps protect the hair. I like the pins that come with this set. I had another set with the hinge clips and they left funny little dents in my curl. These work much better!</li>
            <li> These rollers are quick and easy - on days when there isn&#x27;t time for fussing, I heat them up, put them in and I am done in minutes.  I love the shine it leaves in my hair and absolutely no frizz. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I curled my hair w/o damaging it but the pins to hold it up dont work</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers and they barely heat up or curl my hair. In 2 seconds my hair was completely flat. Definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> You need two hands to turn it on or off, one to hold the case and one to move the switch.  The switch \\&quot;on\\&quot; position is to the left, kind of odd for a product sold in the U.S.  The clips are horrible, horrible, horrible.</li>
            <li> Though they do heat up quickly, I can&#x27;t get them to stay in my hair long enough to work well. The clips don&#x27;t keep them in my hair (shoulder length and fine - but I have tons of it)... I think the &#x27;velvet&#x27; finish makes them just slide right out. Also the edges and the clips also heat up - but way too hot for my scalp. Maybe better with a coarser type hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried these rollers a few times and I really love them.  They heat up quickly and they don&#x27;t burn your fingers. And I really love the curls. The reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is 1) the pins are terrible.  My hair just unrolls right out of them.  Maybe they aren&#x27;t long enough to create tension. So I bought 2 sets of the hinge clips at 9 dollars a piece, adding 18 bucks to my investment. 2) the super jumbo rollers are completely worthless.  When I unroll them my hair is totally straight except for the very end.  3)since there are only 8 usable rollers I bought another set adding 30 bucks to the total.   To give some context, my hair is fine and pin straight. But I have a LOT of hair and it&#x27;s long and layered (it reaches my elbows).  So the 16 jumbo rollers from the 2 sets is sufficient to roll all of my hair in one round.  I do love the way my hair look (and I generally hate my hair!) I just wish I could buy enough rollers to roll all of my hair all in one size and with clips that actually secure the rollers for less than $80.</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and the curl lasts the entire day.  My hair is long and fine so this is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers a month ago and they work really great. Heat well and it gives me the kind of loose curl that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Love these. Heat up quick, lots of volume and my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy at all. I would recommend buying the clips as I hate the wire things that it comes with the rollers. The clips are much easier to keep in place. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I use this set if rollers daily! I like the sizes a lot - they are perfect for getting volume in your hair! I guess because I use them everyday the velvety finish wore off after about a year 1/2 and am now on my 2nd set-which is the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating. But I love them and have not found any other rollers that compare to this set. My mother has this same set and she uses them daily as well and she loves them too!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for BIG hot rollers, this is the set for you. I ordered a set last year and loved them so much, I ordered a second set. I have thick, chin-length hair. I wanted the look of smooth hair, but I&#x27;m no good at using a blow dryer or a curling iron. These curlers help create that look. If I want more body, I just leave the rollers in longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the remington h-1015 hot rollers.  Love the compactness of the set but the rollers are too small especially now that my hair is longer.  A co-worker recommended the conair chv14jxr and I really like this set.  The rollers are much larger and they heat up quickly.  I&#x27;m used to the metal u-pins so I have no problem keeping the rollers in place.  The only problem is that the set is about 3 times larger than the remington and takes up too much room in my gym bag.  Consequently, I use them primarily at home.  So, my hair is straighter on gym days and fuller/bouncier on non-gym days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Now that it&#x27;s warmer, I&#x27;ve started taking these to the gym (summer clothes take up less room in my gym bag).  I no longer spend 25+ minutes straightening my hair.  I just dry my hair quickly and pop these rollers in.  I&#x27;ve cut down my time at the gym by about 15 minutes.  Really glad I purchased these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat fast and create a nice curl. I wanted them mostly to just add a soft \\&quot;Kardashian\\&quot; wave. The super jumbo sized rollers are perfect for that effect, but there are only 4 of them in this set. I&#x27;ll keep this but also buy an additional super-jumbo only set</li>
            <li> These are without a doubt the worst hot rollers I have ever owned/used.  The first time I used them my hair came out with no curl.  I reheated the curlers and put them in again.  Still no curl.  There was a SLIGHT hint of wave but that was gone in no time.  I thought maybe I put too much hair on each roller, so I tried it again a few days later.  I put a very small amount of hair on each roller, which meant that I had to section off my hair into three parts and curl one at a time and reheat rollers in between.  After 40 minutes... No curl!!  Only a SLIGHT hint of wave, which was gone in no time.  I have used hot rollers for over 15 years now, so I know that it was not user error.  I was very disappointed!  I say was, because I have returned the product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased the ConairPro Pro Clips to hold the rollers because I have never liked using the wire clips.  I&#x27;ve used the ConairPro Pro Clips with 2 other types of hot rollers and they worked great, so I know that has nothing to do with the poor performance of this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the ConairPro Pro Clips, but highly discourage anyone to purchase these rollers! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Great for bad hair days or when you need a quick fix. Works best if you let it warm up for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> These rollers are great. They take out the frizz and give my hair a nice bounce. They heat up quickly and are easy to use. I am very happy with my purchase. I like using these rollers much better than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The best thing about these rollers is that you can buy them jumbo sized.  Others I&#x27;ve purchased only had three or four large rollers.  They heat up well also.    The downside is that it&#x27;s difficult to get the hair on the roller itself (and keep it on while trying to roll it up) and the pins that keep them on get hot themselves from the heat of the roller and aren&#x27;t the greatest at keeping attached.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I bought it hoping it would give me cute curly hair and it looks great and it so easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone.   Sarah</li>
            <li> the ease of using this product is amazing.  i&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t even own a blowdryer.  i&#x27;m into washing, air-drying and combing my hair and getting out the door.  i never went near rollers before and i got the hang of these after a couple tries, though my hair still managed to look pretty decent after the first try.  i love the way it makes my hair look, very full and i turn quite a few heads when i use them.  i have extremely straight, long, dyed asian hair that&#x27;s not too full or too thin but it keeps my waves in without too much hair product.  even a curling iron doesn&#x27;t keep the wave in.  you can go for the va-va-voom or natural look with these.  i love that they are flocked (with the velvet fabric over the roller for less damage) and how they get hot quickly.  100% recommended and i&#x27;m even getting these for my best friend for her bday!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair SPC10R Super Clips]] I love these rollers. They give me big Farah Fawcett curls. The clips do not stay in my hair very well so I bought the Conair Super Clips and they stay much better. On humid days I spray each piece of hair with hair spray first before I wrap it around the curler and the curl stays better.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for!  I have tried other rollers in the past without any luck...mostly because I had no idea what I was doing, so I watched this video per another users suggestion and it really, really helped:    [...]     I have longer (about mid-chest), thicker, naturally curly hair cut into long layers.  I used them yesterday after having my hair up in a pony-tail all day.  The curls came out beautifully.  If you have naturally curly hair, you know that after having your hair up all day it tends to be a little straighter/smoother than after a fresh blow-dry so I was anxious to see how they would come out after a fresh wash/blow-dry.  Tried them today after my wash/dry and once again they came out beautiful!  I used hairspray prior to putting the rollers in for extra hold as well as after the rollers cooled and once again after taking out and \\&quot;shaking\\&quot; out the curls.      Some of the reviews say that they leave a \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; from the line in the rollers---I didn&#x27;t notice that but perhaps that is due to the length of my hair.    A couple notes, not complaints, I could use at least 4 more rollers since my hair is longer but the pamphlet that comes with the rollers states you can buy extra sets.  Also, the metal clips don&#x27;t hold as well as it seems the plastic clips would and it takes a little time to get them in so my fingers burnt a bit while trying to get them in.  Over time, probably wouldn&#x27;t be a problem as you get the \\&quot;technique\\&quot; down but as a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; to rollers, it takes me a little time.  Overall though, I am very, very satisfied and these TOTALLY beat using a traditional curling iron on long hair to get the same results.  Good luck ladies!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, Worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is not a good product -- doesn&#x27;t heat up much -- isn&#x27;t worth the time of rolling your hair on the rollers!</li>
            <li> The first time I used my new rollers they worked amazingly, but the next few times I was disappointed that the curl would fall right out of my thick straight hair.  After trial and error, I discovered that if I let the curlers heat up for about 10 minutes (rather than the two that are advertized), I end up with fantastic curls that will last until the next time I wash my hair.  One other &#x27;downside&#x27; is the clips that come with the set - they leave me with little crimp marks in my hair.  I highly recommend buying the conair SPC10R super clips.  They don&#x27;t leave marks, and they hold the rollers in place far more securely.  On the whole, though, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CHV14J Instant Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo-Sized Rollers]]This is a great product! The rollers heat up quickly and are large enough to not cause frizzy curls. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> As far as being quick and easy, these are some of the best I&#x27;ve tried. I personally like their rollers that have the actual hinged clips (easier to secure, slide less), but I like having more than 5 rollers (my hair is long). Excellent product - my first set lasted me many years until I had finally dropped them all one too many times.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up enough, but it is difficult to get the wire clips in the right place because of the design of the roller.  It has an opening on each side from which it heats up on the machine.  But then to navigate the clip away from these 2 openings is a major pain.  I&#x27;m either going to buy a new set of rollers or look for a clip that clips easier.</li>
            <li> these curlers worked great- nice and soft and made my hair nice and soft with big silky bouncy curls- just a dream to run my fingers through or walk down the street looking side to side with my big soft bouncy curls bouncing off of the top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li> This set warms up fast and produces wonderful full curls.  The downside is the center four curlers are hard to remove and replace with one hand.  It is recommended to remove a curler before trying to hold hair and then extract the curler.  I may have a somewhat defective model since no mention of this can be found in any other review.  It is more of an annoyance that anything else, but I felt it deserved mentioning.</li>
            <li> heated the rollers up for 10 minutes and used all the rollers to curl my combed,long, fine hair and let the rollers cool before removing them; my hair curled up in big wavy curls that I quickly covered in hairspray. the product did what I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> This might not work for everyone but it worked for me. Make sure your hair is EVER SO SLIGHTLY DAMP before you use the curlers. If your hair is already completely dry it won&#x27;t work as well. I don&#x27;t mean wet or damp. I mean as I just said, JUST SLIGHTLY DAMP. It will set and hold better that way (Again leave in for 20 minutes). And when you take out the curlers don&#x27;t immediately brush out your hair either. Just let the curls or hair sit there for 5 minutes. Then brush it out. If you want a few extra curls on the side or/and top try also if you have the time and inclination the conair curling iron, 1 inch for bigger curls and 1/2 inch or even 3/8 inch for smaller. If you want then spray it with a good light hairspray for the finishing touch. OK?</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some other rollers that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> needs a hole to hold the hair clips but good product other then that.</li>
            <li> These rollers are awful. Rollers will not stay in. And the rollers will burn your head because of how they are made.</li>
            <li> These are great!  They are usable in 2 minutes but seem to reach maximum heat in 5 minutes (the dot changes color at 5 minutes, also).  I don&#x27;t like the clips that came with it, but Conair also sells clips for hot curlers.   I got a package of 10 for less than $10 and they do a good job of holding the curlers and not leaving a mark. My hair is fine but not thin, so I guess I&#x27;m putting enough hair on each curler so I don&#x27;t have a problem with them staying in.  I finally got tired of my old 30-minutes-to-heat curlers. So glad I spent the money on these!</li>
            <li> The product was defective when I received it.  The return was difficult.  I could not find number to call Amazon with problem. I would purchase from local store next time for easier transaction.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different sets of hot rollers recently, and I love these ones.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reason #1: they have a velvety covering on the roll, which helps hold the hair in place while you&#x27;re rolling it up.  Some brands have a slick surface on the roller, and my hair slides right off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reason #2: they heat up fast.  No waiting around for 10-15 minutes for the rollers to get hot.  They heat up in just a few minutes and are plenty hot enough to get the job done.  I tried one brand that said it heats up in 90 seconds.  Maybe, but they were barely warm enough to create a curl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reason #3: plenty of curlers, all one size (large!).  Other brands have at least 4 very small curlers that I never use.  This set is perfect for someone with long hair and no bangs, therefore not needing the small curlers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reason #4: the pins are easy to use and don&#x27;t leave marks in my hair like some brand&#x27;s clips do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments on my hair when I use these curlers.  I really love this set and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I have used these puppies forever and I will always be a devout fan!  I noticed some feedback about the metal roll clasps that come with them, they do stay in your hair, but you have to do it in a certain way.  After you roll a section of your hair in the roller, put the metal clasp opening (\\&quot;mouth\\&quot;) so it is touching the top of the roller facing your feet. Push down and roll the clasp so it anchors the hair supporting it from the bottom of the individual roll.    You will be a sexy new you, and these are the best, so get them!</li>
            <li> This set is great! I purchased it from Walmart, recently marked down to $19.99. I was skeptical at first. I have relaxed but thick African-American hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if the \\&quot;velvety\\&quot; surface would interfere. It heated  quickly, in a matter of minutes. And the fabric surface actually helped my hair adhere to the roller. The rollers were not too hot to handle. The metal, u-shaped clips are a little tricky and can push back the hair a bit when pushed on, but didn&#x27;t really matter in the end. The results after 10 minutes were nice, big curls. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair OVER curled, like a hot curler might do sometimes. Plus my hair didn&#x27;t dry out and it maintained it&#x27;s shine. This set is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used hot rollers in years, but my hair is now past my shoulders again and I wanted to do something different.  After reading reviews, I settled on these rollers.  I really like that they are large and jumbo.  It takes all the rollers to curl my entire head, and the curl is very natural.  They warm up quickly and get very hot (watch out!).  The main problem is that they are flocked instead of having teeth, so they seem to slip out of my hair if I don&#x27;t wrap them tightly.  I have fine to medium straight hair, and think I need to experiment with different products to see if I can give my hair more texture before I put the curlers in.</li>
            <li> These could be considered large and extra large .... \\&quot;Jumbo\\&quot; or \\&quot;Super Jumbo\\&quot;, they are not. If I were to make recommendations to the manufacturer, it would be to offer 6 (instead of 4) super jumbo curlers and make them larger and offer the remaining 6 (instead of 8) in, what is now, their jumbo size.    Also, the pins are too short and do not always hold well.  Longer pins need to be included.     On the upside, this product heats rapidly and has an off/on switch on the front .... features that I like.</li>
            <li> I love the size of these rollers they are perfect for long thick hair! I just wish they had better clips. It has taken some time to get the clip in there just right to hold the roller in my hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, but the clips do not stay on.  I have used this type of clip years ago with my first set of hot rollers, and did not have this problem with the clips.  I cannot use the rollers if I am in a hurry, because at least 3 or 4 will fall off and I have to put them back on and not move.</li>
            <li> Size of rollers is great.  If the set had 4 more rollers I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  Heats up as promised and results are just what you&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li> Now this was a gift for my sister who has hair like a horse thick, curly and hard to manage. But in my situation I have very fine hair and this will work wonders. It does heat up nice and quick and stays hot for a long time, but the best part is that it makes my hair shiny gives it a nice bounce and last all day long with a bit of hairspray and mousse.   Trust me you will want to try this out for yourself!</li>
            <li> I would say that these rollers are \\&quot;just okay.\\&quot; I do have very thick, coarse, hard to manage hair, but I have used other brands of rollers successfully before. As my hair is also pretty wavy, it generally holds curl all day long quite well, so with other brands of rollers, I only have to leave them in for 5 minutes or so to get my desired result. (Just basically to give the ends of my hair direction, tame down the frizz, and give it some body.) With this product, I not only have to heat them up for at least a half hour to get them hot enough to do anything, but I also have to keep them in at least 20 minutes to get my hair to hold the curl. And even then, it loses the curl after about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best results I&#x27;ve gotten have been when my hair has a ton of product in it and has not been washed in at least 24 hours. In that case, they do work very well and my hair will hold the \\&quot;body\\&quot; for almost a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might work better for someone with more manageable hair. I honestly just think they don&#x27;t get hot enough for me.</li>
            <li> The set arrived with 12 metal pins but 9 of them were for the smaller roller size and only 3 were sized for the larger rollers (there are 4 total).  Also this set did not keep wave/curl in my hair.  If you have a lot of hair which I do, this size roller is just too big to hold the wave/curl.  I returned and actually purchased a set of rollers at a local beauty supply store that had 12 rollers no larger than 1.5&amp;#34; diameter and they work great!</li>
            <li> i have always wanted that sexy soft curl/wavy (most near the end of the hair) look that is so in right now.  i have long hair (right up to the tops of my breasts), it&#x27;s thick Asian hair, highlights, relatively healthy.      i heat them up for 5 minutes, spritz a little styling lotion (i use bumble and bumble), make sure your hair is dry, then roll.  really easy to roll my hair in (i have an old remington est that is super hard to roll hair in, i think b/c the rollers are too small, so i have to use small sections of hair at a time).  the metal clips are so so...they did their job, most of the hair stayed in the roller while i did my make up, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend the metal clips if you&#x27;re going to go around the house waiting for it to set.  i unrolled probably after 15 minutes, and my hair had the soft big curls, super bouncy, loved it. i then put a ping pong ball size of mousse (i used giovanni, which i just discovered, love it, all natural stuff and smells great) and work in my hair.      the rollers are not too hot to handle, i feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t break b/c of the velcro lining on the rollers, and i think the 1.5 in size is great!  highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> these rollers are just slighly larger than average size. they are flocked with velvet to avoid a high % of damage.however the edges are plastic and will be quite hot to the touch , just bearable. the pins are not convienient at all, the conair roller clips will be a great advantage. for a quick fix or shorter hair i would use the 5 roller travel set. if you want a higer quality try their infinti line . excellent for their prices.</li>
            <li> I have never used hot rollers before and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well they would work on long hair, but several review said that it did a great job and they were right. I had a little trouble getting the clips to hold. But like I said it was my first time. If you have long hair you know how hard it can keep your hair from flattening out at the top, but these rollers did a great job. And the price was really a steal too! If your thinking about buying these definitely do. You really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Hiflyer was absolutely terrific with customer service.  I didn&#x27;t care for the rollers - kept falling out.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these rollers before. What did they change it..............no place to put clips and no on-and-off button. WHY?</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly blonde hair.  My trouble in the past was the curlers getting caught in my hair - these do not get caught.  They do curl my hair, but because of the length, the curl isn&#x27;t really tight.  By the way, my hair is almost long enough to sit on.  Also, these curlers do get pretty hot, so be careful when handling them!</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for jumbo rollers, and these seem to get the best reviews of any of the lower-priced items.     But when I rolled my hair with them, there were crimps in my hair from the lines down either side of the rollers. I can&#x27;t think of any creative way to avoid the crimp, so I got rid of the rollers. (And yes, I did notice that they were way too hot to hold on the plastic ends).    I&#x27;m sure everyone using these has very pretty curls, but they&#x27;re probably also walking around with crimps in funny places all over their heads.</li>
            <li> I had some relatively low expectations when I got this, as I have fine hair that&#x27;s a bit over a foot long all over, but curing iorns were giving me too much damage and lots of split ends. Anyhow, after a 7 minute warm up, and a 10-ish minute set, I had perfect curls with shine &amp; bounce! I do suggest getting the little plastic clips (mine are white) for bang areas or odd little layered sections, but the wire ones work just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product tonight and just used the hot rollers. They were ready to go in about 3 minutes. I have never used hot rollers before so it was somewhat of a disaster... I tried to start from the bottom and work up... don&#x27;t ask why. I seriously had no idea what i was doing. But in the end when I took them out i had much more volume than usual and some wave. I was really happy just with that. My hair is really flat and thin and I hate it.     So naturally I went looking around on the internet trying to figure out how to use these rollers and found this video on youtube.     [...]    I can&#x27;t wait to try again tomorrow! Since I have seen so many posts about people not knowing how to use the wire clips, I thought I would share :)     Happy rolling!</li>
            <li> Does not work well with thick heavy hair; was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best for medium length hair...heats up quickly and stays hot....waves/curls hold well!</li>
            <li> I loved these hot rollers from Conair!&lt;br /&gt;These are great for girls with long, fine hair. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for thick hair though, there wouldn&#x27;t be enough rollers to cover a whole head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;When you turn it on, it has a mild plastic-y odor and it does steam up so if your room&#x27;s smoke detector is ultra-sensitive, it might trigger it.&lt;br /&gt;The clips to hold the rollers in place are not very secure although it does depend on the hair&#x27;s thickness/texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, hopefully you would be too!</li>
            <li> I have very long wild, frizzy kinky hair that never wants to cooperate and is neither straight nor nicely curled naturally, but I get tired of just pulling it back in a bun. I did the straight thing for a while, and have recently started venturing into the world of curls. I don&#x27;t like tight springy curls, but adore big loose wavy curls. These curlers are perfect-- hot to the  touch in a minute or less, big enough for my long hair. They smooth out my hair very easily. I got big loose curls with these in just a few minutes, ran a comb through, and instant waves! Not a single kink to be found! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s fast, and works on dry hair (I can just wake up, style and go--I shower at night) unlike some plain rollers that I&#x27;ve tried. Love the clips as well-- my hair is so thick and long that the \\&quot;velco style\\&quot; curlers do not stay in my hair, and hurt coming out. These curlers are a little heavy if you use very thin sections of hair, but they fall right out when your done, leaving the curls intact.     The case is a little smaller than I was expecting, which is wonderful. Fits right next to my sink, and there&#x27;s still room for other bathroom essentials. I wish the curlers were a little bigger, but I&#x27;m not complaining about that. I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open for a nice set of 3 inch curlers, but in the meantime, I&#x27;m in love with these.</li>
            <li> These are the first hot rollers I&#x27;ve bought in years. They heat up quickly and the directions say to keep them in only 10 minutes. I have wavy hair which takes the curl, so they work quite well and the curls last.</li>
            <li> Works great! I have shorter hair and this makes it look good. I&#x27;m sure once my hair is longer it&#x27;ll look even better!</li>
            <li> I received the rollers two days ago.   I have been a Conair customer for over 15 years and I was extremely disappointed in this product.  The rollers were fine but the clips that came with them don&#x27;t even hold the rollers nor are they made for them.  Where it normally takes me 5 minutes to put them in my hair, it took triple the amount of time, more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.   It was so aggravating trying to hold them in place as they just didn&#x27;t grasp the roller. Having had enough I returned them this morning and to add insult to injury, shipping them back was $10.00. It will definitely make me think twice before I ever order another Conair item .</li>
            <li> They need to fire the person that decided to put metal pins with this roller set.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, pins do not work,simply do not hold rollers in place at all.I tried to use smaller Jumbo pin on Super Jumbo roller and it was slightly better but you have to sit still because any movement  loosens your hair on a roller.&lt;br /&gt;Second,I think pins were a afterthought anyway because there is no place in the set to store pins.So you misplace or lose them and have to buy plastic clips anyway.&lt;br /&gt; As of now I have worthless set of rollers.&lt;br /&gt; I ordered plastic super clips and will update my review after I try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got to try it out with clips. Learning curve is very frustrating but eventually I got it to work half decently.It is easier to get tighter  fit and better results with less hair on the roller.So I run out of rollers with small section left in the back and my hait is not thick at all.Two additional rollers would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I also run out of super clips and had to use metal ones fot last two rollers,it took three of those to be able to secure one roller in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say with this set you will need a lot of practice and patience and it does not really give you curls It creates a slight wave  and a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these. They can be tricky when you use the pins, but after a few times, I finally can put the rollers in very tight, and they won&#x27;t fall out at all. I put them in, wait for them to cool after about 20 min., and I have the shiniest bouncy curls that are so pretty! I always get compliments after I use these. I set with lots of hair spray, and my curls will last all day, so happy I purchased these!</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second set of these rollers.  My hair is naturally curly, and these rollers keep the frizz from taking over.  These rollers heat up so fast it is amazing.  I plug them in and within a few minutes thay are HOT.  I ordered the second set of rollers, because I have long, thick hair.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to wait and reheat to do all of my hair, so I decided to splurge on a second set.  There are 8 large rollers and 4 super large rollers.  These sizes work great with my independent, unruly, naturally curly hair.  I blow my hair dry and then put in these rollers.  (People are amazed when I tell them my smooth hair is actually naturally curly.)  I would love to have a set of ALL super size, but the large work ok.  I do take one set of these rollers on trips with me, and they do not take up that much space as they are very compact.  I truly can&#x27;t live without them, especially if I&#x27;m flying across the country for business, fun, etc.  If you have trouble with the pins that come with these rollers, it is worth the cost, in my opinion, to order the Conair super clips/ pro clips (multiple purpose clips) product link [ASIN:B00065AFP4 Conair SPC10X 10 Super Clips] or [ASIN:B001DCE1JU Conair Champion Salon Pro Roller Clips] which are 10 clips for about $7 and available on Amazon.com.  These make using these rollers \\&quot;a walk in the park\\&quot;.  I just ordered a third set of these clips.  I had my first set for about 10 years, as they simply don&#x27;t wear out.  I wanted to have 30 instead of 10, so after using my first 10 for ten years and my new 10 for two years, I finally ordered that 3rd set.  They arrived, and I&#x27;m thrilled.  I definitely rate the rollers and the clips a 5++.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these rollers! They are good quality, heat quickly, and provide a natural loose curl look. The only con is there is no storage area for the pins.</li>
            <li> I like it. My only concern is that there is no on or off switch.  When you plug it in, it is on.  When you unplug it, it is off.  I love the heat that it produces in the rollers. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t horrible but they didn&#x27;t work that great for me. I didn&#x27;t like the velvet material that covers the curler -- felt like the end result was less curl and limper hair. After giving them several tries, I returned these and went back to using my old curlers -- they&#x27;re smaller but at least there&#x27;s noticeable curl in my hair when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its claims.  Easy to use and heats evenly.  Hair looks healthier after use.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, but the hot rollers take about 20 minutes to get hot enough for the hair then you have to leave them in for about 20-30 minutes, I had to do it 2x to make it have body, I have long thick hair, I would not buy them again</li>
            <li> These rollers are so so. First I would hardly call these rollers jumbo size, they are more like large size rollers so I get more curl than I wanted. Second, while it has a light to let you know the unit is turned on, it doesn&#x27;t have any indicator light to let you know when the rollers are hot enough to use. And lastly, they don&#x27;t really get that hot.</li>
            <li> Having had short hair for a long time, I&#x27;m new to the hot roller world. The good news is that that these rollers create nice strong bouncy curls and waves. The bad news is that they&#x27;re a pain to keep in. Are all hot rollers this heavy? Anticipating problems based on reading some of the reviews, I ordered special clips.  [[ASIN:B000E3047C Conair Super Clips, Hold Hot And Cold Rollers 10 Pack]]  These help some--you have to maneuver the clips under the roller so that one edge of the clip clings to hair next to your scalp. Otherwise, these rollers just don&#x27;t stay in. I finally got a super jumbo shower cap and put in on over the whole mess. I&#x27;d give these a 4 for the nice curls, but a 1-2 for convenience. If you don&#x27;t want to go through what I did, try another brand.</li>
            <li> This product is great that is why I bought it online rather than driving around trying to find that exact model in the stores.  My wife says she is very happy with this product and it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> These heat up pretty quickly and are a good size but the clips are tragic.  They are hard to use and leave weird wrinkles in your hair.  Considering either buying different types of clips or just returning the whole thing.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this product zero stars because that&#x27;s how bad it is. There&#x27;s no way to remedy the problems with these rollers. The clips do not hold the curlers in your hair and the rollers are so big that they don&#x27;t do anything for your hair. I&#x27;ve used different curlers in the past to curl my hair and these are, by far, the worst of the lot. I can&#x27;t decide if I should throw them away or try and sell them to someone else because one try was enough. I bought mine for $10 at a yard sale unused and still in the original box.</li>
            <li> I bought this set on sale yesterday from Target------a horrible disapppointment!  They don&#x27;t get hot enough, and after leaving them in my hair for about 10 minutes, I barely had a limp curl.  Also hard to keep them pinned in the hair.  I&#x27;m returning them today and starting over!</li>
            <li> I was looking for rollers that would be easy to use as I was a first time user. More importantly, I wanted volume and loose curls for my fine Asian hair that is mid-back in length. This product fit the bill. I am very pleased with these rollers. And the loose curls carry over to the next day, which is typically unheard of for my type of hair. Wholeheartedly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these type and they never worked well. This one, however, really made me happy! I have thick, frizzy hair and was skeptical but when the rollers came off my hair looked amazing!! Love this product</li>
            <li> I love these rollers! They don&#x27;t burn your hands and give a jumbo curl. I ordered 4 extra jumbo rollers from the company and they fit nicely in the container. Best of all my friends love the way my hair looks and I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> works great in both my hair and my kids. My oldest has super strait hair and for hers it doesn&#x27;t work well but so far I have not found anything that keeps a curl in her hair. but for typical hair it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s invariably a freakishly tall emaciated supermodel pedaling alongside him. Not only can this female look good wearing a trash bag but her hair is almost always infuriatingly perfect -- Always long and sparkling. Always turgid and billowing. She&#x27;s basically like a mortal mermaid with all that succulent, sexy hair whipped up like steam from a roiling pasta pot.  Now, not everyone can land Leo. But the good news is we CAN have that insanely voluptuous supermodel hair thanks to the Conair Extreme.  I have long ramrod straight hair that has NEVER curled. If it does curl it lasts about 10 minutes tops and then it stealthily begins to wilt and deflate like a souffle left out in a snowstorm. I have tried a multitude of curling irons, wands, Remington rollers etc...and I was about to give up completely when I stumbled across the Conair Extreme. I was flabbergasted. When I took these rollers out: KABOOM! -- I had hair like The Venus De Milo or a young Bridget Bardot frolicking on the beach in St Tropez. Not only that but the curl endured for almost 24 hours! Another plus was that the set heated up instantly and the rollers weren&#x27;t unwieldy or too blazing hot to handle. My only complaint is that the roller clips are very poorly designed and don&#x27;t keep the rollers in place. If you purchase this set you need to buy the Conair SPC10X Super Clips (also sold on Amazon). These clips are the size of kiwis but you can just stuff them all in a big Ziplock bag for storage.  If you want FAT, seductive, Disney heroine hair you must try this set. If you want other women to glare at you with a look that screams &amp;#34;Bitch with hot hair!&amp;#34; you must try this set. I can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll wind up pedaling alongside Leo but at least you&#x27;ll have his girlfriend&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I have naturally curly hair to began with but wanted larger curls and read that this would do the trick. I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for any curls to stay. I first tried this product when my hair was curly and I even put LOTS of hairspray in, it did nothing. I also let the hot-curlers warm up for 20 minutes and tried it three times, and on the third try I left them in my hair for over an hour. Then I tired it with my hair straightened, it was even worse. This product is not worth it. The rollers looked nice and they looked like a good size but didn&#x27;t work for me. I would only recommend this product to those whose hair curls without a lot of heat. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers because I wanted an all-jumbo set for my long hair. I have used this type of clip-roller before with no problems, but on this set the clips do not hold the rollers securely and they tend to droop or even fall out. Maybe with another set of clips it would work.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair.  The product has 4 jumbo, and 8 large rolls.  It works perfectly with the price.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews about the product, I thought I would give these rollers a try.  My hair is shoulder length, but can get frizzy at times and I am also in the middle of growing out a bad haircut.  When I would blow dry my hair and style it with a round brush, it still didn&#x27;t look the way I wanted it to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first set of these rollers arrived, but I had to return them because they were damaged.  There was an awful smell when they heated, so Amazon sent me a new set, and picked up the damaged one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am so glad, because these rollers are fantastic!  My hair is very manageable, and it is making the growing out process very easy.  The curl stays in all day, and my hair seems and looks healthier.  And it only takes a couple minutes to heat up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is that I wish the curler would light up when it is heated. There is a red mark on one curler which I thought would change color when heated but it doesn&#x27;t which is a shame because it would be a way to tell when the rollers are heated.  Years ago, that&#x27;s how you could tell when they were heated properly.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But overall, they are worth every penny and it makes difficult hair look great.  What an improvement!</li>
            <li> these hot rollers work great-I love them they are soft so they dont burn my hair and easy to put in yourself</li>
            <li> I have tons of very fine wavy hair and smaller hot rollers make me look like an elderly poodle. I want them to smooth out the kinks, add some lift, and finish the ends, and these rollers do the trick.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this type of pin for years and so I didn&#x27;t find them difficult to use - but they take a little practice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No pin marks, no fishhook ends, no frizz, no problem! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I wish they made a set with even bigger rollers! How about 2\\&quot;, Conair?</li>
            <li> Despite the concerns expressed by others, I went ahead and purchased these since I needed some large/jumbo hot rollers to help de-frizz/straighten my hair.  They heat up very quickly (a big plus over my 90s set...or was that the 80s.....?).   I echo the concerns of others that the lid hinge is delicate (a.k.a. \\&quot;cheesy\\&quot;).    I do find that the wire clips are about 1/2 inch too short for optimal hold.  However, as long as you don&#x27;t break-dance, the curlers stay put reasonably well.  I did not have the significant problems that some experienced making the curlers stay in---but my hair is thick and medium-long.  Again, Mr. Conair could have done us all a favor by making the wire clips a tiny bit longer.</li>
            <li> I found these on Amazon as I was searching for curlers, but I actually bought the product at a local Target for $27-28. At first I was confused because in the instructions it says the light will turn red when plugged in and will turn a white/iridescent color when ready. I ended up letting the curlers heat for 30 minutes because the light never changed colors...I don&#x27;t think the instructions went with my product because there was only one light bulb in there and the cover over it was orange anyway...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the application of the product...the rollers get hot and your fingers can be tender to touch, but after a few tries mine became used to the heat. The pins that hold the rollers in are difficult. I watched several videos on youtube trying to figure out the proper technique. As other reviewers noted, it takes patience. You have to work at it. I am hair appliance challenged and after several tries and 30 minutes later I figured it out. I still may go by clips at some point, we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the result...love it! For the life of me I cannot use a curling iron and my stylist is able to do these Victoria Secret model waves in my hair and I&#x27;ve been yearning to do this on my own. This product does that! It held throughout the day and even 8 hours (and a 2 hour nap) later the body/waves in my hair looked even better and sexy than it did when I first styled it. It also looked great the next day. I am someone who gets bed hair no matter how long my hair is and the next morning I brushed it out and it still looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few specifications to help others...I have thick, naturally wavy semi curly hair. I blow dried it and then set the rollers. My hair is a few inches past my shoulders and the size of the rollers were perfect for it (I believe it&#x27;s 8 1 inch rollers and 4 1 1/2 inch rollers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: rollers are hot to touch and the pins are a struggle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the clips - the old ones are better. Too hot on the scalp. Does heat up fast, though.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She has very long and VERY thick hair. She said she really loved these rollers and they were sufficient to work for her and the tons of hair she has. She said she would buy again.</li>
            <li> I liked these rollers but they don&#x27;t heat up as fast as I expected. The instructions say you should wait until the light on the front of the case is white, indicating they are hot enough to use. But I waited about a half hour without the light changing, and eventually used them without the light changing, because I was already late to the party I was going to. They work fine, and ultimately I like them so far, but now I know to allot more time to heating them up.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quickly and work great for long hair. I get big, smooth bouncy curls instead of tight, boingy curls that smaller rollers make. The only thing missing from this product is there is not a place in the case to put the pins that go with the rollers.</li>
            <li> use them every other day, the large 4 in the middle add nice body to my thick hair, this is my second set.  the last one lasted over three years before the felt started to thin out, they never lost their heat but without the felt became too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> They are extremely fast and they model my hair which is very fine perfectly. Giving it the volume I was looping for.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, does not curl her hair, but does it give body which is what she likes anyway. Price is right. Wish it had a spot for the clips, even just a magnetic surface on the top.</li>
            <li> The Conair jumbo rollers are exactly what I needed and work very well.  They heat up quickly and the pins work just fine without bumps.  The only thing I would have liked is an automatic shutoff after a period of time.  But heck.  I&#x27;m in such a hurry in the morning, I actually don&#x27;t need a shutoff, since I need to get my hair fixed as quickly as possible.  I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Conair is the best for putting out this product.  IONIC shine is optimum, the velvet flocking protective to the hair and just a handy set to have with all of the same sized rollers instead of having a bunch of loose rollers that you never use.  I use every single roller and have enough every time.  I love them but I do suggest for you to buy the \\&quot;roller clamps\\&quot; that hold the roller and hair in tight secure place.  It does make a huge difference in the results!</li>
            <li> I purchased the set of hot rollers hoping to find an easier/quicker way than a curling iron to smooth out my naturally curly hair and add back some curl after blow drying it with a round brush.     As a newbie to hot rollers, I didn&#x27;t find it too hard to put the rollers in, but I was sure stymied by that clip! No way of putting it in seemed to be all that effective at holding the roller in place! Another reviewer shared a link to a video on putting in the rollers that helped on that score, though the clips are still pretty bad at holding them firmly in place.     The rollers seemed to reach temperature quickly(if the little indicator dot on the one roller is accurate). My complaint is that the rollers really do not retain enough heat to penetrate my thick hair all the way to the roots. The rollers were cool and the outsides of the sections of hair never got more than warm. This means the rollers weren&#x27;t totally effective at smoothing frizz and imparting body.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and have it delivered all the way to Singapore. I have been using Remington&#x27;s heated rollers and I love them, but I have been wanting to have bigger rollers to create Victoria Secret models&#x27; big, beautiful waves. So I was really excited when I found them. Unfortunately, after the first time, the side of the rollers which was made up of the silver velvety material started to burn! I noticed it when it produced a smell and smoke! The rollers are in danger of overheating without any homeostatic control mechanism unlike the Remington&#x27;s heat rollers I&#x27;ve been using. Once, the heated rollers were so hot it almost burnt my scalp. While I like the jumbo-sized curlers so much, it&#x27;s a real disappointment it&#x27;s so dangerous to use it.</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and do a good job curling hair.  They don&#x27;t burn your fingers when you hold them.  My only complaint is the clip that is used to hold the curler in place.  I have had two clips break already.  They are fairly easy to fix but I wish they were more sturdy.  All in all though I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> First off, these aren&#x27;t the rollers to use if you want curls.  They work great to give hair a lot of body.  My hair is so flat normally, that I&#x27;ve been using these just about every day now.  My hair is noticably fuller.    The rollers get very hot.  Those that say they don&#x27;t must not be heating the set up with the lid closed.    It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to use the clips.  A little trial and error was all it took.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, &amp; I only use the jumbo rollers.  This CHV14 heats up quickly and does the job.  I do not like the clips that come with the machine.  They dent my hair and are not strong enough.  So I had to buy the Conair SPC10R Super Clips which do the job without denting my hair.  Buy both at the same time so shipping will be less.I wash and blow dry my hair, then use the rollers.  I&#x27;ve cut my hair-time in half, and now with less wear and tear on my hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and the curls last a long time.  This is my first time using this product and I would recommend it to anyone wanting lasting curls.  Easy to use and store away for later.</li>
            <li> The curlers work good however the clips to hold the largest rollers do not work well at all. They are too small and do not hold the rollers properly.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve grown my hair long I needed something to meek it easier to style.  These hot rollers are perfect!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; meant &amp;#34;extremely used and incomplete.&amp;#34; None of the pins came with it, nor did the instruction manual. I&#x27;m sending it back. I&#x27;ll just go purchase rollers at the store.</li>
            <li> I got these from my husband for Christmas this past year. I love the curlers. They work very well, however they give more of a body wave than a curl because the rollers are so large. While those aren&#x27;t the results I would like, they still give me very pretty, full, wavy hair, so I am happy with the way they work. BUT...I also have a complaint about the clips. I don&#x27;t have any problems at all keeping the clips/rollers in...you just have to put the clip straight up and down against your scalp so that they can&#x27;t unroll...I can do all sorts of things with them in and even forget about them sometimes. My problem is that the clips leave crimps in my hair where they attach. They cause little indentations in the set of your hair and it stays because of the heat. So I always have to iron the crimps out after I take the rollers out...sort of defeats the purpose of using rollers to save time. Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.. You need to play around with this many many times to see what positioning of the curls works best for you.. Or else your curl will come out weird. I stopped using it after several months though. It really depends on what you like though. I would personally stick with my regular hair curler</li>
            <li> Works well fast to beautiful curls in 5 min</li>
            <li> Great for those days when my hair needs a little boost.  Love the sizes of the rollers for longer hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived timely and is exactly as it was advertised. It is the only product of its kind I have found that will hold all my hair! Ive got shoulder length, thick hair and am confident were it longer I had room to wrap more hair around the rollers. I even had 2 left over! I would recommend this product to anyone on the go. I will even take this with me traveling as it is a quick fix after completing makeup, you just unroll hair and go!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time for my senior portraits and I looked stunning! I used ItsJudysTime video on YouTube as a guide. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and have tried several different rollers and these are by far the best.  Nice curl that lasts and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> I have used a Conair heated rollers for years.  The one listed above I received does not have an on/off switch on the unit, which is a real inconvenience to have to plug and unplug each time I use it.  Also there are four larger than usual rollers in the middle that is not there in my Conair that I am now using.  I would like to return this Conair.  I have not used it at all.  As soon as I saw it did not have an on/off switch on the unit, I put it back in the box.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW THE PROCEDURE FOR RETURNING THE CONAIR.  THANKS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> Looking for a way to curl my hair in an even manner with little or no time. These curlers heat quickly, are large in size, and work well. I have thin hair but a lot if it, so it is not the best set of rollers for me. There is no on and off button, so it is not as safe as other hot roller sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not comfortable letting my granddaughter use this without having me in her presence. The chances of a burn seem low, but I want to be cautious. I think there are other sets that may be much more preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;prisrob 06-28-15</li>
            <li> Love these hot rollers.  The Jumbo rollers are the perfect size for waves.  I wish they were all Jumbo because the Super ones are really only good for  volume (you don&#x27;t get much curl from them) but other all I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I recommend the Conair clips to go with them because those little metal things are a joke.</li>
            <li> Once you order the big clips, separately as in not included with, the jumbo rollers are great, I hate having to order something separately because the clips that come with the rollers are not as quality minded as the big clips I ordered</li>
            <li> My husband got me this set of rollers for Christmas. I have extremely thick hair, so I did not have enough rollers to do my whole head at one time, but I love the product so I will be purchasing a second set. Some people said that you should leave the rollers in your hair for 20 minutes or so... I was in a hurry this morning but I REALLY wanted to try them out, so I rolled one side, left it for 5 minutes, brushed my teeth and did make-up while they reheated, and then rolled the other side for 5 minutes. My hair looked fantastic! It&#x27;s been about 12 hours since I rolled it and it still looks great!</li>
            <li> Had to throw these away. They literally melted in the case while plugged in. I took one roller out to put in my hair and noticed a burnt plastic smell. The roller had melted where it splits to connect to the metal plates. Not good.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my old Conair rollers had seen better days.  These do not heat up as fast as the old ones.  My hair does not curl nearly as well.  Also, the clips don&#x27;t always hold your hair.</li>
            <li> I just used the rollers for the first time on my shoulder-length, very fine hair. They work pretty well. They heat up quickly and the flocked rollers are just the right size and don&#x27;t slip out. I was kind of concerned about the clips when I purchased them because the description is somewhat vague. They work okay. I&#x27;m going to need to buy the claw ones because the ones that come just do not hold the rollers in very well. They can only clamp over about a 1/4\\&quot; of hair on the 2\\&quot; wide clip. All in all, I do really like what they do for my hair!</li>
            <li> I was hoping the rollers would be bigger. I have long, really thick hair &amp; the rollers are not big enough &amp; there are not enough of them to do a good job. The clips are usless for holding the roller tight. I returned it the next day!</li>
            <li> This does just what I wanted it to do.  My hair feels thin to me but my hairdresser says I have \\&quot;a lot of fine hair\\&quot;.  My length is a long bob and I wanted the curlers just for body.  I put them in, leave them for about 10 minutes and take them out.  Soft waves.  It did take me a while to figure out how to get the clips to work.  I don&#x27;t think this product would work as well on very long or heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick Asian hair and was looking for something to add some body and polish.  These worked really well and heated up quickly, although there weren&#x27;t enough rollers to get all of my hair, so I had to buy two.  The clips aren&#x27;t bad either, they&#x27;re not those chintzy pins, so bonus points for that!</li>
            <li> I scoured the site for recommendations and these were pretty high plus a friend had an older version of the product. They get super hot super fast and work really well. I highly recommend you buy the white plastic roller clips though because the ones that come with don&#x27;t work so well - especially with the uber thick hair that I have. Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> They do everything their supposed to - curl your hair -heat up quick - fairly comfortable (as comfortable as hot rollers can be) - good purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the wire clips like the box said I would. So they are just sitting on the shelf with no purpose. 30 dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to complain when my hair has wound its way around these curlers a b&#x27;jillion times and come out gorgeous.  The top cracked, but that was after years of use.  So why not 5 stars?  I think I&#x27;m just frustrated they don&#x27;t sell larger hot rollers like my friend has.  These are like the largest size in the classic three-size roller set my mom used.  Good, but only for a certain hair length.  Great quality, though - long lasting and my hair is super healthy despite using these!</li>
            <li> very nice set...works well</li>
            <li> Love these - still have them after 2+ years, work great!</li>
            <li> 1st one was defective returned.  This is replacement it works great. Just remember it&#x27;s really hot on metal bars. You will get a burn mark!</li>
            <li> Yes, I love these.  I have extremely thick and curly hair and these work so great.  They tame my frizzy hair and give me large beautiful curls.  They heat up fast!  The texture of the rollers grip my hair nicely and make it easy to wrap my hair around the roller.  Honestly I have had my set for almost 5 years now and it still works well.  I am going to purchase another set so I can roll all my hair at once.  I have a lot of hair so I need two sets.  I am guessing people with normal hair would only need one.</li>
            <li> This has been the best set of hot rollers for a newbie like me to get used to trying out! Very easy, heats up fast, and seems to be very durable so far! I think that my only complaint is that I wish I&#x27;d bought this sooner, versus always going to my stylist for the retro look and paying big $$$ for roller sets in a salon!</li>
            <li> i love this set. it is great thanks I ordered two of the hot collers and I am glade to have done that</li>
            <li> Really  excided to get these jumbo rollers  only to find out they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. Would have returned product but husband threw away paper work and boxes. Lucky you! :-(</li>
            <li> Very fast heat up. Not crazy about the clips as sometimes they leave marks on my hair so I use other ones that I have. Over all I like the size of the rollers. No more wasted tiny rollers that never get used.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Doesnt burn hands  heats quickly  ample rollers for big and small curls    cons:  The clips are too thin and dont hold the big rollers completely.</li>
            <li> The curlers did a great job as far as giving body to my hair.  The problem is the clips.  They do not keep the curlers in, they kept falling out of my hair.  I ended up using hair clips that I have that open really wide and that seems to work.  Conair you need to develop a better system.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot rollers for a long time. I have baby fine hair and have always had trouble creating volume. I also use products after a shampoo to help, but regular rollers or a curling iron just won&#x27;t do anything for my hair; my hair simply will not hold curl with them. This product is great__ although I will say I usually use seperate plastic roller clamps instead of the clips provided. Either way, a very good product.</li>
            <li> These rollers work well...my only complaint&#x27;s are, that it is somewhat difficult to keep them in place on your head. They are heavy and it takes many adjustments to try and keep them in place. I ordered and used the ConairPro Pro Clips. The second thing is they get very hot at the ends and you should be carefull not to burn your fingers like I have. Other than that, they work well.</li>
            <li> After having luck with a pervious set of Conair hot rollers I decided on this one.  There are four jumbo rollers and eight large rollers, this is great but what isn&#x27;t great are the clips!  They don&#x27;t fit the jumbo rollers once you get your hair wrapped around it and they leave dents in your hair.  They are large, plasitc, hinged clips so storage is a pain as well, there is no storage for these clips on the set itself so I had to find a little plastic bucket for them.  This will be a pain when I travel.      My previous set of Conair hot rollers was pretty similar to this one except all of the curlers were the large size and they had regular metal clips with storage for the clips on the set.  I wish I could find this same set again!    I am sure there are other hot rollers on the market that would be a lot more convenient!</li>
            <li> This product works really well, and it is really easy to get the hang of after a few tries. The only reason I am giving it four stars is although the curls are beautiful, they don&#x27;t seem to stay for very long.</li>
            <li> I do not like the metal clips. The reason I ordered the rollers from Amazon was because the picture showed the blue clips. The first time these rollers were shipped, I thought an error had been made. So did the Amazon rep when I called. The same rollers were shipped again. When I looked for the original online, they were no longer selling on the site.</li>
            <li> This product was used by me in Denmark, so I had to use special electrical connectors. A fire almost ensued within 30 seconds of my turning it on, which was quite frightening. Once I had corrected the voltage through various conductors, I still struggled to keep the curlers in my hair with the curler pins. I could not get a good curl for the special event I had that evening. Perhaps a better guide&#x3D;&#x3D;albeit a simple one, would help users with this product.</li>
            <li> Heats in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are unusable - it is not possible to set a heat setting so they get too hot to handle very quickly; the clip to hold the roller in the hair is too flimsy to work, even if two are used, so the only way to really use the rollers is to simply hold it in place manually for several minutes and hope it takes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good hot rollers that don&#x27;t create power-perm &#x27;80s \\&quot;Dallas\\&quot; style curls. With other hot rollers I&#x27;ve tried, the rollers were too small and made tight fuzzy curls. But Conair Extreme Heat with Jumbo and Superjumbo rollers create big, soft waves that last all day. I&#x27;ve rolled my hair almost every day since I got the rollers, and get lots of compliments. The only downside are the pins that hold the rollers. Sometimes they&#x27;re tricky to get in properly and the rollers don&#x27;t feel secure. But these are by far the best rollers I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> These Rollers are great for volume, but they DO NOT curl your hair.  My hair was barely turned under after leaving them in for almost an hour.  It tells you on the box that they are strictly for volume.  The Clips aren&#x27;t quite long enough to hold the rollers in place, so you will need some different clips, like the jumbo clips you can buy seperately.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and these rollers are great for smoothing out frizzy hair. The large size also helps soften the curl. This is the largest size of heated rollers I&#x27;ve been able to find on the market. An important tip when using any hot roller is to make sure your hair is completely dry before using. I add a product like Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing (or a spray-on heat protector) to my hair first and then roll my hair. It comes out nice and smooth with big loose waves.</li>
            <li> The rollers heated promptly and I like the look of the soft curls that are the result of using these rollers BUT I have to physically hold the rollers in my hair because the clips are not long enough and they (1) simply allow the rollers to partially fall out and (2) are almost impossible to remove if you are trying to redo a roller.  I am going to order some of the Conair clips and see if that will help the problem, but the clips that come with the set are useless and really need to be re-designed.</li>
            <li> Ordered these last week for $29, now they are $19.  There were NO clips included, meaning not only has it cost me $10 more; I now have to go buy clips  :(    Haven&#x27;t tried them yet to review how they work as there were no clips!</li>
            <li> I had another Conair set that I bought around 1990 that was still working, but old and breaking apart, so I decided to replace it.  I first bought the Xtreme Instant Heat(tm) Multisized Hot Rollers (the set with the pink rollers) but upon unpacking it, I decided I didn&#x27;t like it, and returned it.    I bought these instead, and they are awesome!  I am 53 years old, with good hair still (I love and recommend Wen products!)  My hair is straight, cut in a shoulder-length layered cut, and colored.  These rollers are perfect when I want some volume and soft, loose curls.  I usually just comb through with my fingers after removing the rollers and allowing my hair to cool - this gives me a very natural, up-to-the-minute look.  But hey 80&#x27;s girls - you can still brush your hair upside down and get the big hair 80&#x27;s look! ;)    I expect to use these for many years.  And I love that they come with the old-style pins - they hold the rollers better than the newer clips.</li>
            <li> I have had these rollers since November, and use them a couple of times each week, so this is a road-tested review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;They heat quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I like the velvet covering on the roller.&lt;br /&gt;The clips don&#x27;t leave marks in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The slit in the rollers for the heating element allows your hair to get underneath the edge of the roller, and if you are not careful, you can pull your hair out or break it.&lt;br /&gt;I use all eight rollers and sometimes the clips just refuse to hold the curler in place.  It happens with two or three rollers each time I use them.  It&#x27;s always rollers in different locations, which tells me it is not my placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, they work, and produce good curls, but I wish they would make a set in this size that are designed like the classic ConAir Rollers - [[ASIN:B001BLRYMO Conair HS34R Compact Hairsetter, Blue]]</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse long hair and while it works well enough, even after buying the conair professional clips, I still have trouble keeping the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these hot rollers...it heats up quick.  The curlers are easy to handle and don&#x27;t burn your fingers if you grab them correctly.  I&#x27;ve had different hot rollers before but this is the best set so far.</li>
            <li> Pros:  12 very large rollers, heats up quickly, stays hot, rollers easy to handle, works well to de-frizz thick &amp; wavy hair, left hair smooth  Cons: because rollers are so large, difficult to keep on head, had to use clips (purchased separately) wire clips don&#x27;t hold roller, even using big plastic clips had to roll a section 3 or 4 times to get roller positioned right for clip to hold  Overall:  will use on special occasions</li>
            <li> I like the rollers, and Conair has always had good products.  What I don&#x27;t like is the size of the rollers.  I wanted large rollers, but these are a bit large for my hair.  I use them anyway, and they will suffice for now. I wish they had an automatic \\&quot;off\\&quot; switch - but they&#x27;re hard to find in electric rollers.</li>
            <li> It may be my thick course hair, these don&#x27;t give me much curl. Heat up fast and work good so don&#x27;t let my review decide it for you.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me. At all. I followed the instructions and did what I was supposed to and they just didn&#x27;t work for me. The curls didn&#x27;t hold, they were really hard to put in, they didn&#x27;t get very hot, and they were hard to take out, to the point that I was tugging pretty hard on my own hair, which isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. But if you buy them, I hope they work, and that you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine-to-medium straight hair, and have tried curling it with these rollers 3-4 times now. The curl never lasts more than an hour or 2, even with excessive hair spray. Wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased :(</li>
            <li> Great curlers. Very easy to use. Won&#x27;t damage hair like a curling or flat iron. Definitely would recommend this to anybody that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on their hair. Also great for busy mommies.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of returning these hot rollers because they are so hot that they burn my scalp. I ordered them because of the size.</li>
            <li> These are really good if you have long hair! But your hair DOES need to be somewhat layered. They won&#x27;t work that well if your hair is all one length ofcourse. I&#x27;ve gotten SO MANY compliments and they only take like 10 minutes to put in and I can still do things with my baby unlike if I were using a curling iron...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these. They give my hair great shape and wave and are easy to use and heat up quickly. I would prefer a few more to cover my whole head, but this is close. It&#x27;s nice to hold your hair in a certain shape and be able to let it cool. Gives some volume too.</li>
            <li> I wanted a set of hot rollers to give my thin hair volume, and these work just fine.  i use the 4 black larger rolls for volume up top, and if i want to go curly ill use the other ones.  It works as expected and heats up quickly.  There is no storage spot that I could locate for the pins, so I just threw them in a cute tray next to the rollers on my countertop.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist.  Only fault is the pins to keep in my hair.  They are too short to be effective.</li>
            <li> The only thing I havn&#x27;t mastered yet is the metal pins to make them stay on other then that great!</li>
            <li> Very good hot rollers for longer hair. The big rollers smooth out my coarse, frizz-prone hair really well. This set seemed to have the biggest rollers I could find. Only two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is no attached compartment in which to keep the roller pins when they&#x27;re not in use. You end up putting them in a separate Baggie, then hope you don&#x27;t misplace or lose them. I have another hot curler set that has an attached compartment for the pins, which is a really good design.&lt;br /&gt;2. There are two size rollers in this set- big and jumbo, and each has its own sized pins. One set of  pins is purple tipped and the other set is black tipped. The colors are a bit hard to differentiate, especially when you&#x27;re in a hurry. I would recommend the manufacturer make the pins in more easily (and rapidly) differentiated colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set would be perfect it weren&#x27;t for these two complaints. But overall, this is a very good set of big and jumbo rollers .</li>
            <li> I was sooo excited to get these because it seemed to have lots of jumbo rollers (more than most sets), but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  It wouldn&#x27;t hold the curl no matter how long I let the set heat up. I even bought the clips that people recommended w/ this set, but still it didn&#x27;t work well. I have another set that has clips that heat up w/ the rollers and that type of set seems to hold the curl for most of the day, but I just wished it had as many jumbo rollers as this one.</li>
            <li> I recently had to retire a set of Conair hot rollers...they were about 10 years old and the flocking was coming off. After looking at higher priced brands I decided to stick with Conair and try the Extreme Heat set. I love them! My hair is long and layered, and while my original Conair set was nice, these rollers are a great improvement. My hair has a pretty, soft curl yet it looks relaxed--not too poofy on top. Rollers do heat up fast and the pins work just fine. The only thing I would caution is to watch how you set them on your head--I tend to secure them too tightly and it is too hot on my scalp. Still learning how to use this set but I do think it is a great product. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> There is no place to store the clips! I own an older set of Conair rollers, and there is a little compartment to hold the metal pins, but surprisingly, this one does not!    Overall, the curlers are ok. I like my older set better.</li>
            <li> These rollers really do heat up quickly as claimed, under 2 minutes. I have the older Conair  rollers, which did take longer.  I bought these for the Super Jumbo rollers. Finally, there are larger hot rollers. I gave these a 4 star rating simply because I would rather have all Super Jumbo rollers, and am buying a product where I am wasting money on rollers I am not using.  The four Super Jumbo rollers make spending time on my hair so much faster, it is worth it to me. Also, once you purchase this full set, you will find with the directions, an address and cost for buying more Super Jumbo rollers--which I have done.  For 4, I believe it was only $7.50, including shipping. Since my older Conair rollers are several years old and still working, I expect these will last for a long time as well. And the bonus is that they do heat up quickly. A good purchase if hot rollers are needed.</li>
            <li> I was actually fed up with the previous model, which did a lovely job until I broke the lid. This model has some major advantages.    #1 the faceplate is open, which allows for cleaning miscellaneous hairs that would get  stuck in the previous model. I love this aspect. The older model would look kind of cruddy after awhile.     #2 It comes with 4 super jumbo rollers, which are perfect for shorter layers or shoulder length hair. The rollers leave an awesome shine. My hair is naturally wavy, but I hate blow drying my hair straight so I opt for hot rollers.    #3 I love the fact that they come with the traditional wire clips vs. the new palstic clips. The wire clips don&#x27;t leave indentations on your hairdo.    #4 The rollers heat up instantly. I can turn my rollers on, walk my dog, roll my hair upon my return :)    The previous model had a caddy for the wire clips and this model does not. The elimination of the wire clip is the only drawback.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted.  The rollers are large and perfect for my long hair.  I had been using a large curling iron but these are much easier and save me a lot of time in the morning.  The rollers grip my hair unlike other types of rollers that are smooth, my hair just slips right off of those kind.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE these curlers. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, and it&#x27;s finally long. Now...what to do with long hair?! Well, I hate my curling iron. It&#x27;s annoying and too cumbersome and unpredictable. These are fabulous. Quick, easy, and I get the exact curls I want...the kind that are all over the magazines. FABULOUS product.    This link taught me all I need to know: [...]</li>
            <li> I have the older set of these rollers but there just weren&#x27;t enough rollers to do my entire hair so I bought this new set.  The set is good except for two things that they changed with the new model.  1) They added in four super huge rollers which really don&#x27;t do much because they are so big.  2) For some reason they got rid of the area where you can store the roller clips.  So the clips basically have to be stored somewhere other than with the rollers.  The spot where it should be is still there so I don&#x27;t know why they wouldn&#x27;t have just left the hole there.  But the rollers will work very well and heat up extremely fast so overall I am basically happy with them.</li>
            <li> This set is all you need.  They heat up quickly and the sizes are the only ones you use anyway!</li>
            <li> Burned my fingers, burned my scalp, and too much curl! Basically, just too hot. And I got the electric rollers because I wanted something that would be gentler on my hair than a curling iron. Still looking.</li>
            <li> The flocked surface is nice, but the design overall is not good. The clips are too short to hold rollers in place. Back in the day, such u-shaped clips were about an inch longer, and I never had a problem before with the rollers falling out. Not true now. Also, the clips are color-coded at the tip to match the size of the roller, but the colors are so close, it&#x27;s hard to get the right one. The grove in the roller to hold the roller on the heating element makes it difficult to get the clip over the roller: the clip gets stuck in the grove. The heating elements are bars that go the length of the case, and when reaching to get another roller, it is easy to touch the heating element, which can be uncomfortable. There is no tray to hold the clips between uses. Overall a bad design: if the rollers won&#x27;t stay in place, they don&#x27;t work. Returned them.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my shoulder length hair so my curls would look natural and have lots of body. I love the ease of the rollers, they are felt covered, helps hair stay and less damage to hair. Definitely get hot fast. You can time them if you want less heat. The only design flaw- no clip holder which I find just weird. I lay them in a dish next to the rollers but traveling, you can throw them in and close the lid.</li>
            <li> My first time buying hot rollers. I think they&#x27;re a great product. Only bought them because they were on sale and I really needed something to give me big curls. I saw on youtube there is other hair curlers by conair but they are pink and smaller. Personally I love big curls. I have asian hair and it looks great in big big curls.</li>
            <li> Okay, for starters, I bought this item at Walmart (about 28 bucks), excited to have soft,wavy,bouncy, voluminous, \\&quot;Hollywood\\&quot; curls.  Let me begin with my hair type. I have decently long hair, about 5 inches below my shoulders. It has been dyed some, and is slightly damaged but not extremely damaged. I normally curl my hair with a Hot Tools 1 1/4 inch barrel curling iron and have NO problem getting curls to stay all day , with a spritz of hair spray, not much at all. I have only used these twice, so ill give them another week before i return them (trying out different methods.  Here&#x27;s the bottom line:  -These create bouncy, big curls/waves  -That last for about an hour.  I spritzed hair spray all over after blow drying, let curlers get hot ( And I mean FREAKING hot. They get so hot I have to be careful to not burn my fingers or ears.)  Left them in until they completely cooled.  Took them out and thought: \\&quot;Yay! so pretty!\\&quot;  Then looked in the hour about an hour later and they were already falling out.  I wouldn&#x27;t particularly recommend these curlers. The idea is great, but for someone who normally has no problem with getting curls to stay, these were sorry.</li>
            <li> This product was just what I wanted big curls and they stayed curly all day and even the next day after using them my hair was still bouncy and looked good.  I am very pleased with the curlers they heat up fast and are easy to use..</li>
            <li> Hi,  I bought the hot rollers for my daughter and she loves them.  The only downside she said, there is not a holder for the pins and she is scared she is going to lose them.</li>
            <li> Love the set. Only wish there was a holder for the clips when not in use. Have to place the clips on the counter and hope they don&#x27;t fall in the sink. Also, for travel, it would be nice to have a place to store the clips.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and stays hot.  Curlers are covered with a soft velvet material which is gentle on the hair.  I am happy with this set overall, my only complaint is that the pins do not keep rollers tight in my hair.  I bought clamps to hold them in place.  I do not know how anyone can keep the curlers in with those stupid pins.</li>
            <li> Love the jumbo size and love the metal pin/clips. Super easy to use and heats up fast. But the barrels don&#x27;t get hot enough to maintain the curls. It&#x27;s great for about an hour but goes straight pretty soon after unless I use a ton of hairspray. I have used other rollers before that keeps my hair curly long enough (and hotter) just not as wide/big as these... my hair usually holds curls pretty well.</li>
            <li> I like that there are big &amp; smaller rollers BUT, be careful as the rollers get very hot and could burn your scalp.  I use end papers to keep my scalp protected.</li>
            <li> These are the best rollers for full hair with body.  The wave and body stay in my hair for two days, helps to make my second day hair style look like I put a lot of effort into achieving it when I only had to brush, pin, clip, or ponytail!  Love these!</li>
            <li> The larger ones are too big. Head can&#x27;t hold them up.</li>
            <li> I have been using a curling iron for years when I saw this product and decided to give it another go.  Hot rollers were what everyone used 20 years ago, but were they as good as an iron?  They sure are, in fact they make the iron look like a poor choice in my opinion.  The rollers heat quickly, are a nice large size that works great on long hair, and they are easy to use.  The soft covering on the rollers is kind to your hair as well, and I think gives a better curl than an iron.  I love this things and highly recommend them to anyone who wants to be a curly girly.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted for my long hair.  Nothing fancy but works well and does the job! Happy!</li>
            <li> At first I thought these curlers would be great as they give good body to the hair. After using them for several months I have found they are burning my hair and creating a lot of damage to the ends. These curlers are way too hot.</li>
            <li> these are great, the velvety surface holds them in well and they are quick to heat up.  Hot rollers have come a long way since my last set was new!</li>
            <li> I cannot get these curlers to stay in my hair.  I&#x27;ve used other curlers successfully, not sure what the issue is here but the clips provided just do not hold the curlers in place.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair at all. I have long thin hair but tons of it. I tried using them 4 different times and no luck. Purchased a curved straight iron instead and that works great</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT...it does NO harm to my hair...heats up quickly...and curls my wavy hair in 15 minutes only...HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years. I like them alot though sometimes they got too hot and burned my head. They heat up quickly which I like.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatley all of a sudden the rollers started to fall apart. I could hear them groaning and cracking while in my hair! I took them out immediatley and they were litterally coming unglued....wow! Never had that happen before......update...I have bought another set of these. I have to take responsibility for the melting. I was heating these up way to long(up to an hour).i don&#x27;t let hem heat for more than 10 minutes And I have had no issues issues my head getting burns.</li>
            <li> I really like this but I had to go out and buy another one because there are just not enough rollers in it and I wish they would make the super jumbo with 12 rollers instead of have the big ones mixed with the small ones</li>
            <li> These rollers are pefect for a person on the go. You can quickly put them in and take them out, with no hassle. They don&#x27;t make your hair look really curly. They just add wave and fullness, because they are the larger size roller.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair and flat iron it.  Works beautifully, however, there are not enough rollers.</li>
            <li> When I first got these this summer I thougt they were nice. They heat up quickly and I didn&#x27;t mind the split down the middle. Then some of the rollers I have dropped on the floor did not seem to fit smoothly into the slot they heat up in and and the stress of pushing them in and pulling them out started to cause the rollers to break apart.    Just this week the back row of rollers stopped heating up and the front row does not seem to have temperature control. The front row got so hot the silver plastic started to melt!!!!     I&#x27;m disappointed because I did like them.</li>
            <li> Conair puts out a good product and these are no exception. After 1 use, I decided I needed smaller rollers just for the top of my hair. I took 4 of the large rollers from my most recent set of Conair rollers and put them in place of 4 of the jumbos in this set. They worked perfectly. They heat up fast and roll easily. This about about my 6th set of Conair rollers. I get bored and want a change before anything has ever not worked on them.</li>
            <li> These curlers are just awesome!  Although the box says it only takes 2 minutes to warm up I like to let it warm up for about 10 (I flip on the switch as soon as I wake up).  The curlers will get hot but I find if you roll them quickly they don&#x27;t singe your fingers.  I read other reviews who complained about the rollers being too hot against the skin and to avoid that I just put a few pieces of toilet paper underneath and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears, scalp or neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me about 5 minutes to put the curlers in my hair and I leave them in for 10 minutes while I dress, eat breakfast ..whatever else I need to do.  If I really want to set them I blast them with a shot of hot followed with cold from my hair dryer before unrolling them.  The initial crimp from the clip is not noticable and calms down quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks amazing for the rest of the day (provided it&#x27;s not humid).  It has a ton of bounce, volume and a soft wave that frames my face and really makes my layers stand out.  I normally can even get away have it still look \\&quot;done\\&quot; the next day after wearing it for a full day and sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and it isn&#x27;t damaged by these curlers.  Plus I am constantly complimented on my hair and find that these fit in really well with a low maintenance routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a curling iron takes me a hour if I&#x27;m lucky and keeps me attached to the sink.  This takes less than 10 minutes of effort on my part and gives me a fabulous every day look.</li>
            <li> If you use curlers on top of your head (from the forehead back to the top-middle) they flop forward. The clips do not seem to be heavy enough or able to be positioned so that the curlers to not fall forward. Very maddening. If you don&#x27;t need to use curlers on the top of your head (or for bangs) the hairsetter is fine - otherwise, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I want to add my agreement to the rest of the people who found the clips included with this product absolutely worthless. I wasn&#x27;t able to get the rollers to work with the clips provided ever, NOT ONCE. I couldn&#x27;t even get them to stay in for more than 10 seconds. I was forced to purchase the other clips that Conair manufactures and still encounter problems with the rollers falling out. I think the suggestion that one other reviewer had, to wear a shower cap, is a good one. The only problem is keeping the rollers in your hair long enough to put the cap on because when you&#x27;re done doing the front and start on the back, the rollers in the front start to fall out, even with the additional clips! Rather than being able to walk around and put on makeup or get dressed, this product forces one to stay absolutely stationary to have any prayer of getting the rollers to stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely stunned that this product ever made it to the marketplace as it exists. Did no one at Conair ever test this? No one at Conair found any problems with it? The problems this unit has is so egregious that people should have lost their jobs over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some benefits- when you do get it to work, the hair styles it produces are beautiful. I have had several stellar hair days due to this product. The fact that it heats up so quickly is also wonderful. However, due to the drawbacks with the rollers themselves, I can&#x27;t really recommend this product to anyone other than those who are gluttons for punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am jealous of all the people who have written reviews and don&#x27;t seem to have these issues. I have experimented with every technique I can think of with no luck.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well, even for someone with thick, long hair. A friend recommended Conair products along this line and I highly recommend this set. I&#x27;ve used it many times and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl hair and these work great. My hair is really long and the big curlers allow me to curl my hair without having to double up the curlers which is great. I do have to curl part of my hair with my flat iron because there are not enough curlers for all of my hair but I like this set a lot. My mother in law also likes this set and has used it as well.</li>
            <li> These do not get hot enough to set a curl.  Unfortunately, the box was recycled with the other Christmas boxes so I guess Goodwill get a new set.  Perhaps they will work better with another hair type.  My hair has a good bit of body and is shoulder length, thick, but very fine.</li>
            <li> Thought they would hold more curl. it might just be my hair.</li>
            <li> Worst hot rollers ever!  The pins were not long enough to keep the rollers in my hair, the rollers didn&#x27;t fit well on the hot metal bar.  I couldn&#x27;t keep them in my hair long enough to get a curl so can&#x27;t rate how well my hair curled. Dropped one of the rollers and it didn&#x27;t fit on the bar any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I was inspired by this amazing video on youtube where a girl uses these rollers, and her hair comes out shiny and well curled; I tried these curlers twice, and even left them in for 30 minutes, and I got some waves, but they only lasted an hour or so, even with use of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem with the wire roller pins at all, the curlers stay in quite nicely, unfortunately, the hair rollers just don&#x27;t work well :(  I may try them one more time (3 is a charm) just to make sure that they don&#x27;t work, and then I am going to return them and buy a traditional 1\\&quot; curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so jealous of all the girls that have had great experiences with these rollers ;)</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers because I felt the positive responses outweighed the negative.  That was a mistake!  These do get EXTREMELY hot - to the point that my scalp and forehead were burned by them.  I sent them back.  Maybe they work for coarser, thicker hair, but not for my fine locks.  The clips did not hold the roller well and were hard to place without jabbing the scalp. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy and a really nice hot roller size for long hair.  And, there are enough rollers for even thick hair.  The only drawback is the metal wire devices that are like the old ones of years gone by... but these are too short to hold the roller.  I gave away all the old hot roller wire clips years ago... so I had to purchase two packs of the conair clips to use with rollers.  Or, try to find some old wire u-shape roller holders at the flea market or salvation army donation center... too much trouble, so ordered the clips... need to figure that into your price, but still a good deal... and they work really well!  And, get the Chi Silk Fusion to use with the hot rollers... you will get some nice compliments on your hair!!  (I wanted to fancy up my long straight hair occasionally... so will use infrequently, but sure makes hair look nice!!)</li>
            <li> I really love the results that I get from this product. My goal was to have nice, soft curls towards the bottom of my hair and great volume...don&#x27;t forget the volume! This product gave me exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for years but they were the assorted smaller sizes and sometimes I could end up with the poodle look (80&#x27;s flashback!) These curlers heat up very quickly and are the normal warm-to-the-touch when putting them in. The little metal clips that come with it hold pretty good (If you find your clip isn&#x27;t holding well I&#x27;ve found that using a smaller section of hair helps some).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time for the draw backs: there is no place to store the clips in the container which I find really odd and inconvenient. Also there is no  cord storage which is another pain. To fix these small issues I simply saved the little plastic bag that the clips came in and placed them back in there and store them in between the curlers (after they&#x27;ve cooled) and I left the cord tied up like it comes to help keep is someone shorter and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product again and again. I hope this review helps, I depend greatly on reviews personally.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, makes hair smoother.  However, it&#x27;s not meant for thick hair.  I have slightly wavy hair that I usually use a large round brush and hairdryer to smooth/straighten.  My hairdresser uses these (she has fine hair) to get the same effect but save time in the morning.  It did save time but would probably have been better if I used stronger clips (I bought the separate Conair roller clamps - 10 pk - not enough for 1 of these sets) and more rollers (purchase a second set).</li>
            <li> I wanted more volume and these rollers work great! They heat up fast, really fast, and don&#x27;t snag my hair. The only thing I would prefer would be roller clamps instead of pins. I am new to rollers and I haven;t quite mastered getting the pins right each time. I would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> these are THE worst hot rollers that i have ever used, and i have been using hot rollers since they came out in the 60s.  the wires to hold the roller in your hair are too short.  they keep falling out!  and that space in the roller............  OMG  the wire gets caught in it and if the ends of your hair happen to be there you get crimped ends.  these are blacklisted as far as i am concerned.!</li>
            <li> The clips that come with these rollers don&#x27;t hold them in my hair.  They do get hot fairly quickly, but you need to get other clips to hold them on.</li>
            <li> This product is good if you are looking for very loose large curls.  My hair is just below my shoulders and when I use these curlers my hair is very wavy.  Heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> My salon brand more expensive ones were getting old &amp; I lived the color of these conair ones but worried the reviews werent great but 4 the price  , im glad I took the chance, I love em! Have had em over a month no probs.</li>
            <li> I recently wrote a review for another similar Comair curler product - the travel jumbo curlers - in which I said that the curlers melted - the wax came out, and the unit overheated to such an extent that it melted the lid. I was hoping that this was just a dud unit, as the curlers had produced good volume and nice curls. Sadly, the second unit I bought has done exactly the same - and the 4 large curlers have had to be thrown away. It seems that the heating grid over which the curlers fit is poorly made and the curlers themselves use low quality glue which melts. The curlers are wedged too tightly onto the heating grid, the glue melts, the curler starts disintegrating and the wax leaks out. Three of the curlers melted before I could whip them out (and only about 60 seconds after I switched the unit on) and the remaining curlers are all singed.  I couldn&#x27;t heat up the unit with the lid closed as it started melting the plastic. I would not recommend that any one buy this product - it is potentially quite dangerous -  it would burst into flame eventually, due to the leaking wax, if left unattended. The other thing is that the clips for the four large rollers are too small so hair doesn&#x27;t remain firmly gripped while the curler is in. But that is minor compared to the other problem!</li>
            <li> I really am loving these curlers. I get SO many compliments when I actually take the time to put them in... I will say that it takes time to get the technique down. And I often get frustrated when they won&#x27;t stay in. I recommend having a few big claws on hand to clamp down the bigger rollers of the set, they tend to slip out of my hair. All in all though, take 5-10 minutes to put them in and it looks like you spent an hour doing your hair. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> The rollers get hot but I can never game them to stay in my hair. The &amp;#34;clips&amp;#34; suck. I&#x27;ve used this once or twice in the 2 years that I&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
            <li> These absolutely would not stay in my hair which is pretty thin and fine. I even bought the white comb clips (which left horrible creases by the way.) I went back to the old reliable velcro rolls which you can&#x27;t heat up but they work much better.</li>
            <li> Please note that this item is listed incorrectly. It says that it comes with 12 pins, but it actually comes with the plastic clips and no pins. I cannot use the clips as they leave crimps in my hair. I had to return the product.     However it&#x27;s a bit confusing because I ordered the same product about a month ago to keep as a set in our gym at work, and it came with the pins. So it might just be a gamble on what you get with the set.     The shipping, however, was very speedy, so they get an extra star for that.</li>
            <li> It makes for lovely hair, for the first 20 minutes. I have very thick wavy hair, and wanted something that would put voluminous curls that last all day, or at least 5 hours. I bought 2 of the conair extreme heat curls, like I said alot of hair, and need every single curler to do my whole head, but the clips are a joke. They do not hold and you can not move with them in, also as they are only a step above bobby pins, they let all the heat escape.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why my hair will only last 20 minutes.  I have tried every trick in the book to make them work, to have the style stay longer, but its to no avail. I really like the look and wish I could rank them higher but it is really not worth the money. It is truly just a wast of time (and your fingertips as you will burn them in the process) what your left with after an the investment of money, and time spending to set your hair is a lovey hair style that will last a whopping 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> These rollers do not heat up and are the worst excuse for hair rollers I have ever purchased.  Bad deal.</li>
            <li> I have thick &amp; long hair this works great for when I am short on time in the mornings. Put these in, do makeup, put my outfit on and then its ready. I unroll them, shake them out, and do some hair spray. Lasts all day, if left in for longer the curls stay in for a few days.  Love it! It works!</li>
            <li> I have now used this product three times and overall, I am happy with this purchase.  Two things that would allow for a 5 star rating.  1) there are not enough rollers if one has alot of hair, which I do, and  2) the pins that hold the curler in place dont do a great job.  You have to attach it exactly the right place for it to hold.  I would recommend though as it gives my crazy curly hair soft waves and I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, these rollers work great.&lt;br /&gt;I have just started having problems where half of the rollers get hot and the others don&#x27;t. May be time to order a new set.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to finally look online for a product I couldn&#x27;t find in stores - a set of electric rollers that were all large. Normally there are 6 of the larger ones in sets, always just a bit shy but okay. And I&#x27;ve tried the smaller ones that dominate those other sets. They make my hair look goofy. I&#x27;m not ready to look as if I&#x27;m elderly quite yet with the small curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length fine hair and have always found that electric curlers give me nice soft body in a short amount of time. I&#x27;m pleased with how these foam rollers hold my hair, and with how hot they get. The instructions are very helpful - heat them longer and they get hotter, unlike the plastic one that get just so hot &amp; no hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who have never used electric curlers, it takes some getting used to the wire clips, but they leave no funny bump, which is highly preferable. They will hold, the clip just has to have enough contact with your scalp to hold. And the clips work best going up under the curl, not from behind.  It could just be gravity...and sometimes if the curlers are just  hanging there, thats okay too. You dont need them in for a long time, for natural styles.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my old set, unfortunately this set also came with the Super size which I did not really need.  They work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish that these had an on/off switch as my previous Conair versus plugging in and they start to heat immediately.  Also, there is no place to store the clips with the rollers.  Thus the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I would buy again due to those factors.</li>
            <li> works well I love the size of the curlers</li>
            <li> They work great but they almost get too hot.  Also find them hard to get back in place in the case but overall they do the job I need them to do.  They curl my hair!</li>
            <li> I like the rollers but I am still undecided on the pins. After debating between the hair claws and pins, I decided on the pins. It took some time to figure out how to use it and I&#x27;m not sure it is really holding the roller that tightly but it works. The curls do not stay that long but it might be because my hair is really silky straight.</li>
            <li> This product works so well!  It takes no time to heat up, I can do my hair in 15 minutes while doing things around the house, and they&#x27;re affordable :)</li>
            <li> These hot rollers work very well for my over shoulder length hair.  They heat up in less than 2 minutes, and there are enough in one set for my hair. I love their compact package that is easy to stow away.  The only issue are the pins that come with the rollers that do not stay put in my hair. I had to get separate butterfly hair clips, and ever since I started using those, getting my hair into curls in the morning is a cinch!</li>
            <li> The pins do not hold the rollers in place and they frequently pop off and shoot across the room.  I spent a half hour trying to get the first two rollers to stay put, got frustrated and gave up.  They get very hot, so hot you&#x27;ll burn your thumbs.  Since they&#x27;ll be a pain to return, I may buy claw clips and see if that helps, but I&#x27;m really disappointed that, as is, these rollers are not usable.</li>
            <li> Love these. This is my second set and not cause they broke but because I have that much hair;) I love them and would recommend them to anyone I use both sets almost everyday.</li>
            <li> These curlers do not get hot enough. The pins work just fine, but they do not get hot enough to make a lasting curl that is worth the effort or the money spent. The size of the curlers are awesome if they did get hot enough, I&#x27;ve even tried using less hair in each section even though I have thin hair to begin with. I would go with a different product.</li>
            <li> Brought this thinking wow nice big size curlers for nothing! How do you manage this hot curler in your hand? By the time you put them on your hair it&#x27;s not that hot and the the clips do not make any sense as they are lose and weak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a few times and the last time I used them I smelled smoke and found that the resistor was in fire and melting! I quickly disconnected them from the wall socket and they continued to melt down. It was a very frightening situation and now I think they are dangerous and aren&#x27;t meeting the safety standards for such appliances should. The rollers were right in their own slots so I can&#x27;t understand why the resistor started suddenly sparkle and set the heaters almost into fire. I would like to have my money back since the rollers are now useless. I&#x27;ve had many different rollers in the past but this has never happened to me and I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love the rollers but buy the clamps to hold them on. The ones they come with are the old wire ones that do not hold some hair types.</li>
            <li> Works well for vacation (size)</li>
            <li> The rollers don&#x27;t hold up with the clips it comes with so I had to buy other type of clips to help hold the roller in place</li>
            <li> Worst rollers ever!!!!!!!!!! Did not curl my hair and they got tangled in my hair in the process, not worth the price at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my third set of these rollers in the past 15 years.  I use them nearly every day.  I have quite thick, long hair that is a little frizzy and these rollers are perfect for me.  Also, my hair is color processed and fragile,  and the rollers have a protective layer that prevents damage.  I just hope they continue to be available.  Love them.  Great price and service with Amazon.  The only reason they have needed replacing is that I travel a lot and am rough on the case because of that.  Otherwise, one set may last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I purchased the conair rollers for my mother-in-law.  Her old set she had for years and where in pretty bad shape.  She complained that she could never find them in the store.  So i looked online and of course found them for her.  She was so exited she had me order another set just incase!</li>
            <li> The ends get very hot and burn your scalp while are in. Leave my hair frizzy. The clips are hard to take out.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is gentle for my hair. I love the results I get when I use it</li>
            <li> I have very long, normal/thick hair. The pins kept popping off and flying across the room. The rollers didn&#x27;t get very hot. It created weak curls in the front and the curls in the back fell out instantly. I ended up returning them and bought Jilbere ones instead that come with clips that help keep the rollers in place. I&#x27;m very happy with my new purchase.</li>
            <li> the cylinders burn your fingers and scalp, curl does not hold very long. would be ok for a quick touch up if you use sprays or gels</li>
            <li> My 3rd set in 10 years...  I keep comin&#x27; back...  for the money, they last about 3 years or so.......love em</li>
            <li> Love these rollers They heat up quick and the curls are so nice and soft. I have allways used Conair products and these rollers are just as good as all the others I have bought over the years.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with different hair clips that kept the roll In place better</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, fine hair that tends to get great, lasting curl from hot rollers. Unfortunately, these rollers don&#x27;t stay in at all. The pins do not hold them in, even if you use 2 pins per roller. I just ordered a separate set of clips to see if that will help. If not, these are getting donated to Goodwill. It&#x27;s a shame, because they do get hot quickly and are nicely sized. My mother has an old set of hard plastic Conair hot rollers from the 70s (maybe 80s?) that still work great and have similar clips, which hold the rollers in just fine. The velvety surface of the modern rollers and the weaker wires are a bad combo in this modern set.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers they leave a full bouncy and soft look. Just make sure you leave them on until your hair has completely cooled or the curl will not hold or be as bouncy. I am sure those of you who are experienced must already know.</li>
            <li> First of alll had hard time keeping the rollers in with the clips that were sent with the set. The rollers are way too hot next to your scalp and if a roller touches your ear it is way too hot. I purchased these thinking they would be better for my hair than a curling iron. Would not buy this product again. Takes longer to curl your hair than a curling iron because to get the roller to stay in, takes time.</li>
            <li> Bought these over a year ago and my wife still uses these almost every day, and I still love how her hair looks!</li>
            <li> The rollers heat and curl well but the rods that hold them in place get extremely hot, to the point I actually have to lift the roller off my scalp for relief.  They don&#x27;t stay that hot long, but it&#x27;s enough to cause discomfort.  In the future, I would look for rods that have a coating on them instead of no coating.</li>
            <li> I like the concept but I wish the rollers were half as many and Bigger, Bigger, Bigger</li>
            <li> I ordered this model because of the good reviews but this machine is not for fine or thin hair textures which I have.  The rollers are nice, the machine heats up quickly, but the steel clips have a slick finish and slide right out of my hair causing must frustration.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I had thick or coarse hair I would give this a 5.</li>
            <li> These are not bad rollers, just wish they can stay on more secure. But even with half fell-out rollers, it still makes nice curls or waves.</li>
            <li> Received just as described.  Soft roller coating doesn&#x27;t burn your hair.  The rollers heat up quickly.  There are enough rollers to get through a thick head of hair.  The large size leaves nice natural curls.  Perfect for beginning of an updo or other fancy style.  Perfect for longer hair.  Shorter hair may not look at curled since these are so big.  Sometimes I use a smaller curling iron to add some diff size curls.  But I&#x27;d rather that than having the multi sized roller set.</li>
            <li> Theses rollers are especially good for those with lots of long hair. I am not crazy about the clips, but they work okay.  The curl lasts....except in very humid weather...same as other methods.  Holding products like foam and hairspray extend the hold.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, rolls up easily (doesn&#x27;t slip like old-school hot rollers used to), and stays on with the right hot roller clips. Depending on the look I&#x27;m looking for, I use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair, keep them on for 10 minutes while I put on my makeup, and voila! Soft, strokeable voluminous hair!</li>
            <li> These get very hot, &amp; work very well!  Comes with pins instead of clips, which is great.  Sizes are great if you don&#x27;t really use the small ones.</li>
            <li> While these rollers do heat up quickly, I found them to be too hot to use.  I was tired of burning my fingers with the rollers (and my head with the metal clips), so I got rid of my set after using it only 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. My hair is very fine and thin, and this is an easy way to add volume. I&#x27;ve had the best results when I allow the rollers to heat up for more than 5 minutes (manufacturer states 2 as a minimum). The 12 BIG rollers add a nice bouncy wave (as opposed to tight curls) to my medium length hair. I also purchased the Conair hot roller clips along with this product. If you are like me and have little hair styling coordination, ditch the wire clips that come with the rollers and buy the jaw clips. They are no-fuss and clamp onto the rollers quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Fast! Easy! Great results! It calms my hair, gives me shiny beautiful curly hair. The first time I use it, I need to practice 2-3 times to tight the rollers. The clips in the box are not designed well. Some elastic band may hold the rollers better. That&#x27;s just a small drawback! I enjoyed the results!!</li>
            <li> The rollers are great.  It is nice to have them all large and the curl they give is what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and your money on this product. The metal clips are completely awful and do not hold your hair at all, the end up falling right out. Then when you finally get them to stay, after much frustration, they poke at your scalp to the point where it is unbareable for them to remain in any longer. The curlers do not reach a high heat, and therefore do not curl your hair. I kept the curlers in for about 25 minutes, and when I took them out, my hair was exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I use this set for taming my horrible hair.  I have long semi-curly hair that tries to frizz all the time.  These rollers really help smooth out my hair.  I like the large size.  They make nice big curls.  They also work really well with the layers cut in my hair and really makes them stand out.</li>
            <li> This products does exactly what is promised. Very easy to use, even for someone like me who has zero talent in managing hair. Easier and faster than curling iron because you can put them in and do other things while the curls set. The clips that are included work very well in keeping the rollers in, if you put it in with the curved side down. There are lots of youtube tutorials on how to use this particular product. This made my hair more curly than the relaxed waves I wanted but maybe I left them in too long or it&#x27;s just my hair quality. All in all, a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Roller are large which is hard to find. Heats up quickly. Only problem - pins are not easy to use, takes a while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This has been a good set for my very &amp; I mean very long hair. I like the largest rollers for scalp. I purchased separate clips at Sallys because the hair setters come with clips that don&#x27;t hold all my hair on the rollers. Satisfied with this purchase in 2009! Its now 2014</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered and very happy with the purchase. Product was as described purchased clips to use with rollers and happy with them.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky getting used to. I&#x27;ve used hot rollers before but not like this, the rubber ones that fold over....and my hair was a lot shorter then. Anyways, I did it, let my hair down and it was beautiful! So much easier than curling and seems less damaging than straightening my hair. It did fall pretty easy after a few hours but it was just a test run before bed so I didn&#x27;t douse my hair with hair spray or anything. I have hair then ends at my lower back and it worked fine. I&#x27;m sure after a few more tries I&#x27;ll master it, but yeah I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase at Target, but this particular item was lower in price, so I purchase online instead. Easy on the hair and actually makes the hair shine.</li>
            <li> The rollers are great...the pins are horrible. I have fine hair, and they don&#x27;t hold my hair. But what i&#x27;m most upset about is the fact that I can get the same roller set, for a cheaper price with CLIPS....Now i have to spend extra to get the clips.... Frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers are fine, and work great for the money.</li>
            <li> Thought these jumbo rollers would help give me more volume but the heat just seemed to flatten my hair even more. The rollers work well, but I&#x27;d suggest these for people who have thin and lank hair. Not thick and coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li> While the rollers themselves are great - heat up VERY quickly and hold the heat for a long time - the metal clips that come with it to hold the rollers are AWFUL. They do not hold the rollers at all, even if you use two at a time (there is only one per roller).&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this item promptly.</li>
            <li> Okay, now that I have been using hot rollers on my hair for almost 2 years, I thought I should give my opinion about these hot rollers and the metal pins that are included. First, I think it is important that I say that I have long, straight, fine hair. I do have a good amount of hair, but it is fine and silky. Also, it holds a curl for most of the day, but when I wake up the next morning, my hair will be pin straight again no matter how much hairspray I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried about 6 different hot roller sets and I always come back to these. I let them heat up with the lid closed for about 10 minutes. They are sometimes kind of hot to handle if I let them heat up any longer so I have found that 10 minutes is perfect. I use the 4 extra jumbo rollers on the \\&quot;mo-hawk\\&quot; section of my head and then the smaller, jumbo rollers on the sides of my head and 1 on the back middle section. I like to use a little hairspray at the roots and then some redkin curl starch (amazing stuff!) on the entire shaft of the hair. I let the rollers set in my hair for about 45 minutes while I put my make-up on and eat breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about those metal pins, I have had good luck with them and bad luck. I do not have a problem with them holding the rollers in place on the sides and back of my head and they do not leave a crease in the hair. For the top \\&quot;mo-hawk\\&quot; section, these pins do not work as well. They tend to leave a crease in my hair and do not hold the rollers in place while I am getting ready and eating breakfast. Instead of using the pins, I used duck-bill clips for the top section. I use 2 per rollers, one on each side of the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These rollers are dependable and great for adding volume and loose curls to hair.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have long layered hair and this set is fast and easy to use. It heats up in about 5 minutes (when the red spot on the large roller turns white then its ready), I set my hair (7 minutes), do my makeup, eat breakfast, then take them out and I have beautiful waves! Easier and faster than the curling iron. The rollers get pretty hot, I&#x27;ve burned my finge, so I would definetly recommend the plastic clips you can purchase in addition. I&#x27;m definetly satisfied!</li>
            <li> Loved the fact that the rollers were big.  Nothing else was worth using.  While it heats fast,the metal SHORT clips don&#x27;t hold the roller in place and if you don&#x27;t put enough hair on the roller, they burn your head.  You would think Conair would have enough experience to know better!</li>
            <li> This could have been a great product. It heats up well! I held one by hand and the curl came out perfect! The problem is the pins included do not hold the curler up! I looked on utube, but couldn&#x27;t find anything useful.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT get warm enough!!! I think the ceramic just doesn&#x27;t hold the heat like the older style where each curler sat on its own rod.  I have let these heat up for long periods of time, and all they do is get lukewarm! No wonder people complain that these curlers don&#x27;t curl!! I would NOTrecommend to anyone, or buy again.  Conair can do MUCH better than this!!  DO NOT waste your money on this model!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used these products from Conair before, you won&#x27;t know what is wrong with this new product. For one thing, there&#x27;s no built in clip holder for the clips! They bounce everywhere...on tile floors and granite countertops - fun, and boy can they hide. The older models ALL had a built in clip holder - and this model even has TWO sized clips. Also, they took away the on-off switch - now you have to unplug and plug with each use. If you have a vanity that holds the product with outlets out of sight, this is a major inconvenience. I don&#x27;t unplug my stove top or oven every time I finish using, so I think I can handle the Conair. Having two sized rollers is nice - and if you can&#x27;t get the clips in, practice. It comes with experience. It does heat up faster than the older models, but again - doing away with the built-in clip holder is going to be a disaster. I will have to return this model because I cannot go through the daily hassle of wondering where the clips are and which ones go with what roller.</li>
            <li> This is the third set of these I have bought.  Got it to leave at my son&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t have to take the other back and forth.  After a while the foam wears off.  It has gotten &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; since the first one I bought.  The case cracks while traveling in a suit case.  I do like it overall, but hope the quality does not continue to decrease.  I don&#x27;t like the clips so I bought other ones that hold the rollers in place better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. The product arrived on time. She was thrilled with the rollers as she has smaller sized ones but wanted this size to make a different sized curl.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product ! easy to use and warms up fast, excellent for styling with little time highly recommend !</li>
            <li> These heated up quickly and the size was great for my long hair. This set was enough to do my entire head and I have fairly thick hair to my mid-back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the metal clips are useless, rendering this product to be useless. I went back to a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Ordered these rollers 5 years ago and they still work great. The only change I will look for next time I order a set is I would like all jumbo rollers instead of 4.</li>
            <li> I have relatively long hair. It&#x27;s not thick, just long.  I had the curlers heated properly, in for a long time, and my curls were flat.  I think it&#x27;s just my hair though, it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well.  This was not the magic bullet.</li>
            <li> These got me into using hot rollers. I bought 2 sets: I have A LOT of thick hair. Hair looks good for the first few hours but they fall out too quickly. I&#x27;ve tried different placement, dirty hair, etc. but nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> It work great except for the clips that are included don&#x27;t work very well in keeping the rollers in place !</li>
            <li> they work well, i had thought they came with plastic claw clips instead of the wire ones. they heat up real quick and allow for a great look.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my best friend who has very long hair, so the size of the rollers were perfect! Excellant quality!</li>
            <li> I have a ton of really long and thick hair.  I used to not be able to get all of my hair in the rollers in one round.  these add a ton of body.  They heat up quickly.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was repleacing a Conair heated rollers product that had an on/off switch at the front.  Furthermore the picture makes it looks like such a swith exits.  I am keeping the product because I like the large and extra large rollers.</li>
            <li> After you own for a few weeks all the smaller dollies melt and break and won&#x27;t fit in the slots. The large ones are good but there are only 4. The clips are prices of crap. They have all broken. The entire box has started to melt. I don&#x27;t leave it on that long. The whole thing is garbage</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  I had been using a Conair Roller Set from 8 years ago which I had been satisfied with.  BUT, this new set heats up in seconds.  Perfect size and high Quality.GREAT</li>
            <li> I would LOVE these curlers (as they heat us fast and work well), except for one rather significant issue:  there is NO place to put the holders (whatever you use to hold the curlers down).  I use the metal pins. And every single time I travel I forget the pins at home (rendering the curlers useless) because there is no attached storage for them.  (I know that not everyone uses the metal pins)</li>
            <li> I have been letting my hair grow longer and needed only the larger rollers. These rollers are easy to use and provide the result I wanted.  So glad I found what I needed on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do what I like first.  The size of the rollers is good for long hair.  I like the felt as it helps keep the rollers in place.  I like that they heat up fast.  The case is nice and slim, the cord is a good enough length to be convenient, and in general the black and purple looks cute.  I&#x27;m sick to death of pink, so this is a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the clips.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s just a learning curve and I&#x27;ll get better with them but I&#x27;ve used these for a week and I&#x27;m still just not getting a nice grip with them.  I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough, either.  I&#x27;m waiting plenty of time, they&#x27;re hot to the touch, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough to roll my hair.  Others have reported better results with the heat so I&#x27;m sure hair type has a LOT to do with it.  My hair is really thick, super fine, and wavy.  The curl falls out after a half hour.  Not cool.  But again, that could just be my hair or the way I&#x27;m rolling it, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to review the curlers under 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these.  I&#x27;m sure as I practice with them a little more things will improve.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it heats up quickly and does its job. I love the clips instead of the pins and am growing my hair out even longer so that I can get the full benefit of these rollers!</li>
            <li> Ther&#x27;s no on/off switch. However the curlers are just the size I need. I love the speedy way they heat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hot curlers. So easy to use, heats up quickly and do a great job of giving my hair volume. Great buy at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally brown hair, down to the middle of my back,  that is killed by bleaching highlights.  Needless to say, if I put a brush to my hair, its frizz central. I have hot rollers however by the time I twist my hair almost to the root, its too thick to get any of the heat so just the ends o my hair would be curled. Well the rollers weren&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;Jumbo and Super Jumbo&amp;#34; but I did curl my entire head and still have one roller left. The set heated rather quickly (Less than 5 minutes) and  I left the rollers in my hair for about 10 minutes.  The rollers gave me a nice curl to the root and left me with a lot of body.  The clips were fine, held tight, however there&#x27;s NO place to &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; them. Every set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned had a place to put these things in because they&#x27;re so easy to lose. That&#x27;s the one big downfall for me as far as the actual make of the product. The curls are still holding nicely 3 hours after setting them.  I like the rollers! They do what they&#x27;re supposed to.. if I want tighter curls, I&#x27;ll stick with my flat iron :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of curlers from seller &amp;#34;Bargains AAA,&amp;#34; and received the item perfectly on time, but in used condition instead of new as it had been advertised.  The box that the manufacturer had originally packed the item in was badly abused, and had obviously been torn open and taped back together.  Upon cutting open the taped box, I immediately noticed that two of the super-jumbo sized black curlers were missing, including the one with the red indicator dot which alerts one as to when the unit has achieved optimum heat.  The two missing black curlers had been replaced with two of the smaller purple jumbo curlers.  There were two too many of the metal pins for holding the black curlers, since it was missing the two black curlers.  There were two too few of the metal pins for the smaller purple curlers, since there were two curlers replaced.  I immediately contacted Amazon customer service to tell them of these problems I experienced from seller Bargains AAA.  Amazon was very helpful and offered to have me return the item to them for a refund, or I could keep it and they would refund 50% of the purchase price.  I chose the latter option, as I live in a fairly rural area and shipping something back is a bit of an inconvenience.  Today, I went to Walmart (which I abhor) and purchased a brand new set, I made sure the box was unopened before I purchased.  The actual curlers work quite well, just be sure that you don&#x27;t use the seller Bargains AAA.  Overall, I still love Amazon and will continue to purchase from them, but not from Bargains AAA.</li>
            <li> A great smooth curling device..Not too hot to the touch and a nice size curl..A variety of sizes and worked perfect for me&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast.. Hair does not get caught in it..Super nice..I would recommend them</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this item because the curlers would not stay in. The metal clips don&#x27;t hold the hair tightly, which ruins the curl. I&#x27;m thinking the clamp clips would work a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am an absolute glamour girl, to the core, and have had hot rollers in my life for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year I decided that I wanted some of the vanity space back that was being taken up by the enormous footprint of my wonderful and beloved [[ASIN:B003V27RB4 Remington H9000 Pearl Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers]], which I had been using for over two years, and never had any issues with, other than the huge space they require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with these Conair Rollers, as they were flocked, jumbo, and heated quickly, like my Remington Pearls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pins these rollers come with *are* difficult to work with, but I found that if you pinch them in a bit between the ends and the curve, they hold better, and so long as you push them through some of the hair that is wrapped around the roller, they will get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day I plugged my rollers in as usual and let them heat up while I went downstairs to get my morning cup of coffee, then I came back up and proceeded to brush my hair out in preparation for the rollers, as I do every morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two rollers were *really, really hot* and didn&#x27;t slide up off their base as easily as they normally do, and as I wrapped my hair around them, I thought, \\&quot;well, that&#x27;s strange - wow, these rollers are hot!\\&quot; and then I grabbed for a third roller and IT BURNED MY FINGERTIPS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I instantly unplugged the cord, and I realized then that I could hear these little crackling sounds, like a frozen pond being cracked - little crackly popping sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the rollers still in the base - they were literally MELTING and BREAKING APART!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tops were lifted up, they had popped upwards a bit, and when I used a towel to grab a few rollers off the base to inspect them, their bottoms were all sticky melted and literally separated from the flocked part of the roller.&lt;br /&gt;The two rollers I had in my hair had sticky melty ends, too, I just didn&#x27;t notice as I put them in and apparently there was a surge of heat through this unit as I was wrapping those first two rollers into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER had anything like this happen before, and I intend on contacting Conair about this directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I googled Conair complaints and defects, and apparently this sort of things happens with a lot of their products, especially hair dryers. Fast thinking on the unplug reaction as well - I read how issues like this from Conair products develop into full-blown house fires!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware.sticky melty ends, too, I just didn&#x27;t notice as I put them in and apparently there was a surge of heat through this unit as I was wrapping those first two rollers into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER had anything like this happen before, and I intend on contacting Conair about this directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I googled Conair complaints and defects, and apparently this sort of things happens with a lot of their products, especially hair dryers.

            <li> These rollers do wonders in such a short time.  I don&#x27;t have to stand in front of a mirror with a hair dryer or curling iron for hours on end.  With the large rollers included, the wave is loose and yet bouncy.  I worry only that this item will one day be unavailable.</li>
            <li> Love this set, several sizes including the super jumbo (perfect!) and most importantly - metal clips.  They hold the best and are VERY hard to find.  Have a second set of these as a backup - use every day! Love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> Like but clips don&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> I do not recommend these curlers. I cannot get them to hold for nothing in my hair and it normally curls very easily. I guess I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t over pay for these. Very bummed.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Actually I haven&#x27;t used this that much since I bought. It is not very easy to use, and considering it may hurt my hair a lot, so I just tried twice and I gave up cuz it didn&#x27;t last long, just couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Average rollers but clips dont hold well. Could use more rollers. Should have a place to store clips but then you had to buy them separately so ...&lt;br /&gt;Average rollers but clips dont hold well. Could use more rollers.</li>
            <li> I returned this product. Not only does it smoke, but it stinks. They do not stay hot for long, once on the hair, and the clips are absolutely junk. THey do NOT stay in your hair. Dont waste your cash</li>
            <li> they were larger than other rollers that claimed to be large. I also bought them because they come with the old fashioned metal clips which work so much better than plastic clamps. they are very large and good for longer or curlier hair to redirect the curl. They heat well.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this product but I was disappointed.  My daughter has thick, long (several inches passed her shoulders) hair - the curls did not stay at all.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great rollers... I saw a video on using metal hair clips vs the clips that came with the rollers that worked better</li>
            <li> i BOUGHT ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR A FRIEND AS A XMAS GIFT.  tHEY ARE WONDERFUL AND i WOULD BUY ANOTRHER PRODUCT FORM CONAIR</li>
            <li> Work fine my only complaint Is there is no where to store the roller clips! Who makes a product and doesn&#x27;t include a little hole to hold clips? Other than that the product woks fine.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> I really like using these rollers. They work incredibly well with my very pin straight hair. Rollers produce awesome, glamorous big curls. However, these rollers do have a dent/split design on them, which is annoying. They WILL burn your fingers...so learn to act quickly! Also, the current pins provided do not hold roller in place very well, and sometimes you end up having to use two pins ( which lengthens the whole process! ) for just one roller. AAAh!</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago. This is a must for ladies with long thick hair. Kardashian style!</li>
            <li> These rollers are very nice. I got them because my hair is really damaged from heat and rollers seem to be less damaging than, say, a straightening iron. Unfortunately, the rollers didn&#x27;t give me the look I was going for, as they are too large. I&#x27;ll still use them, though. I thought I ordered the set that had an on/off switch, but the one I rec&#x27;d does not. They do heat up quickly, and are easy to use. I&#x27;m glad this set had the clips instead of jaw clamps, as other reviewers have said that the jaw clamps leave indents in the hair. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this set, just wish I had gotten smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I have had these rollers for 3 years now and recommend them to all my friends. They&#x27;re so reasonably priced and are so amazing. I am pretty hair-styling challenged but after a few tries, I finally got this down and use it frequently because it&#x27;s so easy. I love that this set includes different sized rollers to create a more natural-look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I&#x27;ve learned about using this set and rollers in general:&lt;br /&gt;1. Section your hair in 1-2 inch sections.&lt;br /&gt;2. Start the roller in the middle of the hair section. Wrap the bottom half around it and then curl it up towards your head.&lt;br /&gt;3. For hair sections around your face, I read that you&#x27;re supposed to wrap the hair away from your face if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;4. Play with it, learn where the metal clip goes best to hold your hair in. If you can&#x27;t get it, unroll and try again! Once you get the hang of it after about 2 tries, it will be so easy!</li>
            <li> These rollers are just fine.....BUT......the pins are so small they do not hold the rollers in place on your head.  Very poor engineering / design.....They are difficult to hold in place on my head.  Very dissapointed with the pins.</li>
            <li> The clips that come with this do not hold the curlers in place at all. They are just the hook wire kind and the rollers don&#x27;t sat put. Would not recommend, would recommend finding one with sturdier clips so the hair actually curls</li>
            <li> Cant live without them</li>
            <li> rollers are good but clips pop out and are somewhat difficult to position correctly so roller is snug. difficult to tell the clips apart, the jumbo should have been in a totally different contrasting colour, now is confusing and hard to differentiate from the others. delivery was quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase, item is as described, heat up very quickly and are less expensive than the same product in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I only needed the large and extra large roller size so this was exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;The metal clips that come with the rollers are the only negative, I took other reviewers advice and purchased Conair plastic super clips.&lt;br /&gt;They work much better at keeping the roller and hair from hanging down.</li>
            <li> I got these today and I&#x27;ve never used rollers before, but I have frizzy, super thick, super long hair and I&#x27;m tired of wasting an hour of every other day using a flat iron. I read the reviews here, and at first, the pins that everyone talks about drove me absolutely nuts. So I went to YouTube and watched a few videos, and what do you know? I was putting them in upside down. The little bent part has to go UNDER the roller. Then, they work just fine. It took me about an hour to do the first two, but after I educated myself, it took about 10 minutes to redo my entire head. If you have hair close to your waist, you have to wrap some of your hair around the roller. It does not have to be flat like when you use an iron - just twist it and wrap it around then roll the thing toward your head. And if you have little frizzies near your scalp like I do, don&#x27;t worry about them - the heat will eventually get to those little boogers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly impressed.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with this purchase because of the very poor quality of the clips. Sorry to say but I would not recommend these to anybody.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a year now and I love these rollers. They heat up quickly and cool pretty quick once shut off. I am able to have lots of body with my roller sets. Just be sure to let the rollers completely cool once applied to your hair before removing them. Do be careful not to touch any of the metal parts as they do get very hot. A great buy for a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot cheaper buying it at Walmart Some times people want to over price things which isn&#x27;t right I come on here to get a deal not ripped off</li>
            <li> The rollars are fine in that they heat up fast and do what they are supposed to do, but those clips leave huge dents in my hair that do not come out until the next washing.  Now I have to buy some other sort of pin.  Not worth the bother!</li>
            <li> Purchased to add to set I already have ... works great ... only wish I could find a set to purchase with solely jumbo rollers as these are the only size I use.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, well built. Does not heat well enough for hard to curl straight medium hair although we have not tried on other hair types.</li>
            <li> Awful. I have other velvet curlers made by Remington, that are AWESOME. As my hair grew out, I knew I needed bigger rollers -  so I decided to give these a shot. Terrible. The look, size, pins - those are all just fine - but the rollers do NOT get HOT enough! I regret this purchase and would advise all my friends NOT to buy it. There has GOT to be something better out there.</li>
            <li> Great set. Alot of rollers to use. Very hot to set hair good.&lt;br /&gt;However, the clips are not strong enough to hold roller in place. I had to buy butterfly clips at Beauty Supply, and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying this set for anyone or myself again. Also get the butterfly clips and you will be a happy camper!!!!</li>
            <li> these work better than any of these hot irons,&lt;br /&gt;makes very nice big curls, still the best hair styling tool,...</li>
