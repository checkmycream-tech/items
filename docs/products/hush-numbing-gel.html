    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>

            <li>HUSH is awesome, I had work done on my sleeve and felt NOTHING.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Great, but not as great as the spray</li>
            <li>but makes it so much more bearable!!</li>
            <li>It Really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>but I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fu**ing amazing</li>
            <li>this stuff is AMAZING ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li>Product works amazingly</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>was I surprised at just how wonderful this stuff is!</li>
            <li>me start off by saying that I applied this in the most non-ideal way imaginable.  </li>
            <li>but I got 45 min of pain free tattooing after applying this gel!</li>
            <li>I was able to get through the outline but had to stop on the color.</li>
            <li>the tattoo artist mentioned many people sell a knock off of Hush gel</li>
            <li>There are too many variables for me to say this gel is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it on my ribs and lasted almost 2 hours (and then two more sessions of 2 hours each).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work because of how conflicted the reviews were</li>
            <li>After an hour or two I did start feeling it more</li>
            <li>Overall product was awesome</li>
            <li>Okay I think there is lots of mis-information in some of the reviews on this</li>
            <li>I was expecting more from this product.  </li>
            <li>Im assuming most of the reviewers didn&#x27;t read the ingredient list before they purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Not sure off the top of my head:) it smells great though and was very easy to wipe off...</li>
            <li>I received the spray as well, which I did not notice a huge result on.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Hush a lot.  </li>
            <li>Also, make sure you know exactly where on your body your artist will be tattooing.  </li>
            <li>Success!  </li>
            <li>The area tingled and felt cool</li>
            <li>I used this and the two full hours I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li>Did whole chest with this magic.</li>
            <li>We have used other brands that have worked great</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I even had to ask him if he had already started at first because I didn&#x27;t feel anything!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have the comfort of knowing that my new art work wasn&#x27;t really felt</li>
            <li>it&#x27;d be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>just follow the instructions keeping it wrapped longer than an hour caused better results as far as the strength of the product goes</li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions (super easy) and so far have had no issues with the healing process of my tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel creates a layer that bounces the needle right out.  </li>
            <li>I have a very large rib piece that I got done over 2 sessions.  </li>
            <li>It has no odor, goes on clear, comes on easy, and works for 2-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Works good for about hour to hour and half</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and had the initial mindset that it might take most of the edge away.  </li>
            <li>The first session was about 3.5 hours, and I didn&#x27;t use anything.  </li>
            <li>Go to their website if you need to, but follow them exactly.  </li>
            <li>During my first session when I didn&#x27;t use the gel, there was also a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Hush anesthetic on my first tattoo and didn&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li>but this was the first time ever that I almost started to fall asleep while I was getting the tattoo.</li>
            <li>it works ok just deferent people take pain in different ways</li>
            <li>This think actually works .. Love it</li>
            <li>Overall though, it&#x27;s pretty good, it definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li>So it actually hurt more using this gel because of how much it had to be gone over, prolonging pain and time.  </li>
            <li>I followed directions exactly and sat for a large ribpiece.</li>
            <li>Works very well, especially on sensitive areas like stomach and bone!</li>
            <li>It burns more than icy hot, therefore I thought it was working.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really helped me through my large chest piece, and would recommend regardless</li>
            <li>I have used Dr. Numb &amp; NumbSkin before and they were the best thing ever.</li>
            <li>Once again I am very dissatisfied with this product and will spread the word for ppl not to use it.</li>
            <li>He should be very used to my skin as he has been working on me for 2 years (</li>
            <li>works the best, client is completely numb for about two hours</li>
            <li>when it goes on (deadening the nerve endings) and really no need to wait more than one hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really works</li>
            <li>Works really well on areas that have heavier fat or muscle tissue, but not so well on spots where it&#x27;s just skin and bone, ie.</li>
            <li>I have 12 tattoos spread out in different places on my body and a pretty low tolerance for pain (unfortunately I love tattoos).</li>
            <li>I ordered Hush due to not being able to find the cream</li>
            <li>I purchased a  different spray brand that is supposed to be the most effective after the skin is broken.</li>
            <li>and the time I actually started the tattoo a full hour had passed.</li>
            <li>The pain was not gone but it was a huge help for such a sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>At the tattoo parlor the skin was still not numb and became very sticky even after cleaning multiple times.</li>
            <li>and I was really thankful to have a more tame start to the session since it enabled me to sit longer than I might have otherwise.</li>
            <li>Then, be a bit more liberal with it and spread it a little beyond that area.  </li>
            <li>Since the reviews for this seemed pretty 50/50, I thought I would try it for my last session of a large leg piece just to see if it worked - I figured for just twenty bucks</li>
            <li>did the normal discomfort begin.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep it wrapped tight!</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I would DEFINITELY recommend this product to anyone who wants the tattoo WITHOUT the pain!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I bought this because the positive reviews outweighed the negative, but I really do think the success of this product is highly dependent on the user.</li>
            <li>I have a full leg piece and at the recommendation of my artist, bought it for the back of my knee and upper thigh.</li>
            <li>I put this on as directed and the numbing was effective for at least 3-4 hours!</li>
            <li>My situation was probably a little different than most people&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I freaked out a little at first because when I first put it on it made my skin burn</li>
            <li>the topical anesthetics can be very helpful.</li>
            <li>I noticed is that on the soft pad of my foot</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a thick layer covering the area to be tattooed.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed it into the skin then layered a thick layer on top before wrapping with saran wrap.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will keep the stuff on and rinse it off in the bathroom right before I get the tattoo and will report back.  </li>
            <li>The gel had been removed for probably 45 minutes to an hour before actually starting the tattoo, and I was amazed at the difference that it made, especially because it didn&#x27;t feel like it had done very much.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed as it is marketed as the numbing gel for tattoo artists by tattoo artist and many of my favorite artists are even sponsored by them.</li>
            <li>If I had followed the directions like a normal person, and left it on longer, it would have lasted</li>
            <li>It also burns at first and that is probably due to tea tree oil?</li>
            <li>It was received before expected date and very helpful.</li>
            <li>My artist did not recommend using this when getting a portrait done since it makes the skin kind of puffy and weird.  </li>
            <li>The tattooed area was never numb and just created a big mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having extensive work done on my back and the spine is such a sensitive area for me.</li>
            <li>least to say a quick hop in the shower to rinse off (about 20 min after I cleaned up) stopped the burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> least to say a quick hop in the shower to rinse off (about 20 min after I cleaned up) stopped the burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friend used it today on a hand tattoo (wrist to hand, very bony) and felt very little pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the same burning, and not a normal burning, but almost like hell fire.  </li>
            <li> To this day, Dr. Numb has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty much you put it on really thick and warp the area with Saran Warp about an hour before your session start.</li>
            <li> Middle of chest or even some other areas of pectoral.</li>
            <li> Due to the stickiness the stencil never dried and created a mess during the tattoo work.</li>
            <li> It is not going to make you completely numb, but it will definitely dull the sensation and make it tolerable in the most sensitive places.</li>
            <li> left my shotty mess of ooze on for about an hour and 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the fire of a thousand suns cutting into my back, it felt more like someone trying to draw on me with a dull pencil.</li>
            <li> Worked just as i expected and just as it directed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t like that everywhere, but I blame that on my lack of being careful whenst applying.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every pennie.</li>
            <li> Longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I applied it 1 hour prior to my session, applied a thick amount and wrapped my upper thigh in the seran wrap.  </li>
            <li> Still felt a little pain, but definitely a lot less than without the cream.</li>
            <li> I am having a rather large tattoo done on my back which spans multiple and painful sessions.  </li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Towards the end, I was pretty uncomfortable</li>
            <li> For all other work, though, he was all about</li>
            <li> Thankfully it was just the outline that was done due to not having any numbness for the three hours.</li>
            <li> Also be aware that it makes tattooing the skin EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.  </li>
            <li> especially when the artist goes over the same location (broken skin) over and over-</li>
            <li> not real happy this stuff works in some areas, but it does not work well enough to be used on your ribs</li>
            <li> This one, however, was very sticky and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I was late for my appointment and in a hurry, so instead of completely following the directions, I just spooged it on.  </li>
            <li> so ill try to be as straight to the point as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was not effective at all in numbing the area after proper use.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist had to go over the same spot at least 6-7 times for the ink to take.  </li>
            <li> The product, however, was slightly a let down.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot bc of the slightly cheaper price.</li>
            <li> It was still uncomfortable, but I definitely noticed a difference between this session and all the ones prior.</li>
            <li> I would say it lasted an hour and a half of the session</li>
            <li> Lasted about an hour and a half and then came the pain.</li>
            <li> I used this product on the same part of my body but opposite side and felt everything, I feel as though this was fake Hush</li>
            <li> I flinched less than I did for my tattoo on my thigh.</li>
            <li> My wife tried it for the first time and told me that the area did not feel numb over an hour after placement.</li>
            <li> The numbness lasted for about 2 hours, maybe a little less.  </li>
            <li> Now after around hour 2, it started wearing off and was a little shock to the system when you don&#x27;t have that pain tolerance built up.  </li>
            <li> In the future, I will spend a little extra and go for Dr. Numb.</li>
            <li> I could feel it heating up and thought it was going to work, but alas, there was no difference in my pain once the needle was laid to my back.  </li>
            <li> Could tell a thing waste of money .</li>
            <li> i bought 4 bottle a waste of money</li>
            <li> My artist says it varies person to person, and that buying the spray is a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but it might weird some people out.  </li>
            <li> that we usually use.</li>
            <li> I almost felt like it hurt worse because the pain really does come on instantly and is very shocking.</li>
            <li> My tattoo took about 3 hours and it wasn&#x27;t completely numb the entire time</li>
            <li> Once you have a thick layer covering the area, cover it with plastic wrap and leave it on for at least an hour.  </li>
            <li> I put a thick layer on and wrapped in Saran Wrap an hour before my appt.</li>
            <li> It burned for about half an hour, then became a little numb.  </li>
            <li> and I figured I try this on a tough spot.  </li>
            <li> I put the gel on very thick and covered with Saran Wrap before leaving for the shop about a 30 min drive.</li>
            <li> Way worse than without using the gel.  </li>
            <li> The tattoo artist became frustrated due to the skin being sticky and the stencil not drying.</li>
            <li> I could tell it had at least done something because when wiping it off, I was numb.  </li>
            <li> but this did make the process less uncomfortable and painful.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it usually is</li>
            <li> BUT ITS KINDA EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive considering it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> it wrong-</li>
            <li> Terrible product didn&#x27;t numb what do ever, I would never waste money on this again.</li>
            <li> you are wrong, it will reduce the pain about 30-40% which for some people can still be a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I USED MASTER NUMB BEFORE</li>
            <li> Foot felt somewhat numb just before the tattoo needle went</li>
            <li> but the skin never felt numb.</li>
            <li> Mr. Numb</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and after removing the gel my leg didn&#x27;t feel very numb</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some things to note:  Once the gel is applied and covered with plastic, it gets very cold in that area.  </li>
            <li> the pain was bearable, but on the bony part it was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY dissatisfied with this product. I have used Dr. Numb &amp; NumbSkin before and they were the best thing ever. A friend told me about Hush so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot bc of the slightly cheaper price. I should&#x27;ve double thought about it though. No wonder why it was cheaper. Once again I am very dissatisfied with this product and will spread the word for ppl not to use it. Did no affect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t feel a thing..</li>
            <li> Great, but not as great as the spray</li>
            <li> I USED IT BEFORE I DO MY DEM ROLLER. IT  DIDNT WORK AT ALL. I CAN STILL FEEL THE PAIN.  SHOULD CALL IT PAIN RELIFE INSTEAD OF  NUMBING GEL.  I USED MASTER NUMB BEFORE AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY WELL ON ME ...BUT ITS KINDA EXPENSIVE ..SO I AM LOOKING FOR RRPLACEMENT...</li>
            <li> Used it and it works dampens about 60% of the pain</li>
            <li> Since the reviews for this seemed pretty 50/50, I thought I would try it for my last session of a large leg piece just to see if it worked - I figured for just twenty bucks it&#x27;d be worth a shot. I followed the directions and after removing the gel my leg didn&#x27;t feel very numb and I was expecting it to not help at all, especially by the time I arrived at the shop. The gel had been removed for probably 45 minutes to an hour before actually starting the tattoo, and I was amazed at the difference that it made, especially because it didn&#x27;t feel like it had done very much. It was still uncomfortable, but I definitely noticed a difference between this session and all the ones prior. I would say it lasted an hour and a half of the session and I was really thankful to have a more tame start to the session since it enabled me to sit longer than I might have otherwise. Tattoos hurt - that&#x27;s just the way it is, but this definitely helped reduce the pain and I personally would  use this again</li>
            <li> The seller was excellent. It was received before expected date and very helpful. The product, however, was slightly a let down. I am in the works of finishing both a sleeve and my entire leg so in problem areas (pits, boney areas, etc.) the topical anesthetics can be very helpful. To this day, Dr. Numb has been my favorite. It has no odor, goes on clear, comes on easy, and works for 2-4 hours. This one, however, was very sticky and difficult to work with. My regular artist was commenting on how he was not too fond of the way it changed my skin. He should be very used to my skin as he has been working on me for 2 years (10+ sessions). I received the spray as well, which I did not notice a huge result on. I was disappointed as it is marketed as the numbing gel for tattoo artists by tattoo artist and many of my favorite artists are even sponsored by them. It just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. My artist said it seemed as if I used hair gel on my legs. In the future, I will spend a little extra and go for Dr. Numb.</li>
            <li> Worked just as i expected and just as it directed. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> No it did not work.  I tried it on two sections and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fu**ing amazing I used it for a cover up sleeve just follow the instructions keeping it wrapped longer than an hour caused better results as far as the strength of the product goes it&#x27;s nice to have the comfort of knowing that my new art work wasn&#x27;t really felt but it was definitely admired</li>
            <li> Works fantastic. My Son and I swear by it for lengthening tattoo sittings.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great!  I read through the reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and had the initial mindset that it might take most of the edge away.  My situation was probably a little different than most people&#x27;s.  I have a very large rib piece that I got done over 2 sessions.  The first session was about 3.5 hours, and I didn&#x27;t use anything.  Towards the end, I was pretty uncomfortable and I thought about trying a numbing cream for my next session.  I found this stuff and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that I applied this in the most non-ideal way imaginable.  I was late for my appointment and in a hurry, so instead of completely following the directions, I just spooged it on.  That being said, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS.  Go to their website if you need to, but follow them exactly.  Do not rub it in - probably won&#x27;t work at all if you apply it that way.  Make sure you have a thick layer covering the area to be tattooed.  Also, make sure you know exactly where on your body your artist will be tattooing.  Then, be a bit more liberal with it and spread it a little beyond that area.  Once you have a thick layer covering the area, cover it with plastic wrap and leave it on for at least an hour.  The thicker you apply it and the longer you leave it on, the longer it lasts.  Leave it on for as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my shotty mess of ooze on for about an hour and 15 minutes.  I could tell it had at least done something because when wiping it off, I was numb.  Success!  Once my artist started working, I definitely noticed a difference between using it and not using it.  There were areas where I literally felt nothing.  It wasn&#x27;t like that everywhere, but I blame that on my lack of being careful whenst applying.  The numbness lasted for about 2 hours, maybe a little less.  If I had followed the directions like a normal person, and left it on longer, it would have lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to note:  Once the gel is applied and covered with plastic, it gets very cold in that area.  Not a big deal, but it might weird some people out.  Also, once the feeling came back and my artist was basically done, there was a burning sensation everywhere the gel was applied.  During my first session when I didn&#x27;t use the gel, there was also a burning sensation.  However, this time it was different.  This wasn&#x27;t the same burning, and not a normal burning, but almost like hell fire.  Way worse than without using the gel.  I washed the area with antibacterial soap and the burning went away.  That&#x27;s something to keep in mind as well.  My artist did not recommend using this when getting a portrait done since it makes the skin kind of puffy and weird.  For all other work, though, he was all about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this stuff is awesome and I will definitely use it again on my next piece.  Don&#x27;t think, buy it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It does eventually wear off but I got 45 min of pain free tattooing after applying this gel!</li>
            <li> I am having a rather large tattoo done on my back which spans multiple and painful sessions.  I tried this product upon the advice of my artist.  Applied per the directions and used suran wrap.  I could feel it heating up and thought it was going to work, but alas, there was no difference in my pain once the needle was laid to my back.  It is a bit expensive considering it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> works the best, client is completely numb for about two hours</li>
            <li> Works good for about hour to hour and half</li>
            <li> Did care for it. Had a menthol affect.</li>
            <li> Got my rib cage done but before applyed this stuff an i swear did not feel pain just felt the needle this stuff is AMAZING ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly and sat for a large ribpiece. Still felt a little pain, but definitely a lot less than without the cream. Lasted about an hour and a half and then came the pain. I almost felt like it hurt worse because the pain really does come on instantly and is very shocking. I was able to get through the outline but had to stop on the color. I purchased a  different spray brand that is supposed to be the most effective after the skin is broken.</li>
            <li> It Really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hush anesthetic on my first tattoo and didn&#x27;t feel anything. I used this product on the same part of my body but opposite side and felt everything, I feel as though this was fake Hush the tattoo artist mentioned many people sell a knock off of Hush gel</li>
            <li> Product works amazingly</li>
            <li> Bought this for my third tattoo - on my foot. I bought this because the positive reviews outweighed the negative, but I really do think the success of this product is highly dependent on the user. I applied this as directed, saran wrapped it an hour before. Foot felt somewhat numb just before the tattoo needle went in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed is that on the soft pad of my foot the pain was bearable, but on the bony part it was awful. So, regardless of how well you apply this, it also depends on the location of the tattoo and the tattoo artist as well. There are too many variables for me to say this gel is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use it again? Probably, if only to see if it works on another part of my body, but I won&#x27;t be rushing to use it again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Hush a lot.  It works well for me.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Used it on my ribs and lasted almost 2 hours (and then two more sessions of 2 hours each). There is some pain, don&#x27;t get it wrong- especially when the artist goes over the same location (broken skin) over and over- but makes it so much more bearable!! My friend used it today on a hand tattoo (wrist to hand, very bony) and felt very little pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stings when it goes on (deadening the nerve endings) and really no need to wait more than one hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> Had a sternum &amp; rib piece done took about 2 hours and it lasted the entire time. Some places I couldn&#x27;t even feel it at all. Already buying another bottle. Blown away. Just make sure you keep it wrapped tight!</li>
            <li> I am not going to sit here and say that I felt no pain, because I did, but then again I got both feet tattood plus I washed the stuff off in the car and and the time I actually started the tattoo a full hour had passed. But this stuff made the pain bearable and took the edge off. I flinched less than I did for my tattoo on my thigh. Next time I will keep the stuff on and rinse it off in the bathroom right before I get the tattoo and will report back.  Overall though, it&#x27;s pretty good, it definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all and I felt everything when I got my tattoo.  Maybe it will work for others, but it did not work for me at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> Could tell a thing waste of money .</li>
            <li> This stuff really works - I had 3 hours of work and felt nothing .. will buy this for every tattoo moving forward.</li>
            <li> Terrible product didn&#x27;t numb what do ever, I would never waste money on this again.</li>
            <li> I Put this on over an hour before tattoo appointment. It was after I showered and had not applied anything else to my skin. The area tingled and felt cool but the skin never felt numb. At the tattoo parlor the skin was still not numb and became very sticky even after cleaning multiple times. Due to the stickiness the stencil never dried and created a mess during the tattoo work. Thankfully it was just the outline that was done due to not having any numbness for the three hours. I would never recommend this product to anyone. We have used other brands that have worked great and we used this in the same way with no effects.</li>
            <li> I have, I don&#x27;t know 12 or so tattoos, only used a numbing cream on my side piece. HUSH is awesome, I had work done on my sleeve and felt NOTHING. (Except for a tapping feeling on my elbow) but no pain! By the time he started tattooing me I had the gel on for about 3 hours and it still lasted the 3 hours he tattooed me. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product to anyone who wants the tattoo WITHOUT the pain! Two TUMBS up!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work because of how conflicted the reviews were but I absolutely loved it. I have 12 tattoos spread out in different places on my body and a pretty low tolerance for pain (unfortunately I love tattoos). I was getting a tattoo on my shoulder/upper arm and I was hoping this would help ease the pain. I freaked out a little at first because when I first put it on it made my skin burn but this was the first time ever that I almost started to fall asleep while I was getting the tattoo. I even had to ask him if he had already started at first because I didn&#x27;t feel anything! After an hour or two I did start feeling it more but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it usually is so I definetely reccomend this. My tattoo took about 3 hours and it wasn&#x27;t completely numb the entire time but this did make the process less uncomfortable and painful.</li>
            <li> not real happy this stuff works in some areas, but it does not work well enough to be used on your ribs</li>
            <li> I ordered Hush due to not being able to find the cream Mr. Numb that we usually use. My wife tried it for the first time and told me that the area did not feel numb over an hour after placement. The tattoo artist became frustrated due to the skin being sticky and the stencil not drying. He informed us that he would not work on us again if this was on the skin and would make us go home and wash it off. The tattooed area was never numb and just created a big mess.</li>
            <li> it works ok just deferent people take pain in different ways</li>
            <li> I have multiple tattoos covering my body and I figured I try this on a tough spot.  I have a full leg piece and at the recommendation of my artist, bought it for the back of my knee and upper thigh. I was pleasantly surprised! I applied it 1 hour prior to my session, applied a thick amount and wrapped my upper thigh in the seran wrap.  For about 2 hours the tattoo was bearable and it definently took the edge off. The pain was not gone but it was a huge help for such a sensitive area.  Now after around hour 2, it started wearing off and was a little shock to the system when you don&#x27;t have that pain tolerance built up.  Overall product was awesome and I will use it again.  FYI don&#x27; bother with spray, now that stuff didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. I used this and the two full hours I didn&#x27;t feel a thing. The only reason I knew he was tattooing me is because I heard it. I will definitely be using this again- I put a thick layer on and wrapped in Saran Wrap an hour before my appt.</li>
            <li> This think actually works .. Love it</li>
            <li> Okay I think there is lots of mis-information in some of the reviews on this so ill try to be as straight to the point as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think this will make your tattoo session not hurt at all you are wrong, it will reduce the pain about 30-40% which for some people can still be a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much you put it on really thick and warp the area with Saran Warp about an hour before your session start.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every pennie. Get it!! Tattoos hurt and suck without it. Did whole chest with this magic.</li>
            <li> Bought this for laser hair removal. This was not effective at all in numbing the area after proper use. It also burns at first and that is probably due to tea tree oil? Not sure off the top of my head:) it smells great though and was very easy to wipe off...</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works very well, especially on sensitive areas like stomach and bone!</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of ink and recently began finishing my back piece (almost 100 % covered). I decided that I was going to try this product in hopes of dulling some of the discomfort that comes with tattooing and boy was I surprised at just how wonderful this stuff is! I sat through a 5 hour session with almost no discomfort and it wasn&#x27;t until my tattoo artist was doing a lot of overlapping of colors did the normal discomfort begin. I followed all the instructions (super easy) and so far have had no issues with the healing process of my tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have is that once I was done, cleaned up, and fresh ink covered my skin felt like it was on fire... least to say a quick hop in the shower to rinse off (about 20 min after I cleaned up) stopped the burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought another bottle and plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I put this on as directed and the numbing was effective for at least 3-4 hours! Longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well for 2 to 3 hrs</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product.  It burns more than icy hot, therefore I thought it was working.  I rubbed it into the skin then layered a thick layer on top before wrapping with saran wrap.  It burned for about half an hour, then became a little numb.  Once tattooing was started I felt everything - it did not help one bit.  Also be aware that it makes tattooing the skin EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.  My tattoo artist had to go over the same spot at least 6-7 times for the ink to take.  The gel creates a layer that bounces the needle right out.  So it actually hurt more using this gel because of how much it had to be gone over, prolonging pain and time.  Would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works really well on areas that have heavier fat or muscle tissue, but not so well on spots where it&#x27;s just skin and bone, ie. Middle of chest or even some other areas of pectoral. This stuff really helped me through my large chest piece, and would recommend regardless</li>
            <li> Doesnt work at all i bought 4 bottle a waste of money</li>
            <li> Im assuming most of the reviewers didn&#x27;t read the ingredient list before they purchased this product. It is not going to make you completely numb, but it will definitely dull the sensation and make it tolerable in the most sensitive places. Instead of the fire of a thousand suns cutting into my back, it felt more like someone trying to draw on me with a dull pencil. I&#x27;m having extensive work done on my back and the spine is such a sensitive area for me. I put the gel on very thick and covered with Saran Wrap before leaving for the shop about a 30 min drive. The artist wiped it off, cleaned the area, and went to work. The gel worked well for about 1.5-2 hours. My artist says it varies person to person, and that buying the spray is a waste of your money.</li>
