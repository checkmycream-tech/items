            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>the quality of this dryer is outstanding!</li>
            <li>It was easy for me just wanted to mention it because I thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn&#x27;t spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height.</li>
            <li>no salon, nice waves, better than blown out!</li>
            <li>Nice and hot!!!!</li>
            <li>nice to have a timer and to control the heat.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is absolutely the best!!!!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best!!!!</li>
            <li>There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is wonderful, very, very quiet lol, my husband an kids where watching a movie when i used the dryer</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I have this dryer, it&#x27;s like I have my own salon now! :-)</li>
            <li>Blow drier can be damaging for curly hair specially, so roller setting and drying hair is a great alternative</li>
            <li>Girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine</li>
            <li>After reading the good to excellent reviews I purchased the dryer recently.  </li>
            <li>Works great and dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to set up</li>
            <li>This was very easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>This dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li>Arrived via FedEx two days after I ordered it, very easy to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li>These are probably by far the best dryers we have had.</li>
            <li>so honestly, I feel like I got it for free as I don&#x27;t have to go the salon to get my hair done!  </li>
            <li>Best item I bought on amazon thus far.</li>
            <li>Better instructions for the assembly of the item would be nice .</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, easy to assemble (even though the &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; are just pictures) and works great!</li>
            <li>Easy set up!</li>
            <li>Easy to  put together!</li>
            <li>The dryer is great; great temperature control too and very quiet.</li>
            <li>but in general I am very happy with the dryer.</li>
            <li>Was great while it lasted, but the first time I tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again...</li>
            <li>It works just fine!</li>
            <li>I am using for my daughter [7] to speed up her lengthy curl process - She is very comfortable using this.</li>
            <li>Huge hit with my clients!</li>
            <li>It is huge!</li>
            <li>This dryer more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li>My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer  </li>
            <li>but I wish I had done a bit more research before settling on this design.</li>
            <li>plus you can get so many styles out of it.</li>
            <li>I though for sure it would overload the circuit breaker.</li>
            <li>Once I figured everything out and used it, I was in love.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Added bonus the price couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li>Much better that the ones I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair faster than the many dryers that I have had.</li>
            <li>It works better than the shop dryers.</li>
            <li>I love It.</li>
            <li>Honestly a better experience than a salon</li>
            <li>It looks like maybe they removed a sticker, it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li>I wanted a more space convince dryer</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Today,( 3/14/14) that I used my hair dyer, I have to say I just love it.</li>
            <li>she paid more than i paid i thoug</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>will update again after more use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, I love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than just meeting both parts together.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer and it provides excellent results very quiet while drying</li>
            <li>Best of all,its quiet.</li>
            <li>I bought a Pibbs and Love it so mucg better.</li>
            <li>As of today, everything seems okay.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I would just say, put in better instructions to follow.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS DRYER.</li>
            <li>and I love the timer.</li>
            <li>Trying to figure out how I can find a better solution then this plastic piece around the metal pole.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>More money makes for a better upgrade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love 😍😍😍</li>
            <li>The problem that most dryers have is that the air flow doesn&#x27;t circulate to the nape of the head.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Wish the heat came out with more force</li>
            <li>One more business day</li>
            <li>I love having it, I can eat breakfast, read, etc while it does the job.</li>
            <li>So I was pleased and still am.</li>
            <li>Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob</li>
            <li>it was a bit challenging putting it together.</li>
            <li>every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  </li>
            <li>So overall it&#x27;s a pretty good dryer and works great!</li>
            <li>it heats up good and its quiet and it dries your hair fast the best thing i ever brought this dryer</li>
            <li>Simply beautiful soft hair with curls from my rollers...</li>
            <li>I love this dryer, it&#x27;s easy to setup and works as stated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4-assembly was easy, just be sure to use judgment as the structure is not well balanced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a salon, but it&#x27;s great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer.</li>
            <li>They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products.</li>
            <li>Best $104 ever spent.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Even so, I&#x27;m STILL able to fit under and inside  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to someone who looking for a good hood dryer without spending so much $$$$.</li>
            <li>Setting up the stand was relatively easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together and works well.</li>
            <li>Everything was in the box and the directions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to assemble &amp; to move around.</li>
            <li>It has many different temperature settings which is great for customer preference.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together.</li>
            <li>Easy to move around if you need to use it anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li>so am guessing assembling is easy</li>
            <li>It is so easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install</li>
            <li>Someone can damage the piece easily.</li>
            <li>easy set up,,and</li>
            <li>Assembling was easy-</li>
            <li>Easy to put together</li>
            <li>Easy to move around as needed.</li>
            <li>I managed to put it together just using the diagram, but if this is not your strong point, enlist help.</li>
            <li>(I have fine textured hair).  </li>
            <li>The dryer works fine</li>
            <li>While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  </li>
            <li>Salon worthy rollersets every time!  </li>
            <li>This dryer gets very hot which I love.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit huge but that is fine because it is used in my basement.</li>
            <li>Temperature gets very hot and you are able to sit comfortably in any chair with it.</li>
            <li>This dryer really gets hot and it dries your hair evenly!!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product quiet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it over the table top hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>The stand adjust to fit my height, in a chair...</li>
            <li>It is free of noice.</li>
            <li>me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t.v.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, works great.</li>
            <li>It was scratched on the light colored plastic.</li>
            <li>She loves it; it really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Works great and is do quiet!</li>
            <li>Great blow head dryer and extremely quiet!</li>
            <li>I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood.</li>
            <li>it is just absolutely just amazing</li>
            <li>The dryer came with pieces that didn&#x27;t even fit together to make up the feet of the stand.</li>
            <li>BUT it DOES fit.</li>
            <li>Great dryer, Dries my curly hair on big rollers in 40 minutes!  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My adult son, who&#x27;s good at assembling things, put it together for me.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for roller sets for over a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good .</li>
            <li>This is an amazing professional hair dryer!!!</li>
            <li>It gets very very hot too, and the setting is so easy to control and easily change the temp.  </li>
            <li>Gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t have to be super strong to do it.  </li>
            <li>However, a quick Google search can easily help you figure it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and love my results!  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need a special chair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results, not many options for a product like this, and didn&#x27;t want to spend more money.  </li>
            <li>It has an adjustable temperature gauge (cool - 75 deg.C) and a timer setting (up to 60 minutes).</li>
            <li>Some aspects of this hair dryer work well: its adjustable, full sized and has wheels.</li>
            <li>Dryer was a good one but its assembled size was too big for our needs.</li>
            <li>Ohhh my God it has a big diffrent.if fact there is s good one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price</li>
            <li>So far ive used the dryer about 4 times, once on my own hair and 3 times on clients.  </li>
            <li>There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  </li>
            <li>At at first, I was really happy with my purchase; the dryer is quiet, and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>good thing is that it drys quick and is quiet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, sturdy, and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>However, I became pregnant and didn&#x27;t have time to focus on my hair.</li>
            <li>One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  </li>
            <li>But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  </li>
            <li>I started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>but I contacted the seller and they quickly sent the parts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put together, it&#x27;s not too loud</li>
            <li>This is very important since I live in an apartment.  </li>
            <li>Great product, top a little bulky but works really well.</li>
            <li>it gets very hot three seting.</li>
            <li>Works great cools itself Down would buy again</li>
            <li>I love my new dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love my new dryer.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy to setup.</li>
            <li>would recommend this dryer to women who want to speed up the drying process without direct heat, beautiful curls/waves from roller sets, or deep condition</li>
            <li>This dryer arrived fast and was easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it !</li>
            <li>I have a dense head of very curly/kinky hair and this dryer does a great job of getting my strands dry in about an hour.</li>
            <li>they did not ask if I want the money  back; they just send another one which came ok but is not 5 start product; will do its job but have to treat it  with care; so far I have been using this product like 4 time in one month and seems fine; for the price for me is ok</li>
            <li>dryer head is large and easily fits a full set of large rollers.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  </li>
            <li>This product delivered in just a few days, which was great...</li>
            <li>This is one powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>They are nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>it does not color my head completely so, this will make for a better job on my color.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This is too big to fit in there,, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  </li>
            <li>Nice dryer very Quiet</li>
            <li>So much better than the soft bonnet dryer I had (had to keep reconnecting the bonnet to the hose).  </li>
            <li>Only issue honestly.</li>
            <li>There is only one thing that kind of bother me, there is a spring on the inside of the pole</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited at finally being able to do it myself and achieving salon results.</li>
            <li>Right now, it&#x27;s in the dining room.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they sent the right piece.</li>
            <li>The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers</li>
            <li>I bought this because paying to go get my hair professionally done at a salon was becoming money consuming.</li>
            <li>dryer itself works good, however i am already wrapping duct tape around the twist mechanism that allows the stand to go up and down....</li>
            <li>It was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot.</li>
            <li>This hooded dryer is just amazing, I wonder what took me so long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I purchased a second one!</li>
            <li>The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>Worked much better than any of the medicines we bought, didn&#x27;t have to do it more than a couple 45 minute treatments and all were dead (15 minutes steaming, 30 minutes</li>
            <li>I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television.</li>
            <li>The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer.</li>
            <li>, how the guy said it pumped twice as much air as a hair dryer, bought a vacuum and a hair dryer that could be set to warm/cool, and made my own).</li>
            <li>Very fast drying too.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on your hair.  </li>
            <li>All in all Iike the product very much.</li>
            <li>I love that the heat evenly reaches all parts of the head, even the very back.</li>
            <li>What I really love is how quiet this dryer is!</li>
            <li>the description didn&#x27;t say how hot it gets</li>
            <li>and it was too hot for my girl friend</li>
            <li>and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord.</li>
            <li>I got this one for personal use, and love it.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely Loves it!  </li>
            <li>(Just as hot as the salon)</li>
            <li>the first time that arrive came with damages; my husband returned (they ask for pictures and want it to prove that was damage; I did send it)</li>
            <li>some of the reviews I read indicated that it was too hot; I beg to differ.</li>
            <li>This is OK for personal use but not a beauty shop.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I finally got one of these for home.</li>
            <li>Not as hot as salon dryers.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>You must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand.</li>
            <li>if I could give the Timer knob replaced I would rate this product higher; for now it&#x27;s non-functional.</li>
            <li>It does get hot</li>
            <li>First of all, item arrived on time.</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot, but it&#x27;s what I prefer.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty sturdy though.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The air circulates by a big fan at the top.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer the same night of the return and glad I did.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer the same night of the return and glad I did.</li>
            <li>Just have to find the proper chair to sit under it:)</li>
            <li>This is a good buy for what you pay, however a few things to know before you purchase this:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The materials seem a bit cheap, but overall, the dryer gets very hot, is not noisy, and makes it look like I went to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was an issue with my original unit but the seller immediately sent me a replacement and so far I haven&#x27;t had an problems.</li>
            <li>So far so good, but you do need to be careful</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>Love this because I dont have to stay under the dryer long.</li>
            <li>At first I thought 1000 watt wouldn&#x27;t do much, but this Bonnet Hood Dryer packs a punch.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  was exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>The unit is very top heavy.  </li>
            <li>My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it&#x27;s pretty huge.</li>
            <li>Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Setup was easy (took about 10 minutes) and very similar to the set up of my hair</li>
            <li>Heat is OK not real hot.  </li>
            <li>Offers high heat or cool temperatures, and has a built in timer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it works great and has definitely saved me money from having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $300-400 on the well-known Pibbs brand.</li>
            <li>But this one is so quiet I can comfortably have a phone conversation while it&#x27;s drying my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that was the whole plan.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Once assembling, I found that it worked reasonably well -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not noisy at all and does the job really well.</li>
            <li>I may admit that I was very intimated by this dryer when I unboxed it.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>It drys your hair fast and its not too laud.  </li>
            <li>so so so so much......</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too</li>
            <li>Its realy very cheep staf</li>
            <li>It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy.</li>
            <li>I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container.</li>
            <li>lice buster people didn&#x27;t want to sell it to me, so I googled the videos, saw what it really did</li>
            <li>My husband put it together as soon as I received and he did it so fast</li>
            <li>( I was not there when he did it), I was washing my hair ready to try it out. .</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale.</li>
            <li>The pole/raising lowering mechanism seem cheap, concerned they won&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much experience with moving it around.</li>
            <li>Then sometimes you can really notice the heating element turn on and</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  </li>
            <li>would recommend to make sure all the part are good since one of the wills broken; not a big deal</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 30 now): I work full time, am married, AND went back to school.</li>
            <li>wow!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had at least 4 of these kind of hair dryer in my life and all of them were good and last me long time!</li>
            <li>so, all I paid was 104.00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  </li>
            <li>If I want the left side done I would have to be underneath of it longer and the right side would get burned!</li>
            <li>actually I&#x27;m watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now!</li>
            <li>I have very long (to my butt), fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>i let the dryer up or down that spring noise gets to me a lil&#x27; but other than that, its definately a great buy for price.  </li>
            <li>Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  </li>
            <li>but we are paying for something new, not broken.</li>
            <li>I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews from previous customers, i wasnt sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>So when mine arrived, I couldn&#x27;t find the main bolt that keeps the feet on.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>dryer works just fine as expected.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!!</li>
            <li>professional grade in my home!!</li>
            <li>Works really well, not too loud and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried like a hand-dryer.</li>
            <li>my hair: My natural hair is very dense (pictured below) and is 4A coily.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s (I use gel on wet hair) and it all fits comfortably under the hood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet , gets really hot , and very adjustable .</li>
            <li>I normally keep the temp.</li>
            <li>I normally keep the temp.</li>
            <li>Also as noted in other reviews, the lid for where you stick your head under is plastic , so be gentle with it as it is fragile .The dryer is top heavy so make sure is stable when in use .</li>
            <li>I used the dryer for deep conditioning treatments which leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the right side will feel cooler than the left side.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended styling tool, particularly for natural hair wearers, or at home hair style mavens.</li>
            <li>is my new baby...</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t expect a new item to be scratched like that.</li>
            <li>I live in Seattle and it was shipping from Florida</li>
            <li>it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia).</li>
            <li>The back of my head gets just as much air as the top, which cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together took less than 5 minutes after unpacking everything.</li>
            <li>This takes an hour to dry and is super</li>
            <li>I only used it one time, but it really dries fast.</li>
            <li>I ended up gluing the pieces into the bottom of the stand and when I finally put the bonnet onto the stand, five minutes later it toppled over because the stand is so light and the dryer part has some weight to it.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save money on their hair!</li>
            <li>Quiet, and it gets Hot</li>
            <li>It came four days early!  </li>
            <li>It is tremendously quiet and dries on a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting, the highest temperature option is too hot.</li>
            <li>I had one prior to this one that didn&#x27;t get as hot.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Although she has only used it  few times, it works just perfect for her thick hair.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap $40 dryer from Sally&#x27;s and took it back two days later because it was horribly loud and didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap $40 dryer from Sally&#x27;s and took it back two days later because it was horribly loud and didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>its cracked, first day of use, I should send it back</li>
            <li>sometimes I like to dry my hair without rollers for a quick natural look, however this dryer creates a whirlwind vortex that ends up tangling the hair on my crown.</li>
            <li>My hair dried very quick and I didn&#x27;t even put it on the max heat.</li>
            <li>I dry at medium-high heat because this hair dryer gets really hot on high</li>
            <li>Its a tight fit</li>
            <li>I do rollers, I only use the Jumbo/Extra Large ones all around my head.</li>
            <li>It probably wouldn&#x27;t survive a hard fall so keep it safe and</li>
            <li>I was looking for a professional dryer to help me achieve salon-quality roller sets at home.</li>
            <li>Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged.</li>
            <li>It is not overly loud and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and so far it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>My curls were soft and springy.  </li>
            <li>it is not loud and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>It is bulky and an eye sore in my bedroom - the old dryer folded and I stored in my closet.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  </li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li>So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  </li>
            <li>The bell is not too loud when the timer is done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying I won&#x27;t get my hair done professionally</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it for commercial use since it&#x27;s very wobbly.</li>
            <li>Like I said no complaints so far</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The timer has startled me once or twice when going off and is a tad bit loud.</li>
            <li>And sometimes the whole thing will feel cooler than it did last time you used it.</li>
            <li>Thoughts on the Effect of the Salon Sundry Professional Bonnet Style Hood Dryer&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li>I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out)</li>
            <li>a stylist&#x27;s pirspective b/c no client likes sitting up under a hot dryer for long and stylists can get their clients in and out!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is that sometimes it&#x27;s shaky especially if the screw isn&#x27;t put in properly but a great dryer for your hair.</li>
            <li>Hair gets dry fast!</li>
            <li>This dryer have cut down on the drying process tremendously</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes!</li>
            <li>I could have used a small spanner to help tighten the screw, but I managed fine with no tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your hair and body can handle the high heat then definitely go for it for faster drying.</li>
            <li>I would have like to see a HIGH and LOW option</li>
            <li>The heat is always concentrated on the top of the head, so the back takes extremely long to dry; But not this dryer!!!</li>
            <li>it and a lot of product to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dryer mainly to dry my wash n go&#x27;s (I use gel on wet hair) and it all fits comfortably under the hood.</li>
            <li>The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer.</li>
            <li>After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  </li>
            <li>Certainly beats standing with a hand held, or taking 5 hours to air dry for a client meeting.  </li>
            <li>: large head, even heat distribution, quiet, low price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>; rollers to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer..</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t sit under that high heat for long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  </li>
            <li>It took me literally 2 hours to put the dryer together since the instructions wasn&#x27;t clear enough.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the timer is so loud that I have to warn my clients about it</li>
            <li>As well as my 6 year old&#x27;s height in the same chair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to leave my house with wet hair.</li>
            <li>but I have no regrets...</li>
            <li>The dryer is really quiet  unlike some that are so loud.</li>
            <li>Dryer is terrific so far [used twice] - I like the variable heat levels and quietness of the unit.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they overlooked that part of the email.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used product once and so far, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>really hot so be careful to adjust or sit low ..best dryer ever</li>
            <li>the plastic top is a bit poorly constructed.</li>
            <li>The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I&#x27;m not moving around a lot if I&#x27;m sitting under the dryer anyway</li>
            <li>Heat is sufficient but not as hot as salon dryers, air blower is a little lower than what I would prefer but its also quieter</li>
            <li>High quality, easy to assemble, adjustable, sturdy base, fast service, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This dryer is silent, gets hot, and does the job in an hour or less.</li>
            <li>This dryer is silent, gets hot, and does the job in an hour or less.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quiet you can barely hear it running.  </li>
            <li>It also heats consistently, so I am spending less time under a hair dryer because I don&#x27;t have to babysit the bonnet and the hose!  </li>
            <li>My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  </li>
            <li>I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I&#x27;m done.</li>

            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> the quality of this dryer is outstanding!</li>
            <li> It was easy for me just wanted to mention it because I thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn&#x27;t spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height.</li>
            <li> no salon, nice waves, better than blown out!</li>
            <li> Nice and hot!!!!</li>
            <li> nice to have a timer and to control the heat.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is absolutely the best!!!!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best!!!!</li>
            <li> There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is wonderful, very, very quiet lol, my husband an kids where watching a movie when i used the dryer</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I have this dryer, it&#x27;s like I have my own salon now! :-)</li>
            <li> Blow drier can be damaging for curly hair specially, so roller setting and drying hair is a great alternative</li>
            <li> Girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine</li>
            <li> After reading the good to excellent reviews I purchased the dryer recently.  </li>
            <li> Works great and dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to set up</li>
            <li> This was very easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> This dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li> Arrived via FedEx two days after I ordered it, very easy to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li> These are probably by far the best dryers we have had.</li>
            <li> so honestly, I feel like I got it for free as I don&#x27;t have to go the salon to get my hair done!  </li>
            <li> Best item I bought on amazon thus far.</li>
            <li> Better instructions for the assembly of the item would be nice .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy to assemble (even though the &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; are just pictures) and works great!</li>
            <li> Easy set up!</li>
            <li> Easy to  put together!</li>
            <li> The dryer is great; great temperature control too and very quiet.</li>
            <li> but in general I am very happy with the dryer.</li>
            <li> Was great while it lasted, but the first time I tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again...</li>
            <li> It works just fine!</li>
            <li> I am using for my daughter [7] to speed up her lengthy curl process - She is very comfortable using this.</li>
            <li> Huge hit with my clients!</li>
            <li> It is huge!</li>
            <li> This dryer more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li> My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer  </li>
            <li> but I wish I had done a bit more research before settling on this design.</li>
            <li> plus you can get so many styles out of it.</li>
            <li> I though for sure it would overload the circuit breaker.</li>
            <li> Once I figured everything out and used it, I was in love.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Added bonus the price couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li> Much better that the ones I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster than the many dryers that I have had.</li>
            <li> It works better than the shop dryers.</li>
            <li> I love It.</li>
            <li> Honestly a better experience than a salon</li>
            <li> It looks like maybe they removed a sticker, it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li> I wanted a more space convince dryer</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Today,( 3/14/14) that I used my hair dyer, I have to say I just love it.</li>
            <li> she paid more than i paid i thoug</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> will update again after more use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, I love it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than just meeting both parts together.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer and it provides excellent results very quiet while drying</li>
            <li> Best of all,its quiet.</li>
            <li> I bought a Pibbs and Love it so mucg better.</li>
            <li> As of today, everything seems okay.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I would just say, put in better instructions to follow.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS DRYER.</li>
            <li> and I love the timer.</li>
            <li> Trying to figure out how I can find a better solution then this plastic piece around the metal pole.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> More money makes for a better upgrade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> The problem that most dryers have is that the air flow doesn&#x27;t circulate to the nape of the head.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Wish the heat came out with more force</li>
            <li> One more business day</li>
            <li> I love having it, I can eat breakfast, read, etc while it does the job.</li>
            <li> So I was pleased and still am.</li>
            <li> Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob</li>
            <li> it was a bit challenging putting it together.</li>
            <li> every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  </li>
            <li> So overall it&#x27;s a pretty good dryer and works great!</li>
            <li> it heats up good and its quiet and it dries your hair fast the best thing i ever brought this dryer</li>
            <li> Simply beautiful soft hair with curls from my rollers...</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, it&#x27;s easy to setup and works as stated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4-assembly was easy, just be sure to use judgment as the structure is not well balanced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a salon, but it&#x27;s great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer.</li>
            <li> They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products.</li>
            <li> Best $104 ever spent.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Even so, I&#x27;m STILL able to fit under and inside  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to someone who looking for a good hood dryer without spending so much $$$$.</li>
            <li> Setting up the stand was relatively easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together and works well.</li>
            <li> Everything was in the box and the directions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to assemble &amp; to move around.</li>
            <li> It has many different temperature settings which is great for customer preference.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together.</li>
            <li> Easy to move around if you need to use it anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li> so am guessing assembling is easy</li>
            <li> It is so easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install</li>
            <li> Someone can damage the piece easily.</li>
            <li> easy set up,,and</li>
            <li> Assembling was easy-</li>
            <li> Easy to put together</li>
            <li> Easy to move around as needed.</li>
            <li> I managed to put it together just using the diagram, but if this is not your strong point, enlist help.</li>
            <li> (I have fine textured hair).  </li>
            <li> The dryer works fine</li>
            <li> While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  </li>
            <li> Salon worthy rollersets every time!  </li>
            <li> This dryer gets very hot which I love.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit huge but that is fine because it is used in my basement.</li>
            <li> Temperature gets very hot and you are able to sit comfortably in any chair with it.</li>
            <li> This dryer really gets hot and it dries your hair evenly!!!!  </li>
            <li> Great product quiet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it over the table top hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> The stand adjust to fit my height, in a chair...</li>
            <li> It is free of noice.</li>
            <li> me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t.v.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, works great.</li>
            <li> It was scratched on the light colored plastic.</li>
            <li> She loves it; it really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Works great and is do quiet!</li>
            <li> Great blow head dryer and extremely quiet!</li>
            <li> I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood.</li>
            <li> it is just absolutely just amazing</li>
            <li> The dryer came with pieces that didn&#x27;t even fit together to make up the feet of the stand.</li>
            <li> BUT it DOES fit.</li>
            <li> Great dryer, Dries my curly hair on big rollers in 40 minutes!  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> My adult son, who&#x27;s good at assembling things, put it together for me.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for roller sets for over a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good .</li>
            <li> This is an amazing professional hair dryer!!!</li>
            <li> It gets very very hot too, and the setting is so easy to control and easily change the temp.  </li>
            <li> Gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have to be super strong to do it.  </li>
            <li> However, a quick Google search can easily help you figure it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and love my results!  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need a special chair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results, not many options for a product like this, and didn&#x27;t want to spend more money.  </li>
            <li> It has an adjustable temperature gauge (cool - 75 deg.C) and a timer setting (up to 60 minutes).</li>
            <li> Some aspects of this hair dryer work well: its adjustable, full sized and has wheels.</li>
            <li> Dryer was a good one but its assembled size was too big for our needs.</li>
            <li> Ohhh my God it has a big diffrent.if fact there is s good one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price</li>
            <li> So far ive used the dryer about 4 times, once on my own hair and 3 times on clients.  </li>
            <li> There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  </li>
            <li> At at first, I was really happy with my purchase; the dryer is quiet, and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> good thing is that it drys quick and is quiet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, sturdy, and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> However, I became pregnant and didn&#x27;t have time to focus on my hair.</li>
            <li> One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  </li>
            <li> But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  </li>
            <li> I started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> but I contacted the seller and they quickly sent the parts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to put together, it&#x27;s not too loud</li>
            <li> This is very important since I live in an apartment.  </li>
            <li> Great product, top a little bulky but works really well.</li>
            <li> it gets very hot three seting.</li>
            <li> Works great cools itself Down would buy again</li>
            <li> I love my new dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love my new dryer.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to setup.</li>
            <li> would recommend this dryer to women who want to speed up the drying process without direct heat, beautiful curls/waves from roller sets, or deep condition</li>
            <li> This dryer arrived fast and was easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it !</li>
            <li> I have a dense head of very curly/kinky hair and this dryer does a great job of getting my strands dry in about an hour.</li>
            <li> they did not ask if I want the money  back; they just send another one which came ok but is not 5 start product; will do its job but have to treat it  with care; so far I have been using this product like 4 time in one month and seems fine; for the price for me is ok</li>
            <li> dryer head is large and easily fits a full set of large rollers.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  </li>
            <li> This product delivered in just a few days, which was great...</li>
            <li> This is one powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> They are nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> it does not color my head completely so, this will make for a better job on my color.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This is too big to fit in there,, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  </li>
            <li> Nice dryer very Quiet</li>
            <li> So much better than the soft bonnet dryer I had (had to keep reconnecting the bonnet to the hose).  </li>
            <li> Only issue honestly.</li>
            <li> There is only one thing that kind of bother me, there is a spring on the inside of the pole</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited at finally being able to do it myself and achieving salon results.</li>
            <li> Right now, it&#x27;s in the dining room.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they sent the right piece.</li>
            <li> The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> Fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers</li>
            <li> I bought this because paying to go get my hair professionally done at a salon was becoming money consuming.</li>
            <li> dryer itself works good, however i am already wrapping duct tape around the twist mechanism that allows the stand to go up and down....</li>
            <li> It was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot.</li>
            <li> This hooded dryer is just amazing, I wonder what took me so long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I purchased a second one!</li>
            <li> The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> Worked much better than any of the medicines we bought, didn&#x27;t have to do it more than a couple 45 minute treatments and all were dead (15 minutes steaming, 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television.</li>
            <li> The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer.</li>
            <li> , how the guy said it pumped twice as much air as a hair dryer, bought a vacuum and a hair dryer that could be set to warm/cool, and made my own).</li>
            <li> Very fast drying too.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on your hair.  </li>
            <li> All in all Iike the product very much.</li>
            <li> I love that the heat evenly reaches all parts of the head, even the very back.</li>
            <li> What I really love is how quiet this dryer is!</li>
            <li> the description didn&#x27;t say how hot it gets</li>
            <li> and it was too hot for my girl friend</li>
            <li> and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord.</li>
            <li> I got this one for personal use, and love it.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely Loves it!  </li>
            <li> (Just as hot as the salon)</li>
            <li> the first time that arrive came with damages; my husband returned (they ask for pictures and want it to prove that was damage; I did send it)</li>
            <li> some of the reviews I read indicated that it was too hot; I beg to differ.</li>
            <li> This is OK for personal use but not a beauty shop.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I finally got one of these for home.</li>
            <li> Not as hot as salon dryers.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> You must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand.</li>
            <li> if I could give the Timer knob replaced I would rate this product higher; for now it&#x27;s non-functional.</li>
            <li> It does get hot</li>
            <li> First of all, item arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot, but it&#x27;s what I prefer.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty sturdy though.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The air circulates by a big fan at the top.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer the same night of the return and glad I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer the same night of the return and glad I did.</li>
            <li> Just have to find the proper chair to sit under it:)</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for what you pay, however a few things to know before you purchase this:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The materials seem a bit cheap, but overall, the dryer gets very hot, is not noisy, and makes it look like I went to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was an issue with my original unit but the seller immediately sent me a replacement and so far I haven&#x27;t had an problems.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but you do need to be careful</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Love this because I dont have to stay under the dryer long.</li>
            <li> At first I thought 1000 watt wouldn&#x27;t do much, but this Bonnet Hood Dryer packs a punch.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  was exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li> The unit is very top heavy.  </li>
            <li> My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it&#x27;s pretty huge.</li>
            <li> Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Setup was easy (took about 10 minutes) and very similar to the set up of my hair</li>
            <li> Heat is OK not real hot.  </li>
            <li> Offers high heat or cool temperatures, and has a built in timer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it works great and has definitely saved me money from having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $300-400 on the well-known Pibbs brand.</li>
            <li> But this one is so quiet I can comfortably have a phone conversation while it&#x27;s drying my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that was the whole plan.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Once assembling, I found that it worked reasonably well -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not noisy at all and does the job really well.</li>
            <li> I may admit that I was very intimated by this dryer when I unboxed it.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> It drys your hair fast and its not too laud.  </li>
            <li> so so so so much......</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> Its realy very cheep staf</li>
            <li> It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy.</li>
            <li> I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container.</li>
            <li> lice buster people didn&#x27;t want to sell it to me, so I googled the videos, saw what it really did</li>
            <li> My husband put it together as soon as I received and he did it so fast</li>
            <li> ( I was not there when he did it), I was washing my hair ready to try it out. .</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale.</li>
            <li> The pole/raising lowering mechanism seem cheap, concerned they won&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much experience with moving it around.</li>
            <li> Then sometimes you can really notice the heating element turn on and</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  </li>
            <li> would recommend to make sure all the part are good since one of the wills broken; not a big deal</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 30 now): I work full time, am married, AND went back to school.</li>
            <li> wow!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 4 of these kind of hair dryer in my life and all of them were good and last me long time!</li>
            <li> so, all I paid was 104.00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  </li>
            <li> If I want the left side done I would have to be underneath of it longer and the right side would get burned!</li>
            <li> actually I&#x27;m watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now!</li>
            <li> I have very long (to my butt), fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> i let the dryer up or down that spring noise gets to me a lil&#x27; but other than that, its definately a great buy for price.  </li>
            <li> Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  </li>
            <li> but we are paying for something new, not broken.</li>
            <li> I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews from previous customers, i wasnt sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> So when mine arrived, I couldn&#x27;t find the main bolt that keeps the feet on.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> dryer works just fine as expected.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!!</li>
            <li> professional grade in my home!!</li>
            <li> Works really well, not too loud and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried like a hand-dryer.</li>
            <li> my hair: My natural hair is very dense (pictured below) and is 4A coily.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s (I use gel on wet hair) and it all fits comfortably under the hood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet , gets really hot , and very adjustable .</li>
            <li> I normally keep the temp.</li>
            <li> I normally keep the temp.</li>
            <li> Also as noted in other reviews, the lid for where you stick your head under is plastic , so be gentle with it as it is fragile .The dryer is top heavy so make sure is stable when in use .</li>
            <li> I used the dryer for deep conditioning treatments which leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the right side will feel cooler than the left side.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended styling tool, particularly for natural hair wearers, or at home hair style mavens.</li>
            <li> is my new baby...</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t expect a new item to be scratched like that.</li>
            <li> I live in Seattle and it was shipping from Florida</li>
            <li> it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia).</li>
            <li> The back of my head gets just as much air as the top, which cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together took less than 5 minutes after unpacking everything.</li>
            <li> This takes an hour to dry and is super</li>
            <li> I only used it one time, but it really dries fast.</li>
            <li> I ended up gluing the pieces into the bottom of the stand and when I finally put the bonnet onto the stand, five minutes later it toppled over because the stand is so light and the dryer part has some weight to it.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save money on their hair!</li>
            <li> Quiet, and it gets Hot</li>
            <li> It came four days early!  </li>
            <li> It is tremendously quiet and dries on a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting, the highest temperature option is too hot.</li>
            <li> I had one prior to this one that didn&#x27;t get as hot.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Although she has only used it  few times, it works just perfect for her thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap $40 dryer from Sally&#x27;s and took it back two days later because it was horribly loud and didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap $40 dryer from Sally&#x27;s and took it back two days later because it was horribly loud and didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> its cracked, first day of use, I should send it back</li>
            <li> sometimes I like to dry my hair without rollers for a quick natural look, however this dryer creates a whirlwind vortex that ends up tangling the hair on my crown.</li>
            <li> My hair dried very quick and I didn&#x27;t even put it on the max heat.</li>
            <li> I dry at medium-high heat because this hair dryer gets really hot on high</li>
            <li> Its a tight fit</li>
            <li> I do rollers, I only use the Jumbo/Extra Large ones all around my head.</li>
            <li> It probably wouldn&#x27;t survive a hard fall so keep it safe and</li>
            <li> I was looking for a professional dryer to help me achieve salon-quality roller sets at home.</li>
            <li> Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged.</li>
            <li> It is not overly loud and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and so far it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> My curls were soft and springy.  </li>
            <li> it is not loud and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> It is bulky and an eye sore in my bedroom - the old dryer folded and I stored in my closet.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  </li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li> So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  </li>
            <li> The bell is not too loud when the timer is done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying I won&#x27;t get my hair done professionally</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it for commercial use since it&#x27;s very wobbly.</li>
            <li> Like I said no complaints so far</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The timer has startled me once or twice when going off and is a tad bit loud.</li>
            <li> And sometimes the whole thing will feel cooler than it did last time you used it.</li>
            <li> Thoughts on the Effect of the Salon Sundry Professional Bonnet Style Hood Dryer&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li> I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out)</li>
            <li> a stylist&#x27;s pirspective b/c no client likes sitting up under a hot dryer for long and stylists can get their clients in and out!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is that sometimes it&#x27;s shaky especially if the screw isn&#x27;t put in properly but a great dryer for your hair.</li>
            <li> Hair gets dry fast!</li>
            <li> This dryer have cut down on the drying process tremendously</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes!</li>
            <li> I could have used a small spanner to help tighten the screw, but I managed fine with no tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your hair and body can handle the high heat then definitely go for it for faster drying.</li>
            <li> I would have like to see a HIGH and LOW option</li>
            <li> The heat is always concentrated on the top of the head, so the back takes extremely long to dry; But not this dryer!!!</li>
            <li> it and a lot of product to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dryer mainly to dry my wash n go&#x27;s (I use gel on wet hair) and it all fits comfortably under the hood.</li>
            <li> The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer.</li>
            <li> After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  </li>
            <li> Certainly beats standing with a hand held, or taking 5 hours to air dry for a client meeting.  </li>
            <li> : large head, even heat distribution, quiet, low price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> ; rollers to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer..</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t sit under that high heat for long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  </li>
            <li> It took me literally 2 hours to put the dryer together since the instructions wasn&#x27;t clear enough.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the timer is so loud that I have to warn my clients about it</li>
            <li> As well as my 6 year old&#x27;s height in the same chair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to leave my house with wet hair.</li>
            <li> but I have no regrets...</li>
            <li> The dryer is really quiet  unlike some that are so loud.</li>
            <li> Dryer is terrific so far [used twice] - I like the variable heat levels and quietness of the unit.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they overlooked that part of the email.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used product once and so far, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> really hot so be careful to adjust or sit low ..best dryer ever</li>
            <li> the plastic top is a bit poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I&#x27;m not moving around a lot if I&#x27;m sitting under the dryer anyway</li>
            <li> Heat is sufficient but not as hot as salon dryers, air blower is a little lower than what I would prefer but its also quieter</li>
            <li> High quality, easy to assemble, adjustable, sturdy base, fast service, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This dryer is silent, gets hot, and does the job in an hour or less.</li>
            <li> This dryer is silent, gets hot, and does the job in an hour or less.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quiet you can barely hear it running.  </li>
            <li> It also heats consistently, so I am spending less time under a hair dryer because I don&#x27;t have to babysit the bonnet and the hose!  </li>
            <li> My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  </li>
            <li> I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This dryer completely dried her hair in about 30 minutes and she usually has to sit for more than an hour to ensure that her hair is thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly but takes so, long too dry.</li>
            <li> Used this in conjunction with a hair dryer and vacuum cleaner (that can be set to blow)  to steam the knits to death and out of the hair, and then the hair dryer (with multi-pronged attachment) and vacuum cleaner on blow to overdry the living ones to death.</li>
            <li> Other than the timer being way too loud when it goes off, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> It is constantly ticking (it&#x27;s not loud</li>
            <li> I have long hair, below my shoulders but above waist.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with this dryer is that the long metal pole connecting to the hood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more alarming when I have to stay under the heat to dry those spots while the rest of my hair is already dry and being exposed to unnecessary heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more alarming when I have to stay under the heat to dry those spots while the rest of my hair is already dry and being exposed to unnecessary heat.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 for a new salon and both broke within a few uses.</li>
            <li> The base is very wide to help support the weight of the dryer which I personally think does a great job.</li>
            <li> and I only needed to use the dryer for 10 minutes to completely dry my hair</li>
            <li> The timer isn&#x27;t crazy loud, but once you zone out and forget about it the &#x27;ding&#x27; sound can be startling.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very loud at all, which I also like.</li>
            <li> Underneath the dryer is a little loud, but you can still carry on a conversation over the phone or watch things on your PC/</li>
            <li> Around the front left side, the right side, the crown (at the roots), and the nape dry poorly.</li>
            <li> Around the front left side, the right side, the crown (at the roots), and the nape dry poorly.</li>
            <li> More than 12 of those bad boys on your head at once may not fit very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is Mich earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this items for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for too long</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to stay under so long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 10-12 inches in length stretched.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 10-12 inches in length stretched.</li>
            <li> It allows my long hair to dry without difficulty.  </li>
            <li> My hair usually takes 45 mins to dry and with my new dryer it takes me 30.</li>
            <li> Air dry or heat dry.</li>
            <li> I can now dry my hair in 10 minutes by just sitting there, instead of 40 minutes with a hand held drier.  </li>
            <li> When you sit to dry your hair, an office chair won&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> In 5 to 10 minutes your hair is dry with curlers or without.</li>
            <li> , it has no choice but to dry the hair evenly.</li>
            <li> At 60-65oC (140-149oF) it takes about 30-40 minutes to fully dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use the dryer mainly to dry my wash n go</li>
            <li> At 60-65oC (140-149oF) it takes about 30-40 minutes to fully dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Being Dominican, I remember going to the salon every Saturday morning since I was 10 with my mother so that we could pay 20-30 dollars for our \\&quot;lady\\&quot; to blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I used the middle, yellow settings and it dried my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several comments before purchasing, especially the part about missing parts upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Although moveable, I find it awkward and feel like it is about to fall over simply because it is so top heavy.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me an hour and a half to dry my natural 3c-4a hair but this only took about 45mins.</li>
            <li> So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, less than 6 months later, the Timer Knob breaks!  </li>
            <li> I tried super glue, to mend the knob, but that didn&#x27;t work so this dryer is USELESS now.  </li>
            <li> It can tip over if you are not careful and it is a little bit suffocating-feeling when you put down the visor.</li>
            <li> My old tabletop dryer was so loud I worried about disturbing my roommates.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the timer should also be quiet.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet one and nothing missing from a Pibbs</li>
            <li> Price was under $200 for 3 different items (hair dryer, steam bonnet, heavy duty wet/dry vac that can blow as well as suck)</li>
            <li> Although it came in two separate boxes, installation was a snap even with the minimal directions that were included.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it is new or because it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> I typically do 20 minutes (gets my hair about 85-90% dry), shake my hair out, fluff it while feeling for wet areas, and sit under the dryer for another 10-20 minutes as needed.</li>

            <li> but I realized that if they couldn&#x27;t get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this rating is due to the difficulty in putting the pole piece into the plastic height control.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while</li>
            <li> top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with.</li>
            <li> I read other ladies who have purchased on Amazon&#x27;s site which is why I purchased this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> (sticks up) due to the suction created by the convection current.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friend in the military posted overseas swears by hers!</li>
            <li> but the holder is a little bit loose</li>
            <li> The head seems to be a little heavy for the stand but no problem .It takes a little bigger storage space for me</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll last me for at least a year with no problems!pictured below) and is 4A coily.</li>
            <li> Also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder-er to adjust down</li>
            <li> Otherwise, that&#x27;s $104 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  </li>
            <li> The other seemed too heavy and toppled over on a client.</li>
            <li> The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed.</li>
            <li> Not cool...</li>
            <li> The poor circulation plus the occasional uneven heating leaves parts of my hair wet still.</li>
            <li> The poor circulation plus the occasional uneven heating leaves parts of my hair wet still.</li>
            <li> Little to my surprise, the bolt was already screwed on the bottom of the stick.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll last me for at least a year with no problems!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan, but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess.</li>
            <li> which cuts down on time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> My tabletop dryer dried my hair in about an hour and 30 mins..</li>
            <li> I did let it run for a few minutes and the smell does not go away.  </li>
            <li> but I took a leap of faith since the complaints were few and ordered my dryer.  </li>
            <li> I had to lower the thermostat after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> One of the pieces did not fit</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t waste my money on a Pibb or PEBCO brand.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Shipment was missing a piece.</li>
            <li> i was missing.</li>
            <li> Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town.</li>
            <li> Item came missing the connecting screw.</li>
            <li> After owning this machine for 4 months I have noticed the heat has become a bit uneven sometimes.</li>
            <li> forward a few years</li>
            <li> Even though the base is very wide, it&#x27;s not heavy enough to  keep it stable.  </li>
            <li> put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up!</li>
            <li> The extended legs get in the way and is not easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit leery after reading a few reviews where customers had a hard time contacting the seller or getting satisfaction after receiving defective items</li>
            <li> No more heat damaged hair.</li>
            <li> When my husband and I moved, I couldn&#x27;t find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  </li>
            <li> I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  </li>
            <li> The dryer comers with various temperature controls that are listed in Celsius, not Fahrenheit, which is a little inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad.</li>
            <li> When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke.</li>
            <li> hard hat is narrower than those from a salon.</li>
            <li> However, It does not blow hard at all.</li>
            <li> The enclosure of the dryer is made of hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Just use your common sense and look at the pictures</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one is terrible and it only drys the right side of my hair.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not for someone afraid of small spaces!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  </li>
            <li> The bad thing about this is that it has a whirlwind that make it hard to dry hair and the (whirlwind causes hair to spin and</li>
            <li> I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least 5 times in the 3 weeks since I bought it!</li>
            <li> The round piece around the metal pole is cracked!!!  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve never experienced</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is getting a weight to add to the base because it can tip over easier than it should.</li>
            <li> This item came broken and had to trash it.  </li>
            <li> hurt myself worse</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking</li>
            <li> Could of been done in 5 minutes but was confused with the pole connection.</li>
            <li> The problem I have--and probably my biggest complaint--with this dryer is that though the air circulates, it does so poorly (IMHO).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful addition to my home.  This dryer really gets hot and it dries your hair evenly!!!!  Good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Work really nice is awesome. .....</li>
            <li> Great buy, fantastic dryer! Huge hit with my clients!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she said it works good.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a professional dryer to help me achieve salon-quality roller sets at home. But I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $300-400 on the well-known Pibbs brand. This dryer more than met my expectations. I ordered from Mix Wholesale and they were wonderful. It shipped the same day I ordered it and arrived in 3 business days. Setting up the stand was relatively easy. I could have used a small spanner to help tighten the screw, but I managed fine with no tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer head is large and easily fits a full set of large rollers. I love that the heat evenly reaches all parts of the head, even the very back. It has an adjustable temperature gauge (cool - 75 deg.C) and a timer setting (up to 60 minutes). What I really love is how quiet this dryer is! My old tabletop dryer was so loud I worried about disturbing my roommates. But this one is so quiet I can comfortably have a phone conversation while it&#x27;s drying my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary,&lt;br /&gt;Pros: large head, even heat distribution, quiet, low price&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t think of any!&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Loving it!</li>
            <li> This is one powerful hair dryer. The heat can be controlled along with the height and hood position.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together and works well.</li>
            <li> nice to have a timer and to control the heat.  the description didn&#x27;t say how hot it gets but it says 75 Celsius and it was too hot for my girl friend and she has hair that requires a lot of heat.  Easy to put together took less than 5 minutes after unpacking everything. No fan speed on this model.  Also the description said locking wheels when I bought it and it does not have it.  Girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine and that was the whole plan.  Also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder-er to adjust down but you don&#x27;t have to be super strong to do it.  It was easy for me just wanted to mention it because I thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn&#x27;t spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height.</li>
            <li> The dryer is great; great temperature control too and very quiet. This is very important since I live in an apartment.  My only complaint is that the timer should also be quiet. It is constantly ticking (it&#x27;s not loud but you notice) when in use so you hear it especially when you&#x27;re in the dryer. When the dryer is finished it &amp;#34;dings&amp;#34; that it&#x27;s done and it can startle you if you are not expecting it. I just have to get used to the ticking timer but in general I am very happy with the dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 4 of these kind of hair dryer in my life and all of them were good and last me long time! Unfortunately this one is terrible and it only drys the right side of my hair. If I want the left side done I would have to be underneath of it longer and the right side would get burned! Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband put it together and got to use it twice. So far so good, but you do need to be careful so it won&#x27; tip over. It is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad. If I did not hear the ticking I would not know if it was on or not. I can have a conversation with the person sitting under it that&#x27;s how quiet it is and it gets really hot. My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable. For the amount of money I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Hair dryer works just fine as expected.  Order came on time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to make sure all the part are good since one of the wills broken; not a big deal but we are paying for something new, not broken.</li>
            <li> Great product quiet like I&#x27;ve never experienced I forget it&#x27;s on if I walk away from it! Lol&lt;br /&gt;Gets really hot so be careful to adjust or sit low ..best dryer ever and I&#x27;ve owned 7</li>
            <li> The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping. Now! on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord. I contacted the company and they immediately got back to me stating that they would send me another bonnet. Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged. The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed. They replied stating they would send me out another one but I realized that if they couldn&#x27;t get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be. They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products. I&#x27;m very disappointed and would never purchase from this company ever again. Never had an issue like this throughout my years of purchasing items through amazon!</li>
            <li> I love my new dryer.  The only downside is that the timer is so loud that I have to warn my clients about it beforehand so they don&#x27;t freak out when it buzzes.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! It is a bit huge but that is fine because it is used in my basement. It is not overly loud and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift to my mom and she love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I got this one for personal use, and love it. It is very quiet one and nothing missing from a Pibbs one.&lt;br /&gt;I did received one that the button was defective but the customer service help and expedite the process, great outcome.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Put it together. Did not work!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I am totally enjoying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as a mother&#x27;s day present and she absolutely Loves it!  (Just as hot as the salon)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this dryer!! My hair usually takes 45 mins to dry and with my new dryer it takes me 30. It is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast. I would totally recommend this to everyone. It&#x27;s at a good price also.</li>
            <li> Works great arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to setup. Everything was in the box and the directions were easy to follow. I would definitely recommend especially as an investment to save money.</li>
            <li> the first time that arrive came with damages; my husband returned (they ask for pictures and want it to prove that was damage; I did send it) they did not ask if I want the money  back; they just send another one which came ok but is not 5 start product; will do its job but have to treat it  with care; so far I have been using this product like 4 time in one month and seems fine; for the price for me is ok</li>
            <li> I bought this because paying to go get my hair professionally done at a salon was becoming money consuming. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it works great and has definitely saved me money from having to go to the salon. It was very easy to set up and you don&#x27;t even need any tools to do it. I have medium length, curly hair and it takes about an hour to finish drying my hair. I dry at medium-high heat because this hair dryer gets really hot on high and I couldn&#x27;t sit under that high heat for long. If your hair and body can handle the high heat then definitely go for it for faster drying. As for me, I&#x27;ll stick to the medium-high. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save money on their hair!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer  it heats up good and its quiet and it dries your hair fast the best thing i ever brought this dryer is my new baby... lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer! It was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot. I would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Was great while it lasted, but the first time I tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again...and it had been 90 days, so no refund or exchange.</li>
            <li> Some aspects of this hair dryer work well: its adjustable, full sized and has wheels. the plastic top is a bit poorly constructed. I used it once and the mechanism that holds the pieces together (a metal ring) didn&#x27;t hold. I had to fix it with some help. Once assembling, I found that it worked reasonably well - some of the reviews I read indicated that it was too hot; I beg to differ. It gets the job done but I wish I had done a bit more research before settling on this design.</li>
            <li> Perfect salon quality drier!!! It&#x27;s really easy to assemble &amp; to move around. It&#x27;s not noisy at all and does the job really well. Blow drier can be damaging for curly hair specially, so roller setting and drying hair is a great alternative plus you can get so many styles out of it. I just wish I had bought this year&#x27;s ago</li>
            <li> When using this dryer. Please use a industrial extension cord or it will blow the power. I love this dryer, it&#x27;s easy to setup and works as stated.</li>
            <li> This was very easy to assemble.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it works great. It&#x27;s definitely worth it over the table top hair dryers.  Temperature gets very hot and you are able to sit comfortably in any chair with it. I have locs and this is prefect for drying my hair in no longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> I may admit that I was very intimated by this dryer when I unboxed it. It is huge! I though for sure it would overload the circuit breaker. I also didn&#x27;t know what heat setting to put it on as to not fry my hair. It is in Celsius. Once I figured everything out and used it, I was in love. The dryer is very quiet, and it didn&#x27;t overload my circuits. The back of my head gets just as much air as the top, which cuts down on drying time. The stand adjust to fit my height, in a chair... As well as my 6 year old&#x27;s height in the same chair. I don&#x27;t like how squeaky the stand is to adjust, but I can overlook that. Nothing is going to be perfect.... And it doesn&#x27;t take away from the overall performance of the dryer. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This product was a great investment, three clients love it&#x27;s power and heat. I love it. Please buy this product.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this rating is due to the difficulty in putting the pole piece into the plastic height control. It is defective and will not insert.</li>
            <li> This dryer is absolutely the best!!!! It&#x27;s strong, sturdy, and exactly as advertised. It has many different temperature settings which is great for customer preference. I would definitely recommend to friend, family, or salon owner. It was definitely worth every penny. Added bonus the price couldn&#x27;t have been better. It actually shipped out and delivered to me within 3-4 days regular ground delivery. Which is Mich earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer. I liked it so much I purchased a second one! The auto fan is a must have for everyone.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a month now and so far it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Love my new dryer. Much better that the ones I&#x27;ve had before. I like that you can adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> I have a dense head of very curly/kinky hair and this dryer does a great job of getting my strands dry in about an hour. The only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars is that drying the lower back of my head can be an issue, but the mostly requires me to sit an uncomfortable position for about 20 minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer to women who want to speed up the drying process without direct heat, beautiful curls/waves from roller sets, or deep condition their hair back to health.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this items for a long time. Finally,  I found it. It is as described by the seller. It allows my long hair to dry without difficulty.  It is free of noice. The price is excellent and the product is really good</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It dries my hair faster than the many dryers that I have had. The heat is well adjustable for any work.. Air dry or heat dry. The head seems to be a little heavy for the stand but no problem .It takes a little bigger storage space for me&lt;br /&gt; Overall it is a good dryer.I</li>
            <li> Works as it should. I use this dryer from 2-5 times a month without any issue. Would recommend to someone who looking for a good hood dryer without spending so much $$$$.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item last year and used it once. It worked very well. However, I became pregnant and didn&#x27;t have time to focus on my hair. When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke. I tried gluing it together but it didn&#x27;t work. I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while but I guess not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with. Hoping I can find something that will suffice or buy a replacement base. Otherwise, that&#x27;s $104 down the drain. Not cool...</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is awesome, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. This dryer have cut down on the drying process tremendously and I&#x27;m so thankful.</li>
            <li> Terribly convienent especially with the wheels. The only thing I would say is that sometimes it&#x27;s shaky especially if the screw isn&#x27;t put in properly but a great dryer for your hair. Especially with the timer!</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing! It works better than the shop dryers. It&#x27;s super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer..me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t.v. This dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble. The shipping was also awesome it arrived within 3 days from ordering it. I recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  Bought one for my mom too!</li>
            <li> I love It. It&#x27;s quiet , gets really hot , and very adjustable . Honestly a better experience than a salon</li>
            <li> worked out good as a gift, now my gma can have her hair dresser come to her</li>
            <li> These are probably by far the best dryers we have had. They are nice and quiet. They were a great addition to the salon.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, works great. It was scratched on the light colored plastic. It looks like maybe they removed a sticker, it&#x27;s not horrible I just didn&#x27;t expect a new item to be scratched like that. Easy to put together. And after reading reviews before my purchase I will add it did come with the plug in cord. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Im a cosmetologist and I have a 1 chair salon this works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It works well it just too big! I wanted a more space convince dryer but this is big!!</li>
            <li> This is OK for personal use but not a beauty shop.  The extended legs get in the way and is not easy to maneuver.  Heat is OK not real hot.  I would recommend for home use only.</li>
            <li> I ordered as a gift for my mom. She loves it; it really comes in handy. I definitely like that it was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> After reading the good to excellent reviews I purchased the dryer recently.  The delivery was speedy and all the parts were included.  My adult son, who&#x27;s good at assembling things, put it together for me.  I&#x27;m African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  I wasn&#x27;t able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  I&#x27;ll have to call on my son again.  I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  My curls were soft and springy.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> Hair gets dry fast! I have long hair, below my shoulders but above waist.  It takes me 35-40 minutes (I have fine textured hair).  The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  One can literally talk on the phone or what TV while under this dryer.  One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  It works just fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I finally got one of these for home. Works really well, not too loud and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried like a hand-dryer. My only suggestion is getting a weight to add to the base because it can tip over easier than it should.</li>
            <li> i love it but it&#x27;s just so BIG</li>
            <li> All i have to say is very good..</li>
            <li> It drys your hair fast and its not too laud.  Easy to move around if you need to use it anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li> Today,( 3/14/14) that I used my hair dyer, I have to say I just love it. My hair is naturally curly but takes so, long too dry. I have a hand held dyer with the diffueser attchatment an it makes my hair puffy.  I started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick an sufficient an when looking they were really expensive as well as shipping and handling but when I compared on amazon your company caught my eye because on the head of the dyer was elongated and there was zero shipping so, all I paid was 104.00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling. I also colored my hair an I use a heating cap an it does not color my head completely so, this will make for a better job on my color. Thank you so so so so so much......</li>
            <li> I love it the product works great. it is not loud and it gets really hot. It was definitely worth the buy. Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> Good product. Dries my hair rapidly just as I like</li>
            <li> Dryer was a good one but its assembled size was too big for our needs.</li>
            <li> ALL OF MY CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and is do quiet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Working good, I love it!</li>
            <li> This dryer is excellent. It gets hotter then the ones in the salon. Best $104 ever spent. I recommended it to all my friends and fam.</li>
            <li> Love it! My tabletop dryer dried my hair in about an hour and 30 mins.. This takes an hour to dry and is super quiet.i  It is bulky and an eye sore in my bedroom - the old dryer folded and I stored in my closet.  This is too big to fit in there,, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy to assemble (even though the &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; are just pictures) and works great! I have very short 3b hair and I only needed to use the dryer for 10 minutes to completely dry my hair and it looked great!</li>
            <li> Its realy very cheep staf the stand looks going to fail all the material they used cheep.  I saw another one of my family member bougt infact she paid more than i paid i thoug her drier was on sale becouse it said on sale. Ohhh my God it has a big diffrent.if fact there is s good one but i amnt recomed this for any body</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!!!!! I read other ladies who have purchased on Amazon&#x27;s site which is why I purchased this hair dryer. It is absolutely the best!!!! Good Quality...Quiet, and it gets Hot..Hot..Hot!!!!  I am so glad that I have this dryer, it&#x27;s like I have my own salon now! :-)</li>
            <li> Great stand. Movable.Good performance for the price I paid. Not as hot as salon dryers.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.  I got it on time and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like it very nice but the holder is a little bit loose</li>
            <li> As I tolld you before.  This item came broken and had to trash it.  Haven&#x27;t the foggiest if it was any good or not.</li>
            <li> Impressive. I love it. I only used it one time, but it really dries fast. The timer is a plus, the temprature controller is a plus, best of all-it is not noisey.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and I was convinced this wouldn&#x27;t work. I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan. Needless to say, only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan, but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess. So I wanted to try this - especially now that winter is coming. I really don&#x27;t want to leave my house with wet hair. It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy. Its like the heat locks my hair product  [Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Hair Curling Lotion] in place. I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container. I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer and it even dries my hair on the lower settings. My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it&#x27;s pretty huge. Right now, it&#x27;s in the dining room. Other than that, it was worth every penny. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This drier is perfect for what I need.  I can now dry my hair in 10 minutes by just sitting there, instead of 40 minutes with a hand held drier.  It has a temperature control and a timer, but it does not have a switch to control the wind speed, as was listed in the description.  The speed control switch was even on the diagram that came packaged with it, but it was not on the drier.  Despite this, I am keeping the product and am very happy with the results I am getting.  One thing to note is that there is some assembly required for the stand, and there were no instructions included.  I managed to put it together just using the diagram, but if this is not your strong point, enlist help.</li>
            <li> Heats up well and works great. however it does have a burning rubber smell when it&#x27;s on. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it is new or because it&#x27;s not a good product. I did let it run for a few minutes and the smell does not go away.  Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Used this in conjunction with a hair dryer and vacuum cleaner (that can be set to blow)  to steam the knits to death and out of the hair, and then the hair dryer (with multi-pronged attachment) and vacuum cleaner on blow to overdry the living ones to death. Worked much better than any of the medicines we bought, didn&#x27;t have to do it more than a couple 45 minute treatments and all were dead (15 minutes steaming, 30 minutes drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CURE FOR LICE WITHOUT PAYING ARM AND LEG TO COMPANY THAT DOESN&#x27;T WANT TO SELL YOU THEIR $2000 HAIR DRYER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Stingy lice buster people didn&#x27;t want to sell it to me, so I googled the videos, saw what it really did, how the guy said it pumped twice as much air as a hair dryer, bought a vacuum and a hair dryer that could be set to warm/cool, and made my own). Price was under $200 for 3 different items (hair dryer, steam bonnet, heavy duty wet/dry vac that can blow as well as suck)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it took 10 days before I received it. I live in Seattle and it was shipping from Florida, that&#x27;s probably why it seemed like forever waiting but I have no regrets...This hooded dryer is just amazing, I wonder what took me so long! My husband put it together as soon as I received and he did it so fast so am guessing assembling is easy ( I was not there when he did it), I was washing my hair ready to try it out. . The results? Simply beautiful soft hair with curls from my rollers...I&#x27;m excited at finally being able to do it myself and achieving salon results. You can move it around the house and you don&#x27;t need a special chair. I used the middle, yellow settings and it dried my hair okay. The dryer is really quiet  unlike some that are so loud. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  I was a bit leery after reading a few reviews where customers had a hard time contacting the seller or getting satisfaction after receiving defective items but I took a leap of faith since the complaints were few and ordered my dryer.  It came four days early!  Although it came in two separate boxes, installation was a snap even with the minimal directions that were included.  There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  This dryer gets very hot which I love.  I had to lower the thermostat after a few minutes.  The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy but so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  My sister, who has locs, was impressed.  This dryer completely dried her hair in about 30 minutes and she usually has to sit for more than an hour to ensure that her hair is thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> Ver y good I recomendet</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it&#x27;s a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  Thank you, Mix Wholesale, for wasting my time.</li>
            <li> High quality, easy to assemble, adjustable, sturdy base, fast service, highly recommend. I can&#x27;t say the same for this form.</li>
            <li> Excellent. It&#x27;s very easy to put together, it&#x27;s not too loud actually I&#x27;m watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now! The bell is not too loud when the timer is done. The only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking but I&#x27;m used to that from going to the beauty salon it goes unnoticeable. Delivery was quick and swiftly and customer service was excellent. My hair dried very quick and I didn&#x27;t even put it on the max heat. I&#x27;m African American with shoulder length hair 4c and I never had a perm. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price</li>
            <li> Love it. Heats up good. Fast delivery. Easy set up!</li>
            <li> Nice! Bigger than what I thought. I will be ordering another one soon. It is so easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine but I purchased it for a birthday gift and the front flap is cracked. I believed it happened during the shipping,</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very fast drying too.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I thought it would be. It is tremendously quiet and dries on a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting, the highest temperature option is too hot. When you sit to dry your hair, an office chair won&#x27;t do. You must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It Works!! I have been using this for roller sets for over a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer very Quiet</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer ever.  I am so happy I purchased it.  I had one prior to this one that didn&#x27;t get as hot.  Love this because I dont have to stay under the dryer long.</li>
            <li> Great blow head dryer and extremely quiet!</li>
            <li> YO COMPRE ESTO PARA MI HIJA Y LE ENCANTO LE SALVA MUCHO TIEMPO Y DINERO CADA VES QUE ELLA QUIERE HACERCE EL PELO</li>
            <li> Dryer is terrific so far [used twice] - I like the variable heat levels and quietness of the unit.  Although moveable, I find it awkward and feel like it is about to fall over simply because it is so top heavy. I am using for my daughter [7] to speed up her lengthy curl process - She is very comfortable using this.</li>
            <li> wow!!! incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale. I ordered it on Thursday..it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia). put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up! So easy to assemble!! Can&#x27;t wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!! will update again after more use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This dryer is fantastic!! Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes! on medium heat!! I did not need neck covers or ear protectors at all. I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood. It&#x27;s also very quiet--I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television. I haven&#x27;t had to duct tape anything, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I&#x27;m not moving around a lot if I&#x27;m sitting under the dryer anyway..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I love it and I&#x27;m SO GLAD i didn&#x27;t waste my money on a Pibb or PEBCO brand. I don&#x27;t own a salon, but it&#x27;s great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer.</li>
            <li> It can tip over if you are not careful and it is a little bit suffocating-feeling when you put down the visor. It is definitely not for someone afraid of small spaces!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer 3 years ago. It&#x27;s still working and in good condition, I have saved a lot money and trips to the beauty salon. My hair looks healthier after I&#x27;m using it. I recommend this product in 100/%. If I have to buy another one, I&#x27;ll definitively bye this one again. Good quality as the salon type. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the dryer about 9 month ago. It is alway stay at my home in one place. I occasionally used it and never moved it. Now it can not stand anymore. The plastic base and 3 legs are broken. I called the customer service and they said the warranty only for 60 days.</li>
            <li> Great product,very satisfied</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is just what I wanted.  So much better than the soft bonnet dryer I had (had to keep reconnecting the bonnet to the hose).  It also heats consistently, so I am spending less time under a hair dryer because I don&#x27;t have to babysit the bonnet and the hose!  Love it!!!  Delivery was wonderful, got it sooner than promised.  Easy to assemble.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with the product. Seems to be content. Only issue honestly. Easy to install but the instructions are horrible. Could of been done in 5 minutes but was confused with the pole connection. It&#x27;s more than just meeting both parts together. Someone can damage the piece easily.</li>
            <li> Great product, top a little bulky but works really well.</li>
            <li> Just amazing! easy set up,,and it is just absolutely just amazing it gets very hot three seting. And its quite . I was using it one day and my husband came in from work and said &amp;#34; why are you just sitting under that aren&#x27;t you goning  to turn it on&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten one if these years ago!!! I can sit in a chair and watch tv while my hair is drying. The motor is quiet. I know what I&#x27;m getting my daughter for Christmas!! It was very easy to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li> I bought this hooded dryer because I do roller sets &amp; deep conditioning treatments weekly.  At at first, I was really happy with my purchase; the dryer is quiet, and dries my hair quickly.  However, less than 6 months later, the Timer Knob breaks!  I tried super glue, to mend the knob, but that didn&#x27;t work so this dryer is USELESS now.  I cannot set the time/turn it on, without that knob so I can&#x27;t use the dryer.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in the quality item and I basically feel like I threw $100 + in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember if this dryer came with a warranty, but if I could give the Timer knob replaced I would rate this product higher; for now it&#x27;s non-functional.</li>
            <li> Impressed!  At first I thought 1000 watt wouldn&#x27;t do much, but this Bonnet Hood Dryer packs a punch.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and love my results!  This dryer will pay for itself after another 3 uses - so honestly, I feel like I got it for free as I don&#x27;t have to go the salon to get my hair done!  I&#x27;m not saying I won&#x27;t get my hair done professionally but this will definately keep my hair groomed until I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for what you pay, however a few things to know before you purchase this:&lt;br /&gt;1-The hard hat is narrower than those from a salon. I have long curly hair so I need to use 2&amp;#34; rollers to dry my hair straight. More than 12 of those bad boys on your head at once may not fit very well.&lt;br /&gt;2- sometimes I like to dry my hair without rollers for a quick natural look, however this dryer creates a whirlwind vortex that ends up tangling the hair on my crown. So I can&#x27;t use this dryer for that. Such a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;3- it heats up great, does take a while like most others, and sometimes the heat doesn&#x27;t distribute well towards the lower areas.&lt;br /&gt;4-assembly was easy, just be sure to use judgment as the structure is not well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;5- I wouldn&#x27;t use it for commercial use since it&#x27;s very wobbly. But at home in a low traffic area it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer and it provides excellent results very quiet while drying and I can finally watch tv thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent my wife love it, this is one  of the best hair dryer Would live to recommend because is silence and efficient.</li>
            <li> Great heating appliance.  Works great and dries hair quickly.  If you fall asleep under the dryer don&#x27;t worry the timer will wake you up.</li>
            <li> I am a former hair dresser of the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s .All hair services were done with roller sets and a time under a hair dryer.So I feel qualified to rate this dryer. IT ROCKS! The heat and air circulation are great. Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use. The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer. Best of all,its quiet. Instructions for assembly are very vague. Just use your common sense and look at the pictures and you&#x27;ll figure it out. I had mine together and running in about 15 minutes. For the money I don&#x27;t think you could go wrong. The only thing I would change is the plastic legs. But what isn&#x27;t plastic these days? Good buy.</li>
            <li> The dryer came with pieces that didn&#x27;t even fit together to make up the feet of the stand. I ended up gluing the pieces into the bottom of the stand and when I finally put the bonnet onto the stand, five minutes later it toppled over because the stand is so light and the dryer part has some weight to it. it ended up breaking the stands feet. It was a waste of money. I bought a Pibbs and Love it so mucg better.</li>
            <li> so far so good. After reading all of the reviews from previous customers, i wasnt sure what to expect. As of today, everything seems okay.</li>
            <li> Great dryer!!! The directions were not made for people who have no idea what they are doing, so it tooke about a month or so to actually put it together!!  But I got it and I love it. I would just say, put in better instructions to follow.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS DRYER. IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> This dryer arrived fast and was easy to assemble.  It does get hot and I love the timer. I used the dryer for deep conditioning treatments which leaves my hair super soft. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a good moible dryer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for too long but so far I&#x27;m really happy with it. There was an issue with my original unit but the seller immediately sent me a replacement and so far I haven&#x27;t had an problems. It usually takes me an hour and a half to dry my natural 3c-4a hair but this only took about 45mins.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this dryer is that the long metal pole connecting to the hood. The round piece around the metal pole is cracked!!!  Trying to figure out how I can find a better solution then this plastic piece around the metal pole.</li>
            <li> This product delivered in just a few days, which was great... However, It does not blow hard at all. I would have like to see a HIGH and LOW option but it doesn&#x27;t have it. It gets the job done. But its just not quite the quality I was looking for. **Service was great though!!</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this is that it has a whirlwind that make it hard to dry hair and the (whirlwind causes hair to spin and tangle).&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that it drys quick and is quiet</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DRYER!!! Salon worthy rollersets every time!  Gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly. Quite enough that you can hear the tv and have a conversation on the phone. Fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers okay. Its a tight fit BUT it DOES fit.</li>
            <li> More money makes for a better upgrade.</li>
            <li> professional grade in my home!!</li>
            <li> First of all, item arrived on time. Packaging was good. Assembling was easy-all items were present.&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer works great- my wife loves it. Although she has only used it  few times, it works just perfect for her thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very gentle on your hair.  No more heat damaged hair. In 5 to 10 minutes your hair is dry with curlers or without.</li>
            <li> Very nice dryer. It dries quickly and thoroughly. If it had a fan blower adjustment I would have given it 5 stars. It gets really hot!</li>
            <li> Shipment was missing a piece. It took forever for them to figure out what piece i was missing. Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town. Apparently they overlooked that part of the email. Hopefully they sent the right piece. This review is based on the customer service, not on whether the product works well.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Gets hot and works perfectly. The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage. I&#x27;m in love 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> The dryer works well. The only problem I must say about this product is that the instructions is horrible. The instructions is so bad to the point they shouldn&#x27;t even include it in the package. It took me literally 2 hours to put the dryer together since the instructions wasn&#x27;t clear enough. There&#x27;s no steps just a picture explaining how the dryer suppose to look. Other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  was exactly like the picture.  Easy to put together and it&#x27;s quiet you can barely hear it running.  Mines did come without the screw but I contacted the seller and they quickly sent the parts. So overall it&#x27;s a pretty good dryer and works great! Gets the job done, very good buy!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! Perfect size for my house, no noise &amp; dries my hair just right. Best item I bought on amazon thus far.</li>
            <li> This dryer came sooner than i ecpected.  I was suprised when i opened my door, couldnt wait to get it in an open.  So far ive used the dryer about 4 times, once on my own hair and 3 times on clients.  The dryer is wonderful, very, very quiet lol, my husband an kids where watching a movie when i used the dryer and my husband had to double check to see if the dryer was acutally on. I love the dryer!! It gets very very hot too, and the setting is so easy to control and easily change the temp.  Putting together was a breeze, well my husband assemble it in like 10mins max.  There is only one thing that kind of bother me, there is a spring on the inside of the pole the balances the heights when adjusting the dryer height i guess, but i just know that everytime i let the dryer up or down that spring noise gets to me a lil&#x27; but other than that, its definately a great buy for price.  I will update my review in 6mths.</li>
            <li> This styling hood is absolutely amazing! The problem that most dryers have is that the air flow doesn&#x27;t circulate to the nape of the head. The heat is always concentrated on the top of the head, so the back takes extremely long to dry; But not this dryer!!! :) The air flows in a circular motion and the way it&#x27;s angled, it has no choice but to dry the hair evenly. which cuts down on time! How awesome is that? This is like heaven to a client and a stylist&#x27;s pirspective b/c no client likes sitting up under a hot dryer for long and stylists can get their clients in and out! :) the icing on the cake is that the dryer is extremely quiet! ugh! Dryer Perfection! lol Buy this dryer!!! It came in 3 days I believe and I&#x27;m 100% completely happy with my dryer!</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose. Wish the heat came out with more force so I wouldn&#x27;t have to stay under so long.</li>
            <li> Great machine.. It gets extremely hot, but it&#x27;s what I prefer.</li>
            <li> Item came missing the connecting screw. Still waiting for someone to get back to me. One more business day and I&#x27;m going to request a refund and return.</li>
            <li> I love having it, I can eat breakfast, read, etc while it does the job. I have curly hair that doesn&#x27;t need styling, just drying.  Certainly beats standing with a hand held, or taking 5 hours to air dry for a client meeting.  I&#x27;m happy with the results, not many options for a product like this, and didn&#x27;t want to spend more money.  I would give 5 stars but for the iffy construction. The pole/raising lowering mechanism seem cheap, concerned they won&#x27;t last.  The unit is very top heavy.  Even though the base is very wide, it&#x27;s not heavy enough to  keep it stable.  It hasn&#x27;t fallen over, but it always feels like it&#x27;s about to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used product once and so far, I have no complaints. Dries hair like it suppose to. Other than the timer being way too loud when it goes off, I have no complaints. I&#x27;ve read several comments before purchasing, especially the part about missing parts upon arrival. So when mine arrived, I couldn&#x27;t find the main bolt that keeps the feet on. Little to my surprise, the bolt was already screwed on the bottom of the stick. So I was pleased and still am. Like I said no complaints so far and this was very good investment.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer on November 16, 2014 (Sunday) and got it on November 21, 2014 (Friday). I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing the dryer to give it time to settle. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS/CONS&lt;br /&gt;1. Setup was easy (took about 10 minutes) and very similar to the set up of my hair steamer.&lt;br /&gt;2. The base is very wide to help support the weight of the dryer which I personally think does a great job. I keep mine stationary in a corner (pictured) so I don&#x27;t have much experience with moving it around. It feels pretty sturdy though.&lt;br /&gt;3. The enclosure of the dryer is made of hard plastic. It probably wouldn&#x27;t survive a hard fall so keep it safe and upright.&lt;br /&gt;4. Although the dryer comes with one fan speed, it is VERY quiet on the outside. Underneath the dryer is a little loud, but you can still carry on a conversation over the phone or watch things on your PC/TV.&lt;br /&gt;5. The dryer comers with various temperature controls that are listed in Celsius, not Fahrenheit, which is a little inconvenient. However, a quick Google search can easily help you figure it.&lt;br /&gt;6. The air circulates by a big fan at the top. I believe this machine uses convection heat transfer which is good for moisture retention and drying things evenly. Because of this design, hair in the crown of the head can come out looking lifted (sticks up) due to the suction created by the convection current.&lt;br /&gt;7. The timer has startled me once or twice when going off and is a tad bit loud. The timer isn&#x27;t crazy loud, but once you zone out and forget about it the &#x27;ding&#x27; sound can be startling.&lt;br /&gt;8. After owning this machine for 4 months I have noticed the heat has become a bit uneven sometimes. Sometimes the right side will feel cooler than the left side. And sometimes the whole thing will feel cooler than it did last time you used it. Then sometimes you can really notice the heating element turn on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Thoughts on the Effect of the Salon Sundry Professional Bonnet Style Hood Dryer&lt;br /&gt;About my hair: My natural hair is very dense (pictured below) and is 4A coily. It&#x27;s about 10-12 inches in length stretched. It takes a lot of water to &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34; it and a lot of product to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dryer mainly to dry my wash n go&#x27;s (I use gel on wet hair) and it all fits comfortably under the hood. I use it about 1-2 times a week unless my hair is in cornrows. At 60-65oC (140-149oF) it takes about 30-40 minutes to fully dry my hair. I typically do 20 minutes (gets my hair about 85-90% dry), shake my hair out, fluff it while feeling for wet areas, and sit under the dryer for another 10-20 minutes as needed. I normally keep the temp. at 65oC, but I&#x27;ve used it at 66-70oC (151-158oF) with the latter shaving off about 10 minutes of drying time. The problem I have--and probably my biggest complaint--with this dryer is that though the air circulates, it does so poorly (IMHO). The poor circulation plus the occasional uneven heating leaves parts of my hair wet still. Around the front left side, the right side, the crown (at the roots), and the nape dry poorly. It can be very frustrating when I do my hair before bed as I have to wait. It&#x27;s even more alarming when I have to stay under the heat to dry those spots while the rest of my hair is already dry and being exposed to unnecessary heat. It DOES get the job done eventually and I&#x27;m always grateful for the time that it saves me, but it&#x27;s such a pain haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great dryer. I bought a cheap $40 dryer from Sally&#x27;s and took it back two days later because it was horribly loud and didn&#x27;t do the job. I bought this dryer the same night of the return and glad I did. It&#x27;s been well worth the money. This dryer is silent, gets hot, and does the job in an hour or less. It was a great buy and I&#x27;d do it over again. Hopefully it&#x27;ll last me for at least a year with no problems!pictured below) and is 4A coily. It&#x27;s about 10-12 inches in length stretched.

            <li> dryer itself works good, however i am already wrapping duct tape around the twist mechanism that allows the stand to go up and down....its cracked, first day of use, I should send it back but I need the dryer now</li>
            <li> Works great cools itself Down would buy again</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE! I bought 2 for a new salon and both broke within a few uses. One the legs broke and are unable to be pieced together. The other seemed too heavy and toppled over on a client. I contacted them and they have been no help. I will never purchase from MIX Wholesale ever again. If I could rate zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Nice and hot!!!! Easy to  put together!</li>
            <li> Great dryer, Dries my curly hair on big rollers in 40 minutes!  That is at 60 •c, which is between yellow and red on the heat setting controll....Just have to find the proper chair to sit under it:)</li>
            <li> I put this together in about 15 minutes.  Heat is sufficient but not as hot as salon dryers, air blower is a little lower than what I would prefer but its also quieter so I guess its a trade off.  All in all Iike the product very much.</li>
            <li> A non working product. Just west of time and energy. Well they refund my money but I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the dryer for about two weeks but so far so good . Better instructions for the assembly of the item would be nice . Also as noted in other reviews, the lid for where you stick your head under is plastic , so be gentle with it as it is fragile .The dryer is top heavy so make sure is stable when in use . My friend and I used it about four times already and it seems good . Overall, I love it !</li>
            <li> I have very long (to my butt), fine, wavy hair. Being Dominican, I remember going to the salon every Saturday morning since I was 10 with my mother so that we could pay 20-30 dollars for our \\&quot;lady\\&quot; to blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a few years (I&#x27;m 30 now): I work full time, am married, AND went back to school. So, I don&#x27;t have time to go to the salon and sit there for hours until my hair gets blown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, with my hair, all I have to do are rollers and sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and boom...no salon, nice waves, better than blown out! Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looove that the dryer has a timer, which means I don&#x27;t have to watch the clock constantly. The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer. It&#x27;s not very loud at all, which I also like. Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob, right? Not with this one! I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I&#x27;m done. Some people may not be used to his, but it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do rollers, I only use the Jumbo/Extra Large ones all around my head. Even so, I&#x27;m STILL able to fit under and inside  the bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star b/c it was a bit challenging putting it together. The materials seem a bit cheap, but overall, the dryer gets very hot, is not noisy, and makes it look like I went to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy, great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least 5 times in the 3 weeks since I bought it! Arrived via FedEx two days after I ordered it, very easy to assemble and operate. Highly recommended styling tool, particularly for natural hair wearers, or at home hair style mavens. My friend in the military posted overseas swears by hers! Offers high heat or cool temperatures, and has a built in timer. Easy to move around as needed. Would totally buy again!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing professional hair dryer!!! I brought this dryer for my sister as a Christmas present 2014 and she was overjoyed!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer!  I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny!  My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn&#x27;t find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I&#x27;ve had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!</li>
            <li> the quality of this dryer is outstanding! I will save alot of money and time doing my hair with this equipment without the need of the salons...A+😉</li>
