            <li>Super site to shop at.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling, cool soothing action of the conditoner.</li>
            <li>Avlon products do exactly what they claim to do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for dry, itchy scalp for the last couple of decades and this product is probably the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>conditioner is a bit better, but mineral oil is pretty high up on the list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and the conditioner is very milky which I like because it penitrates through my thick coils.</li>
            <li>Gave my hair a healthy and natural shine.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many hair products recently and I was sceptical, but gave it a try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently in surgical menopause and don&#x27;t need any more hormonal disruptions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her scalp issues cleared up 100% after the first use.</li>
            <li>was also causing my scalp to dry out more).  </li>
            <li>First time trying this product; it came highly recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li>It smells like straight up chemicals.</li>
            <li>ARrived fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>but I think I should start because I really find them helpful.</li>
            <li>It really helped my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>and it controls itch very well.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is my favorite because it is super hydrating to my relaxed thick hair.</li>
            <li>Acute formaldehyde exposure, even in small amounts, can cause irritation of the skin and respiratory system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mineral oil coats your skin, kind of like a plastic, and inhibits normal skin function, like releasing waste products and absorbing natural moisture.  </li>
            <li>I normally use it once a week otherwise my scalp is back itchy and full of dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I had high expectations for it.  </li>
            <li>This is because of the high number of allergic reactions to PABA.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and managable and the shampoo cleans really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do a lot of reviews</li>
            <li>My mom told me about a new hair product she uses called Wen</li>
            <li>But I live in the desert</li>
            <li>Leaves my half manageable and soft and has proven to be an effective treatment for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now near the end of the month</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now near the end of the month</li>
            <li>I use them on my relaxed hair and daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have excema and its caused the back of my head to scab and be really itchy.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Head and Shoulders or Selsun Blue and really did not stop my scalp itching (which is the reason that I purchased it).</li>
            <li>I was washing my natural hair every four days.</li>
            <li>You need to leave it in for at least 20 min to get the full effect, but after washing it out it feels really silky!</li>
            <li>I have dandruff constantly and have noticed that it has cut down significantly since I started using this product about a month ago.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month for a very stubborn patch of dry, irritated skin on the front of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>This Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp shampoo and conditioner works very well for me.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works very well for dry, ithch scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister, she loves it and says it manages her dry scalp/dandruff very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently in school for mortuary science and have just finished my OSHA training for formaldehyde standards, and I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I DON&#x27;T want something like this in my hair and on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly thick and it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t leaving it on long enough, as the shampoo says to leave on for 5 minutes and the conditioner says to leave on for 15 minutes, but after I switched up my routine and started washing my hair at night to let the shampoo and conditioner work for the recommended time, I&#x27;ve developed a burning sensation.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I followed directions to the T.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards my hair was a mess, dry brittle, really</li>
            <li> Right after using it, my scalp felt really clean, scent wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> It definitely controls her dry and itchy scalp and penetrates the scalp leaving that healing sensation.</li>
            <li> I follow up with the foam wrap lotion and use dry scalp moisturizer to keep my dandruff in check all week long.</li>
            <li> And the conditioner leaves my hair feeling extremely stripped and dry though I only put it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Oh and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair dry.</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff and itchy scalp and dry patches in his hair.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with dry and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has had issues with dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> But my flakes would still be in my hair after i would wash and blow dry.....</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it really stops the flaking and nasty itchying....</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t seen a single flake or felt an itch.may have carcinogenic properties.  </li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t seen a single flake or felt an itch.</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair it feels so silky!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very dry here which is a factor as well.</li>
            <li> It really has helped my dandruff, I haven&#x27;t been to the doctor to know if its really that bad.</li>
            <li> I have thick and coarse hair along with dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Now I am back to strictly using keracare, no more sampling other products for me.</li>
            <li> Ever since my hair dresser introduced this to me, I have noticed it helps to cut down on the flaking of my scalp (along with stopping my relaxers, which I discovered</li>
            <li> and now I wash my hair every week and a half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tight, it&#x27;s irritated, and it&#x27;s flaky.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair feels really light.</li>
            <li> Ever since my hair dresser introduced this to me, I have noticed it helps to cut down on the flaking of my scalp (along with stopping my relaxers, which I discovered was also causing my scalp to dry out more).  I love the tingling, cool soothing action of the conditoner. It would be better if it weren&#x27;t so expensive, though. Otherwise, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product; it came highly recommended by a friend. I have tried so many hair products recently and I was sceptical, but gave it a try anyway and I absolutely love it. Now I am the one recommending it.</li>
            <li> Feb 14&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month for a very stubborn patch of dry, irritated skin on the front of my scalp.  It&#x27;s tight, it&#x27;s irritated, and it&#x27;s flaky.  This product had only good reviews so I had high expectations for it.  My scalp has become worse and the flakiness is starting to creep down to my forehead.  I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t leaving it on long enough, as the shampoo says to leave on for 5 minutes and the conditioner says to leave on for 15 minutes, but after I switched up my routine and started washing my hair at night to let the shampoo and conditioner work for the recommended time, I&#x27;ve developed a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the ingredient list out of curiosity and found some disturbing info.  Listed on the shampoo is DMDM Hydantoin, a preservative that releases formaldehyde.  I&#x27;m currently in school for mortuary science and have just finished my OSHA training for formaldehyde standards, and I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I DON&#x27;T want something like this in my hair and on my scalp.  Acute formaldehyde exposure, even in small amounts, can cause irritation of the skin and respiratory system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo also contains Cocomide DEA, a chemical known to disrupt hormones and increase your risk for kidney and liver cancer.  No thank you.  I&#x27;m currently in surgical menopause and don&#x27;t need any more hormonal disruptions.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains fragrance and blue dye, which can cause skin irritation or allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a bit better, but mineral oil is pretty high up on the list of ingredients.  Mineral oil coats your skin, kind of like a plastic, and inhibits normal skin function, like releasing waste products and absorbing natural moisture.  The conditioner also contains PABA and fragrance.  You&#x27;ve probably noticed many sunscreens say \\&quot;PABA free\\&quot; on the label.  This is because of the high number of allergic reactions to PABA.  There is also some developing research indicating PABA may have carcinogenic properties.  Of course I&#x27;ve already mentioned fragrance can be an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, needless to say, these products are out of here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE (Feb 26th)***&lt;br /&gt;After my frustration with this product, I tried a little home remedy of 25% vegetable glycerin and 75% distilled water.  I misted it on the trouble spot after showering and in 2 days it was gone.  It&#x27;s now near the end of the month and I still haven&#x27;t seen a single flake or felt an itch.may have carcinogenic properties.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it. I have dandruff and this leaves my hair with bounce and body. I love the way the conditioner tingles</li>
            <li> I must say, I have a love/hate relationship with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love: It works! My scalp does not itch anymore and I&#x27;m flake free. Also enjoy the tingling sensation from the product :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hate: The smell, ugh. It smells like straight up chemicals. And the conditioner leaves my hair feeling extremely stripped and dry though I only put it on my scalp. Even if I try putting my deep conditioner on after rinsing out the Keracare conditioner, it still feels massively dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, basically the product works, but I have to cut back on the conditioner, only using it once a week. The shampoo does a pretty good job though, still no itching or dandruff though I don&#x27;t always use the conditioner.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing on my hair.. glad I was able to find at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter. It definitely controls her dry and itchy scalp and penetrates the scalp leaving that healing sensation.</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels really clean and tingly as you are washing your hair. The conditioner is also very good!! You need to leave it in for at least 20 min to get the full effect, but after washing it out it feels really silky!</li>
            <li> I have the driest, hair and scalp after a few shampoos and conditioning the dryness is down to a minimum and my hair is softening! Love this duo ; )</li>
            <li> ARrived fast and packaged well. Love the keracare hairline. I have many products and all are great. I use them on my relaxed hair and daughter&#x27;s natural hair. I have moderate dandruff and I love how this cleanses my hair and scalp. Not to mention how cool my scalp feels. Oh and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair dry. The conditioner has the same cooling effect. It&#x27;s not overly thick and it spreads easily. Very moisturizing. I follow up with the foam wrap lotion and use dry scalp moisturizer to keep my dandruff in check all week long.</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff and itchy scalp and dry patches in his hair.  (He&#x27;s going to kill me if he ever reads this!)  Anyway, he&#x27;s tried every dandruff/itchy scalp product out there, and nothing ever works.  It might ease some of his problems a little bit, but nothing took it away.  UNTIL I bought this duo for him to try.  He has not had anymore problems anymore.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd batch of ordering this and will continue to do so coz&#x27; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has a cooling and soothing effect and it helps relieve my itchy scalp when nothing else helps.</li>
            <li> Love these products !!!</li>
            <li> Keracare Dry&amp;Itchy scalp moisturizing shampoo and conditioner works great. Controlled my dandruff and itchy scalp. Would recommend. Will order larger size next time.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing. I am absolutely pleased with this duo. I have suffered for years with dry and itchy scalp. I could wash my hair and the very next day it is awful itchy. So when i tried the dynamic duo i paid close attention to when the itching would start. To my surprise it didnt. I am going on week two with no wash and still no itching.  I wash once a week but was sick last week and  didnt wash. I love love love this amazing duo.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have excema and its caused the back of my head to scab and be really itchy. It looks like a bad case of dandruf.  Since using this product it has eliminated that. Smells like chemicals but it works so I can stand that.</li>
            <li> These products are great for itchy scalp.  I have noticed a significant difference in the condition of my scalp since using this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my half manageable and soft and has proven to be an effective treatment for my dry scalp. Shipment was prompt.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Makes hair feel smooth and silky. Aids in moisture and reduces itchiness and dryness of scalp . The product was delivered within the projected period also, good service.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is no longer available where I purchased it.  I love the feel of the conditioner on your scalp when you first apply the product.  Makes hair soft and managable and the shampoo cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was doubtful, once I tried the shampoo and conditioner I was amazed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do a lot of reviews but I think I should start because I really find them helpful. I LOVE this product. I have dandruff constantly and have noticed that it has cut down significantly since I started using this product about a month ago. I actually purchased it at a beauty supply store and they didn&#x27;t have the conditioner so I bet my experience would be even greater if I had that. I&#x27;ve been washing weekly with this, then with the Keracare Moisturizing/Detangling Shampoo and then following with the Humecto Conditioner. Hair comes out soft, clean, and feeling great! I&#x27;m a definite fan.</li>
            <li> I have been using Avalon products for over 20 years This Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp shampoo and conditioner works very well for me. It&#x27;s soothing, but not over drying to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Keracare line. The shampoo is prep for the conditioner. They are both medicated. The conditioner is my favorite because it is super hydrating to my relaxed thick hair. When I blow dry my hair it feels so silky!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Smell great and make my hair very soft, silky, and manageable. Would like to order serum if you have any</li>
            <li> The product works great and gets rid of dandruff.  It is rather expensive for 8 oz bottles but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I have seborrheic dermatitis I used this once and I&#x27;ve been flake free ever sense</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has had issues with dandruff and dry scalp. Her scalp issues cleared up 100% after the first use. I wish that I had known about this sooner.</li>
            <li> Love it! It really helped my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo and cooling conditioner. Worked right away and my dandruff and itchy scalp has gone away! I&#x27;ll be using these products for life!</li>
            <li> Great products at a great price online. These are some of the best hair products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months to get rid of my flakes and itchy scalp and it works, it won&#x27;t solve your hair issue in a wk but after a couple of wks you WILL see a difference. My mom told me about a new hair product she uses called Wen and she wanted me to try it,horrible idea!!! After 2wks of Wen(almond mint) my itchy and flaky scalp that I made go away with keracare came back with a vengeance.I even tried the tea tree Wen that is suppose to be for itchy scalp. Now I am back to strictly using keracare, no more sampling other products for me.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Head and Shoulders or Selsun Blue and really did not stop my scalp itching (which is the reason that I purchased it).</li>
            <li> I had been using these product&#x27;s for more them 5 months and is excellent stops dam drop and also prevents hair from falling, good for dermatitis skin condition.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will order it again. Will reccommend it to my family and friends. Super site to shop at.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans my hair throughly and relieved my itchy scalp, but the smell is unpleasant and it leaves my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> Burned my scalpe.  It was very painful.  And it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for dry, itchy scalp for the last couple of decades and this product is probably the best I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ll probably buy the shampoo again.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for years and have been completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!! I have thick and coarse hair along with dry itchy scalp. I hade been diagnosed with dermatitis in the past but not in my scalp area. So before I ran back to the dermatologist my bestfriend and hair stylist told me to try this. She recommends you let the shampoo sit in your hair for a little while as well as the conditioner. I normally use it once a week otherwise my scalp is back itchy and full of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. It smells wonderful and the conditioner is very milky which I like because it penitrates through my thick coils. Hopefully I will get to the point that I can last 2 weeks before a washing. But I live in the desert so it&#x27;s very dry here which is a factor as well. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> No flaking and no itch!</li>
            <li> The products are working for an itchy scalp, will order again.</li>
            <li> It really has helped my dandruff, I haven&#x27;t been to the doctor to know if its really that bad. But my flakes would still be in my hair after i would wash and blow dry.....and my friend would have to scratch it out. I was washing my natural hair every four days. This product is amazing it really stops the flaking and nasty itchying....I have to buy this by the bulk and now I wash my hair every week and a half.</li>
            <li> Works great to relieve itchy scalp. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my hair and severely dry scalp. Helped relieve the itch.  Gave my hair a healthy and natural shine.</li>
            <li> This product does so much for more hair.  It stops the itchness and takes away the dryness.  I also love the smell and the way it makes my scalp tingles.  Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> BEST SHAMPOO EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO GLAD I FOUND THIS ON AMAZON TOOK ALL THE ITCH AWAY!! AND I HAD IT SOOOOOO BAD AND THIS WORKED . I MENTIONED IT TO MY MOM AND SHE LOVES IT TOO. TOOK FLAKES AWAY AND COULD WEAR CLOTHES WITHOUT ALWAYS LOOKING AT MY SHOULDERS SEEING SNOW AS I CALL IT.</li>
            <li> Avlon products do exactly what they claim to do!</li>
            <li> The shampoo works very well for dry, ithch scalp.The flakes on my scalp are gone on the same day I used the product. The conditioner gives very minty and refreshing sensation. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird but I feel like my scalp felt more itchy after using it. My daughter had the same experience. Right after using it, my scalp felt really clean, scent wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I followed directions to the T.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards my hair was a mess, dry brittle, really nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love these products!</li>
            <li> Amazing amount of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; for natural hair styles and it controls itch very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, she loves it and says it manages her dry scalp/dandruff very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working out fine. However, the next time I think I&#x27;ll order a product that combines both the shampoo and conditioner. It will save time.</li>
