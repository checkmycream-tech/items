            <li>It took about 3/4 weeks to see good results but it worked.   </li>
            <li>Never had good eyelashes in my life, unless they were glued on, until I began using this product.  </li>
            <li>Good Luck to all of you.</li>

            <li>Alot of peole in my family have been very pleased with lilash results as well.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It works fantastic!!</li>
            <li>My lashes have lengthened, darkened, curled and filled in beautifully.</li>
            <li>Make sure to take \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture, and take again after each month to see the result!</li>
            <li>To my surprise it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>They DEFINATELY started to curl, which was amazing.</li>
            <li>Results are quite amazing, however, you do have to keep using it to maintain.</li>
            <li>well, like AMAZINGLY well).</li>
            <li>It is truly an amazing product that does what it claims to.  </li>
            <li>and my eyelashes STILL look amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Truth In Aging really liked [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>But.. the thing is, I honestly would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Also when I apply it, my skin is kind a itchy...</li>
            <li>They truly cannot believe they are my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I received the product in it&#x27;s original packaging in great condition and the delivery time was just a couple of days after placing my order.</li>
            <li>I had to order 2 more bottles for girl friends of mine because after seeing my beautiful lashes they were true believers.</li>
            <li>LiLash is by far the best product I have used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful, natural way to get longer lashes.</li>
            <li>I know that these side affects may not be experienced by everyone, but they bothered me to the point where I didnt think the increase in my lashes were worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An excellent value for the price and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Will give it more time.  </li>
            <li>but this made them even more longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Have tried many things over the years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Quite pleased.</li>
            <li>My lashes are stronger, longer, thicker and healthy.  </li>
            <li>improvements I am pleased with.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are stronger and longer than ever :) I trimmed the tips twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others for more money that did nothing.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be without this stuff that&#x27;s for sure....      </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The best surprise is that without mascara, I can actually see some eyelashes, when before they were invisible.</li>
            <li>but that is ok.</li>
            <li>My lashes are more sparse and are falling out.  </li>
            <li>I love Lilash.  </li>
            <li>LiLash worked better for me.  </li>
            <li>And I love having fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li>For those who gave this product a 1 Star who had no reactions, give the product more time to work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been diligently using this for about 4 months now and my lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wear mascara most days</li>
            <li>I am so pleased w/ this product.  </li>
            <li>I give 5 stars because it gives results to both my daughter and me and we are satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with the results and the side effects were very mild and almost non existent now after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li>My daughter too has had incredible results, although initially she scoffed that a product could do this.  </li>
            <li>They are about triple the original length and more volumized.</li>
            <li>I could easily go without mascara now if I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This seller was great, love the product and will continue to look back at what the seller has to offer.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to use and does not irritate eyes.  </li>
            <li>A high-end mascara could be a better investment depending on your natural lash length (DiorShow is good).</li>
            <li>and it has been fine since.  </li>
            <li>After using it for the 90-day initial period I had great lashes, but when I quit using it altogether my lashes fell out again.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I stopped to use the product and began to search the relevant reports.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are naturally light</li>
            <li>BUT IT GOT SUCH GREAT REVIEWS THAT I HAD TO TRY IT.</li>
            <li>Other people would probably be OK with that though, especially if it&#x27;s important for their career</li>
            <li>I saw results in exactly 4 weeks!!  </li>
            <li>This is totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>After faithfully using this product as instructed for over 3 weeks now, I have not seen a significant change in my lashes.</li>
            <li>But to me, it&#x27;s worth it because I have struggled all my life with my lashes!</li>
            <li>I wear contacts, as do two of my girlfriends who I&#x27;ve brought over to the Lilash side of the force, and all three of us are happy and long lashed!</li>
            <li>and wow am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>My advice is to make sure you read the fine print on the return policy of where you buy LiLash from, so if you do have problems with it, you will be able to get your money back.</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the side effect of this product which I do see as a good thing because it does make it look like your wearing eyeliner too, for me it did make my eyes itchy and red for awhile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping if I use it for the whole time frame, I&#x27;ll have more luck.</li>
            <li>I stopped using a lash curler at about week 6 as they have developed their own curl.  </li>
            <li>i hope everyone enjoys this product as much as i do, once my tube is out i will no doubt be purchasing more LiLash.</li>
            <li>Most of the reactions are from people who use too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>but no bad side effects either.  </li>
            <li>I have had NO bad reactions and NO color changes.</li>
            <li>23 people reported irritation and itchiness of some sort, ranging from mild to so severe that they had to stop using the products.   </li>
            <li>It does not work that quickly.  </li>
            <li>It took about 4 weeks or so to see noticeable results and my eyelashes have only gotten better and better.</li>
            <li>I have one more part of my body back, one more thing that does not remind me of cost of cancer.  </li>
            <li>After reviewing many other similar products, this one is the best and within reasonable price range.</li>
            <li>I made my purchase after reading several reviews here and on makeupalley, and I&#x27;ve experienced pretty much every side effect (with the exception of pigment change).</li>
            <li>I have only been using LiLash for a month, but am already seeing amazing results.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like much</li>
            <li>17 people saw an increase in eyelash length and thickness, didn&#x27;t have any trouble, and were generally happy with their results.   </li>
            <li>and my lashes look fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the risks and money?</li>
            <li>Lilash has made my own lashes come back in thicker</li>
            <li>May not be worth it at all.</li>
            <li>I have watched utube videos and reread the directions making sure I don&#x27;t apply directly on my lash line.  </li>
            <li>the kind that make me try on several pairs of sunglasses before finding a pair that my eyelashes wouldn&#x27;t bang into and give me a headache.</li>
            <li>I had eyelash extensions, which were a total waste of money and to be honest, not that great.</li>
            <li>I am deployed to Iraq right now</li>
            <li>The results are pretty amazing, my lashes grew an extra 2-3 mm!</li>
            <li>It is the most amazing product I have ever used, I was soo skeptical of it ,but it  does everything it says and more.</li>
            <li>What did grow, grew in nice and long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the itching to get the better results and to save the extra money.  </li>
            <li>However, a cousin in her very late 60&#x27;s started using the product and her lashes are currently incredible.........</li>
            <li>Not truly believing that this would work, I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>This is the first eyelash growth formula that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve been using Lilash now for almost six months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently before bed and started to see results after six weeks, after eight weeks</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I only apply it once a day and have had no side effects with it.  </li>
            <li>but i can tell you LiLash made my eyelashes SO much longer!</li>
            <li>;)ey?</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>The first week</li>
            <li>Be willing to hang in there.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.)    </li>
            <li>Okay, here is my 11/11 update,  almost 1 and 1/2 years later.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Lilash for 6 weeks and have followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Overall I am ok with the results given the price and</li>
            <li>My lashes do not appear to be thicker just overall better conditioned, not as brittle.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back to using the Maybelline Great Lash #you know the one in the pink container#</li>
            <li>If I had applied it regularly, I&#x27;d probably be raving about it like others who&#x27;ve had successful results, but what happens if I already have long lashes</li>
            <li>I had previously tried Revitalash and had way better results!  </li>
            <li>At first my eyes were super sensitive to it, but they dont deny this in the warnings so i kept with it.</li>
            <li>, I may try other eyelash growth stimulators and see if I would get the same great results to ease on my wallet.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so much fuller now and SO much longer!</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say that I wasnt really in the market for an eyelash enhancer when I bought this.</li>
            <li>Works better than I could imagine and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It was never really painful just itchy, but come on what do you expect, your appying this DIRECTLY to your eyelid pretty much.</li>
            <li>If you have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>At long last, I don&#x27;t need to use all that eyeliner and mascara to look good --</li>
            <li>and I certainly see improvement.</li>
            <li>so I thought if only this product will do half of what it says  I will be happy .</li>
            <li>It does cause mild irritation but only right after application.</li>
            <li>and it does really work people</li>
            <li>It makes the eyelash feel thicker and more brittle and harder to pull.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been just plucking them, although that really hurts</li>
            <li>My eyelashes grew longer and I absolutely noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>This is  not a scientific study, but it is real users reporting their results.   </li>
            <li>I think perhaps I was expecting too much</li>
            <li>It worked really fast for me</li>
            <li>and I really regret using it.  </li>
            <li>The more I use the product, the more lush and thick they become.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>so i cant really tell you if the product made my eyes darker</li>
            <li>so i never really wear mascara (just more of a pain)</li>
            <li>and it really does make your lashes grow thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li>It took about 6 weeks to really notice.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m done with the whole bottle?</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are thicker and much longer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It took way too much time and energy to get this issue resolved -- I WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THE PRODUCT - my neighbor uses it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really evaluate the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>I received the product in quite fast delivery, and immediately tried it on.</li>
            <li>I follow the instructions very closely.  </li>
            <li>I just want to make it clear that I wasn&#x27;t able to apply the product as regularly as I would like to</li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday sometimes twice a day, it just kind of depends.</li>
            <li>I agree that the older you are, results may be slower and more limited.  </li>
            <li>Changed my light blue eyes to a dark blue/green with mostly brown throughout.  </li>
            <li>One report which is helpful to me is that many women made complaints on this product is due to incorrect use.  </li>
            <li>The results, though slow at first, are absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Last year at Christmas time, I noticed that her lashes were really long and questioned what kind of mascara she was using.  </li>
            <li>I have used Revitalash in the past with NO side effects and got amazing results.  </li>
            <li>As for myself, I changed my goal of having long lashes to having healthy lashes and went back to cheap, natural ingredients of old.</li>
            <li>I actually have a full set of eyelashes now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true -- they are actually thicker, fuller, and longer.  </li>
            <li>I have very light skin, and blue eyes and haven&#x27;t noticed any lasting eyelid or iris</li>
            <li>The only side effects I experienced were a little itching at first, and red eye lids, at times.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are light blue, and I have not noticed any discoloration so far.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, no side affects felt yet.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes had been steady and the growth stopped.  </li>
            <li>but this is the only one that has really worked, worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 tubes over the last 2 years, I did have one tube that irritated my eyes quite a bit, but it seems that they have made some changes recently for the better, gentler and thicker formula,</li>
            <li>Be patient and have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>my eyes are red and veiny and they burn and I feel like I didn&#x27;t even get adequate sleep because my freaking eyes burn all</li>
            <li>Never once did I experience any irritation and I have very sensitive skin around my eyes!  </li>
            <li>While I have not accomplished lashes equivilent to extensions I am very happy with my results, with a good mascara I get long, stand out dramatic looking lashes that make me happy and don&#x27;t look fake!!</li>
            <li>In high concentrations it can cause chemical burns</li>
            <li>It was ranked as high as Latisse for results achieved on the website.  </li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that the growing process is not dramatic and look natural, yet still visible to notice.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have a little curl to them now and my bottom lashes are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I really want this product to work for me</li>
            <li>they are so long and full</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t possibly be the only one with eyes that are so sensitive as to not be able to use it?  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really upsetting that I ruined my pretty blue eyes for longer lashes.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the wait and the initial redness.  </li>
            <li>When I used lilash for the first time 3 weeks ago, I found irritation and redness around my eyes on the following whole day.  </li>
            <li>Okay soo, people seem to think that they will get results in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>My eyelids haven&#x27;t had any pigment problems they look normal</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are longer, darker, and many new little lashes are beginning to appear.  </li>
            <li>When this happened I switched to applying it every other day, which works fine.     </li>
            <li>Another thing, I have saved money on mascara since I never hardly wear it anymore.</li>
            <li>The only problem is when I have missed days the longer eyelashes quickly fall out, and my natural lashes almost seem sparser than before I used the product.  </li>
            <li>and I have full, long eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>My tube ran out and I haven&#x27;t got around to ordering a new one, its been 7 months without it</li>
            <li>But I can live with that.   </li>
            <li>but really after seeing my eyelashes now I have no regrets buying this product.</li>
            <li>you, ive been using LiLash every night now for 10 weeks and WOW its almost as if over night my eyelashes just popped out!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to completely stop using it because I understand that they&#x27;ll eventually return to normal if you stop using it,</li>
            <li>The thin applicator is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>As for sensitive eyes, mine are VERY sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that will last me a very long time seeing that the first one lasted for 4 months (and there&#x27;s still a little bit left yet in the first bottle.)</li>
            <li>My bottle has lasted probably 3 months so far, and it seems like its running low, although I can&#x27;t really tell since I can&#x27;t see inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I noticed my lashes were actually growing much longer &amp; fuller.  </li>
            <li>My experience with LiLash began with my 22 old daughter.</li>
            <li>She developed blepharititis, an eye condition which one of the symtoms is having the eyelashes fall out.  </li>
            <li>No results so far...  </li>
            <li>2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand of lash growth stimulator and it really works.</li>
            <li>As far as side effects go so far</li>
            <li>I am blond, blue-eyed and have invisible, sparse, short and straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product so far.</li>
            <li>Finally I realized that I put too much lilash on my lashline which caused the irritation and redness.  </li>
            <li>and so far they continue to grow in length</li>
            <li>but it is still too soon to know the complete results.</li>
            <li>I finally purchased LiLash, I did not actually think it would work, but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>THe good news is that there are other lash stimulators, (one in particular that is awesome) that I have used and work and are less costly, without the nasty side effects.</li>
            <li>THe good news is that there are other lash stimulators, (one in particular that is awesome) that I have used and work and are less costly, without the nasty side effects.</li>
            <li>I have noticed some fine, dark hairs down below my lower lashes, kind of on my upper cheekbone growing due to the lilash, but its not a big deal, I just pluck them out and they are gone!</li>
            <li>you need to also be aware that the makers of Lilash are currently being sued by another lash stimulator company (that sells their brand via prescription only) and this formula may well be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is better than Revitalash which I have used in the past and did not get the same results as with Lilash.</li>
            <li>Now they are long and luscious and they have natural curl (but I still curl them with an eyelash curler and they hold it REALLY</li>
            <li>Fast forward a couple of months: I now have really long, lush eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product; it was very moderately priced, too, compared to competitors.</li>
            <li>no dark line and my eyes haven&#x27;t changed color at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased my 1st bottle on 12/15, then went out of town for New Year&#x27;s, and accidentally left it where we stayed, so I had to purchase another one on 1/16, and still haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
            <li>It has just taken a very long time to start working, do not know why, but just be very patient.</li>
            <li>This particular brand uses prostaglandin which is a controversial drug used in the treatment of glaucoma and has some serious side effects, which include blindness among other things.</li>
            <li>I have experienced slight darkening at the base of my eyelid, but it just looks like eyeliner, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I did research on every major eyelash stimulating product and decided to try LiLash.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go back to my natural lashes now that I have these babies!</li>
            <li>Update, I have used it for about 16 weeks now and the bald spots are filling in very slowly, but are getting better.  </li>
            <li>Over all, it is getting better just very slowly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any bad side effects.</li>
            <li>The product does work, without the immediate dramatic effect for me as quickly as others, but if things continue to progress as they have for the first 7 weeks</li>
            <li>Also, after reading more into the schematics of these lash stimulators, you should be aware that they can be dangerous.</li>
            <li>My lashes were pretty average, I had to rely on volumizing mascaras to get them to pop</li>
            <li>My lashes look completely natural and I just placed my 2nd order.</li>
            <li>but I had lots of bare spots.  </li>
            <li>My lashes grew longer than with Latisse, the bottle lasts for 5-6 months, and the application is simple with no waste- just like putting on regualr liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>In the last month (early March)</li>
            <li>I wore fake lashes for years and basically ruined my own.  </li>
            <li>The first night or two my eyes felt sensitive and a little red in the morning, so I skipped using it one night, started again</li>
            <li>Maybe a little longer lashes on the right eye but not the left.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews that LiLash is the best on the market as eye lash stimulators, I am disappointed that after using it for one month, still nothing!  </li>
            <li>Lilash was really pricey when I first bought it, so I tried a few other products, including RapidLash and Maxolash.  </li>
            <li>but the difference was very modest, I continued to use this product intermittently probably 3-4 times a week for the last 4 months , are u kidding me , my lashes are sooo long .</li>
            <li>I first noticed that my eyelashes seemed darker and a few lashes were longer.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, my eyes were a little red and irritated, but not unbearable.  </li>
            <li>Only drawback: when I first began using it, it caused a little bit of redness (only noticiable without make-up) at the outer corner of my eye.</li>
            <li>My eyes do get red and twitch sometimes, but no long lashes.</li>
            <li>The first few days of using lilash my eyes were really itchy and a little red.</li>
            <li>Naturally straight, my lashes even have a little curl now.  </li>
            <li>I have short, straight eyelashes and after 2 months, I do see A LITTLE growth.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t go overboard on its application and get it directly in your eye, there really isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It works fantastic!!</li>
            <li> My lashes have lengthened, darkened, curled and filled in beautifully.</li>
            <li> Make sure to take \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture, and take again after each month to see the result!</li>
            <li> To my surprise it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> They DEFINATELY started to curl, which was amazing.</li>
            <li> Results are quite amazing, however, you do have to keep using it to maintain.</li>
            <li> well, like AMAZINGLY well).</li>
            <li> It is truly an amazing product that does what it claims to.  </li>
            <li> and my eyelashes STILL look amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Truth In Aging really liked [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> But.. the thing is, I honestly would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Also when I apply it, my skin is kind a itchy...</li>
            <li> They truly cannot believe they are my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I received the product in it&#x27;s original packaging in great condition and the delivery time was just a couple of days after placing my order.</li>
            <li> I had to order 2 more bottles for girl friends of mine because after seeing my beautiful lashes they were true believers.</li>
            <li> LiLash is by far the best product I have used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful, natural way to get longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I know that these side affects may not be experienced by everyone, but they bothered me to the point where I didnt think the increase in my lashes were worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An excellent value for the price and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Will give it more time.  </li>
            <li> but this made them even more longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Have tried many things over the years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Quite pleased.</li>
            <li> My lashes are stronger, longer, thicker and healthy.  </li>
            <li> improvements I am pleased with.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are stronger and longer than ever :) I trimmed the tips twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others for more money that did nothing.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be without this stuff that&#x27;s for sure....      </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The best surprise is that without mascara, I can actually see some eyelashes, when before they were invisible.</li>
            <li> but that is ok.</li>
            <li> My lashes are more sparse and are falling out.  </li>
            <li> I love Lilash.  </li>
            <li> LiLash worked better for me.  </li>
            <li> And I love having fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li> For those who gave this product a 1 Star who had no reactions, give the product more time to work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diligently using this for about 4 months now and my lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear mascara most days</li>
            <li> I am so pleased w/ this product.  </li>
            <li> I give 5 stars because it gives results to both my daughter and me and we are satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with the results and the side effects were very mild and almost non existent now after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li> My daughter too has had incredible results, although initially she scoffed that a product could do this.  </li>
            <li> They are about triple the original length and more volumized.</li>
            <li> I could easily go without mascara now if I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This seller was great, love the product and will continue to look back at what the seller has to offer.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to use and does not irritate eyes.  </li>
            <li> A high-end mascara could be a better investment depending on your natural lash length (DiorShow is good).</li>
            <li> and it has been fine since.  </li>
            <li> After using it for the 90-day initial period I had great lashes, but when I quit using it altogether my lashes fell out again.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I stopped to use the product and began to search the relevant reports.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are naturally light</li>
            <li> BUT IT GOT SUCH GREAT REVIEWS THAT I HAD TO TRY IT.</li>
            <li> Other people would probably be OK with that though, especially if it&#x27;s important for their career</li>
            <li> I saw results in exactly 4 weeks!!  </li>
            <li> This is totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> After faithfully using this product as instructed for over 3 weeks now, I have not seen a significant change in my lashes.</li>
            <li> But to me, it&#x27;s worth it because I have struggled all my life with my lashes!</li>
            <li> I wear contacts, as do two of my girlfriends who I&#x27;ve brought over to the Lilash side of the force, and all three of us are happy and long lashed!</li>
            <li> and wow am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> My advice is to make sure you read the fine print on the return policy of where you buy LiLash from, so if you do have problems with it, you will be able to get your money back.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the side effect of this product which I do see as a good thing because it does make it look like your wearing eyeliner too, for me it did make my eyes itchy and red for awhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping if I use it for the whole time frame, I&#x27;ll have more luck.</li>
            <li> I stopped using a lash curler at about week 6 as they have developed their own curl.  </li>
            <li> i hope everyone enjoys this product as much as i do, once my tube is out i will no doubt be purchasing more LiLash.</li>
            <li> Most of the reactions are from people who use too much of the product.  </li>
            <li> but no bad side effects either.  </li>
            <li> I have had NO bad reactions and NO color changes.</li>
            <li> 23 people reported irritation and itchiness of some sort, ranging from mild to so severe that they had to stop using the products.   </li>
            <li> It does not work that quickly.  </li>
            <li> It took about 4 weeks or so to see noticeable results and my eyelashes have only gotten better and better.</li>
            <li> I have one more part of my body back, one more thing that does not remind me of cost of cancer.  </li>
            <li> After reviewing many other similar products, this one is the best and within reasonable price range.</li>
            <li> I made my purchase after reading several reviews here and on makeupalley, and I&#x27;ve experienced pretty much every side effect (with the exception of pigment change).</li>
            <li> I have only been using LiLash for a month, but am already seeing amazing results.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sound like much</li>
            <li> 17 people saw an increase in eyelash length and thickness, didn&#x27;t have any trouble, and were generally happy with their results.   </li>
            <li> and my lashes look fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the risks and money?</li>
            <li> Lilash has made my own lashes come back in thicker</li>
            <li> May not be worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I have watched utube videos and reread the directions making sure I don&#x27;t apply directly on my lash line.  </li>
            <li> the kind that make me try on several pairs of sunglasses before finding a pair that my eyelashes wouldn&#x27;t bang into and give me a headache.</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions, which were a total waste of money and to be honest, not that great.</li>
            <li> I am deployed to Iraq right now</li>
            <li> The results are pretty amazing, my lashes grew an extra 2-3 mm!</li>
            <li> It is the most amazing product I have ever used, I was soo skeptical of it ,but it  does everything it says and more.</li>
            <li> What did grow, grew in nice and long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the itching to get the better results and to save the extra money.  </li>
            <li> However, a cousin in her very late 60&#x27;s started using the product and her lashes are currently incredible.........</li>
            <li> Not truly believing that this would work, I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> This is the first eyelash growth formula that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve been using Lilash now for almost six months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently before bed and started to see results after six weeks, after eight weeks</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I only apply it once a day and have had no side effects with it.  </li>
            <li> but i can tell you LiLash made my eyelashes SO much longer!</li>
            <li> ;)ey?</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> The first week</li>
            <li> Be willing to hang in there.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.)    </li>
            <li> Okay, here is my 11/11 update,  almost 1 and 1/2 years later.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Lilash for 6 weeks and have followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Overall I am ok with the results given the price and</li>
            <li> My lashes do not appear to be thicker just overall better conditioned, not as brittle.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back to using the Maybelline Great Lash #you know the one in the pink container#</li>
            <li> If I had applied it regularly, I&#x27;d probably be raving about it like others who&#x27;ve had successful results, but what happens if I already have long lashes</li>
            <li> I had previously tried Revitalash and had way better results!  </li>
            <li> At first my eyes were super sensitive to it, but they dont deny this in the warnings so i kept with it.</li>
            <li> , I may try other eyelash growth stimulators and see if I would get the same great results to ease on my wallet.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so much fuller now and SO much longer!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I wasnt really in the market for an eyelash enhancer when I bought this.</li>
            <li> Works better than I could imagine and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It was never really painful just itchy, but come on what do you expect, your appying this DIRECTLY to your eyelid pretty much.</li>
            <li> If you have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> At long last, I don&#x27;t need to use all that eyeliner and mascara to look good --</li>
            <li> and I certainly see improvement.</li>
            <li> so I thought if only this product will do half of what it says  I will be happy .</li>
            <li> It does cause mild irritation but only right after application.</li>
            <li> and it does really work people</li>
            <li> It makes the eyelash feel thicker and more brittle and harder to pull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been just plucking them, although that really hurts</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew longer and I absolutely noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> This is  not a scientific study, but it is real users reporting their results.   </li>
            <li> I think perhaps I was expecting too much</li>
            <li> It worked really fast for me</li>
            <li> and I really regret using it.  </li>
            <li> The more I use the product, the more lush and thick they become.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> so i cant really tell you if the product made my eyes darker</li>
            <li> so i never really wear mascara (just more of a pain)</li>
            <li> and it really does make your lashes grow thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks to really notice.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m done with the whole bottle?</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are thicker and much longer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It took way too much time and energy to get this issue resolved -- I WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THE PRODUCT - my neighbor uses it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really evaluate the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> I received the product in quite fast delivery, and immediately tried it on.</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions very closely.  </li>
            <li> I just want to make it clear that I wasn&#x27;t able to apply the product as regularly as I would like to</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday sometimes twice a day, it just kind of depends.</li>
            <li> I agree that the older you are, results may be slower and more limited.  </li>
            <li> Changed my light blue eyes to a dark blue/green with mostly brown throughout.  </li>
            <li> One report which is helpful to me is that many women made complaints on this product is due to incorrect use.  </li>
            <li> The results, though slow at first, are absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> Last year at Christmas time, I noticed that her lashes were really long and questioned what kind of mascara she was using.  </li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash in the past with NO side effects and got amazing results.  </li>
            <li> As for myself, I changed my goal of having long lashes to having healthy lashes and went back to cheap, natural ingredients of old.</li>
            <li> I actually have a full set of eyelashes now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true -- they are actually thicker, fuller, and longer.  </li>
            <li> I have very light skin, and blue eyes and haven&#x27;t noticed any lasting eyelid or iris</li>
            <li> The only side effects I experienced were a little itching at first, and red eye lids, at times.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are light blue, and I have not noticed any discoloration so far.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, no side affects felt yet.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes had been steady and the growth stopped.  </li>
            <li> but this is the only one that has really worked, worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 tubes over the last 2 years, I did have one tube that irritated my eyes quite a bit, but it seems that they have made some changes recently for the better, gentler and thicker formula,</li>
            <li> Be patient and have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> my eyes are red and veiny and they burn and I feel like I didn&#x27;t even get adequate sleep because my freaking eyes burn all</li>
            <li> Never once did I experience any irritation and I have very sensitive skin around my eyes!  </li>
            <li> While I have not accomplished lashes equivilent to extensions I am very happy with my results, with a good mascara I get long, stand out dramatic looking lashes that make me happy and don&#x27;t look fake!!</li>
            <li> In high concentrations it can cause chemical burns</li>
            <li> It was ranked as high as Latisse for results achieved on the website.  </li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that the growing process is not dramatic and look natural, yet still visible to notice.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have a little curl to them now and my bottom lashes are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I really want this product to work for me</li>
            <li> they are so long and full</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t possibly be the only one with eyes that are so sensitive as to not be able to use it?  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really upsetting that I ruined my pretty blue eyes for longer lashes.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the wait and the initial redness.  </li>
            <li> When I used lilash for the first time 3 weeks ago, I found irritation and redness around my eyes on the following whole day.  </li>
            <li> Okay soo, people seem to think that they will get results in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids haven&#x27;t had any pigment problems they look normal</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer, darker, and many new little lashes are beginning to appear.  </li>
            <li> When this happened I switched to applying it every other day, which works fine.     </li>
            <li> Another thing, I have saved money on mascara since I never hardly wear it anymore.</li>
            <li> The only problem is when I have missed days the longer eyelashes quickly fall out, and my natural lashes almost seem sparser than before I used the product.  </li>
            <li> and I have full, long eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> My tube ran out and I haven&#x27;t got around to ordering a new one, its been 7 months without it</li>
            <li> But I can live with that.   </li>
            <li> but really after seeing my eyelashes now I have no regrets buying this product.</li>
            <li> you, ive been using LiLash every night now for 10 weeks and WOW its almost as if over night my eyelashes just popped out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to completely stop using it because I understand that they&#x27;ll eventually return to normal if you stop using it,</li>
            <li> The thin applicator is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> As for sensitive eyes, mine are VERY sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that will last me a very long time seeing that the first one lasted for 4 months (and there&#x27;s still a little bit left yet in the first bottle.)</li>
            <li> My bottle has lasted probably 3 months so far, and it seems like its running low, although I can&#x27;t really tell since I can&#x27;t see inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I noticed my lashes were actually growing much longer &amp; fuller.  </li>
            <li> My experience with LiLash began with my 22 old daughter.</li>
            <li> She developed blepharititis, an eye condition which one of the symtoms is having the eyelashes fall out.  </li>
            <li> No results so far...  </li>
            <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand of lash growth stimulator and it really works.</li>
            <li> As far as side effects go so far</li>
            <li> I am blond, blue-eyed and have invisible, sparse, short and straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product so far.</li>
            <li> Finally I realized that I put too much lilash on my lashline which caused the irritation and redness.  </li>
            <li> and so far they continue to grow in length</li>
            <li> but it is still too soon to know the complete results.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased LiLash, I did not actually think it would work, but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> THe good news is that there are other lash stimulators, (one in particular that is awesome) that I have used and work and are less costly, without the nasty side effects.</li>
            <li> THe good news is that there are other lash stimulators, (one in particular that is awesome) that I have used and work and are less costly, without the nasty side effects.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some fine, dark hairs down below my lower lashes, kind of on my upper cheekbone growing due to the lilash, but its not a big deal, I just pluck them out and they are gone!</li>
            <li> you need to also be aware that the makers of Lilash are currently being sued by another lash stimulator company (that sells their brand via prescription only) and this formula may well be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is better than Revitalash which I have used in the past and did not get the same results as with Lilash.</li>
            <li> Now they are long and luscious and they have natural curl (but I still curl them with an eyelash curler and they hold it REALLY</li>
            <li> Fast forward a couple of months: I now have really long, lush eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product; it was very moderately priced, too, compared to competitors.</li>
            <li> no dark line and my eyes haven&#x27;t changed color at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased my 1st bottle on 12/15, then went out of town for New Year&#x27;s, and accidentally left it where we stayed, so I had to purchase another one on 1/16, and still haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
            <li> It has just taken a very long time to start working, do not know why, but just be very patient.</li>
            <li> This particular brand uses prostaglandin which is a controversial drug used in the treatment of glaucoma and has some serious side effects, which include blindness among other things.</li>
            <li> I have experienced slight darkening at the base of my eyelid, but it just looks like eyeliner, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> I did research on every major eyelash stimulating product and decided to try LiLash.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to my natural lashes now that I have these babies!</li>
            <li> Update, I have used it for about 16 weeks now and the bald spots are filling in very slowly, but are getting better.  </li>
            <li> Over all, it is getting better just very slowly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any bad side effects.</li>
            <li> The product does work, without the immediate dramatic effect for me as quickly as others, but if things continue to progress as they have for the first 7 weeks</li>
            <li> Also, after reading more into the schematics of these lash stimulators, you should be aware that they can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> My lashes were pretty average, I had to rely on volumizing mascaras to get them to pop</li>
            <li> My lashes look completely natural and I just placed my 2nd order.</li>
            <li> but I had lots of bare spots.  </li>
            <li> My lashes grew longer than with Latisse, the bottle lasts for 5-6 months, and the application is simple with no waste- just like putting on regualr liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> In the last month (early March)</li>
            <li> I wore fake lashes for years and basically ruined my own.  </li>
            <li> The first night or two my eyes felt sensitive and a little red in the morning, so I skipped using it one night, started again</li>
            <li> Maybe a little longer lashes on the right eye but not the left.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews that LiLash is the best on the market as eye lash stimulators, I am disappointed that after using it for one month, still nothing!  </li>
            <li> Lilash was really pricey when I first bought it, so I tried a few other products, including RapidLash and Maxolash.  </li>
            <li> but the difference was very modest, I continued to use this product intermittently probably 3-4 times a week for the last 4 months , are u kidding me , my lashes are sooo long .</li>
            <li> I first noticed that my eyelashes seemed darker and a few lashes were longer.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, my eyes were a little red and irritated, but not unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback: when I first began using it, it caused a little bit of redness (only noticiable without make-up) at the outer corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> My eyes do get red and twitch sometimes, but no long lashes.</li>
            <li> The first few days of using lilash my eyes were really itchy and a little red.</li>
            <li> Naturally straight, my lashes even have a little curl now.  </li>
            <li> I have short, straight eyelashes and after 2 months, I do see A LITTLE growth.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t go overboard on its application and get it directly in your eye, there really isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> Anyway, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, they have gotten a little thinner</li>
            <li> The only odd things I&#x27;m experiencing is a few lashes on each eye are longer than their neighbors which makes them stand out more when mascara is applied, also a few of the tips appear lighter in color than the rest of the shaft.  </li>
            <li> I say almost because like i said it did irritate my eyes pretty badly for about the first week or two, but for me it was completely bareable.</li>
            <li> They are so much stronger no more falling out.</li>
            <li> I would like to know how long one tube should last.</li>
            <li> I am still using the 1st tube that I have ever bought, so it does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - I have been using LiLash for over 2 years now, it has become part of my daily routine and will remain a part as long as I wear make-up.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is I dont know how long the effect last for and if I need to keep using it long term .   </li>
            <li> My lashes before were too short to use an eyelash curler; now they are so long that I don&#x27;t need to curl them!  </li>
            <li> I tried purchasing other similar products, some even more expensive, but they didn&#x27;t work and irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li> , My bald spots have not grown back, but my other lashes are not falling out or getting worse, I think that they are even a little longer, I hope if I keep using it they will fill in, because it is making my bald spot even more noticeable.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes a so long</li>
            <li> Her eyelashes were really long.  </li>
            <li> either thought I was still wearing makeup because the eyelashes were long</li>
            <li> and I already always had long lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a young gal either.  </li>
            <li> Will continue you get this product as long as I can still afford it.</li>
            <li> They are so long</li>
            <li> No lie, they are so long now that they even touch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Also, it was not that the lashes were already too long so they just fell out.</li>
            <li> They look almost like I have extensions, but just not as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long eyelashes...</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t realize how long they are until I have mascara on them.</li>
            <li> So I got better results with a less expensive product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;ll need a new one, but I&#x27;ll give this tube four months, and then re-order.</li>
            <li> The tube was leaking and the wand was broken right from the getgo.</li>
            <li> My lashes had grown about twice as long and some very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably cut back to using it every other day because I don&#x27;t want my lashes to get too long.    </li>
            <li> Finally, and I know other commenters have addressed this</li>
            <li> , it contains Prostaglandin, which has a possible side effect of eye color change, among other things.</li>
            <li> Also, fyi, if you use this or any other lash enhancer of this type, remember that you have to use it FOREVER to maintain whatever growth you may accumulate, otherwise you lose not only the growth, but sometimes all the lashes....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other product to compare it to, but I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> My eyelid skin did get dry but using an eye cream helped.</li>
            <li> For those who had dry and itchy eyelids from this.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble losing lashes for about 12 years now, have tried several different things, nothing works.  </li>
            <li> So, I recommend those with sensitive eyes to use it before bedtime since it does turn your eyes red (or at least I had that result).</li>
            <li> They are so long now that my sunglasses that did work now have to be 1/2 inch further down my nose</li>
            <li> I had little stubs for eyelashes, barely even noticeable.  </li>
            <li> At first I was being very impatient and thought it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have average eyelashes that required several coats of mascara to be noticed to my satisfaaction, I then wore extensions for almost a year, which I definately DO NOT recommend, when I had the extensions removed</li>
            <li> I did have a little bit of irritation from the product, but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of any product promising to lengthen lashes but was willing to try based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> but they grew enough for me to get compliments and to use less mascara.    </li>
            <li> I actually got a few comments on my long lashes.</li>
            <li> I love it LiLash - no more false eyelashes for me!</li>
            <li> I was down to only a few skimpy wisps, and I never used mascara because I was afraid more eyelashes would fall out.</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are already longer and a little thicker - but definitely longer.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes are longer and a little thicker..2 months later.  </li>
            <li> I already had decent sized eyelashes, but i can say in less then 3 months they grew at least a quarter of an inch longer.  </li>
            <li> , people think they&#x27;re not real.  </li>
            <li> but if the symtoms continue, I wont risk to have dark circles for long lashes.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts maybe 2 months, application is messy, and there is a lot of waste with the poorly designed application method (I know the FDA likes it for sanitary reasons and Allergan likes it for generating quicker refills), but it is a comfortable product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see what develops over the next few months.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because of several reasons; first, my lids were burning and itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> how long the LiLash is supposed to last (at least 4 months).  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are finally getting long and thick.  </li>
            <li> The lure of having long, dark, beatiful eyelashes without makeup made made me throw caution out the window!</li>
            <li> In terms of side effects, in the beginning, I had noticed that if I put too much on, my eyes would get irritated and the skin that came in contact with Lilash would darken a bit (it would look like slight undereye circle or that I was really tired).  </li>
            <li> My lashes were thinning due to menopause and needed some help.  </li>
            <li> Iwas skeptical at first but after 2 weeks use I am a beleiver.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sesitive eyes</li>
            <li> Due to her rave reviews with LiLash, after having tried Jan Marini and others, I decided to try it to see if my lashes would get even longer.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed length on my other lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think twice a day is recommended and they say do not use one lower lids (I use the other product there).  </li>
            <li> Use this product carefully!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any irritation or other side effects.  </li>
            <li> For some reason it appeared to me and after reading the reviews for this and other eyelash stimulators, I thought &#x27;why not&#x27;?</li>
            <li> Since lilash is concentrate, customers are suggested to use only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with a brown line appearing where I apply it like some other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before buying LiLash and even when I first started using the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using the product for maintenance every other day or so.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll use it every other day and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> The only small thing is that they don&#x27;t all grow to even lengths.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the first time I put on mascara as a teenager, my mother yelled at me wanting to know where I got the false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Lately though, I have seen that the teeny tiny hair on my cheekbones became darker and longer but really not noticeable by other people.  </li>
            <li> Before lilash i had very short thin asian lashes.</li>
            <li> Update---ladies it is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have someone that dyes my lashes dark before I go on vacation</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> now i would even go as far as saying they are a bit ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Then only use a very very small amount.  </li>
            <li> Again, I brought the subject up again.  </li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks your eyelashes  are thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> but i did start putting eye lotion around my eyes and that did make it less itchy.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I had to get within an inch of the mirror to actually see my lashes.  </li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t want me to know because she thought I would be mad that she spent so much money on the product.    </li>
            <li> and I have dark circles under my eyes, a dark line appears where I apply the product and my eyelids are red and irritating.</li>
            <li> I tried LiLash and within two months my lashes are so long and thick, no one can believe it.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and a little surprize inside....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a little longer and see what happens.</li>
            <li> BTW, Revitalash also leave dark circles!</li>
            <li> As for the darkening of the eyes, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change - if anything my eyes look a little lighter, but then I have brown eyes to begin with.</li>
            <li> I like this because unlike Latisse, you don&#x27;t have to go to a doctor which cuts down on costs!</li>
            <li> I e-mailed, called and then had to argue with the salesperson - who suggested that I chase down my mail carrier!   </li>
            <li> I would like to say that at first i was very skeptical in buying this product.  </li>
            <li> Bought this and have been using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about lilash because nothing has ever worked for me and its pretty pricy</li>
            <li> It took a few days to heal.</li>
            <li> IT TOOK FEW MONTHS</li>
            <li> I have short, thin, pale lashes.</li>
            <li> Long and thick!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple months ago, and have had very minor redness and irritation lasting several hours at the base of my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I get the same dramatic results, times 10.    </li>
            <li> I cannot yet say if it works but the pain and suffering in the mean time is NOT worth it.  </li>
            <li> Then I started to use very little amount</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to reach a firm conclusion on Lilash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> and I found that I&#x27;ve no more redness around my eyes and</li>
            <li> Not sure this is working.  </li>
            <li> I cant even wear mascara to work  anymore , and definitely no more falsies for me.</li>
            <li> No effect whatsoever, which is unbelievable considering the price.   </li>
            <li> How could something SO expensive actually work.  </li>
            <li> I PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT 2009 AND WAS NOT SURE IF IT WOULD WORK</li>
            <li> With all the positive reviews I have read I am disappointed with my results.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had slight itching, nothing that was incredibly irritating though.  </li>
            <li> it does not worth it!!!</li>
            <li> It is expensive to not really work.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;ve got all my eyelashes intact with LiLash.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using Lilash for 90 days with the hope I am just a *late bloomer</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on buying this, considering how expensive it was, based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about lash growing products but after reading other reviews I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> I started using it on 12/9/09 and began to see subtle results in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> , but it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I used to have short ugly lashes that were sparse and wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl from my eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any discoloration of the eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Everyone keeps asking me if I have on false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have people all the time asking me if I have false eyelashes on or if I have extensions.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product, but I was desperate, so after reading some of the other reviews, I decided to try it just once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too dramatic.</li>
            <li> No more fake eyelashes for her anymore!</li>
            <li> Be prepared to have lashes that look fake</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like that it is so expensive</li>
            <li> and I got weird twitchings in my face.</li>
            <li> , Ill buy this twice a year always..&#x27;</li>
            <li> Ill be posting a review on it soon.</li>
            <li> Ill be posting a review on it soon.</li>
            <li> I am going on a trip to Europe and did not want to wear my fake lashes on the trip.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate to those who have irritations from the product.  </li>
            <li> But there is random itching.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE FAKE EYELASHES BEFORE THAT</li>
            <li> (I know weird -</li>
            <li> Since I am not a fan of fake eyelashes and always find difficulty to put it on my eyes, I bought this product as the alternative.</li>
            <li> and immediately I was disappointed in the shoddy packaging.</li>
            <li> Lilash also contains (in addition to five parabens and phenoxyethanol) a rather unpleasant preservative called methylchloroisothiazalinone.</li>
            <li> so I did not know what to expect with this product since my lashes weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with.  </li>
            <li> After using it for once, I have to stop because both of my eyelids became swollen and painful.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be unhappy!</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, I noticed my lashes felt thicker at the base.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I never got to try it!</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED!   </li>
            <li> I have been using this for four weeks now and I am very disappointed that there have been no results at all.</li>
            <li> but i decided to wear mascara on Christmas and holy crap!</li>
            <li> My lashes were terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My lashes were thinning due to menopause and needed some help.  Not truly believing that this would work, I was willing to give it a try.  To my surprise it was amazing.  I could easily go without mascara now if I wanted.  This product is wonderful.  I hope there are no longterm effects, I plan on keep using this.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the different products for eyelash growth on the market.  LiLash is by far the best product I have used.  After 2 weeks I noticed my lashes were actually growing much longer &amp; fuller.  I use it in the morning &amp; at night and am very pleased with the results. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lilash for about 2 months and I am very happy with the results.  My lashes are longer and thicker then ever.  Naturally straight, my lashes even have a little curl now.  My eyes are light blue, and I have not noticed any discoloration so far.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews that LiLash is the best on the market as eye lash stimulators, I am disappointed that after using it for one month, still nothing!  I had previously tried Revitalash and had way better results!  I&#x27;m going back to revitalash!</li>
            <li> This seller was great, love the product and will continue to look back at what the seller has to offer.  Prompt shipping and a little surprize inside....Who doesn&#x27;t like a lil sometin:o)</li>
            <li> the best of all the eyelalsh conditioners.  my eyelashes a so long, people think they&#x27;re not real.  I&#x27;ve tried all the others, but this one is the best.  I have recommended it to several people.    I would like to know how long one tube should last.</li>
            <li> My experience with LiLash began with my 22 old daughter. She developed blepharititis, an eye condition which one of the symtoms is having the eyelashes fall out.  Last year at Christmas time, I noticed that her lashes were really long and questioned what kind of mascara she was using.  She replied some norma mascara and I forgot about it.  The next day, I noticed it again.  I askd her if she was using an eyelash primer.  She said no and that was it..  The third time I noticed her lashes was one morning when she had no makeup on.  Her eyelashes were really long.  Again, I brought the subject up again.  Her sister was there and started smiling.  They finally fessed up and told me about LiLash.  My daughter didn&#x27;t want me to know because she thought I would be mad that she spent so much money on the product.    Immediately, I googled it and ordered it online.  If I hadn&#x27;t seen it myself, I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it. It works fantastic!! In less than 2 weeks your eyelashes  are thicker and longer.  It&#x27;s unbelievable.  I have turned on 3 friends to this product and we all have had the same experience.  All I can say is that you will not be disappointed.  As a sidenote, my friend and I had tried MDLash.  It DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> It is the most amazing product I have ever used, I was soo skeptical of it ,but it  does everything it says and more. Great GReat GREAT . Be prepared to have lashes that look fake they are so long and full</li>
            <li> Have been using LiLash every night several weeks now and do not see any  difference in my lashes.  Will give it more time.  It is expensive to not really work.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:38098351]]I have been using this product off an on for 2yrs and it does really work people either thought I was still wearing makeup because the eyelashes were long and they also thought I still had eyeliner on but it&#x27;s the side effect of this product which I do see as a good thing because it does make it look like your wearing eyeliner too, for me it did make my eyes itchy and red for awhile but i did start putting eye lotion around my eyes and that did make it less itchy. My reasoning I had to use it off and on only was because of the price and I already always had long lashes but this made them even more longer and thicker.  Overall people should buy this product. checkout my video there&#x27;s prove and yes of course I am wearing mascara in it.</li>
            <li> Iwas skeptical at first but after 2 weeks use I am a beleiver. I have extremely sesitive eyes and there was no irritation at all. After about two weeks, my eyelashes are definitely thicker and longer. Everyone keeps asking me if I have on false eyelashes. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lilash for 3 1/2 months and it has done what it promised.  This is the only product I have tried and it has allowed me to grow lashes and stop pulling them.   I have trichotillomania where I pull out my eyelashes.  Lilash makes no claim that it can help with this disorder, but it has helped.  I actually have a full set of eyelashes now.  It makes the eyelash feel thicker and more brittle and harder to pull.  I also switched to a non-allergy waterproof mascara....can&#x27;t believe that I get to put mascara on :o)  Lilash is not a cure all and there have been some side effects such as the eyelid feeling sore and again the change in the lash itself.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and two months now and I am more than happy with the results. As long as you don&#x27;t go overboard on its application and get it directly in your eye, there really isn&#x27;t a problem. I wear contacts, as do two of my girlfriends who I&#x27;ve brought over to the Lilash side of the force, and all three of us are happy and long lashed! Seriously, no side affects felt yet. Hopefully there won&#x27;t be any too.</li>
            <li> No results so far...  but no bad side effects either.  I&#x27;ll keep hoping.</li>
            <li> I have only been using LiLash for a month, but am already seeing amazing results.  My eyelashes are longer, darker, and many new little lashes are beginning to appear.  I am delighted with this product!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Does exactly what it says it will.  My eyelashes are finally getting long and thick.  I definitely recommend it to anyone with sparse lashes.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyelash growth formula that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve been using Lilash now for almost six months.  My lashes were pretty average, I had to rely on volumizing mascaras to get them to pop so I did not know what to expect with this product since my lashes weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with.  I&#x27;ve been using it consistently before bed and started to see results after six weeks, after eight weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes had been steady and the growth stopped.  I&#x27;m still using it to maintain.  The results are pretty amazing, my lashes grew an extra 2-3 mm! It doesn&#x27;t sound like much but they grew enough for me to get compliments and to use less mascara.    In terms of side effects, in the beginning, I had noticed that if I put too much on, my eyes would get irritated and the skin that came in contact with Lilash would darken a bit (it would look like slight undereye circle or that I was really tired).  That had gone away after 4-6 weeks of usage (the irritation and skin darkening).  Lately though, I have seen that the teeny tiny hair on my cheekbones became darker and longer but really not noticeable by other people.  I&#x27;ve been just plucking them, although that really hurts so I may just leave them alone since no one else would notice them anyway.    Overall, I am very happy with the results and the side effects were very mild and almost non existent now after prolonged use.  I just don&#x27;t like that it is so expensive, I may try other eyelash growth stimulators and see if I would get the same great results to ease on my wallet.</li>
            <li> I purchased Revitalash from my doctor for $120.  I was very happy with the results.  My eyelashes grew longer and I absolutely noticed a difference.  But then I went on YouTube and watched a video posted by a gal who was reviewing Latisse, Jan Marini, Revitalash and Lilash.  Due to her rave reviews with LiLash, after having tried Jan Marini and others, I decided to try it to see if my lashes would get even longer.  Lo and behold!  They actually did!  A lot!  And I could see the difference in 2 weeks after using Revitalash for about 9 months.  You&#x27;ve GOT to try this product.  I&#x27;m not a young gal either.  Someone my age to have these gorgeous lashes?  I get compliments at work almost every day.  Awesome product!  Try it.  You won&#x27;t be unhappy!</li>
            <li> The lure of having long, dark, beatiful eyelashes without makeup made made me throw caution out the window! I read plenty of reveiws on LiLash and I couldn&#x27;t find any concerning intolerance to the product.  I can&#x27;t possibly be the only one with eyes that are so sensitive as to not be able to use it?  My advice is to make sure you read the fine print on the return policy of where you buy LiLash from, so if you do have problems with it, you will be able to get your money back.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It took me awhile to get used to putting it on every night but once i did, I saw some lengthing in about 2 months</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on buying this, considering how expensive it was, based on other reviews. And it&#x27;s worked as promised - I love it. In about four weeks my lashes are thicker and growing back toward the outer corners, where they were getting sparse. I actually chose this one, as reviewers for another brand talked about eye sensitivity with that brand. I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with sensitivity.     It&#x27;s a wonderful, natural way to get longer lashes. I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;ll need a new one, but I&#x27;ll give this tube four months, and then re-order. That&#x27;s about all my budget can handle.</li>
            <li> I work for a blog called Truth In Aging. When we posted a review of Lilash Eyelash Stimulator we had over 40 comments where readers shared their results. This is  not a scientific study, but it is real users reporting their results.   17 people saw an increase in eyelash length and thickness, didn&#x27;t have any trouble, and were generally happy with their results.   23 people reported irritation and itchiness of some sort, ranging from mild to so severe that they had to stop using the products.   7 people reported increased growth in cheek hair and another 7 reported changes in pigmentation on their eyelids where they were using Lilash.     Finally, and I know other commenters have addressed this, it contains Prostaglandin, which has a possible side effect of eye color change, among other things. Lilash also contains (in addition to five parabens and phenoxyethanol) a rather unpleasant preservative called methylchloroisothiazalinone. In high concentrations it can cause chemical burns and it is a skin and membrane irritant, thus the pigmentation changes.     It&#x27;s hard to reach a firm conclusion on Lilash. It seems to work but the side effects can outweigh the benefits. Truth In Aging really liked [[ASIN:B001CWCIE6 Jan Marini Marini Lash]], but it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble losing lashes for about 12 years now, have tried several different things, nothing works.  I have been using lilash for almost 4 weeks, when I started using it I had a big bald spot in each eye, My bald spots have not grown back, but my other lashes are not falling out or getting worse, I think that they are even a little longer, I hope if I keep using it they will fill in, because it is making my bald spot even more noticeable. I will keep using it and update later.[[ASIN:B001VNP4XS LiLash Eyelash Growth Stimulator]] Update, I have used it for about 16 weeks now and the bald spots are filling in very slowly, but are getting better.  I have noticed length on my other lashes. Over all, it is getting better just very slowly.  I will continue to use this product,this is the only thing that I have ever used that has helped.      Update: Been using this product for about 5 or 6 months.  All of the sudden my lashes are longer and fuller than ever. Love this stuff, I only apply it once a day and have had no side effects with it.  My lashes are not falling out anymore and look great! I am still using the 1st tube that I have ever bought, so it does last a long time.  Have tried many things over the years but this is the only one that has really worked, worth the money.  It has just taken a very long time to start working, do not know why, but just be very patient.</li>
            <li> I purchased my 1st bottle on 12/15, then went out of town for New Year&#x27;s, and accidentally left it where we stayed, so I had to purchase another one on 1/16, and still haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I made my purchase after reading several reviews here and on makeupalley, and I&#x27;ve experienced pretty much every side effect (with the exception of pigment change). I started using LiLash mid-December and have been using it once, every night. It does cause mild irritation but only right after application. So, I recommend those with sensitive eyes to use it before bedtime since it does turn your eyes red (or at least I had that result). My eyelid skin did get dry but using an eye cream helped. I have short, straight eyelashes and after 2 months, I do see A LITTLE growth. That said, I haven&#x27;t seen any thickening effect. My eyelashes have a little curl to them now and my bottom lashes are more noticeable. I think perhaps I was expecting too much (what with all the hype about this product and Latisse). I was expecting the Chia Pet effect. I&#x27;m hoping if I use it for the whole time frame, I&#x27;ll have more luck. Will update again later!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  My lashes have grown and seem to have thickened as well.  Quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I have average eyelashes that required several coats of mascara to be noticed to my satisfaaction, I then wore extensions for almost a year, which I definately DO NOT recommend, when I had the extensions removed I had little stubs for eyelashes, barely even noticeable.  I&#x27;ve been using lilash for 7 weeks once daily now, I&#x27;ve had slight itching, nothing that was incredibly irritating though.  In these 7 weeks my lashes have already exceeded their previous length, they are stronger, do not seem to fall out as quickly as before and appear slightly thicker.  I stopped using a lash curler at about week 6 as they have developed their own curl.  The only odd things I&#x27;m experiencing is a few lashes on each eye are longer than their neighbors which makes them stand out more when mascara is applied, also a few of the tips appear lighter in color than the rest of the shaft.  The product does work, without the immediate dramatic effect for me as quickly as others, but if things continue to progress as they have for the first 7 weeks I believe that I will end up with lashes equal to the extensions I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I have been using LiLash for over 2 years now, it has become part of my daily routine and will remain a part as long as I wear make-up.  My lashes are stronger, longer, thicker and healthy.  I have purchased 3 tubes over the last 2 years, I did have one tube that irritated my eyes quite a bit, but it seems that they have made some changes recently for the better, gentler and thicker formula, improvements I am pleased with.  While I have not accomplished lashes equivilent to extensions I am very happy with my results, with a good mascara I get long, stand out dramatic looking lashes that make me happy and don&#x27;t look fake!!</li>
            <li> It took about 3/4 weeks to see good results but it worked.   I actually got a few comments on my long lashes. My lashes are stronger and longer than ever :) I trimmed the tips twice. No side affects for me. I would buy it again.    A.Sosa~CA</li>
            <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand of lash growth stimulator and it really works. I&#x27;ve tried others for more money that did nothing. This is totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. Before lilash i had very short thin asian lashes. I&#x27;ve only started seeing results on the 4th week. At first I was being very impatient and thought it was a waste of money but really after seeing my eyelashes now I have no regrets buying this product. They are about triple the original length and more volumized. I haven&#x27;t experienced any bad side effects. I have water eyes and have had no problem with seeing any cheek bone hair growth I&#x27;ve heard some people get. Will continue you get this product as long as I can still afford it.</li>
            <li> After faithfully using this product as instructed for over 3 weeks now, I have not seen a significant change in my lashes. My eyes do get red and twitch sometimes, but no long lashes.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is amazing.  I have only been using this product for 1 1/2 weeks ( 2 times per day) and I can&#x27;t believe the results already. My lashes are already a lot longer.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what they look like after 4-6 weeks.  It worked really fast for me and I would recommend this product hands down. As far as side effects go so far I have not had one. I won&#x27;t be without this stuff that&#x27;s for sure....      Update---ladies it is not worth it.  Changed my light blue eyes to a dark blue/green with mostly brown throughout.  I knew this was a possibility but didn&#x27;t think it would happen.  Well it did and I really regret using it.  it&#x27;s really upsetting that I ruined my pretty blue eyes for longer lashes.  I wish I could go back...</li>
            <li> I would like to say that at first i was very skeptical in buying this product.  I had lash extensions which are costly for the maintenance but once the allergy season hit I could not help rubbing my eyes. The more I rubbed my eyes the extension and my own lashes fell out!!!!!! i had been using this product and i am very happy to say that IT DOES WORK!!! after 6 weeks i have longer lashes and people have asked me if i am still wearing my lash extensions..the answer is NO !!! Just try lilash and you will be amazed!!!</li>
            <li> I tried another brand of eyelash growth stimulator and while my lashes grew some, they were still light and thin.  I tried LiLash and within two months my lashes are so long and thick, no one can believe it. I do have darkening at the lash line, but I see that as eyeliner and like the definition.  I do not see a change in my eyecolor and I do have blue eyes. I don&#x27;t think twice a day is recommended and they say do not use one lower lids (I use the other product there).  Nonetheless, I am sold. As with any product, only use it as recommended! When you don&#x27;t you increase the likelihood of side effects.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 tubes of Lilash, one for my daughter and one for me.  The results, though slow at first, are absolutely amazing.  My lashes before were too short to use an eyelash curler; now they are so long that I don&#x27;t need to curl them!  The more I use the product, the more lush and thick they become.  At long last, I don&#x27;t need to use all that eyeliner and mascara to look good -- what a time savings in the morning and confidence booster for me!  My daughter too has had incredible results, although initially she scoffed that a product could do this.  No more fake eyelashes for her anymore!</li>
            <li> I cant believe this works so well. I have been using it for eleven days and already people can notice a difference.  Well worth the wait and the initial redness.  (it subsided on day 7).   Thanks so much. I feel beautiful!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple months ago, and have had very minor redness and irritation lasting several hours at the base of my lashes. When this happened I switched to applying it every other day, which works fine.     My eyelashes aren&#x27;t darker, but they&#x27;re definitely longer- only noticeable with mascara.  I might buy this product again.  The only problem is when I have missed days the longer eyelashes quickly fall out, and my natural lashes almost seem sparser than before I used the product.  I have very light skin, and blue eyes and haven&#x27;t noticed any lasting eyelid or iris pigmentation- a possible side effect.  Use this product carefully!  A high-end mascara could be a better investment depending on your natural lash length (DiorShow is good).</li>
            <li> This product does work for me.  I don&#x27;t have any irritation or other side effects.  After using it for the 90-day initial period I had great lashes, but when I quit using it altogether my lashes fell out again.  I tried purchasing other similar products, some even more expensive, but they didn&#x27;t work and irritated my eyes.  I purchased this product again and after the initial growth, I am using is a couple of times a week (like the instructions say) and it keeps my lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, end of story! I have brown eyes so i cant really tell you if the product made my eyes darker but i can tell you LiLash made my eyelashes SO much longer! Like my title says, you must be patient with this product. I followed the directions and used it only once a day. I used it at night after my face care regimen. At first my eyes were super sensitive to it, but they dont deny this in the warnings so i kept with it. It was never really painful just itchy, but come on what do you expect, your appying this DIRECTLY to your eyelid pretty much. So anyways i didnt see results until probably 4 weeks into it but im tellin you, ive been using LiLash every night now for 10 weeks and WOW its almost as if over night my eyelashes just popped out! They are so long now i would even go as far as saying they are a bit ridiculous! I am deployed to Iraq right now so i never really wear mascara (just more of a pain) but i decided to wear mascara on Christmas and holy crap! My eyelashes are so much fuller now and SO much longer! No lie, they are so long now that they even touch my eyebrows. I would recommend this product to almost anyone!!! I say almost because like i said it did irritate my eyes pretty badly for about the first week or two, but for me it was completely bareable. If you have super sensitive eyes i wouldnt try it. But if you dont then in my opinion you have nothing to lose but the opportunity for longer, fuller lashes! :) i hope everyone enjoys this product as much as i do, once my tube is out i will no doubt be purchasing more LiLash.</li>
            <li> I did research on every major eyelash stimulating product and decided to try LiLash. I am blond, blue-eyed and have invisible, sparse, short and straight eyelashes. I started using it on 12/9/09 and began to see subtle results in about 2 weeks. I first noticed that my eyelashes seemed darker and a few lashes were longer. They DEFINATELY started to curl, which was amazing. I had some burning and redness in both eyes. It&#x27;s now been 5 1/2 weeks and I certainly see improvement. My lashes are darker, fuller, curlier and longer. The best surprise is that without mascara, I can actually see some eyelashes, when before they were invisible. I still have occasional burning and redness, but have not seen any darkening on my eyelid or changes in eye color. I only use it once a day as recommended. With mascara, I see such a difference and my lashes look fresh all day. I&#x27;m curious to see what develops over the next few months. I purchased Revitalash for my daughters for Christmas to put both products to the test. I would recommend this product so far.UPDATE 2/27/10 After almost 3 months, LiLash has continued provide the promised results. My lashes have lengthened, darkened, curled and filled in beautifully. Be patient and have realistic expectations. I have experienced slight darkening at the base of my eyelid, but it just looks like eyeliner, which is fine with me. My lashes look completely natural and I just placed my 2nd order. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I wasnt really in the market for an eyelash enhancer when I bought this. For some reason it appeared to me and after reading the reviews for this and other eyelash stimulators, I thought &#x27;why not&#x27;? So, I received this and immediately I was disappointed in the shoddy packaging. The tube was leaking and the wand was broken right from the getgo. But cosmetics aside, I decided to use what was remaining in the dispenser before reordering another one that may have been faulty too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked for me, I did see eyelash increase in a matter of weeks. Although the growth was only in length and not in thickness or density. But.. the thing is, I honestly would not recommend this to anyone. I stopped using it because of several reasons; first, my lids were burning and itching like crazy. The feeling didnt dissipate, my eyes were red for the several weeks I did use it and I got weird twitchings in my face. I know that these side affects may not be experienced by everyone, but they bothered me to the point where I didnt think the increase in my lashes were worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, after reading more into the schematics of these lash stimulators, you should be aware that they can be dangerous. This particular brand uses prostaglandin which is a controversial drug used in the treatment of glaucoma and has some serious side effects, which include blindness among other things. Also, fyi, if you use this or any other lash enhancer of this type, remember that you have to use it FOREVER to maintain whatever growth you may accumulate, otherwise you lose not only the growth, but sometimes all the lashes.... Well, you might say, &#x27;I dont care, Ill buy this twice a year always..&#x27; you need to also be aware that the makers of Lilash are currently being sued by another lash stimulator company (that sells their brand via prescription only) and this formula may well be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, those are my two cents. Does it work? Yes it does. Is it worth the risks and money? In my opinion, NO. THe good news is that there are other lash stimulators, (one in particular that is awesome) that I have used and work and are less costly, without the nasty side effects. Ill be posting a review on it soon. ;)ey? In my opinion, NO. THe good news is that there are other lash stimulators, (one in particular that is awesome) that I have used and work and are less costly, without the nasty side effects. Ill be posting a review on it soon. ;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. This is my second bottle and the last one lasted for 6 months. I had to order 2 more bottles for girl friends of mine because after seeing my beautiful lashes they were true believers.</li>
            <li> When I used lilash for the first time 3 weeks ago, I found irritation and redness around my eyes on the following whole day.  Therefore I stopped to use the product and began to search the relevant reports.  One report which is helpful to me is that many women made complaints on this product is due to incorrect use.  Finally I realized that I put too much lilash on my lashline which caused the irritation and redness.  Since lilash is concentrate, customers are suggested to use only a small amount.  Then I started to use very little amount and I found that I&#x27;ve no more redness around my eyes and my eyelashes are growing a bit longer now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about lash growing products but after reading other reviews I decided to try this.  I have to say that I am very pleased with this product and it really does make your lashes grow thicker and longer.  I wore fake lashes for years and basically ruined my own.  I am going on a trip to Europe and did not want to wear my fake lashes on the trip.  Lilash has made my own lashes come back in thicker and so far they continue to grow in length but it is still too soon to know the complete results. I have used this product for only three weeks. I hope to see ongoing results. My eyelashes are not coming in darker as the product states it does but that is ok. I am just happy to see eyelashes growing in .  I will continue to use this product. I think it is better than Revitalash which I have used in the past and did not get the same results as with Lilash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for four weeks now and I am very disappointed that there have been no results at all. I was counting on the \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; results but it just has no effect on me. now I am waiting on a refund.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is working.  Maybe I&#x27;ve not given it enough time.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  Maybe a little longer lashes on the right eye but not the left.  I&#x27;ve used Latese before which made a lot of my eyelashes fall out.  What did grow, grew in nice and long but I had lots of bare spots.  At least I&#x27;ve got all my eyelashes intact with LiLash.  I&#x27;ll give it a little longer and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This lash grower is wonderful.  Works better than I could imagine and it lasts a long time.  An excellent value for the price and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> I used LiLash for 2 weeks.  My eyelids started itching so I discontinued use.  It is now one week later and my lids still itch, are red and swollen.  My lashes are more sparse and are falling out.  I am devastated!    I hope LiLash has not permanently damaged my lashes.  Can any one share if they had this reaction ... if so...when will the itching and swelling stop and will my lashes grow back in?</li>
            <li> The product works as described.  I noticed longer lashes after 3 weeks, even though once or twice I forgot to put it on.  I&#x27;ll probably cut back to using it every other day because I don&#x27;t want my lashes to get too long.    Only drawback: when I first began using it, it caused a little bit of redness (only noticiable without make-up) at the outer corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> I am probably one of the most skeptical people ever  but will try anything one . I bought Lilash  because I had really short lashes and when I had big functions always had falsies on , and so I thought if only this product will do half of what it says  I will be happy . Within 1 month I saw  that my lashes had grown longer but the difference was very modest, I continued to use this product intermittently probably 3-4 times a week for the last 4 months , are u kidding me , my lashes are sooo long . I cant even wear mascara to work  anymore , and definitely no more falsies for me. My only problem is I dont know how long the effect last for and if I need to keep using it long term .   P.s I had no sideeffects at all</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of any product promising to lengthen lashes but was willing to try based on other reviews.  IT REALLY WORKS! This is my second tube.  It took about 6 weeks to really notice.  I have been very pleased with this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I started using Lilash 2 days ago and I have dark circles under my eyes, a dark line appears where I apply the product and my eyelids are red and irritating. Also when I apply it, my skin is kind a itchy... According the Lilash webpage, the irritation could decrease if I reduce the frequency of use, so maybe I will use it every 2-3 days. but if the symtoms continue, I wont risk to have dark circles for long lashes. it does not worth it!!! BTW, Revitalash also leave dark circles!</li>
            <li> I love Lilash.  Never had good eyelashes in my life, unless they were glued on, until I began using this product.  It is also easy to use and does not irritate eyes.  Results are quite amazing, however, you do have to keep using it to maintain.</li>
            <li> Bought this and have been using for a few weeks. No effect whatsoever, which is unbelievable considering the price.   Think twice before purchasing this. May not be worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I just want to make it clear that I wasn&#x27;t able to apply the product as regularly as I would like to and it was probably the reason why my lashes are falling out. But the thing is, I was expecting for this to make my lashes stronger, thus preventing premature fall-out and promoting lashes&#x27; maximum length. I didn&#x27;t know the effect was temporary. Also, it was not that the lashes were already too long so they just fell out. My lashes didn&#x27;t lengthen, just weaken.    If I had applied it regularly, I&#x27;d probably be raving about it like others who&#x27;ve had successful results, but what happens if I already have long lashes and I&#x27;m done with the whole bottle? No, it&#x27;s not gonna be part of my budget forever. I&#x27;m not setting aside $100 once or twice a year to buy Lilash. Other people would probably be OK with that though, especially if it&#x27;s important for their career or it improves their self-image. As for myself, I changed my goal of having long lashes to having healthy lashes and went back to cheap, natural ingredients of old.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse and LiLash over the last year.  What I have found is that I prefer LiLash over Latisse.  Latisse is more expensive, costing me $120 for a bottle locally.  The bottle lasts maybe 2 months, application is messy, and there is a lot of waste with the poorly designed application method (I know the FDA likes it for sanitary reasons and Allergan likes it for generating quicker refills), but it is a comfortable product.  LiLash worked better for me.  My lashes grew longer than with Latisse, the bottle lasts for 5-6 months, and the application is simple with no waste- just like putting on regualr liquid eyeliner.  So I got better results with a less expensive product.  There is a trade-off, though.  I do have some itching on my eyelids at night with the LiLash.  I wash it off in the morning when I wash my face to put my makeup on, just like I did with Latisse. It&#x27;s worth the itching to get the better results and to save the extra money.  And I love having fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li> I like this because unlike Latisse, you don&#x27;t have to go to a doctor which cuts down on costs! This stuff has worked wonders for me! I use it almost everyday sometimes twice a day, it just kind of depends. I have not had any problems with a brown line appearing where I apply it like some other reviewers have said. I have had zero irritation, no redness or puffiness, the only thing is that sometimes it makes my eye itch where I applied it, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I used to have short ugly lashes that were sparse and wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl from my eyelash curler. Now they are long and luscious and they have natural curl (but I still curl them with an eyelash curler and they hold it REALLY well, like AMAZINGLY well). They look almost like I have extensions, but just not as long. I will use this stuff forever!!! I can&#x27;t go back to my natural lashes now that I have these babies! I have noticed some fine, dark hairs down below my lower lashes, kind of on my upper cheekbone growing due to the lilash, but its not a big deal, I just pluck them out and they are gone! My bottle has lasted probably 3 months so far, and it seems like its running low, although I can&#x27;t really tell since I can&#x27;t see inside the bottle. But to me, it&#x27;s worth it because I have struggled all my life with my lashes!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before buying LiLash and even when I first started using the product.  How could something SO expensive actually work.  Well, I&#x27;m no longer a skeptic.  After about a month I now have thicker, fuller, longer lashes.  (Even in the corners where they were non-existent to begin with.#  How it works?  I have no idea.  But it does!      The first day I used it, my eyes were a little red and irritated, but not unbearable.  After the 1st day of use, I haven&#x27;t had anymore redness or irritation.  I also read the comments about sometimes changing the color of blue eyes to blue eyes with brown speckles.  I have blue eyes and thankfully have not seen a change in their color.    The first week or so I thought I noticed a difference in my eyelash thickness/fullness, but thought I was just &#x27;seeing what I wanted to see&#x27;.  After about 4 weeks, walah!!!  It&#x27;s true -- they are actually thicker, fuller, and longer.  I use to wear Loreal Double Extend mascara to get the thicker, fuller, longer look.  Now I&#x27;m back to using the Maybelline Great Lash #you know the one in the pink container# and I get the same dramatic results, times 10.    I plan to continue to use the product.  The thin applicator is super easy to use.  And the vendor was great!  I received the product in it&#x27;s original packaging in great condition and the delivery time was just a couple of days after placing my order.</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash in the past with NO side effects and got amazing results.  LiLash I cannot yet say if it works but the pain and suffering in the mean time is NOT worth it.  Upon application I feel like I have Vaseline caked around my eyes, when I awake in the morning it appears that I pulled an all nighter smoking pot my eyes are red and veiny and they burn and I feel like I didn&#x27;t even get adequate sleep because my freaking eyes burn all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have watched utube videos and reread the directions making sure I don&#x27;t apply directly on my lash line.  I&#x27;ve tried using it every other day.  I&#x27;ve tried stopping for a week and starting again but it just irritates my eyes beyond believe.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I really want this product to work for me but I think I will have to give it up I cannot tolerate the side effects.</li>
            <li> Okay soo, people seem to think that they will get results in just a few weeks.  It does not work that quickly.  It actually takes time.  I have been using the product for almost 3 months.  It is unfortunate to those who have irritations from the product.  I have had NO bad reactions and NO color changes. My eyes are green/blue.  Most of the reactions are from people who use too much of the product.  You need to wipe off all the product from the brush onto the side of the bottle. Then only use a very very small amount.  The product works great.  My eyelashes are thicker and much longer.  I already had decent sized eyelashes, but i can say in less then 3 months they grew at least a quarter of an inch longer.  I feel them hit my eyebrows when i fully open my eyes now.  For those who gave this product a 1 Star who had no reactions, give the product more time to work.  It doesnt work overnight.      For those who had dry and itchy eyelids from this.  Dont wash it off with regular face soap.  Use johnson n johnson baby shampoo.  it will help a lot with any dryness of your eyelids...</li>
            <li> I am seeing results already after only 1 month (I have applied it twice some days) and ther is NO eye irritation.  I highly recommend this product; it was very moderately priced, too, compared to competitors.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered Lilash.  It is truly an amazing product that does what it claims to.  My results have been excellent and I intend to continue using and recommending Lilash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long eyelashes...the kind that make me try on several pairs of sunglasses before finding a pair that my eyelashes wouldn&#x27;t bang into and give me a headache. In fact, the first time I put on mascara as a teenager, my mother yelled at me wanting to know where I got the false eyelashes! My lashes are naturally light so you don&#x27;t realize how long they are until I have mascara on them. Anyway, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, they have gotten a little thinner and so I wanted to see if there was a way of making them thicker. After reading reviews about eyelash enhancers/stimulators, I decided to try Lilash. I began using it at the end of December. In the last month (early March) people began asking me if I had eyelash extensions, or the individual ones that you pay A LOT of money for put on. I have someone that dyes my lashes dark before I go on vacation so I don&#x27;t need mascara in the water, ask when I got eyelash extensions! They are so long now that my sunglasses that did work now have to be 1/2 inch further down my nose so my lashes don&#x27;t bang into the lenses and give me a headache! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, I noticed my lashes felt thicker at the base.  It&#x27;s now been 4 weeks and I have full, long eyelashes!  Never once did I experience any irritation and I have very sensitive skin around my eyes!  I love it LiLash - no more false eyelashes for me!</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions, which were a total waste of money and to be honest, not that great. After finding out about this product, I took the plunge and bought it. I am soooooooo happy with it! I did have a little bit of irritation from the product, but it didn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;ve been diligently using this for about 4 months now and my lashes have never looked better. It took about 4 weeks or so to see noticeable results and my eyelashes have only gotten better and better. I have people all the time asking me if I have false eyelashes on or if I have extensions. They truly cannot believe they are my own eyelashes. I don&#x27;t even wear mascara most days and they still look incredible. You should see when I do put mascara on....OMG! It&#x27;s almost too dramatic. My husband told me just last night that I might want to stop using the product cuz my eyelashes are almost out of control in length. I just may have to trim them! I will continue using the product for maintenance every other day or so. I don&#x27;t want to completely stop using it because I understand that they&#x27;ll eventually return to normal if you stop using it, so I&#x27;ll use it every other day and see how that goes. I just bought a second bottle and I&#x27;m sure that will last me a very long time seeing that the first one lasted for 4 months (and there&#x27;s still a little bit left yet in the first bottle.) I wholeheartedly endorse this product! Another thing, I have saved money on mascara since I never hardly wear it anymore.</li>
            <li> My product NEVER ARRIVED!   I e-mailed, called and then had to argue with the salesperson - who suggested that I chase down my mail carrier!   I ORDER ON LINE ALL THE TIME AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED!   It took way too much time and energy to get this issue resolved -- I WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THE PRODUCT - my neighbor uses it and I was going on her recommendation.   Too bad I never got to try it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! My lashes were terrible they were short and sparse in some places i didn&#x27;t even have any. I was very skeptical about lilash because nothing has ever worked for me and its pretty pricy so I was reluctant to try it. I thought i&#x27;d give it a try and wow am I glad I did! The first few days of using lilash my eyes were really itchy and a little red. That went away after about a week, and I can use it now with zero irritation. My eyelids haven&#x27;t had any pigment problems they look normal no dark line and my eyes haven&#x27;t changed color at all. My tube ran out and I haven&#x27;t got around to ordering a new one, its been 7 months without it and my eyelashes STILL look amazing. They are so much stronger no more falling out. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone. Alot of peole in my family have been very pleased with lilash results as well.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I could see an improvement in about two weeks.  I have been using it about three now and my eyelashes are already longer and a little thicker - but definitely longer.  The first night or two my eyes felt sensitive and a little red in the morning, so I skipped using it one night, started again and it has been fine since.  I don&#x27;t have any other product to compare it to, but I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> You need to have a lot of patience to wait and see how this product will work on you.  To date I can see some improvement after 2 weeks usage.  Be willing to hang in there.  I hung in there and my lashes are longer and a little thicker..2 months later.  But there is random itching.  I agree that the older you are, results may be slower and more limited.  However, a cousin in her very late 60&#x27;s started using the product and her lashes are currently incredible.........so who knows????  I have not experienced any discoloration of the eyelids.  Good Luck to all of you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really evaluate the effectiveness of this product. It makes my eyelids so itchy that I had to stop using it after one week.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product, but I was desperate, so after reading some of the other reviews, I decided to try it just once. I was down to only a few skimpy wisps, and I never used mascara because I was afraid more eyelashes would fall out. Fast forward a couple of months: I now have really long, lush eyelashes. I still can&#x27;t believe this product worked until I look in the mirror.  And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company; I don&#x27;t even know who makes this stuff or what&#x27;s in it, and I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s amazing.  I followed the directions exactly.)    Okay, here is my 11/11 update,  almost 1 and 1/2 years later.  Lilash was really pricey when I first bought it, so I tried a few other products, including RapidLash and Maxolash.  My eyelashes did nothing on RapidLash, and on Maxolash they started falling out again (and it stung!).  So... recently I went back to LiLash (it&#x27;s cheaper now, thank goodness), and my lashes started growing longer and thicker again.  The only small thing is that they don&#x27;t all grow to even lengths.  But I can live with that.   I did call the company, by the way; they said that the pigment change is a problem with the prescription product, not this one. I did not experience that at all.</li>
            <li> I used lilash for about 2 1/2 weeks before I saw a change in may lashes.  It was great by 10 weeks.  My lashes had grown about twice as long and some very long</li>
            <li> I had cancer several years ago, the chemo not only makes the hair on your head fall out; it also makes your eyelashes fall out.  Some of my eyelashes did come back...fewer and shorter.  I finally purchased LiLash, I did not actually think it would work, but it was worth a try.  My lashes are great! Long and thick!  I have one more part of my body back, one more thing that does not remind me of cost of cancer.  It works! Give it a try.  Terri M.</li>
            <li> After using it for once, I have to stop because both of my eyelids became swollen and painful. It took a few days to heal. I hope I could get my refund.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT 2009 AND WAS NOT SURE IF IT WOULD WORK BUT IT GOT SUCH GREAT REVIEWS THAT I HAD TO TRY IT. IT TOOK FEW MONTHS BUT IT WORKS MY LASHES ARE ENVIED BY ALL MY  FRIENDS.I LOOK LIKE I HAVE FAKE EYELASHES BEFORE THAT MY LASHES WERE ALWAYS FALLING OUT AND WERE VERY SHORT I&#x27;AM SO VERY HAPPY I GAVE IT A TRY. THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY SIS THAT IT DOES DARKEN YOUR EYE LIDS BUT I DON&#x27;T HAVE A PROMBLEM WITH THAT YES I WOULD RECOMMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND</li>
            <li> I can only speak for my experience.  I am so pleased w/ this product.  I had non-existent lashes before I started using this.  Seriously, I had to get within an inch of the mirror to actually see my lashes.  After using Lilash for about a week I could see an improvement.  Within about 2 months I could actually see my lashes in from like 6 feet away and even in my shadow (I know weird - but when you don&#x27;t have lashes you notice these things).  I have been using it for about 3 months now and my lashes practically hit my lids!  As for sensitive eyes, mine are VERY sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.  It does leave your eyelids darker, which is only a bonus for me.  I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara or eyeliner!  As for the darkening of the eyes, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change - if anything my eyes look a little lighter, but then I have brown eyes to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lilash for 6 weeks and have followed the directions exactly. I have short, thin, pale lashes. I have not noticed ANY difference or improvement in length, darkness or thickness since the day I started. I will continue using Lilash for 90 days with the hope I am just a *late bloomer*. With all the positive reviews I have read I am disappointed with my results. I have experienced some irritation with Lilash..bloodshot eyes, redness and itchiness of lids.</li>
            <li> Product was advertised to make a big difference in eyelash appearance.  It was ranked as high as Latisse for results achieved on the website.  I have not used Latisse but this seems to just be an eyelash conditioner.  Overall I am ok with the results given the price and how long the LiLash is supposed to last (at least 4 months).  My lashes do not appear to be thicker just overall better conditioned, not as brittle.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! It took about 2-3 months, but once you notice it is working, the result is remarkable.  Make sure to take \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture, and take again after each month to see the result!</li>
            <li> Since I am not a fan of fake eyelashes and always find difficulty to put it on my eyes, I bought this product as the alternative. After reviewing many other similar products, this one is the best and within reasonable price range. I received the product in quite fast delivery, and immediately tried it on. It took about 3 to 4 weeks to see the result, while my daughter got the results faster than me. The eyelash grows longer and darker, even curler. What I like about this product is that the growing process is not dramatic and look natural, yet still visible to notice. I give 5 stars because it gives results to both my daughter and me and we are satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the end of December.  I follow the instructions very closely.  I saw results in exactly 4 weeks!!  My eyelashes are simply amazing!  It&#x27;s been 5 months now and I cannot tell you how many compliments I have received on them!!!  My lashes are longer and thicker than ever before.  The only side effects I experienced were a little itching at first, and red eye lids, at times.  I now use it about 4 to 5 times a week.</li>
