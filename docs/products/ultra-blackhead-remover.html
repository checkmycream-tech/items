    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>great store to buy from.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product and is so great.</li>
            <li>looks great and works</li>
            <li>This one works much better than the loop style versions and has the perfect size openings and shape(like a spoon) to get the job done.</li>
            <li>but i have heard lots of great reviews so hopefully its good!:)</li>
            <li>Works great, I love it!  </li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as was described in the listing.</li>
            <li>Using this product is much more efficient than squeezing.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>but this one is much better.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you watch how-to YouTube videos on this method of blackhead removal.</li>
            <li>so your pores are nice and open.</li>
            <li>I just never was able to get the pressure localized enough for an extraction.</li>
            <li>but you need to apply more pressure with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;two different hole sizes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it right after a hot shower</li>
            <li>On this one, there isn&#x27;t much difference in size between the two ends, which means it doesn&#x27;t really matter which end</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually bother leaving reviews,but I have purchased 4 other ones here on Amazon and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Not sturdy at s ll very cheap material find a better one this is no good !!</li>
            <li>It is too short to apply a decent amount of pressure (basic physics tells us longer lever &#x3D; greater force applied).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I think the difference is that the two end areas don&#x27;t scoop in as much as the old one.</li>
            <li>Doesnt work very well in comparisson to a different one we order years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scraped the top layer of skin which made my face hurt and made my skin look worse.</li>

            <li> The device itself is flat, with no curve, so there&#x27;s no leverage when it comes to removed the blackhead.  </li>
            <li> Also, the opening (hole) which it to surround the blackhead and then remove it is so flat that it cannot be used to put pressure on the skin to remove the blackhead.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works for others who have those big black heads but for the tiny ones around the nose, all it did was hurt and leave red marks which lasted for days.</li>
            <li> My old one also had a smaller small hole than this one.</li>
            <li> Both ends should be an opened circle (one smaller than the other), but one was still shut.</li>
            <li> The ends with the holes where too thick (or something) to lay flat enough on the face to actually remove the blackhead/whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I Have a couple of sisters and a brother as well as a son and they have black heads which I take out when possible.</li>
            <li> Didnt do what I expected nor what the title said it would.</li>
            <li> It removes only a few blackheads.</li>
            <li> Removes black heads and pimples with minimal pain/effort.  </li>
            <li> to order another one, misplaced the one</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> not smooth circles made indents in head and cut skin</li>
            <li> the item is smaller than I expected, and very thin.</li>
            <li> What I actually received had two small, thin oval shapes at the ends and looked of poor quality.</li>
            <li> One end broke off and the other is difficult to use</li>
            <li> Sadly this product did not remove anyone of my blackheads nor the bfs black heads.</li>
            <li> This little gadget was absolutley useless for me.  </li>
            <li> This has to be one of the worst things ive purchased from amazon.shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Difficult to hold and apply any pressure.</li>
            <li> It removed difficult comedones.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but this tool did a very poor job extracting blackheads and ended up in the garbage soon after purchasing.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had one of these blackhead remover that was a Revlon brand. I lost it, and I haven&#x27;t found one like it. I thought this one looked like it, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as well. I think the difference is that the two end areas don&#x27;t scoop in as much as the old one. That must affect the pressure it applies on the area around the blackhead. This product works on some blackheads, but it doesn&#x27;t work on all of them. My old one also had a smaller small hole than this one. On this one, there isn&#x27;t much difference in size between the two ends, which means it doesn&#x27;t really matter which end you use. That could also be affecting why it only works on some blackheads.</li>
            <li> Too flat, would like sharper edges around the holes. Difficult to hold and apply any pressure.</li>
            <li> One end broke off and the other is difficult to use</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as was described in the listing. The strength of this product, it truly is unbending during use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work very well in comparisson to a different one we order years ago.</li>
            <li> not at all like the one I was looking for, It doesnt work without scratching your face</li>
            <li> It works, you need to know HOW to use&lt;br /&gt;the product correctly. Fast shipping,&lt;br /&gt;and great store to buy from.&lt;br /&gt;If you have blackheads instead of digging&lt;br /&gt;your nails in your face get this!.. I actually&lt;br /&gt;need to order another one, misplaced the one I purchased,&lt;br /&gt;lol!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product and is so great. I Have a couple of sisters and a brother as well as a son and they have black heads which I take out when possible.</li>
            <li> I just ordered one and it hasn&#x27;t come yet but i have heard lots of great reviews so hopefully its good!:)</li>
            <li> Not sturdy at s ll very cheap material find a better one this is no good !!</li>
            <li> I did NOT receive what is posted in the picture. What I actually received had two small, thin oval shapes at the ends and looked of poor quality. Did not even open it - sent it back immediately.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The device itself is flat, with no curve, so there&#x27;s no leverage when it comes to removed the blackhead.  Also, the opening (hole) which it to surround the blackhead and then remove it is so flat that it cannot be used to put pressure on the skin to remove the blackhead.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> gave them away as gifts</li>
            <li> looks great and works just wish the holes were smaller</li>
            <li> spend xtra money for revlon</li>
            <li> The product was defected. Both ends should be an opened circle (one smaller than the other), but one was still shut. The metal inside the circle did not break open as it should&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  It removed difficult comedones. This product gets out the comedones from deep within the pores. I am very happy with the performance of this product. Using this product is much more efficient than squeezing.</li>
            <li> Didnt do what I expected nor what the title said it would. It&#x27;s scraped the top layer of skin which made my face hurt and made my skin look worse. After using product on the back area it would become puffy and the skin would raise up... Sadly this product did not remove anyone of my blackheads nor the bfs black heads.</li>
            <li> This little gadget was absolutley useless for me.  Maybe it works for others who have those big black heads but for the tiny ones around the nose, all it did was hurt and leave red marks which lasted for days.</li>
            <li> both sides were the same size circle. way too big for blackheads. not smooth circles made indents in head and cut skin</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but this tool did a very poor job extracting blackheads and ended up in the garbage soon after purchasing.  I just never was able to get the pressure localized enough for an extraction.</li>
            <li> This one works much better than the loop style versions and has the perfect size openings and shape(like a spoon) to get the job done. I don&#x27;t usually bother leaving reviews,but I have purchased 4 other ones here on Amazon and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> the item is smaller than I expected, and very thin. It does the job but you need to apply more pressure with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;two different hole sizes. the length is about 3 inches.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. Had the Revlon one for years but this one is much better. Just make sure you watch how-to YouTube videos on this method of blackhead removal.</li>
            <li> The ends with the holes where too thick (or something) to lay flat enough on the face to actually remove the blackhead/whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Works great, I love it!  Removes black heads and pimples with minimal pain/effort.  I highly recommend using it right after a hot shower so your pores are nice and open.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the worst things ive purchased from amazon.shipping was fast. but the produst does not work at all</li>
            <li> Does not work as it says. It removes only a few blackheads. I would not purchase again. It is too short to apply a decent amount of pressure (basic physics tells us longer lever &#x3D; greater force applied).</li>
