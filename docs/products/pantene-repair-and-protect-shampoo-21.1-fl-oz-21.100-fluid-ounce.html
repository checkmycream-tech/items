            <li> Great shampoo, got it for $3.71</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work quite as advertised. I was happy with it at first, but it seems like the more I use it the more product is required to get the same result...like my body is becoming accustomed to it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody else see this?</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo. It made my hair smell great and look great. I will buy it again.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review</li>

            <li> Great shampoo!Smells good and makes hair soft!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo at a great price!!</li>
            <li> great product at low price</li>
            <li> See my review of 25.4 oz size.</li>
            <li> Favorite go to for my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This Pantene Repair &amp; Protect Shampoo, 21.1 Fl Oz, 21.100-Fluid Ounce is what i have a subscribed for the family. The shampoo has a very silky smooth feeling and  for me it was just a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Received product as promised and in good shape</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after this. The only reason it&#x27;s 4 stars is because it has the stereotypical girly shampoo smell and I&#x27;m a guy (it doesn&#x27;t smell like a lumberjack!)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, but remember to also buy the conditioner. It helped my hair in just one wash. It already looks healthier and can&#x27;t beat the price. I think i found my new shampoo and conitioner!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and works well.  We have some professional (and much more expensive) shampoos and conditioners in the master bedroom, but, if you ask me, this stuff works just as well.  We keep this Pantene shampoo in the guest bathroom, but I&#x27;ve used it myself and it is great!</li>
            <li> My hair is very shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene products for years and have been using this product for about a year now.  I have noticed that my hair is stronger than it was prior to changing to this formula.  I made the mistake of getting my hair done by an inexperienced stylist and was scrambling to do everything to get my hair back to its previous healthy condition.  It works in the first application and gets better with each use.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a more economic solution to a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> Needless to say Pantene well known Shampoo products. Got this on very good deal. Love It.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes me hair feel and smell.. have always been a Pantene lover.. Thanks Pantene!!</li>
            <li> This Pantene Repair &amp; Protect Shampoo, 21.1 Fl Oz, 21.100-Fluid Ounce was much more like shampoo&amp;conditioner combo in my opinion. the shampoo has a very silky smoothe feeling rather than regular gel kind typed shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;but for me it was just a bang for the price. &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price through Amazon in exchange for an honest review of this product. I love the smell. Pantene is a name I trust.My hair is softer and easier to comb through after I use this product and my hair is color treated. Thank You</li>
            <li> My wife and 5 year old use this constantly because of the hair type. My daughter&#x27;s is very thick and difficult to manager and this product works very well for a great price.</li>
