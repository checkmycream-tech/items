            <li>I bought this Eucalyptus oil because of the large quantity for a low price.  </li>

            <li> It has a somewhat offensive smell to it, and only slightly resembles the smell of \\&quot;normal\\&quot; Eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li> after fees the previously used brand was actually cheaper.</li>
            <li> this oil smells like they used eucalyptus leaves that were fallen to the ground and partially decomposed,</li>

            <li> musty smell compared to other eucalyptus oils i have purchased.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before purchasing this Eucalyptus Oil.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other oils on Amazon from other vendors and never had a problem with them.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how this product was processed but the quality of the essential oil wasn&#x27;t what I was used to receiving.</li>
            <li> In the past, it has been a different brand offered at the 20 something dollar price.</li>
            <li> Please allow up to 72 hours for your refund to process.*&lt;br /&gt;So, they are at least refunding my money after I sent my last email.</li>
            <li> It actually smells like Eucalyptus mixed with dirty gym socks or vomit.</li>
            <li> waste of my money will not buy again.</li>
            <li> pour a small amount in a bowl and allow it to make room smell spa like.)  </li>
            <li> I told them I would gladly accept the refund but that they were missing the point~~selling a bad product is bad.</li>
            <li> and  I decided after reading all of these bad reviews to let them know that to me, it diminished my trust in their brand to have such a poor quality product out there, making me wonder about the quality of their supplements, which I use regularly.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment...</li>
            <li> Vitacost already deleted my previous review so we&#x27;ll see if they keep this one!!!</li>
            <li> I let Vitacost know how awful mine smelled, but by the time I used it, too much time had passed to refund according to their policy.</li>
            <li> smells really bad compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> But I just received this product and poured a small amount out and the smell is quite unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> My husband suffers from allergies.  </li>
            <li> My husband said it smelled like dirty socks</li>
            <li> Fleas hate this stuff</li>
            <li> This is absolutely awful!</li>
            <li> I had to wash items to get the terrible smell out.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> I bought this Eucalyptus oil because of the large quantity for a low price.  It said that it was 100% pure, so I thought it had to be good.  When I used it the first time, I realized that it did not smell like any of the Eucalyptus oil I have purchased in the past.  It has a somewhat offensive smell to it, and only slightly resembles the smell of \\&quot;normal\\&quot; Eucalyptus oil.  A big disappointment...</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 star rating because other places I checked cost more for 2-4 oz. This product is strong and I use it in my vaporizer during the winter for my kids. If it is too strong it can be diluted down. I would recommend this product, and I have, to my friends and family without question.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Value. Prompt delivery.concentrated, use sparingly...When needed to purchase again, will reorder the product. I would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> this oil smells like they used eucalyptus leaves that were fallen to the ground and partially decomposed, my guess. it is not freash smelling at all. musty smell compared to other eucalyptus oils i have purchased.</li>
            <li> We use this all the time and it is great! Smells great. Works wonders on your skin. Excellent price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent smell and works great for the curing oils for arthritis and ease to mix with other oils that we mix it with</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a really good price.  My husband suffers from allergies.  We add the oil to diffusers and they put out an enoyable scent that helps with his congestion.</li>
            <li> Good value for price.</li>
            <li> NO HOME SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS WONDERFUL HELP..COLDS  SINUS  AROMATHERAPY STEAM</li>
            <li> this has many properties to it and can be used for alot of things.  Fleas hate this stuff and so they cannot survive, put into a bottle with water and mist the area....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it wasn &#x27;t very strong compared to the others i have bought more imitation smell which is why it&#x27;s in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely awful! My husband said it smelled like dirty socks and I agree.  I had to wash items to get the terrible smell out.  Vitacost already deleted my previous review so we&#x27;ll see if they keep this one!!!</li>
            <li> I let Vitacost know how awful mine smelled, but by the time I used it, too much time had passed to refund according to their policy. Many months passed and  I decided after reading all of these bad reviews to let them know that to me, it diminished my trust in their brand to have such a poor quality product out there, making me wonder about the quality of their supplements, which I use regularly. I do not buy them through Amazon, but directly from them and I don&#x27;t think that should matter.Here&#x27;s what they sent me today~~&lt;br /&gt;*Unfortunately, we do only have a 30-Return Policy. However, as a onetime courtesy we was able to issue a refund back for the item for $21.55. Please allow up to 72 hours for your refund to process.*&lt;br /&gt;So, they are at least refunding my money after I sent my last email. I told them I would gladly accept the refund but that they were missing the point~~selling a bad product is bad. Once more the squeaky wheel was oiled.</li>
            <li> Great product and highly aromatic.  We use it in our home steam room and spa.  A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a great value.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before purchasing this Eucalyptus Oil.  I have purchased other oils on Amazon from other vendors and never had a problem with them.  All we use them for is aromatherapy (pour a small amount in a bowl and allow it to make room smell spa like.)  But I just received this product and poured a small amount out and the smell is quite unpleasant.  It actually smells like Eucalyptus mixed with dirty gym socks or vomit. Pardon the graphic description, but that is LITERALLY what this smells like.  I will be requesting a full refund from Vitacost vendor immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> Vey good.  Could almost qualify as a PANACEA.  I like the 100%  Pure and having been distilled which spells SAFE for USING.</li>
            <li> very happy packaging was great  smell  very wonderful keeps a strong scent all the time I use in vaporizer very happy.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS (THE FREAKIN BOMB)!! LOL! FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE SAYING HAH, MEANS IT&#x27;S AWESOME!! :) PUT A CAP FULL IN YOUR BATH WATER LIGHT SOME CANDLES AND USE YOUR BATH PILLOW, LAY BACK AND YOU&#x27;LL SEE WHY IT SO GREAT! OH, DON&#x27;T FORGET THE JAZZ. SUGGESTION: EARL KLUGH. :)</li>
            <li> smells really bad compared to other brands.  waste of my money will not buy again. found other brands to be far better such as edens garden.  the only problem is it comes in 10ml bottles only.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product was processed but the quality of the essential oil wasn&#x27;t what I was used to receiving.</li>
            <li> all i can say it is great&lt;br /&gt;now i must fill in several words to make this system fly&lt;br /&gt;bye</li>
            <li> I order the 16 oz of Eucalyptus order every month.  This time it smelled like rotten feet. I am not even kidding. Horrible. I had to throw out 45 batches of home made lotions, etc. I also use it on my bed pillows for my husbands allergies.  we had to get up last night and change out the pillows. I will never use this brand again. In the past, it has been a different brand offered at the 20 something dollar price. never had a problem.  Will pay more for the previous brand used.  UPDATE- just checked and after fees the previously used brand was actually cheaper. Will go back to NOW brand and never use the Vitacost brand again.</li>
