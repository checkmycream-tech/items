            <li>I have had this for over a year now and it works awesome.</li>
            <li>What doesn&#x27;t make sense is that Norelco sells a beard trimmer that does have a setting that&#x27;s perfect, but not this unit.</li>

            <li>The body trimming capability of this unit with the body trimming comb is good - gives me a capability that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li>Once you understand the idiosyncracies of the guide you are in good shape.</li>
            <li>Good backup time.</li>
            <li>Does what is says and seems to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>my mb-300 did just as good.  </li>

            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>For the price though I think it&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>

            <li>The product is really good and handy.</li>
            <li>The attachments are very nice, the shaver attachment shown in the photo is great for quickly removing hair.  </li>
            <li>2 year warrantee and sensational results all add up to an excellent buy for a personal groomer that performs beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>Got it yesterday and that part did an amazing job.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a trimmer from Sharper Image for years that was Amazing.</li>
            <li>- Nice docking bay for charging and holding all attachments  - Wet/dry operation  </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice pouch to hold all the items and the razor.  </li>
            <li>It even comes with a nice case and well-thought-out caddy that holds your commonly-used attachments.</li>
            <li>I liked using the screen option shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>, it looks nice and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li>that for body it is nice</li>
            <li>hair trimmer works nicely</li>
            <li>but whatever, it&#x27;s nice to use it in the shower to trim my balls</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and beard.</li>
            <li>You know this WAS a nice system and had alot going for it..</li>
            <li>Well, just bought him his own, planning on giving it to him as a gift.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the shaver one, because I have a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>I honestly wonder how this ever made it into production.</li>
            <li>(my sweetie has a beautiful bald head on top) and then clean up the nape of his neck.</li>
            <li>Battery life is great and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>The razor does vibrate very strongly, but it is not bothersome to me.  </li>
            <li>It is well designed and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is very easy to store and plug in.  </li>
            <li>beard/mustache comb seemed to get clogged up very easily to where it didn&#x27;t seem to be trimming anymore.</li>
            <li>Perhaps there&#x27;s no device that&#x27;ll give a great trim/shave without spending hundreds, in which case this gives a decent trim for a good price.</li>
            <li>but.... it would be nice to be able to use it without having to worry about the thing coming off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great shaver for men who don&#x27;t have the right equipment to control their hair growth.</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>It is soo comfortable and close and never tugs.the clipper attachment is so accurate and requires very little skill.and for the mini foil trimmer,is perfect for etching designs if you like.i am very pleased with this mans best friend.</li>
            <li>My old remington mb-300 was perfect and had more \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; settings.  </li>
            <li>Great price prompt delivery and was exactly what i thought it was.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Good battery life, charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I have not tested all the options that comes with this, but so far is a very good deal, I would recomend it.</li>
            <li>My favorite shaving/grooming shaver, ordered this Jan 2013</li>
            <li>more words were required to post</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better for close quarters &amp; travel, more attachments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review when I have had more time with it.</li>
            <li>-scaping,\\&quot; but I just want to shave and trim in the morning without focusing more than I have</li>
            <li>I am minimalist polishing a book on that topic and this device fits my system because it has so many features.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he seems to love it, haven&#x27;t heard any complaints yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a well-made and stylish kit.</li>
            <li>Works great and very east to change all the pieces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a phenomenal device.</li>
            <li>The design is ingenious with the ability to swap clippers and the guides that attach to them.  </li>
            <li>He has a full beard and is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The rest of it has turned out to be okay.</li>
            <li>use most attachments and the battery has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>This groomer was purchased to simply keep a beard at stubble length and it works perfectly for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Love the body trimmer portion of this already.</li>
            <li>I have called customer support and have been waiting more than four weeks for a replacement.</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best clipper I have bought.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this model.</li>
            <li>I have been using various shaving devices over the years but have never been as impressed over the quality and function as the multi pro by Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item after reading the many reviews here which raved about it.</li>
            <li>Once I turned on the shaver and started trimming, the top loosened and flew off.</li>
            <li>I read the many reviews and was optimistic about the Norelco Multigroom Pro shaver.  </li>
            <li>This thing still works after I have been dropping it in the shower many times.</li>
            <li>After trying several others this one is the best,</li>
            <li>This, with its dual clippers and foil does a awesome job even after a weeks growth of facial hair.</li>
            <li>, very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer is good, I wouldn&#x27;t say amazing, but it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>keep my hair short so the hair clipper attachment is perfect and works well.</li>
            <li>She does say that it works better than any groomer she has ever bought.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remember being more satisfied.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>slower and more time consuming.  </li>
            <li>For armpits, it was ok.  </li>
            <li>Up by the top of my chest</li>
            <li>Well, for most people, it will disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it :-)</li>
            <li>This product more than exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve accidentally removed them many times while just trying to adjust the comb</li>
            <li>They made many improvements to this one: better attachments, the upgraded battery.  </li>
            <li>The thing i like the most is charging stand and it needs only 1hr time to charge which is excellent.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews before making this purchase.  </li>
            <li>used most of the attachments already</li>
            <li>I have been trimming my facial hair for over 35 years and this is the best trimmer ever.</li>
            <li>Good Battery Life and the accessories are useful.</li>
            <li>It shaves great and fast.</li>
            <li>Trimming sure, detail trimming and shaving</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a pretty nice set, though the stand isn&#x27;t great and doesn&#x27;t hold as many attachments as you&#x27;ll need to get through anything like a full face grooming.</li>
            <li>Glad they also threw in a bag to hold the rest of the pieces, as you&#x27;ll need to pull that out too almost any time you use this.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is ok.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s this for?&amp;#34; many times...</li>
            <li>As with many multi grooming tools, it does some functions better than others.</li>
            <li>There is cracks all over it that keep expanding and breaking off more peices as you touch it.  </li>
            <li>Lets hope it holds up better.</li>
            <li>so I could make sure that the area most prone to razor bumps and razor irritation for any man</li>
            <li>Interesting.  </li>
            <li>Interesting.  </li>
            <li>Beard and Hair Engineers go over to the Dental Engineers, crack a Heineken some Dutch Treats and share the love.  </li>
            <li>With another attachment I can shave the top of his head</li>
            <li>It is a favorite.</li>
            <li>Comes with more attachments then you&#x27;ll probably ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Nose, ear, pits and more.</li>
            <li>I grew my &amp;#34;no-shave November&amp;#34; beard and really enjoyed grooming it on December 1.</li>
            <li>Best of all, his unruly beard is finally trimmed and under control!</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>They would be better off with a stand like the Walh.</li>
            <li>I gave it a three start rating because the top part comes off when trimming..</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s water resistant makes it much more versatile.</li>
            <li>It has done everything that I wanted,so far it has been great no problems easy to clean &amp; portable works great</li>
            <li>newer model is better in just about every way.</li>
            <li>The heads are of both better quality and variety.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The actual shaver head is one of the things I like best about this device.</li>
            <li>It seems like Philips/Norelco are always improving these products, so when yet another newer version of this comes out, I&#x27;d be sure to check it out.</li>
            <li>It seems like Philips/Norelco are always improving these products, so when yet another newer version of this comes out, I&#x27;d be sure to check it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to expect fare more from Philips/Norelco.</li>
            <li>and guys, its safe.. really safe for ALL areas.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s too</li>
            <li>Too many trimmers that almost work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>like being able to wash the heads off under running water, no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To prove my point, if you are a guy, how many adapters to shavers do you have in your drawers?</li>
            <li>Each head is well-crafted, fits into the main device perfectly, and the whole thing looks really nice on the charging station.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I could be more happy with a grooming tool, particularly considering the price.</li>
            <li>The performance is very rich, a lot of things can be done, fully waterproof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a cheapo on this kind of stuff, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I\\&quot; know looking smooth and blemish-free (or as close to it as possible).&lt;br /&gt;For about the first 4 months or so, we were great partners.  </li>
            <li>Change the head type is easy, and is very light too</li>
            <li>This started out being a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li>this is the first time he has stated how good it was.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best purchases I have made for myself in a long time.</li>
            <li>and the funny thing is the warrenty isnt any good either.</li>
            <li>The Lithium Ion battery is the best, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing shaver and with all the attachments it serves every purpose you can imagine from body hair to facial hair it is great.</li>
            <li>The interchangeable heads are easy to attach, and the combs don&#x27;t have any moveable parts, making them much more durable.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works very well and has a good variety of trimming heads for many jobs.  </li>
            <li>Very user friendly!!!</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This unit was very nice when new, but did not hold up well.  </li>
            <li>All attachment very good, especially for body grooming.</li>
            <li>facial hair pieces do a very good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say that if one is looking for a beard trimmer primarily, a cheaper option might be a better bet.</li>
            <li>I used remington grooming kit for almost more than 3years but not at all satisfied which made me to search for another cool product which philips made it.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping sensitive areas trimed.</li>
            <li>Cheap Cheap!</li>
            <li>of adapters looks great in pic but is far from ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco worked great for about 10 years then the lock that holds the heads on broke.  </li>
            <li>so you have to secure it with your fingers to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>Attachments work better than my original Remington groomer.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, every other tool in there is excellent.</li>
            <li>I think it is the best I used comparing with other brands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and gets the job</li>
            <li>Nothing compared to this elegant, slim, effective, VERY well-designed device.    </li>
            <li>The trimming heads are easily removable/ interchangeable.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s quite easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>should be easy.  </li>
            <li>Attachments easily disconnect from the shaver body while using.</li>
            <li>I owned a Philips body groomer before, but after two years the battery died, I thought it will be easy to change it</li>
            <li>Once clicked it easily unclicks and there is not a locking mechanism that secures the adaptor grooming piece in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re easy to store.</li>
            <li>mechanism that is also easy to slide out of place if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>...the stopper that holds the plastic guards in place came off way too easily, this is not what you&#x27;d expect for a $50 trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is my first Lithium Ion shaver, so I am pretty happy with the battery</li>
            <li>Ordered this thing about a year ago, its still working strong like it did the day i got it.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair for first year at college in 2003.  </li>
            <li>At first, all of the attachments and the fact that it was waterproof were really handy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and comfortably fits in my hand.  </li>
            <li>It is light and cordless, so easy to use anywhere.</li>
            <li>The attachment comes in handy for trimming the goatee and eyebrows to a certain length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various attachments work great as well.</li>
            <li>Beard trimming is also effective and fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and change attachments.</li>
            <li>I finished up and put it on the stand to charge but the charge light didn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li>I hoped it was just the light going</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be any happier since I am a cheap college guy after all.  </li>
            <li>this for two months - completely satisfied and worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that has a very short life.  </li>
            <li>It is compact and fits comfortably in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feels light and plastic.</li>
            <li>but I only do this once in a great while</li>
            <li>Great groomer to keep hair at the proper length.</li>
            <li>works great, quiet enough, all over great product.</li>
            <li>Great Product overall.</li>
            <li>Their trimmers with NiCad batteries seem to die after a couple of years of light use.</li>
            <li>works great for different beard lengths or a manicured stubble</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t snap on securely.</li>
            <li>it has many useful aparatus.</li>
            <li>The ear and nose trimmer works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It worked great to trim up excess chest and back hair.  </li>
            <li>Crappy and cheap.</li>
            <li>it’s a sound investment.</li>
            <li>The clipper guards now slide smoothly.  </li>
            <li>If you get to aggressive with the angle on the smooth shave and clipper attachment it will &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; you.</li>
            <li>All of the attachments work great and built to last!</li>
            <li>Purchased in Dec 2012 is still working great 2 months later.  </li>
            <li>The parts feel plasticky and cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap parts fell apart after 2 times i used it..</li>
            <li>He has been so happy with this product that I ordered a second on for my husband, who also loves it.  </li>
            <li>It is compact and fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li>carry bag is cheaply made, but who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product primarily to use it as a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as my old Braun rechargeable</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Honestly you don&#x27;t need all of the attachments, I only use two of them, but i guess it&#x27;s nice to have options.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this thing has way too many options - but in all is a good pick because it will likely have whatever attachments and functions you are looking for.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>very good product and mainly charger fit all inputs across the world so no need to carry specific voltage convertor all the time :)</li>
            <li>Will it groom your beard and mustache Absolutely !!!</li>
            <li>Definitely very useful.</li>
            <li>It has multiple attachments that work great if you want to clean out your ear, nose etc as well.</li>
            <li>Firstly the basics: light, good looking device, ready to go after an hour or two charge.    </li>
            <li>2 year warrantee and sensational results all add up to an excellent buy for a personal groomer that performs beautifully.an easily spend twice as much and still not get close to all this personal trimmer</li>
            <li>it charges quickly, is durable and easy to carry anywhere you want.</li>
            <li>This does a better job than normal but for the price you would think the organization mechanism would be a lot better.  </li>
            <li>They told me that even though I had all of the pieces, literature and everything except the original box they would not exchange it.</li>
            <li>I went through 3 of the original body groom trimmers.</li>
            <li>that campares, The only thing that would make it better is if the charging station held all the attachments and was a little more stable, easy to knock over, The trimmer is excellent</li>
            <li>little gem sells most everyplace at $70 - it&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon at $49.99.</li>
            <li>This new version is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice battery when new.</li>
            <li>You will never keep this thing fully clean.</li>
            <li>I can clean it by just running water over it in the sink.</li>
            <li>I can clean it by just running water over it in the sink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers and this one is by far the best ever.</li>
            <li>I have found this groomer to be decent to use, and I like its quick charge and handy battery life.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product for shaving your chest, armpits, private area (really useful) and the face.</li>
            <li>When I bought this item I didn&#x27;t believe it would work as proposed, however it worked, I couldn&#x27;t believe when I saw all my face sleek and clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it too many times yet, but I&#x27;m so far satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It sure is more useful to me since it also has taken place of my main way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sure is more useful to me since it also has taken place of my main way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even see any instruction to install, clean or fix it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, light, compact and with the right attachments to take care of your whole body.</li>
            <li>Other than needing a razor for really close shaving and finesse work, this is the best electric razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>Other reviews might be more helpful than this one, but I would like to say that this product is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li>you own one of the older/cheaper Philips Norelco models I would HIGHLY recommend the upgrade; it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The LiOn battery is also very good, and the warning light leaves enough charge to complete the task at hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is great for general grooming but it really didn&#x27;t do the job for my face.</li>
            <li>Not only has the body groomer been working great for this entire time, but the customer service was amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you wear a true \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; beard, this trimmer will be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think this one would be as good as it is, it seems they all lack at least something, but this one is great.  </li>
            <li>but I throw it on it&#x27;s sweet stand set up</li>
            <li>Contacted Amazon and am returning it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know better, I didn&#x27;t really want it THAT buzzed :</li>
            <li>yet it never did a good job unless you used the shortest setting, which makes it really obvious that you trimmed your body hair.</li>
            <li>It has nice features but somehow the guide on how to use all the parts that comes with it is not quite clear.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro Q3280 promised to be my panacea when it came to full body grooming.  </li>
            <li>, it is true.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the money compared to similarly priced competitors.</li>
            <li>He has very wire like hair on his face and most razors will not shave.</li>
            <li>It works good on chest hair, and with care, it works on private regions as well.  </li>
            <li>You can definitely get a good manscape.</li>
            <li>a full beard now for ah jeez...</li>
            <li>It was fairly inexpensive and i have had it for awhile now, so it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li>But not bad.</li>
            <li>The length guide/comb thing had me worried with how it attaches, it seemed like it could very easily slip to a shorter setting with light pressure, or the adjustment \\&quot;button\\&quot; easily pressed during shaving as it is in a place your hand is likely to rest.</li>
            <li>and it is:  easy to use, works super in the shower, has all the necessary attachments (and more) and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cool!</li>
            <li>I mostly use this trimmer for nose hair (yep), but love the fact that it has so many other pieces too.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco QG3280 Multigroom Pro, allowed me to easily keep my very closely trimmed goatee in check!</li>
            <li>Other than that everything works great.</li>
            <li>, it does everything you could possibly think of, very sturdy, charges quickly, and when you use the body grooming tool its just like you used a razor, but with zero irritation and no stubble (unless thats what you want, and there IS a attachement for that lol).</li>
            <li>I love Norelco products and am saving up to replace my current 8000-model with one of their top 3d-senso-touch razors.</li>
            <li>Product arrived really quick after ordering.  </li>
            <li>My only annoyance is that the guides are all graded every 2 length units, which means to get the best sculpted look, I have to juggle them back and forth.</li>
            <li>Is your nose hair starting to look more and more like dreadlocks?</li>
            <li>Enter this excellent personal trimmer by Norelco, Once considered a low end  </li>
            <li>and when a charge is needed, its quick.</li>
            <li>This one has been a much better experience for me than the predecessor and am confident it will last longer, too.</li>
            <li>This one has been a much better experience for me than the predecessor and am confident it will last longer, too.</li>
            <li>The multiple heads all are precise, easy to use guides and the most powerful rechargeable motor</li>
            <li>and it is a pretty accurate trimmer</li>
            <li>I got this for my Sweetheart for Christmas, he said it works better than the more expensive brands he&#x27;s used before; he loves all the attachments, they all work great.  </li>
            <li>Has a pretty cheap look and feel to it.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;decided to give this one a try as I have had good luck with the brand as long as I didn&#x27;t drop them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and has a large selection of attachments.    </li>
            <li>This is hands down a great investment</li>
            <li>, its the kind that spins around and just doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job, so I have kept my old one for this purpose (replaced it because other parts of it broke when it was dropped but that piece is undamaged).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i really have nothing more to add ;)</li>
            <li>So many attachments that pretty much take care of every hair on your body.</li>
            <li>The device handled the water well, yet it did not seem to do nearly as good a job as when dry.    </li>
            <li>hair clipper/attachment: I have really thinning hair (pretty bald/thin on top)</li>
            <li>exactly a con, but more attachments then are really needed.</li>
            <li>It is fast &amp; easy to recharge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are shipping the Whole new Peice not just charging Body.. which i really liked...</li>
            <li>The fine tuning trimmer head is plenty gentle.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast, decent product in the sense it doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave but great for trimming facial hair or small/tight areas for a hair cut</li>
            <li>Nice being able to do it more frequently without the mess.  </li>
            <li>groomer was a problem too as the design of it pretty much sucked, so although this newer one doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the original&#x27;s stand, it&#x27;s a much better design in just about every</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The docking station doesn&#x27;t fit all the attachments and is VERY lightweight -.-&lt;br /&gt;-Charged</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they attached more firmly.</li>
            <li>works great for few months then breaks.</li>
            <li>give self PROFESSIONAL (much better than barbers.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and has a good lasting battery.</li>
            <li>Well worth my 70 bucks.</li>
            <li>A standard corded hair trimmer like the kind barbers use.</li>
            <li>My old one does a much better job.</li>
            <li>The battery powered motor is surprisingly powerful for its size.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t quite as good as I expected in that area.</li>
            <li>For the price you pay for this one item, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It cleans up easy and holds a charge for a decent time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that it isnt worth spending the price that is being sold here.</li>
            <li>what with all of the various trimming attachements, combes the promise of being 100% waterproof and most importantly of all...the color blue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The multiple attachments all work nicely.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice set of grooming tools.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice product for people you a trimmer and a mini shaver, all in one</li>
            <li>I actually cut my own hair using two mirrors and was complimented on the job.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth trying to get another one I just went and bought an actuall hair clipper that was heavier built.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the different attachments.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice looking, and it definitely has the power to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the $50.00.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that this product is good at, is the noise trim, but you can get something much cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>He did and I was pretty excited to finally be able to keep my face groomed without it being a major time-consuming chore involving scissors, comb, razor, shaving cream, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item shipped quickly and was received exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The color is also very pleasing and unique.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the family jewels, I own a Norelco Body Groomer 2040 and this is definitely a step up.</li>
            <li>Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t sit quite right on the charger.</li>
            <li>Safely gets into sensitive areas without a problem ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts through nicely and my facial hair is pretty</li>
            <li>The stand of the older style Norelco groomer was a problem too as the design of it pretty much sucked, so although this newer one doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the original&#x27;s stand, it&#x27;s a much better design in just about every</li>
            <li>I feel confident, though, that with some care, I will be able to get my hair trimmed without having it break down or pull my hair out -</li>
            <li>Back in 2003, I used a Wahls then (louder, clunkier, about twice the size and rusted easily and in a cheap plastic case with tons of parts, you needed a mini suitcase to carry around that hair trimmer).  </li>
            <li>Only con is that the charging stand is really light weight and comes along easily whenever you lift the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time too which is nice.  </li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t own a trimmer yet, you will be hard pressed to find a better alternative.</li>
            <li>My new Phillips Norelco QG3280 Trimmer and Shaver is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my birthday on Mar 28, when i tried to use it the head came right off, evidently there is no locking mechanism.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The regular clipper end works great and cuts very smooth, with the attachments you can cut to various different lengths, but I use it bare most often.</li>
            <li>I even use it to shave my head in place of my larger, more powerful clippers quite often.</li>
            <li>I had to throw the previous one even though it was still in good condition.</li>
            <li>It works very well, is quiet, nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Effortless to use, quick and fast.</li>
            <li>This unit is loud, but I expect that since it seems to have a pretty strong motor on it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and all</li>
            <li>I like it very much, I think you will like the items.</li>
            <li>Having lived in Europe designing user interface technology it all comes down to making sure the majority can easily adapt, use and care for consumer devices.  </li>
            <li>I have an older Panasonic nose hair trimmer and it works far better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have an older Panasonic nose hair trimmer and it works far better than this one.</li>
            <li>The device continues to charge and it does a very reasonable job with body hair, though I have the feeling that it worked a bit better earlier.</li>
            <li>You have to go various different directions in some spots to make sure you get it well, but it&#x27;s so quick and easy</li>
            <li>they verified purchase and said.. they will ship to my home in 7 days and for Free :)  and with Shipping label for the old one to ship back....</li>
            <li>The only attachment which could use improvement is the mini-foil shaver - it&#x27;s ok.     </li>
            <li>First product i have purchased online.  </li>
            <li>-Received the item, was exactly as I thought it would&lt;br /&gt;-Except</li>
            <li>I love the color, the functions, the stand, the waterproofing, ESPECIALLY customer service.</li>
            <li>Secondly what could be better: shaving heads can fall off occasionally (though not when in use, but mostly at time of storage).    </li>
            <li>Given it has been used daily for over a year, I recommend it even more.    </li>
            <li>The many adapters can be used for various applications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn a beard most of my life so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to scrape my skin with a razor regularly.</li>
            <li>This one is good enough to get by with but every once in a while I get out the old trimmer to really zap those hard-to-reach</li>
            <li>We use different attachments, so there was no need to buy more than one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy a better one next time.</li>
            <li>You have settings from \\&quot;1\\&quot; to much higher.  </li>
            <li>and it did an outstanding job, although I did set the guard one notch too low -</li>
            <li>and I find I&#x27;m happiest with the shortest setting, maybe one higher.</li>
            <li>and I find I&#x27;m happiest with the shortest setting, maybe one higher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco grooming products products and haven&#x27;t been pleased with them.</li>
            <li>but it works pretty well however</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver exactly one year ago.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says in its description.</li>
            <li>I read lots of reviews for various products and picked this one as packing the most punch for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, as a disclaimer this is the first product of this type I&#x27;ve owned/used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this unit to occasionally groom mostly during the summers (swimsuit weather).  </li>
            <li>noticing  that the original hole had grown into a full-fledged window of sharp blades waiting to cut and scrape anything they could devour, I shaved as normal...</li>
            <li>noticing  that the original hole had grown into a full-fledged window of sharp blades waiting to cut and scrape anything they could devour, I shaved as normal...</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>, I tried on my head and is better than the regular hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>brand Norelco has re-vamped their product line and after 35 years as a devoted Braun fan I recently switched to the Norelco Senso-Touch 3D razor and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quality built and should last many years like any Philips/Norelco product.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in the shower and that it has all of the different attachments.</li>
            <li>I bought this and didn&#x27;t even notice at first because I didn&#x27;t use it for the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Then again, this is the first unit I&#x27;ve had that was &amp;#34;waterproof.&amp;#34; So, it might still be working if water wasn&#x27;t a factor.</li>
            <li>Just look pretty</li>
            <li>The mini shaver was the best surprise, not only done it get in small places and allow styling</li>
            <li>The foil shaver works pretty well</li>
            <li>first one head attachment broke.</li>
            <li>this is my first body groomer and cannot compare it well</li>
            <li>Great product, the cheapy plastic holder for all the pieces if the least of concerns when it provides the results ones looking for.</li>
            <li>Capable of full head to toe grooming, fast recharge, portable and durable.  </li>
            <li>Gets super smooth, my friends actually noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s holding up great compared to my past products of this nature!</li>
            <li>I it charges fast and has the right attachments.</li>
            <li>I cannot express my/his enthusiasm and just plain happiness with this item.</li>
            <li>- Powerful motor  - Multiple attachments for different grooming  - Great for sensitive skin/areas  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to cutting my own hair (and grooming body and nose hair and everything) and the hair cut I give myself with this INDESCRIBABLY elegant, useful, compact, efficient, sharp, and awesome device</li>
            <li>This set of clippers blew through stubborn areas that other clippers missed and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>Phillips has a new loyal customer amongst them.</li>
            <li>I have used at least 5 different trimmers and this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>Works well in most scenarios and very convenient overall.  </li>
            <li>From my first week of use, it has pretty much exceeded all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>and  i noticed just recently that the whole handle/motor assembly is all shattered to many peices.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the design shape but the actual functionality of the slide on click of adapting grooming tools does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>This thing is small but powerful, very pleased for now.</li>
            <li>long next to the section that it successfully trimmed.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much does just that.</li>
            <li>Also the stand is pretty sturdy although it&#x27;s real light-weight.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the ticket for me!&lt;br /&gt;Now, having a full beard and mustache, I naturally used the beard trimmer with mustache comb to keep myself looking dapper.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are printed on a large sheet of cheap paper, folded in half many times, in a type size that requires a magnifying glass to read, in too many languages to be taken in any way other than a joke.</li>
            <li>I had long waited to replace my old groomer and this was a great choice, for a pretty solid price.</li>
            <li>very quickly you will be running out of road and driving through brush and even swamps with that thing when you did not initially plan to.</li>
            <li>: compact, long battery life, complete grooming set fits in a nice bag.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The only problem is the heads seem to fall off easily.  </li>
            <li>The battery last forever, you can use it in the shower, and the attachments are easy to use.</li>
            <li>The lithium ion battery maintains a charge well (so far) and charges up quickly when it runs out of juice.  </li>
            <li>The foil body attachment works wonders, and will certainly tackle any job you may have for it.</li>
            <li>It does certainly get the job done.</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s large</li>
            <li>Are you going to cut hair as well as a large plug in  clipper?</li>
            <li>If I am trimming, the head falls off, so I have to keep the angle at a certain angle or it will keep falling off.  </li>
            <li>The clip to the mount broke and when you try to shave at a certain direction the attachment falls off.</li>
            <li>I certainly can see some faults, but for the price and my needs</li>
            <li>You can easily spend twice as much and still not get close to all this personal trimmer</li>
            <li>but I thought I would take a chance on a new unit, hoping that the tech had advanced enough to be useful.</li>
            <li>I also love being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty decent for one to shave his chest and legs.</li>
            <li>it charges very fast... and fully waterproof... for a very reasonable price...and nearly after 18 months of use....</li>
            <li>if I may offer, Philips design engineers: trash the current stand and make one that has a wider base, better power connection and cord hiding, one that does not tip easily and one that can nicely hold all or most of the adapters and making it</li>
            <li>The nice thing is actually that the stand holds the groomer nice and easily and also charges without needing to shove the groomer down onto it like the old one; just rest it down</li>
            <li>The shaver looks very well put together and seems very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Also, the guides are sturdy and won&#x27;t flex under too much pressure (another problem with my Remington).  </li>
            <li>so much for that.&lt;br /&gt;-Returning</li>
            <li>:  Can&#x27;t really find an attachment for your nether regions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The attachments are really flimsy.</li>
            <li>When taking off the plastic comb, the whole thing comes apart.</li>
            <li>but it did not help to prevent irritation nearly as much as Geo F Trumper&#x27;s) if at all.    </li>
            <li>Very versatile and dependable.  </li>
            <li>This product is really not usable for most shaving because the shaver head comes off when you apply even the smallest amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower often just to keep the hair trimmed which is really convenient,</li>
            <li>and I have to trim more carefully, ie.</li>
            <li>Really nothing to complain about here, but</li>
            <li>I really like the stand</li>
            <li>I swear the one included with this set did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swear the one included with this set did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t fall apart so much, I&#x27;d like it and give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really well though out cordless trimmer that is waterproof, comes with a lot of attachments and just works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see that there is much of a difference between the 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The person that recieved this item as a gift claims it works very well.</li>
            <li>A real standout of this package is the body trimmer; it is gentle enough for even the most sensitive trimming jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver/trimmer kit</li>
            <li>The quality and ease of switching the removable heads is fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I do however really</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I have had this for two weeks now, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Charges very fast&lt;</li>
            <li>Holds charge very long&lt;</li>
            <li>Mine broke after 12 months of use and that&#x27;s with very sparing use, maybe once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>Ironic that I purchased this POS to replace a dependable product that I paid 1/3 the price 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>In that respect the ear and nose trimmer is fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;The motor is really strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I really needed one and found this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it really does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>body attachment doesn&#x27;t shave very well for me</li>
            <li>The body attachment seems to work with my long thick hair but seems it would take all day for a full body shave, the trimmer works great to trim my unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li>The trimmer guards stay set on the number you want, really well for now.</li>
            <li>Call me metro, but I believe that a well groomed body is a hallmark of the modern gentlemen.</li>
            <li>than those two items, I really like the shaver.</li>
            <li>but it i can say it leaves a really close shave in all areas.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>But now thanks to the Phillips Norelco QG3280/41 Multigroom Pro</li>
            <li>and it works well, except you have to be careful of the edge trimmers on top and bottom.</li>
            <li>My husband is VERY picky about his shavers/trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The kit contains quite a few attachments, none of which do their job effectively.</li>
            <li>Works very well, the use wet is better because avoid blades from heating up or harm the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not great, not horrible.</li>
            <li>you can choose the length you want to leave it, mow it down and then shape it with one of two small heads that do an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it is easy to accidentally knock the stand over and send them all flying) but this is a minor issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Surprised because other Phillips Norelco products have been quite good and solid to use.</li>
            <li>You have to kind of press down and wiggle it to make sure that it actually makes enough contact to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After getting it out of the packaging and trying it I have started to use this more so than the other razor that I have (the Arcitec).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with a dedicated beard trimmer with more stubble settings and a razor for all the other areas.  </li>
            <li>Trimming -- whether it be arm or back hair, facial hair or whatever, it does a pretty ok job of.  </li>
            <li>My original cutter for hair has a guide that simply raises the trimmer from the head to varying lengths but keeps the head of the trimmer all exposed thus creating an even trim.  </li>
            <li>Also, the razor isn&#x27;t as wide as the actual head - it would work so much better if it was the full width</li>
            <li>No complaints, other than I wish they would come up with a better holder for all the heads for this thing..</li>
            <li>Other than that, I have really enjoyed this clipper set.</li>
            <li>, he looks like he actually cares about his appearance and he loves how user friendly it is.</li>
            <li>Wow, I gotta say that this trimmer set certainly lives up to the reviews!</li>
            <li>have to make several passes with the shaver attachment to shave my face, and I still need to use a safety razor to clean up stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Body shaving with this device is instead something to be accomplished quickly and with no fuzz --much easier than an actual face shave, for example.    </li>
            <li>I find that the attachments sometimes fall off when I use them to clean up my neckline or use on back hair.</li>
            <li>There is a special attachment for ears and nose trimming that works equally well without pulling.</li>
            <li>I does recharge quickly and I really like the electric blue color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I does recharge quickly and I really like the electric blue color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one did a great job on my leg and arm hair, cutting it shorter but not too short, it looks much more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful where you place your hands so that you don&#x27;t change the length setting, but that is true with pretty much all of them.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my old Remington trimmer which felt like it was yanking every hair, this trimmer trims like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>actual full razor head</li>
            <li>but this is TRUE as i said this unit was NEVER dropped and only used like once a month if that since September 3, 2012.</li>
            <li>It also includes a small carrying case which is nice for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li>It only takes about an hour and charges up to full strength.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use this anywhere I need, face or elsewhere such as more delicate areas.</li>
            <li>would have preferred a more slimmed down charging station though.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use charge last a long time , I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I saved the box and called the customer service number, and they are sending me a whole new unit in 5-7 business days, and return packaging for the damaged unit.</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted it to trim my beard, which is what I used my previous trimmer for, but it also comes with an additional attachment for body grooming, and another for hair (scalp) clipping.  </li>
            <li>, I feel that my previous one was better</li>
            <li>yea this is much better than the 15$ razor I had previously.  </li>
            <li>Its much better than the previous models.</li>
            <li>do think that the stand that it comes with is not very easy to use, and serves more as a marketing device than a functional storage stand.  </li>
            <li>and they asked some questions and asked about the theprouct code.. which was on the main body of the groomer...</li>
            <li>&quot; look with that particular attachment(but</li>
            <li>and I had another older trimmer that was nearing the end of it&#x27;s road.</li>
            <li>I called the hotline and not only was it quick and painless</li>
            <li>attachment has multiple functions and you need most of them to maintain facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Main shaving attachement broke within 3 months of use.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly when you are in a hurry, and has enough attachments to trim or shave anywhere on your body with precision.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been considering cutting my own hair, and I believe this trimmer will do the trick using the appropriate guard.  </li>
            <li>I had a older Norelco G380 grooming kit that this one replaced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mostly use it to shave my face once a week and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>But neither of these things has happened so far, it stays in place much better than I&#x27;d expected by looking at it.</li>
            <li>The older we get hair grows everyplace expect our heads.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that looked decent.</li>
            <li>you might notice that they fit quite loosely and that a medium acceleration can make them fall off.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended as a body shaver.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly appreciate that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these several times with superb success, also use for facial hair if I fail to shave during a weekend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, except for the stand</li>
            <li>Just a warning that you want to be sure to hold the clippers as flat as possible to your skin rather than raking it across.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Choosing this trimmer over other brands was an easy choice to make and the benefits are tremendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give the ultra modern lithium ion battery some electrical fuel and in return, it would, provide me a complete battalion of hair-removing possibilities about every 3 days or so...</li>
            <li>more everyday I use it</li>
            <li>I think at the time I ended up spending quite a bit on this, so it kind of sucks</li>
            <li>Not all of them everyday, but it leaves me with having attachments all over the counter top or in drawers which is not convenient.</li>
            <li>Not all of them everyday, but it leaves me with having attachments all over the counter top or in drawers which is not convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The (many, perhaps somewhat redundant) interchangeable heads are held in place by a magnet.</li>
            <li>The device is well constructed, and feels good in the hand: not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li>its like driving a Ferrari on the freeway instead of my normal work truck.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but I have to wonder if its required for companies to hire people with no common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this can be done without any male swearing in the morning after a fun night out......</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>The fact that this one is wet or dry is also nice.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve answered yes to any of the above - you&#x27;re in the right</li>
            <li>I really really didn&#x27;t need it because I have 3 other mini battery operated trimmers, 2 electric full sized and one battery nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>Having tried so many before this (Remington, VS etc) and getting on mediocre results - especially for beard hair, I am surprised at hoe effective</li>
            <li>They are all clear plastic and look pretty much the same, until you have a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li>: the guards kind of suck in that I like to trim my facial hair very short, the shortest guard is still too long.</li>
            <li>there was live chat option...</li>
            <li>How did I live without this before.</li>
            <li>but they sent me a new Multigroom Pro at no cost</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new trimmer and this was the one for me.  </li>
            <li>To see if it was an isolated problem we used the return option and got a new one, today Mar 30.</li>
            <li>had another Phillips trimmer that I dropped and it stopped working so had to get a new</li>
            <li>I have no idea if you can buy new foils for the shavers or anything.orelco</li>
            <li>I have no idea if you can buy new foils for the shavers or anything.</li>
            <li>I had their trimmer with the vacuum for catching hairs, and the little catch that holds the door for trimmings broke off that in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair trimmer guide is labeled with typical guard lengths (I use a #4), so you can match barbershop lengths easily.</li>
            <li>This one works smoothly and has several different settings for whatever body part you are using it on.  </li>
            <li>only possible downside I&#x27;ve seen so far has been that the interchangeable heads seem to pop off a bit easy.</li>
            <li>The multiple heads designed ti fit on the handle only sit on the handle and do not lock in place.  </li>
            <li>but I was also very busy with work last year and every time I logged on amazon to check it I noticed and would get busy with work or family right away</li>
            <li>Sounds funny, but hey for proper bodygrooming and hygiene this is what works.    </li>
            <li>Getting it back on, it is again pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>Product support tells me I might have overcharged it - you are only allowed to charge it when it&#x27;s drained, and then you have to charge it exactly one hour</li>
            <li>I have bought many shavers in the past but</li>
            <li>I was excited by the other reviews to try out this shaver.</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but that all depends on whether or not I find anything better after this one dies.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re actually trimming exactly where you want.</li>
            <li>I love that is cordless no more tangled up cord from my clippers</li>
            <li>first surprise with this \\&quot;Head to Toe\\&quot; grooming kit was reading the instructions and descriptions of all the different attachments and realizing there</li>
            <li>sometimes I shop based on color first and details second.  </li>
            <li>We have tried so many grooming devices over the past 2 years.</li>
            <li>First off I am a man who has a lot of facial hair.</li>
            <li>All the various facial hair styles they display in the product info and on the box aren&#x27;t actually possibly using just this item, as many of them have various parts of the face clean shaven, which is NOT possible when using this device as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>no mess and no need to vacuum when done :) One caveat, be careful not to push the release button for the guide.</li>
            <li>The shortest length available, #2, is slightly longer than the length I want.</li>
            <li>Not only does this grooming kit have a cool blue body to it</li>
            <li>but overall I like being able to take in the shower and not being tied down with a cord.</li>
            <li>The exception is the beard trimmer which does work fine, but is a little clunky when changing heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BUT if you press too hard or angle it too much the head pops off all too easily.</li>
            <li>Finally, I haven&#x27;t had the need to use the body shaver (the large head that is waterproof), so it is extraneous for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The various attachements are smart, and fulfill basically any trimming need you might have.  </li>
            <li>day, I noticed an extra large \\&quot;hole in the foil \\&quot;screen\\&quot; of the Body Groom Shaver.  </li>
            <li>noticing that the chore THAT morning seemed a bit forced...and almost felt like the old disposable razor blades of yore that I previously would fight with....&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off the soap with warm water, lo and behold, I saw that my entire neck, from ear to ear, was a racetrack of red scrapes, cuts...some with blood seeping through.  </li>
            <li>noticing that the chore THAT morning seemed a bit forced...and almost felt like the old disposable razor blades of yore that I previously would fight with....&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off the soap with warm water, lo and behold, I saw that my entire neck, from ear to ear, was a racetrack of red scrapes, cuts...some with blood seeping through.  </li>
            <li>There are just too many pieces to this thing and hard to keep track of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to give this three stars just for the little piece of plastic coming off so easily, but I do use this trimmer a lot and have no other gripes besides that.</li>
            <li>But the product claimed to be great for cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real shame that such a vital part broke so soon without any way to get</li>
            <li>The trim length is not controlled by an integrated sliding collar (like my old Norelco).</li>
            <li>The tiny embossed icons aren&#x27;t much help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very practical and versatile to be short!  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, so I have to be picky about what I use.</li>
            <li>My old shaving gear had to travel in a separate container.</li>
            <li>I tried to look for something I was missing; I couldn&#x27;t believe the item was that cheap.</li>
            <li>I guess because they didn&#x27;t expect people as busy as I was to not worry about their money once it&#x27;s out there, but</li>
            <li>Not that you would/should expect it to be, and I don&#x27;t really SHAVE shave enough to care.</li>
            <li>We had to finish up using our old hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband after his old (crappy) one died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this once so far</li>
            <li>just keep your old nose hair trimmers</li>
            <li>just keep your old nose hair trimmers around.</li>
            <li>The different blades do their intended job very well.</li>
            <li>The shave is close and the razor bumps are non existent (though my skin may not be as sensitive as others).</li>
            <li>really isn&#x27;t an attachment for actually Shaving your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for years and have an extensive collection of both.</li>
            <li>Each accessory comes in a marked plastic bag</li>
            <li>and i tend to just shave before church (not everyday)</li>
            <li>My old trimmer got lost</li>
            <li>I used it primarily in the shower and one day it was just dead.</li>
            <li>I really like the short charge time.  </li>
            <li>but - I was surprised how well all attachments work.</li>
            <li>so I dealt with it, but don&#x27;t be surprised if you think so too when you get</li>
            <li>This works well so far.</li>
            <li>This thing was reasonably priced has a lot of different attachments</li>
            <li>You get a quality grooming tool but the organizer is the same shabby stuff you get no matter how much you spend.  </li>
            <li>Complete joke.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the bodygroom is heavy, and the silver seems nicer, but the weight means it&#x27;s more likely to slip out of your hands in the shower.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine this product lasting more than a few years.</li>
            <li>I\\&quot;ll be sad when mine quits for good, and my warranty is expired.</li>
            <li>Even on this questionable looking face, it makes me look good.</li>
            <li>Very little cleaning required easy to maintain</li>
            <li>Second, the head holds onto the blade/trimmer much better (the other one would pop out after I had it for several months).</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is small, lightweight, and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather return what part of my original purchase I had left for a partial refund than to continue to use this shameful and pain-producing utensil of metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;(my</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather return what part of my original purchase I had left for a partial refund than to continue to use this shameful and pain-producing utensil of metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;</li>
            <li>I had to replace the blade about 2 and half years into having it, but that&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>hair cutter has a little long, it is better.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1H62PWTBA886J]]after the first week the shaver started to stop working suddenly, it has been a severe pain to turn it back on.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for grooming my face and neck and to shape up the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>Some of them seem to duplicate what others do, particularly the different combs for beard, body and face.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this same device that eventually just gave out.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an older model of a similar device by Norelco that died after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stand only holds 2 heads, 1 clipper height attachment, and the maintenance brush, besides the main unit itself.</li>
            <li>First, I had expected that the unit would come with a fine small head trimmer, but this may just have been a misconception on my part.  </li>
            <li>Long battery life on each charge is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>But the nose hair trimmer and small clippers are indispensable.</li>
            <li>I usually go the cheap route on stuff like this and just use head clippers for the body.</li>
            <li>is your goatee home to an actual live goat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>blades are pretty sharp so far, though so it works pretty well as long as you are staying conscious of &amp;#34;not touching the wrong thing&amp;#34; while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-D</li>
            <li>The plastic guard is pretty sharp and sometimes catches my skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a definite improvement over my old gear!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t excel at anything though, but that isn&#x27;t a major detraction for me.  </li>
            <li>Nothing major, you see, but something to make me take note.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands that are maybe built a little better.</li>
            <li>This is the first unit I&#x27;ve had that died prematurely for something other than a battery issue.</li>
            <li>I recently moved and my new bathroom does not have an outlet close enough to the sink for my old wired unit.</li>
            <li>Well, after not long, I figured out that I only really use 3 heads anyway, so I keep the regular clipper on the device</li>
            <li>It replaces at least 4 devices I had been using and the waterproofing has let me do my trimming in the shower- saving a good chunk of cleaning the sink/counter from tiny little whiskers.</li>
            <li>I tried it for face shaving once, and the product clearly could not handle it, so it is for the body only.    </li>
            <li>The beard shaver and small trimmer are great, but the body groomer and the shave foil are poorly designed.</li>
            <li>Shave at any angle you want, if you have soft facial hair, this won&#x27;t get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a definite improvement over my old gear!me.</li>
            <li>Be careful when attaching the clips as they might slide off the groove and if you inadvertently force it too much it may break at some point.</li>
            <li>I especially like that you can plug the charger directly into the trimmer</li>
            <li>For my face, the beard trimmer was too close on the lowest setting and too far on the second lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>This by far blows away my last one.</li>
            <li>Spent as much time swapping parts out as getting any grooming</li>
            <li>but apparently it couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li>Only had it for about four days so far</li>
            <li>I would give one word of caution... choose a higher setting and work down, I put this one on the same setting as my old one and...</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this modern trimmer from an old Philips Norelco (the black ones with NiCd batteries) and boy is it an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, having a fully waterproof trimmer makes shaving/trimming etc.</li>
            <li>This puppy will not operate while the hand held is plugged in for charging, which I found a bit odd at first.</li>
            <li>Was a great little attachment but that parts useless now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Multigroom really shines on three other counts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed, as I thought I had spent more money to get a more reliable unit.  </li>
            <li>The clipper guards were tight when I first used them.  </li>
            <li>When this new one dies, I&#x27;m definitely going to be going back to Philips for the next one(s).</li>
            <li>so no real regrets.</li>
            <li>I was using it in the shower and it was slowly dying, but the low power light wasn&#x27;t coming on.</li>
            <li>i will also say to be careful with the body trimmer attachment as shown in the main picture.</li>
            <li>Someone at Norelco should be fired for allowing such a poor product to be sold at the top price point.  </li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t have a major impact on my overall rating.   </li>
            <li>Safety razors are not cheap and they are not environmentally friendly, but at least they work on the first pass.</li>
            <li>The only major flaw to me is the lack of an attachment intended to close shave the neck/jawline.</li>
            <li>But after only a few uses, it started to breakdown, with the seal between the motor and the shaver now being able to be dislodged with only a slight touch.</li>
            <li>The PLASTIC hair trim piece followed not long after.</li>
            <li>I bought this product late September of 2011 October 2011 because it looked cool</li>
            <li>Not sure if worth the price, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li>Previously had the older version of this and it was time for an upgrade!</li>
            <li>I have designed medical products around the world and really like the stand for the main handle that can have one adapter grooming device attached but the rest of the stand is &amp;#34;SAD&amp;#34;  Philips should have sat down with the guys in the USA in various home or apartment bathrooms where space is limited either by the size of our sink counter space or the encrouchment of our female partners</li>
            <li>I have found too that it can irritate the skin, but that if I dry shave before having a shower, and if I lathe over shave cream in the shower just to moisturize and soothe (in my case I use Geo F Trumper&#x27;s shaving creams) the irritation does not happen nearly as often.</li>
            <li>Since this is basically a beefier version of my old beard trimmer, it&#x27;s no surprise this trimmer manages loose ends</li>
            <li>But overall we like it just fine over other razors we&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li>there is also a larger ridge than the multigroom, which makes it hard to get into the intimate crevices, and leads to some unexpected bites.</li>
            <li>The stand is very lightweight and grips the shaver tightly enough that, to pick up the shaver, you have to hold the stand with your other hand - every single time you pick it up.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I have had this for over a year now and it works awesome.</li>
            <li> What doesn&#x27;t make sense is that Norelco sells a beard trimmer that does have a setting that&#x27;s perfect, but not this unit.</li>

            <li> sorta like I had done in the past...and had great wisdom to move away from and be welcomed into the embrace of Philips Norelco&#x27;s time-trusted line of shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This does a great job, I&#x27;m very pleased with the look.</li>
            <li> very good product, however carry-on bag very cheap and tore up as soon as I got it.</li>
            <li> suppose this would be good choice if you have a ritual where you devote all your attention to \\&quot;man</li>
            <li> The body trimming capability of this unit with the body trimming comb is good - gives me a capability that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li> Once you understand the idiosyncracies of the guide you are in good shape.</li>
            <li> Good backup time.</li>
            <li> Does what is says and seems to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li> my mb-300 did just as good.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver does a good job as well.  </li>
            <li> but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> As good as a blade?</li>

            <li> Some heads is working good</li>

            <li> The shaver is good ............and the trimmers seem to do a good job too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good Job.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> For the price though I think it&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>
            <li> but that is a nice problem to have, and it is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaver is really good while it was working</li>

            <li> I was trying to find a good woman&#x27;s razor</li>

            <li> , over-all I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The product is really good and handy.</li>
            <li> The attachments are very nice, the shaver attachment shown in the photo is great for quickly removing hair.  </li>
            <li> 2 year warrantee and sensational results all add up to an excellent buy for a personal groomer that performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday and that part did an amazing job.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a trimmer from Sharper Image for years that was Amazing.</li>
            <li> - Nice docking bay for charging and holding all attachments  - Wet/dry operation  </li>
            <li> It comes with a nice pouch to hold all the items and the razor.  </li>
            <li> It even comes with a nice case and well-thought-out caddy that holds your commonly-used attachments.</li>
            <li> I liked using the screen option shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> , it looks nice and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> that for body it is nice</li>
            <li> hair trimmer works nicely</li>
            <li> but whatever, it&#x27;s nice to use it in the shower to trim my balls</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and beard.</li>
            <li> You know this WAS a nice system and had alot going for it..</li>
            <li> Well, just bought him his own, planning on giving it to him as a gift.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the shaver one, because I have a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> I honestly wonder how this ever made it into production.</li>
            <li> (my sweetie has a beautiful bald head on top) and then clean up the nape of his neck.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> The razor does vibrate very strongly, but it is not bothersome to me.  </li>
            <li> It is well designed and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is very easy to store and plug in.  </li>
            <li> beard/mustache comb seemed to get clogged up very easily to where it didn&#x27;t seem to be trimming anymore.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there&#x27;s no device that&#x27;ll give a great trim/shave without spending hundreds, in which case this gives a decent trim for a good price.</li>
            <li> but.... it would be nice to be able to use it without having to worry about the thing coming off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great shaver for men who don&#x27;t have the right equipment to control their hair growth.</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> It is soo comfortable and close and never tugs.the clipper attachment is so accurate and requires very little skill.and for the mini foil trimmer,is perfect for etching designs if you like.i am very pleased with this mans best friend.</li>
            <li> My old remington mb-300 was perfect and had more \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; settings.  </li>
            <li> Great price prompt delivery and was exactly what i thought it was.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I have not tested all the options that comes with this, but so far is a very good deal, I would recomend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving/grooming shaver, ordered this Jan 2013</li>
            <li> more words were required to post</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better for close quarters &amp; travel, more attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review when I have had more time with it.</li>
            <li> -scaping,\\&quot; but I just want to shave and trim in the morning without focusing more than I have</li>
            <li> I am minimalist polishing a book on that topic and this device fits my system because it has so many features.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he seems to love it, haven&#x27;t heard any complaints yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a well-made and stylish kit.</li>
            <li> Works great and very east to change all the pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a phenomenal device.</li>
            <li> The design is ingenious with the ability to swap clippers and the guides that attach to them.  </li>
            <li> He has a full beard and is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> The rest of it has turned out to be okay.</li>
            <li> use most attachments and the battery has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> This groomer was purchased to simply keep a beard at stubble length and it works perfectly for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Love the body trimmer portion of this already.</li>
            <li> I have called customer support and have been waiting more than four weeks for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best clipper I have bought.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this model.</li>
            <li> I have been using various shaving devices over the years but have never been as impressed over the quality and function as the multi pro by Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading the many reviews here which raved about it.</li>
            <li> Once I turned on the shaver and started trimming, the top loosened and flew off.</li>
            <li> I read the many reviews and was optimistic about the Norelco Multigroom Pro shaver.  </li>
            <li> This thing still works after I have been dropping it in the shower many times.</li>
            <li> After trying several others this one is the best,</li>
            <li> This, with its dual clippers and foil does a awesome job even after a weeks growth of facial hair.</li>
            <li> , very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer is good, I wouldn&#x27;t say amazing, but it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> keep my hair short so the hair clipper attachment is perfect and works well.</li>
            <li> She does say that it works better than any groomer she has ever bought.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember being more satisfied.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> slower and more time consuming.  </li>
            <li> For armpits, it was ok.  </li>
            <li> Up by the top of my chest</li>
            <li> Well, for most people, it will disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it :-)</li>
            <li> This product more than exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accidentally removed them many times while just trying to adjust the comb</li>
            <li> They made many improvements to this one: better attachments, the upgraded battery.  </li>
            <li> The thing i like the most is charging stand and it needs only 1hr time to charge which is excellent.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews before making this purchase.  </li>
            <li> used most of the attachments already</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my facial hair for over 35 years and this is the best trimmer ever.</li>
            <li> Good Battery Life and the accessories are useful.</li>
            <li> It shaves great and fast.</li>
            <li> Trimming sure, detail trimming and shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a pretty nice set, though the stand isn&#x27;t great and doesn&#x27;t hold as many attachments as you&#x27;ll need to get through anything like a full face grooming.</li>
            <li> Glad they also threw in a bag to hold the rest of the pieces, as you&#x27;ll need to pull that out too almost any time you use this.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is ok.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s this for?&amp;#34; many times...</li>
            <li> As with many multi grooming tools, it does some functions better than others.</li>
            <li> There is cracks all over it that keep expanding and breaking off more peices as you touch it.  </li>
            <li> Lets hope it holds up better.</li>
            <li> so I could make sure that the area most prone to razor bumps and razor irritation for any man</li>
            <li> Interesting.  </li>
            <li> Interesting.  </li>
            <li> Beard and Hair Engineers go over to the Dental Engineers, crack a Heineken some Dutch Treats and share the love.  </li>
            <li> With another attachment I can shave the top of his head</li>
            <li> It is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Comes with more attachments then you&#x27;ll probably ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Nose, ear, pits and more.</li>
            <li> I grew my &amp;#34;no-shave November&amp;#34; beard and really enjoyed grooming it on December 1.</li>
            <li> Best of all, his unruly beard is finally trimmed and under control!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> They would be better off with a stand like the Walh.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three start rating because the top part comes off when trimming..</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s water resistant makes it much more versatile.</li>
            <li> It has done everything that I wanted,so far it has been great no problems easy to clean &amp; portable works great</li>
            <li> newer model is better in just about every way.</li>
            <li> The heads are of both better quality and variety.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The actual shaver head is one of the things I like best about this device.</li>
            <li> It seems like Philips/Norelco are always improving these products, so when yet another newer version of this comes out, I&#x27;d be sure to check it out.</li>
            <li> It seems like Philips/Norelco are always improving these products, so when yet another newer version of this comes out, I&#x27;d be sure to check it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to expect fare more from Philips/Norelco.</li>
            <li> and guys, its safe.. really safe for ALL areas.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s too</li>
            <li> Too many trimmers that almost work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> like being able to wash the heads off under running water, no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To prove my point, if you are a guy, how many adapters to shavers do you have in your drawers?</li>
            <li> Each head is well-crafted, fits into the main device perfectly, and the whole thing looks really nice on the charging station.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I could be more happy with a grooming tool, particularly considering the price.</li>
            <li> The performance is very rich, a lot of things can be done, fully waterproof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a cheapo on this kind of stuff, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I\\&quot; know looking smooth and blemish-free (or as close to it as possible).&lt;br /&gt;For about the first 4 months or so, we were great partners.  </li>
            <li> Change the head type is easy, and is very light too</li>
            <li> This started out being a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> this is the first time he has stated how good it was.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made for myself in a long time.</li>
            <li> and the funny thing is the warrenty isnt any good either.</li>
            <li> The Lithium Ion battery is the best, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing shaver and with all the attachments it serves every purpose you can imagine from body hair to facial hair it is great.</li>
            <li> The interchangeable heads are easy to attach, and the combs don&#x27;t have any moveable parts, making them much more durable.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well and has a good variety of trimming heads for many jobs.  </li>
            <li> Very user friendly!!!</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This unit was very nice when new, but did not hold up well.  </li>
            <li> All attachment very good, especially for body grooming.</li>
            <li> facial hair pieces do a very good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say that if one is looking for a beard trimmer primarily, a cheaper option might be a better bet.</li>
            <li> I used remington grooming kit for almost more than 3years but not at all satisfied which made me to search for another cool product which philips made it.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping sensitive areas trimed.</li>
            <li> Cheap Cheap!</li>
            <li> of adapters looks great in pic but is far from ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco worked great for about 10 years then the lock that holds the heads on broke.  </li>
            <li> so you have to secure it with your fingers to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> Attachments work better than my original Remington groomer.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, every other tool in there is excellent.</li>
            <li> I think it is the best I used comparing with other brands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy and gets the job</li>
            <li> Nothing compared to this elegant, slim, effective, VERY well-designed device.    </li>
            <li> The trimming heads are easily removable/ interchangeable.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s quite easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> should be easy.  </li>
            <li> Attachments easily disconnect from the shaver body while using.</li>
            <li> I owned a Philips body groomer before, but after two years the battery died, I thought it will be easy to change it</li>
            <li> Once clicked it easily unclicks and there is not a locking mechanism that secures the adaptor grooming piece in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re easy to store.</li>
            <li> mechanism that is also easy to slide out of place if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ...the stopper that holds the plastic guards in place came off way too easily, this is not what you&#x27;d expect for a $50 trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my first Lithium Ion shaver, so I am pretty happy with the battery</li>
            <li> Ordered this thing about a year ago, its still working strong like it did the day i got it.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair for first year at college in 2003.  </li>
            <li> At first, all of the attachments and the fact that it was waterproof were really handy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and comfortably fits in my hand.  </li>
            <li> It is light and cordless, so easy to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> The attachment comes in handy for trimming the goatee and eyebrows to a certain length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various attachments work great as well.</li>
            <li> Beard trimming is also effective and fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and change attachments.</li>
            <li> I finished up and put it on the stand to charge but the charge light didn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li> I hoped it was just the light going</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be any happier since I am a cheap college guy after all.  </li>
            <li> this for two months - completely satisfied and worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that has a very short life.  </li>
            <li> It is compact and fits comfortably in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Feels light and plastic.</li>
            <li> but I only do this once in a great while</li>
            <li> Great groomer to keep hair at the proper length.</li>
            <li> works great, quiet enough, all over great product.</li>
            <li> Great Product overall.</li>
            <li> Their trimmers with NiCad batteries seem to die after a couple of years of light use.</li>
            <li> works great for different beard lengths or a manicured stubble</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t snap on securely.</li>
            <li> it has many useful aparatus.</li>
            <li> The ear and nose trimmer works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It worked great to trim up excess chest and back hair.  </li>
            <li> Crappy and cheap.</li>
            <li> it’s a sound investment.</li>
            <li> The clipper guards now slide smoothly.  </li>
            <li> If you get to aggressive with the angle on the smooth shave and clipper attachment it will &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; you.</li>
            <li> All of the attachments work great and built to last!</li>
            <li> Purchased in Dec 2012 is still working great 2 months later.  </li>
            <li> The parts feel plasticky and cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap parts fell apart after 2 times i used it..</li>
            <li> He has been so happy with this product that I ordered a second on for my husband, who also loves it.  </li>
            <li> It is compact and fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li> carry bag is cheaply made, but who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to use it as a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as my old Braun rechargeable</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Honestly you don&#x27;t need all of the attachments, I only use two of them, but i guess it&#x27;s nice to have options.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this thing has way too many options - but in all is a good pick because it will likely have whatever attachments and functions you are looking for.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> very good product and mainly charger fit all inputs across the world so no need to carry specific voltage convertor all the time :)</li>
            <li> Will it groom your beard and mustache Absolutely !!!</li>
            <li> Definitely very useful.</li>
            <li> It has multiple attachments that work great if you want to clean out your ear, nose etc as well.</li>
            <li> Firstly the basics: light, good looking device, ready to go after an hour or two charge.    </li>
            <li> 2 year warrantee and sensational results all add up to an excellent buy for a personal groomer that performs beautifully.an easily spend twice as much and still not get close to all this personal trimmer</li>
            <li> it charges quickly, is durable and easy to carry anywhere you want.</li>
            <li> This does a better job than normal but for the price you would think the organization mechanism would be a lot better.  </li>
            <li> They told me that even though I had all of the pieces, literature and everything except the original box they would not exchange it.</li>
            <li> I went through 3 of the original body groom trimmers.</li>
            <li> that campares, The only thing that would make it better is if the charging station held all the attachments and was a little more stable, easy to knock over, The trimmer is excellent</li>
            <li> little gem sells most everyplace at $70 - it&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon at $49.99.</li>
            <li> This new version is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice battery when new.</li>
            <li> You will never keep this thing fully clean.</li>
            <li> I can clean it by just running water over it in the sink.</li>
            <li> I can clean it by just running water over it in the sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers and this one is by far the best ever.</li>
            <li> I have found this groomer to be decent to use, and I like its quick charge and handy battery life.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product for shaving your chest, armpits, private area (really useful) and the face.</li>
            <li> When I bought this item I didn&#x27;t believe it would work as proposed, however it worked, I couldn&#x27;t believe when I saw all my face sleek and clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it too many times yet, but I&#x27;m so far satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It sure is more useful to me since it also has taken place of my main way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sure is more useful to me since it also has taken place of my main way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even see any instruction to install, clean or fix it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, light, compact and with the right attachments to take care of your whole body.</li>
            <li> Other than needing a razor for really close shaving and finesse work, this is the best electric razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> Other reviews might be more helpful than this one, but I would like to say that this product is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li> you own one of the older/cheaper Philips Norelco models I would HIGHLY recommend the upgrade; it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The LiOn battery is also very good, and the warning light leaves enough charge to complete the task at hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is great for general grooming but it really didn&#x27;t do the job for my face.</li>
            <li> Not only has the body groomer been working great for this entire time, but the customer service was amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you wear a true \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; beard, this trimmer will be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think this one would be as good as it is, it seems they all lack at least something, but this one is great.  </li>
            <li> but I throw it on it&#x27;s sweet stand set up</li>
            <li> Contacted Amazon and am returning it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know better, I didn&#x27;t really want it THAT buzzed :</li>
            <li> yet it never did a good job unless you used the shortest setting, which makes it really obvious that you trimmed your body hair.</li>
            <li> It has nice features but somehow the guide on how to use all the parts that comes with it is not quite clear.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro Q3280 promised to be my panacea when it came to full body grooming.  </li>
            <li> , it is true.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the money compared to similarly priced competitors.</li>
            <li> He has very wire like hair on his face and most razors will not shave.</li>
            <li> It works good on chest hair, and with care, it works on private regions as well.  </li>
            <li> You can definitely get a good manscape.</li>
            <li> a full beard now for ah jeez...</li>
            <li> It was fairly inexpensive and i have had it for awhile now, so it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> But not bad.</li>
            <li> The length guide/comb thing had me worried with how it attaches, it seemed like it could very easily slip to a shorter setting with light pressure, or the adjustment \\&quot;button\\&quot; easily pressed during shaving as it is in a place your hand is likely to rest.</li>
            <li> and it is:  easy to use, works super in the shower, has all the necessary attachments (and more) and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cool!</li>
            <li> I mostly use this trimmer for nose hair (yep), but love the fact that it has so many other pieces too.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco QG3280 Multigroom Pro, allowed me to easily keep my very closely trimmed goatee in check!</li>
            <li> Other than that everything works great.</li>
            <li> , it does everything you could possibly think of, very sturdy, charges quickly, and when you use the body grooming tool its just like you used a razor, but with zero irritation and no stubble (unless thats what you want, and there IS a attachement for that lol).</li>
            <li> I love Norelco products and am saving up to replace my current 8000-model with one of their top 3d-senso-touch razors.</li>
            <li> Product arrived really quick after ordering.  </li>
            <li> My only annoyance is that the guides are all graded every 2 length units, which means to get the best sculpted look, I have to juggle them back and forth.</li>
            <li> Is your nose hair starting to look more and more like dreadlocks?</li>
            <li> Enter this excellent personal trimmer by Norelco, Once considered a low end  </li>
            <li> and when a charge is needed, its quick.</li>
            <li> This one has been a much better experience for me than the predecessor and am confident it will last longer, too.</li>
            <li> This one has been a much better experience for me than the predecessor and am confident it will last longer, too.</li>
            <li> The multiple heads all are precise, easy to use guides and the most powerful rechargeable motor</li>
            <li> and it is a pretty accurate trimmer</li>
            <li> I got this for my Sweetheart for Christmas, he said it works better than the more expensive brands he&#x27;s used before; he loves all the attachments, they all work great.  </li>
            <li> Has a pretty cheap look and feel to it.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;decided to give this one a try as I have had good luck with the brand as long as I didn&#x27;t drop them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and has a large selection of attachments.    </li>
            <li> This is hands down a great investment</li>
            <li> , its the kind that spins around and just doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job, so I have kept my old one for this purpose (replaced it because other parts of it broke when it was dropped but that piece is undamaged).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i really have nothing more to add ;)</li>
            <li> So many attachments that pretty much take care of every hair on your body.</li>
            <li> The device handled the water well, yet it did not seem to do nearly as good a job as when dry.    </li>
            <li> hair clipper/attachment: I have really thinning hair (pretty bald/thin on top)</li>
            <li> exactly a con, but more attachments then are really needed.</li>
            <li> It is fast &amp; easy to recharge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are shipping the Whole new Peice not just charging Body.. which i really liked...</li>
            <li> The fine tuning trimmer head is plenty gentle.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast, decent product in the sense it doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave but great for trimming facial hair or small/tight areas for a hair cut</li>
            <li> Nice being able to do it more frequently without the mess.  </li>
            <li> groomer was a problem too as the design of it pretty much sucked, so although this newer one doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the original&#x27;s stand, it&#x27;s a much better design in just about every</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The docking station doesn&#x27;t fit all the attachments and is VERY lightweight -.-&lt;br /&gt;-Charged</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they attached more firmly.</li>
            <li> works great for few months then breaks.</li>
            <li> give self PROFESSIONAL (much better than barbers.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and has a good lasting battery.</li>
            <li> Well worth my 70 bucks.</li>
            <li> A standard corded hair trimmer like the kind barbers use.</li>
            <li> My old one does a much better job.</li>
            <li> The battery powered motor is surprisingly powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t quite as good as I expected in that area.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay for this one item, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It cleans up easy and holds a charge for a decent time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that it isnt worth spending the price that is being sold here.</li>
            <li> what with all of the various trimming attachements, combes the promise of being 100% waterproof and most importantly of all...the color blue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The multiple attachments all work nicely.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice set of grooming tools.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice product for people you a trimmer and a mini shaver, all in one</li>
            <li> I actually cut my own hair using two mirrors and was complimented on the job.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth trying to get another one I just went and bought an actuall hair clipper that was heavier built.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the different attachments.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice looking, and it definitely has the power to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the $50.00.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that this product is good at, is the noise trim, but you can get something much cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> He did and I was pretty excited to finally be able to keep my face groomed without it being a major time-consuming chore involving scissors, comb, razor, shaving cream, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly and was received exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The color is also very pleasing and unique.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the family jewels, I own a Norelco Body Groomer 2040 and this is definitely a step up.</li>
            <li> Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t sit quite right on the charger.</li>
            <li> Safely gets into sensitive areas without a problem ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts through nicely and my facial hair is pretty</li>
            <li> The stand of the older style Norelco groomer was a problem too as the design of it pretty much sucked, so although this newer one doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the original&#x27;s stand, it&#x27;s a much better design in just about every</li>
            <li> I feel confident, though, that with some care, I will be able to get my hair trimmed without having it break down or pull my hair out -</li>
            <li> Back in 2003, I used a Wahls then (louder, clunkier, about twice the size and rusted easily and in a cheap plastic case with tons of parts, you needed a mini suitcase to carry around that hair trimmer).  </li>
            <li> Only con is that the charging stand is really light weight and comes along easily whenever you lift the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time too which is nice.  </li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t own a trimmer yet, you will be hard pressed to find a better alternative.</li>
            <li> My new Phillips Norelco QG3280 Trimmer and Shaver is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday on Mar 28, when i tried to use it the head came right off, evidently there is no locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The regular clipper end works great and cuts very smooth, with the attachments you can cut to various different lengths, but I use it bare most often.</li>
            <li> I even use it to shave my head in place of my larger, more powerful clippers quite often.</li>
            <li> I had to throw the previous one even though it was still in good condition.</li>
            <li> It works very well, is quiet, nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Effortless to use, quick and fast.</li>
            <li> This unit is loud, but I expect that since it seems to have a pretty strong motor on it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and all</li>
            <li> I like it very much, I think you will like the items.</li>
            <li> Having lived in Europe designing user interface technology it all comes down to making sure the majority can easily adapt, use and care for consumer devices.  </li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic nose hair trimmer and it works far better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic nose hair trimmer and it works far better than this one.</li>
            <li> The device continues to charge and it does a very reasonable job with body hair, though I have the feeling that it worked a bit better earlier.</li>
            <li> You have to go various different directions in some spots to make sure you get it well, but it&#x27;s so quick and easy</li>
            <li> they verified purchase and said.. they will ship to my home in 7 days and for Free :)  and with Shipping label for the old one to ship back....</li>
            <li> The only attachment which could use improvement is the mini-foil shaver - it&#x27;s ok.     </li>
            <li> First product i have purchased online.  </li>
            <li> -Received the item, was exactly as I thought it would&lt;br /&gt;-Except</li>
            <li> I love the color, the functions, the stand, the waterproofing, ESPECIALLY customer service.</li>
            <li> Secondly what could be better: shaving heads can fall off occasionally (though not when in use, but mostly at time of storage).    </li>
            <li> Given it has been used daily for over a year, I recommend it even more.    </li>
            <li> The many adapters can be used for various applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard most of my life so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to scrape my skin with a razor regularly.</li>
            <li> This one is good enough to get by with but every once in a while I get out the old trimmer to really zap those hard-to-reach</li>
            <li> We use different attachments, so there was no need to buy more than one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy a better one next time.</li>
            <li> You have settings from \\&quot;1\\&quot; to much higher.  </li>
            <li> and it did an outstanding job, although I did set the guard one notch too low -</li>
            <li> and I find I&#x27;m happiest with the shortest setting, maybe one higher.</li>
            <li> and I find I&#x27;m happiest with the shortest setting, maybe one higher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco grooming products products and haven&#x27;t been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> but it works pretty well however</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver exactly one year ago.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says in its description.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews for various products and picked this one as packing the most punch for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, as a disclaimer this is the first product of this type I&#x27;ve owned/used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this unit to occasionally groom mostly during the summers (swimsuit weather).  </li>
            <li> noticing  that the original hole had grown into a full-fledged window of sharp blades waiting to cut and scrape anything they could devour, I shaved as normal...</li>
            <li> noticing  that the original hole had grown into a full-fledged window of sharp blades waiting to cut and scrape anything they could devour, I shaved as normal...</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> , I tried on my head and is better than the regular hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> brand Norelco has re-vamped their product line and after 35 years as a devoted Braun fan I recently switched to the Norelco Senso-Touch 3D razor and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality built and should last many years like any Philips/Norelco product.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can use it in the shower and that it has all of the different attachments.</li>
            <li> I bought this and didn&#x27;t even notice at first because I didn&#x27;t use it for the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Then again, this is the first unit I&#x27;ve had that was &amp;#34;waterproof.&amp;#34; So, it might still be working if water wasn&#x27;t a factor.</li>
            <li> Just look pretty</li>
            <li> The mini shaver was the best surprise, not only done it get in small places and allow styling</li>
            <li> The foil shaver works pretty well</li>
            <li> first one head attachment broke.</li>
            <li> this is my first body groomer and cannot compare it well</li>
            <li> Great product, the cheapy plastic holder for all the pieces if the least of concerns when it provides the results ones looking for.</li>
            <li> Capable of full head to toe grooming, fast recharge, portable and durable.  </li>
            <li> Gets super smooth, my friends actually noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s holding up great compared to my past products of this nature!</li>
            <li> I it charges fast and has the right attachments.</li>
            <li> I cannot express my/his enthusiasm and just plain happiness with this item.</li>
            <li> - Powerful motor  - Multiple attachments for different grooming  - Great for sensitive skin/areas  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to cutting my own hair (and grooming body and nose hair and everything) and the hair cut I give myself with this INDESCRIBABLY elegant, useful, compact, efficient, sharp, and awesome device</li>
            <li> This set of clippers blew through stubborn areas that other clippers missed and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> Phillips has a new loyal customer amongst them.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 5 different trimmers and this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li> Works well in most scenarios and very convenient overall.  </li>
            <li> From my first week of use, it has pretty much exceeded all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> and  i noticed just recently that the whole handle/motor assembly is all shattered to many peices.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the design shape but the actual functionality of the slide on click of adapting grooming tools does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> This thing is small but powerful, very pleased for now.</li>
            <li> long next to the section that it successfully trimmed.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much does just that.</li>
            <li> Also the stand is pretty sturdy although it&#x27;s real light-weight.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the ticket for me!&lt;br /&gt;Now, having a full beard and mustache, I naturally used the beard trimmer with mustache comb to keep myself looking dapper.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are printed on a large sheet of cheap paper, folded in half many times, in a type size that requires a magnifying glass to read, in too many languages to be taken in any way other than a joke.</li>
            <li> I had long waited to replace my old groomer and this was a great choice, for a pretty solid price.</li>
            <li> very quickly you will be running out of road and driving through brush and even swamps with that thing when you did not initially plan to.</li>
            <li> : compact, long battery life, complete grooming set fits in a nice bag.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The only problem is the heads seem to fall off easily.  </li>
            <li> The battery last forever, you can use it in the shower, and the attachments are easy to use.</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery maintains a charge well (so far) and charges up quickly when it runs out of juice.  </li>
            <li> The foil body attachment works wonders, and will certainly tackle any job you may have for it.</li>
            <li> It does certainly get the job done.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s large</li>
            <li> Are you going to cut hair as well as a large plug in  clipper?</li>
            <li> If I am trimming, the head falls off, so I have to keep the angle at a certain angle or it will keep falling off.  </li>
            <li> The clip to the mount broke and when you try to shave at a certain direction the attachment falls off.</li>
            <li> I certainly can see some faults, but for the price and my needs</li>
            <li> You can easily spend twice as much and still not get close to all this personal trimmer</li>
            <li> but I thought I would take a chance on a new unit, hoping that the tech had advanced enough to be useful.</li>
            <li> I also love being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty decent for one to shave his chest and legs.</li>
            <li> it charges very fast... and fully waterproof... for a very reasonable price...and nearly after 18 months of use....</li>
            <li> if I may offer, Philips design engineers: trash the current stand and make one that has a wider base, better power connection and cord hiding, one that does not tip easily and one that can nicely hold all or most of the adapters and making it</li>
            <li> The nice thing is actually that the stand holds the groomer nice and easily and also charges without needing to shove the groomer down onto it like the old one; just rest it down</li>
            <li> The shaver looks very well put together and seems very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Also, the guides are sturdy and won&#x27;t flex under too much pressure (another problem with my Remington).  </li>
            <li> so much for that.&lt;br /&gt;-Returning</li>
            <li> :  Can&#x27;t really find an attachment for your nether regions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The attachments are really flimsy.</li>
            <li> When taking off the plastic comb, the whole thing comes apart.</li>
            <li> but it did not help to prevent irritation nearly as much as Geo F Trumper&#x27;s) if at all.    </li>
            <li> Very versatile and dependable.  </li>
            <li> This product is really not usable for most shaving because the shaver head comes off when you apply even the smallest amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower often just to keep the hair trimmed which is really convenient,</li>
            <li> and I have to trim more carefully, ie.</li>
            <li> Really nothing to complain about here, but</li>
            <li> I really like the stand</li>
            <li> I swear the one included with this set did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swear the one included with this set did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t fall apart so much, I&#x27;d like it and give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really well though out cordless trimmer that is waterproof, comes with a lot of attachments and just works very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see that there is much of a difference between the 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The person that recieved this item as a gift claims it works very well.</li>
            <li> A real standout of this package is the body trimmer; it is gentle enough for even the most sensitive trimming jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver/trimmer kit</li>
            <li> The quality and ease of switching the removable heads is fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I do however really</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I have had this for two weeks now, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Charges very fast&lt;</li>
            <li> Holds charge very long&lt;</li>
            <li> Mine broke after 12 months of use and that&#x27;s with very sparing use, maybe once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Ironic that I purchased this POS to replace a dependable product that I paid 1/3 the price 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> In that respect the ear and nose trimmer is fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;The motor is really strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I really needed one and found this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it really does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> body attachment doesn&#x27;t shave very well for me</li>
            <li> The body attachment seems to work with my long thick hair but seems it would take all day for a full body shave, the trimmer works great to trim my unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> The trimmer guards stay set on the number you want, really well for now.</li>
            <li> Call me metro, but I believe that a well groomed body is a hallmark of the modern gentlemen.</li>
            <li> than those two items, I really like the shaver.</li>
            <li> but it i can say it leaves a really close shave in all areas.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> But now thanks to the Phillips Norelco QG3280/41 Multigroom Pro</li>
            <li> and it works well, except you have to be careful of the edge trimmers on top and bottom.</li>
            <li> My husband is VERY picky about his shavers/trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The kit contains quite a few attachments, none of which do their job effectively.</li>
            <li> Works very well, the use wet is better because avoid blades from heating up or harm the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great, not horrible.</li>
            <li> you can choose the length you want to leave it, mow it down and then shape it with one of two small heads that do an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it is easy to accidentally knock the stand over and send them all flying) but this is a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Surprised because other Phillips Norelco products have been quite good and solid to use.</li>
            <li> You have to kind of press down and wiggle it to make sure that it actually makes enough contact to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After getting it out of the packaging and trying it I have started to use this more so than the other razor that I have (the Arcitec).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with a dedicated beard trimmer with more stubble settings and a razor for all the other areas.  </li>
            <li> Trimming -- whether it be arm or back hair, facial hair or whatever, it does a pretty ok job of.  </li>
            <li> My original cutter for hair has a guide that simply raises the trimmer from the head to varying lengths but keeps the head of the trimmer all exposed thus creating an even trim.  </li>
            <li> Also, the razor isn&#x27;t as wide as the actual head - it would work so much better if it was the full width</li>
            <li> No complaints, other than I wish they would come up with a better holder for all the heads for this thing..</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have really enjoyed this clipper set.</li>
            <li> , he looks like he actually cares about his appearance and he loves how user friendly it is.</li>
            <li> Wow, I gotta say that this trimmer set certainly lives up to the reviews!</li>
            <li> have to make several passes with the shaver attachment to shave my face, and I still need to use a safety razor to clean up stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Body shaving with this device is instead something to be accomplished quickly and with no fuzz --much easier than an actual face shave, for example.    </li>
            <li> I find that the attachments sometimes fall off when I use them to clean up my neckline or use on back hair.</li>
            <li> There is a special attachment for ears and nose trimming that works equally well without pulling.</li>
            <li> I does recharge quickly and I really like the electric blue color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I does recharge quickly and I really like the electric blue color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one did a great job on my leg and arm hair, cutting it shorter but not too short, it looks much more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful where you place your hands so that you don&#x27;t change the length setting, but that is true with pretty much all of them.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my old Remington trimmer which felt like it was yanking every hair, this trimmer trims like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> actual full razor head</li>
            <li> but this is TRUE as i said this unit was NEVER dropped and only used like once a month if that since September 3, 2012.</li>
            <li> It also includes a small carrying case which is nice for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li> It only takes about an hour and charges up to full strength.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use this anywhere I need, face or elsewhere such as more delicate areas.</li>
            <li> would have preferred a more slimmed down charging station though.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use charge last a long time , I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I saved the box and called the customer service number, and they are sending me a whole new unit in 5-7 business days, and return packaging for the damaged unit.</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted it to trim my beard, which is what I used my previous trimmer for, but it also comes with an additional attachment for body grooming, and another for hair (scalp) clipping.  </li>
            <li> , I feel that my previous one was better</li>
            <li> yea this is much better than the 15$ razor I had previously.  </li>
            <li> Its much better than the previous models.</li>
            <li> do think that the stand that it comes with is not very easy to use, and serves more as a marketing device than a functional storage stand.  </li>
            <li> and they asked some questions and asked about the theprouct code.. which was on the main body of the groomer...</li>
            <li> &quot; look with that particular attachment(but</li>
            <li> and I had another older trimmer that was nearing the end of it&#x27;s road.</li>
            <li> I called the hotline and not only was it quick and painless</li>
            <li> attachment has multiple functions and you need most of them to maintain facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Main shaving attachement broke within 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly when you are in a hurry, and has enough attachments to trim or shave anywhere on your body with precision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been considering cutting my own hair, and I believe this trimmer will do the trick using the appropriate guard.  </li>
            <li> I had a older Norelco G380 grooming kit that this one replaced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mostly use it to shave my face once a week and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> But neither of these things has happened so far, it stays in place much better than I&#x27;d expected by looking at it.</li>
            <li> The older we get hair grows everyplace expect our heads.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that looked decent.</li>
            <li> you might notice that they fit quite loosely and that a medium acceleration can make them fall off.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended as a body shaver.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these several times with superb success, also use for facial hair if I fail to shave during a weekend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, except for the stand</li>
            <li> Just a warning that you want to be sure to hold the clippers as flat as possible to your skin rather than raking it across.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Choosing this trimmer over other brands was an easy choice to make and the benefits are tremendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give the ultra modern lithium ion battery some electrical fuel and in return, it would, provide me a complete battalion of hair-removing possibilities about every 3 days or so...</li>
            <li> more everyday I use it</li>
            <li> I think at the time I ended up spending quite a bit on this, so it kind of sucks</li>
            <li> Not all of them everyday, but it leaves me with having attachments all over the counter top or in drawers which is not convenient.</li>
            <li> Not all of them everyday, but it leaves me with having attachments all over the counter top or in drawers which is not convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The (many, perhaps somewhat redundant) interchangeable heads are held in place by a magnet.</li>
            <li> The device is well constructed, and feels good in the hand: not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li> its like driving a Ferrari on the freeway instead of my normal work truck.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I have to wonder if its required for companies to hire people with no common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this can be done without any male swearing in the morning after a fun night out......</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The fact that this one is wet or dry is also nice.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve answered yes to any of the above - you&#x27;re in the right</li>
            <li> I really really didn&#x27;t need it because I have 3 other mini battery operated trimmers, 2 electric full sized and one battery nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Having tried so many before this (Remington, VS etc) and getting on mediocre results - especially for beard hair, I am surprised at hoe effective</li>
            <li> They are all clear plastic and look pretty much the same, until you have a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> : the guards kind of suck in that I like to trim my facial hair very short, the shortest guard is still too long.</li>
            <li> there was live chat option...</li>
            <li> How did I live without this before.</li>
            <li> but they sent me a new Multigroom Pro at no cost</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new trimmer and this was the one for me.  </li>
            <li> To see if it was an isolated problem we used the return option and got a new one, today Mar 30.</li>
            <li> had another Phillips trimmer that I dropped and it stopped working so had to get a new</li>
            <li> I have no idea if you can buy new foils for the shavers or anything.orelco</li>
            <li> I have no idea if you can buy new foils for the shavers or anything.</li>
            <li> I had their trimmer with the vacuum for catching hairs, and the little catch that holds the door for trimmings broke off that in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair trimmer guide is labeled with typical guard lengths (I use a #4), so you can match barbershop lengths easily.</li>
            <li> This one works smoothly and has several different settings for whatever body part you are using it on.  </li>
            <li> only possible downside I&#x27;ve seen so far has been that the interchangeable heads seem to pop off a bit easy.</li>
            <li> The multiple heads designed ti fit on the handle only sit on the handle and do not lock in place.  </li>
            <li> but I was also very busy with work last year and every time I logged on amazon to check it I noticed and would get busy with work or family right away</li>
            <li> Sounds funny, but hey for proper bodygrooming and hygiene this is what works.    </li>
            <li> Getting it back on, it is again pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> Product support tells me I might have overcharged it - you are only allowed to charge it when it&#x27;s drained, and then you have to charge it exactly one hour</li>
            <li> I have bought many shavers in the past but</li>
            <li> I was excited by the other reviews to try out this shaver.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but that all depends on whether or not I find anything better after this one dies.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re actually trimming exactly where you want.</li>
            <li> I love that is cordless no more tangled up cord from my clippers</li>
            <li> first surprise with this \\&quot;Head to Toe\\&quot; grooming kit was reading the instructions and descriptions of all the different attachments and realizing there</li>
            <li> sometimes I shop based on color first and details second.  </li>
            <li> We have tried so many grooming devices over the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> First off I am a man who has a lot of facial hair.</li>
            <li> All the various facial hair styles they display in the product info and on the box aren&#x27;t actually possibly using just this item, as many of them have various parts of the face clean shaven, which is NOT possible when using this device as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> no mess and no need to vacuum when done :) One caveat, be careful not to push the release button for the guide.</li>
            <li> The shortest length available, #2, is slightly longer than the length I want.</li>
            <li> Not only does this grooming kit have a cool blue body to it</li>
            <li> but overall I like being able to take in the shower and not being tied down with a cord.</li>
            <li> The exception is the beard trimmer which does work fine, but is a little clunky when changing heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> BUT if you press too hard or angle it too much the head pops off all too easily.</li>
            <li> Finally, I haven&#x27;t had the need to use the body shaver (the large head that is waterproof), so it is extraneous for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The various attachements are smart, and fulfill basically any trimming need you might have.  </li>
            <li> day, I noticed an extra large \\&quot;hole in the foil \\&quot;screen\\&quot; of the Body Groom Shaver.  </li>
            <li> noticing that the chore THAT morning seemed a bit forced...and almost felt like the old disposable razor blades of yore that I previously would fight with....&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off the soap with warm water, lo and behold, I saw that my entire neck, from ear to ear, was a racetrack of red scrapes, cuts...some with blood seeping through.  </li>
            <li> noticing that the chore THAT morning seemed a bit forced...and almost felt like the old disposable razor blades of yore that I previously would fight with....&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off the soap with warm water, lo and behold, I saw that my entire neck, from ear to ear, was a racetrack of red scrapes, cuts...some with blood seeping through.  </li>
            <li> There are just too many pieces to this thing and hard to keep track of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to give this three stars just for the little piece of plastic coming off so easily, but I do use this trimmer a lot and have no other gripes besides that.</li>
            <li> But the product claimed to be great for cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real shame that such a vital part broke so soon without any way to get</li>
            <li> The trim length is not controlled by an integrated sliding collar (like my old Norelco).</li>
            <li> The tiny embossed icons aren&#x27;t much help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very practical and versatile to be short!  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, so I have to be picky about what I use.</li>
            <li> My old shaving gear had to travel in a separate container.</li>
            <li> I tried to look for something I was missing; I couldn&#x27;t believe the item was that cheap.</li>
            <li> I guess because they didn&#x27;t expect people as busy as I was to not worry about their money once it&#x27;s out there, but</li>
            <li> Not that you would/should expect it to be, and I don&#x27;t really SHAVE shave enough to care.</li>
            <li> We had to finish up using our old hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after his old (crappy) one died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far</li>
            <li> just keep your old nose hair trimmers</li>
            <li> just keep your old nose hair trimmers around.</li>
            <li> The different blades do their intended job very well.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and the razor bumps are non existent (though my skin may not be as sensitive as others).</li>
            <li> really isn&#x27;t an attachment for actually Shaving your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for years and have an extensive collection of both.</li>
            <li> Each accessory comes in a marked plastic bag</li>
            <li> and i tend to just shave before church (not everyday)</li>
            <li> My old trimmer got lost</li>
            <li> I used it primarily in the shower and one day it was just dead.</li>
            <li> I really like the short charge time.  </li>
            <li> but - I was surprised how well all attachments work.</li>
            <li> so I dealt with it, but don&#x27;t be surprised if you think so too when you get</li>
            <li> This works well so far.</li>
            <li> This thing was reasonably priced has a lot of different attachments</li>
            <li> You get a quality grooming tool but the organizer is the same shabby stuff you get no matter how much you spend.  </li>
            <li> Complete joke.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the bodygroom is heavy, and the silver seems nicer, but the weight means it&#x27;s more likely to slip out of your hands in the shower.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine this product lasting more than a few years.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ll be sad when mine quits for good, and my warranty is expired.</li>
            <li> Even on this questionable looking face, it makes me look good.</li>
            <li> Very little cleaning required easy to maintain</li>
            <li> Second, the head holds onto the blade/trimmer much better (the other one would pop out after I had it for several months).</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is small, lightweight, and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather return what part of my original purchase I had left for a partial refund than to continue to use this shameful and pain-producing utensil of metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;(my</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather return what part of my original purchase I had left for a partial refund than to continue to use this shameful and pain-producing utensil of metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I had to replace the blade about 2 and half years into having it, but that&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> hair cutter has a little long, it is better.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1H62PWTBA886J]]after the first week the shaver started to stop working suddenly, it has been a severe pain to turn it back on.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for grooming my face and neck and to shape up the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> Some of them seem to duplicate what others do, particularly the different combs for beard, body and face.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this same device that eventually just gave out.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older model of a similar device by Norelco that died after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stand only holds 2 heads, 1 clipper height attachment, and the maintenance brush, besides the main unit itself.</li>
            <li> First, I had expected that the unit would come with a fine small head trimmer, but this may just have been a misconception on my part.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life on each charge is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> But the nose hair trimmer and small clippers are indispensable.</li>
            <li> I usually go the cheap route on stuff like this and just use head clippers for the body.</li>
            <li> is your goatee home to an actual live goat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> blades are pretty sharp so far, though so it works pretty well as long as you are staying conscious of &amp;#34;not touching the wrong thing&amp;#34; while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-D</li>
            <li> The plastic guard is pretty sharp and sometimes catches my skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a definite improvement over my old gear!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t excel at anything though, but that isn&#x27;t a major detraction for me.  </li>
            <li> Nothing major, you see, but something to make me take note.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands that are maybe built a little better.</li>
            <li> This is the first unit I&#x27;ve had that died prematurely for something other than a battery issue.</li>
            <li> I recently moved and my new bathroom does not have an outlet close enough to the sink for my old wired unit.</li>
            <li> Well, after not long, I figured out that I only really use 3 heads anyway, so I keep the regular clipper on the device</li>
            <li> It replaces at least 4 devices I had been using and the waterproofing has let me do my trimming in the shower- saving a good chunk of cleaning the sink/counter from tiny little whiskers.</li>
            <li> I tried it for face shaving once, and the product clearly could not handle it, so it is for the body only.    </li>
            <li> The beard shaver and small trimmer are great, but the body groomer and the shave foil are poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Shave at any angle you want, if you have soft facial hair, this won&#x27;t get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a definite improvement over my old gear!me.</li>
            <li> Be careful when attaching the clips as they might slide off the groove and if you inadvertently force it too much it may break at some point.</li>
            <li> I especially like that you can plug the charger directly into the trimmer</li>
            <li> For my face, the beard trimmer was too close on the lowest setting and too far on the second lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> This by far blows away my last one.</li>
            <li> Spent as much time swapping parts out as getting any grooming</li>
            <li> but apparently it couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> Only had it for about four days so far</li>
            <li> I would give one word of caution... choose a higher setting and work down, I put this one on the same setting as my old one and...</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this modern trimmer from an old Philips Norelco (the black ones with NiCd batteries) and boy is it an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, having a fully waterproof trimmer makes shaving/trimming etc.</li>
            <li> This puppy will not operate while the hand held is plugged in for charging, which I found a bit odd at first.</li>
            <li> Was a great little attachment but that parts useless now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Multigroom really shines on three other counts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed, as I thought I had spent more money to get a more reliable unit.  </li>
            <li> The clipper guards were tight when I first used them.  </li>
            <li> When this new one dies, I&#x27;m definitely going to be going back to Philips for the next one(s).</li>
            <li> so no real regrets.</li>
            <li> I was using it in the shower and it was slowly dying, but the low power light wasn&#x27;t coming on.</li>
            <li> i will also say to be careful with the body trimmer attachment as shown in the main picture.</li>
            <li> Someone at Norelco should be fired for allowing such a poor product to be sold at the top price point.  </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t have a major impact on my overall rating.   </li>
            <li> Safety razors are not cheap and they are not environmentally friendly, but at least they work on the first pass.</li>
            <li> The only major flaw to me is the lack of an attachment intended to close shave the neck/jawline.</li>
            <li> But after only a few uses, it started to breakdown, with the seal between the motor and the shaver now being able to be dislodged with only a slight touch.</li>
            <li> The PLASTIC hair trim piece followed not long after.</li>
            <li> I bought this product late September of 2011 October 2011 because it looked cool</li>
            <li> Not sure if worth the price, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> Previously had the older version of this and it was time for an upgrade!</li>
            <li> I have designed medical products around the world and really like the stand for the main handle that can have one adapter grooming device attached but the rest of the stand is &amp;#34;SAD&amp;#34;  Philips should have sat down with the guys in the USA in various home or apartment bathrooms where space is limited either by the size of our sink counter space or the encrouchment of our female partners</li>
            <li> I have found too that it can irritate the skin, but that if I dry shave before having a shower, and if I lathe over shave cream in the shower just to moisturize and soothe (in my case I use Geo F Trumper&#x27;s shaving creams) the irritation does not happen nearly as often.</li>
            <li> Since this is basically a beefier version of my old beard trimmer, it&#x27;s no surprise this trimmer manages loose ends</li>
            <li> But overall we like it just fine over other razors we&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li> there is also a larger ridge than the multigroom, which makes it hard to get into the intimate crevices, and leads to some unexpected bites.</li>
            <li> The stand is very lightweight and grips the shaver tightly enough that, to pick up the shaver, you have to hold the stand with your other hand - every single time you pick it up.</li>
            <li> vacuum</li>
            <li> Wet the shaver a little and apply some shaving cream to desired areas, and you get a pretty darn close shave.</li>
            <li> Completely recommend this for trimming beards and other parts.</li>
            <li> I decided to shave my head (just a buzz cut, not bare skin) recently and the trimmer manages that quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past, my groomers have lost their battery life steadily and broken easily when dropped.</li>
            <li> My previous set had a spring loaded comb for the beard that broke - one of the reasons I had to look for a new unit.  </li>
            <li> Be careful where you need to be careful, but with the attachments, there is no other grooming device you will need!!!!</li>
            <li> The only negative first.</li>
            <li> Second, the holder does not accommodate all of the heads, requiring me to store the extra heads somewhere else instead of with the unit - a minor pain.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit mainly because it was one of a few that advertised 100V-240V.</li>
            <li> already .it is a solid machine with a nice feel to it , but it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it seems to do a good job at the actual business of trimming, I&#x27;m fairly unhappy with it because the poor design requires so much fussy handling.</li>
            <li> Whole body is taken care of by this set ( used all features)&lt;br /&gt;Liked the small space</li>
            <li> only actual complaint is the stand does not hold the attachments very well.</li>
            <li> have never had much luck with electric shavers and in the past</li>
            <li> I put this on my wishlist this year, since my old groomer was at least 5 years old, and was on its last legs.  </li>
            <li> first complaint is about the stand.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s size for it does not take up much room and therefor leaves lots of room for a small soap dish that hold attachments for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to make this too long, so I&#x27;ll be brief.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone with minor facial or body maintenance.</li>
            <li> , I use it regularly, holds a charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li> I have had other rechargable trimmers in the past, but none were as useful as this one.  </li>
            <li> The chassis is thick and pretty hefty giving off the impression of quality.</li>
            <li> Super tough.</li>
            <li> No matter how many blades are stacked up, gel strips applied, or vibrating handles in various speeds, I virtually ALWAYS get that irritating razor burn/razor bumps that are not only unsightly but also are small breeding hotspots for bacteria to fester.  </li>
            <li> The other ones for thicker hair will grab skin if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li> a few months after I get the new head; let&#x27;s see if that one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> The only way to prevent this from happening is to keep it completely dry at all times.</li>
            <li> The Lithium-Ion battery is phenomenal and allows me to keep the device always charged; never again will I get midway through cutting my hair only to realize that the battery is about the die!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had 2 (minor) mistakes happen while using this device over a year long</li>
            <li> The only other shaving foil is the tiny miniature one that takes many passes pressing hard to shave down a couple little stubbles, so getting a close shave on your neck</li>
            <li> .. use for a few months and then as it  gets old starts to wrtither away and break apart!..  </li>
            <li> I used their live chat functionality, and even though it was just one of the attachments that was broken and I was only hoping to get that single piece replaced, they&#x27;re going to be sending an entirely new unit to me -- and they suggested that solution.  </li>
            <li> Its instructions come in a huge thin paper and the hair attachedments are plastic with no instructions other that their name</li>
            <li> But I take shaving pretty seriously, in addition to electrics</li>
            <li> The trimmings drop through the screen, past the blades, and land on the greasy axel of the connector and floor of the main razor compartment.</li>
            <li> if you fail to catch what i&#x27;m saying, lets just say i am smooth in places that i have not been in almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> These issues are really just an annoyance, but at the price of the item, I feel like it would have been common sense to fix these issues.</li>
            <li> I like how after a day or two of having not shaved the Trimmer/Shaver Foil takes care of the long stubble with out any hair pulling or pinching.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> still I guess that&#x27;s an excuse</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand how it was sitting in my &amp;#34;Your Orders&amp;#34; tab for so long and no automated system picked it up</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> He spent quite a lot of time checking out the different attachments</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> have noticed that it doesnot always work well on long hair (body hair)</li>
            <li> a charge for a long time as well</li>
            <li> For the neck area, I obviously used the Body Groom Shaver with the wide foil head...</li>
            <li> Minor issue but</li>
            <li> long battery charge and a tool for every hair on your body.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the trimmer&#x27;s performance under wet conditions was sub-par; the generic ten-dollar multi-purpose groomer I had before performed just as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> His eyebrows would get so long that they&#x27;d go into eyes</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it stays that way, as the small plastic bit that holds it seems like it won&#x27;t take much time to wear down enough to slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> groomer, while not perfect, seems to be the best on the market and is easier than any other way I&#x27;ve found of removing body hair in awkward places</li>
            <li> but I typically go over the bare skin with a disposable razor every once in a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple of years and my blades are still sharp enough to do the job</li>
            <li> It has definitely surpassed my expectations after I read the reviews for other Norelco products.</li>
            <li> I will admit I&#x27;ve only used one other brand</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I can see how people would like it with the interchangeable parts, so I don&#x27;t totally ding it.</li>
            <li> It has definitely surpassed my expectations after I read the reviews for other Norelco products.</li>
            <li> The unit then stays charged for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> If you rush, a few hours later it might look like you had a battle with a cat as red scratches can appear.</li>
            <li> The comb guides have numbers ranging up to 18, but your choices are limited to even numbers.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try this, as it wasn&#x27;t that much more expensive than just a plain \\&quot;stubble-look\\&quot; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have used every single attachment that came with this item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for the past couple of months and so far it has been good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s replaced at least two individual devices I have already and seems to be working very well after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not do any of the jobs that has been listed, specially for shaving (assume main job) is absolutely useless ... unexpected from Philips...</li>
            <li> I used it to touch up loose ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a pain about it is the the fact the button to run it is a pain to keep pressed down.</li>
            <li> a barber&#x27;s clippers are, so slowing down may be in order to get the hair cut properly.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable guides slide up and down and lock in place with a simple &amp;#34;plastic bar in groove&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The cracks stemmed down the back from where the attachments go (on the side</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last forever compared to other devices, and you can count on it to work for years!</li>
            <li> However if you plan to change the tops putting the other ones back in the stand always make one or the other loose attachments fall because they are kept so close together.</li>
            <li> At times you have to really push down hard when trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> I tried too the wet method versus the dry shave.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with product especially considering Black Friday pricing.</li>
            <li> My uncle recently went on vacation &amp; wished he would have had this razor with him because the one he brought along didn&#x27;t do nearly half of the things</li>
            <li> i took 1 star away cause the guard length selector thing that goes over blade is hard to adjust other than that its a decent razer for the price</li>
            <li> Cutting performance was fine.</li>
            <li> so they snap into their persepective base holders and it is clear for us male species to quickly know where to put each attachment without playing &amp;</li>
            <li> I ended up trimming shorter than intended because it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything at longer settings, probably due to clogging after a single pass.</li>
            <li> Too bad, I also wanted this trimmer to do many things.  </li>
            <li> The guards don&#x27;t clip on smoothly and will sometimes pull the cutting attachment off when you remove the guard.  </li>
            <li> My big complaint with this product is that the beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim it close enough to my skin.</li>
            <li> The close shave attachment is pretty small though, and not nearly as effective as a dedicated shaver.  </li>
            <li> If I have any negative, it is that you can&#x27;t get as close cut around sideburns or under your nose because the clipper edges will cut into your hair (or skin, but I don&#x27;t take it that far).</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the beard trimmer piece, it doesn&#x27;t lock in place too well</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no issues with any aspect of this device, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now and am nothing short of amazed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been careful, mind where you are putting your fingers as you change angles and grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this device tries to do a lot of things.  </li>
            <li> wide array of health and beauty items</li>
            <li> However, after only a few uses this seemed to go away.  </li>
            <li> (It cannot hold all the attachments that come with the unit, and it is liable to fall over.)</li>
            <li> ; switch), through the push mechanism (that is the lock for lengthening attachments), and beyond almost to the center of the unit&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now and am nothing short of amazed.</li>
            <li> I used to be Philips fan, from now on I have to think about it carefully</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t tried the nose hair trimmer yet) that will allow you to sculpt your desired look and do it efficiently and with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> Effectively I am forced to buy a different product because obviously my body hair does not stop growing.</li>
            <li> Love the blue and the charging base.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and my old Remmington Ceramic (that was electric) used to get stuck and pull.</li>
            <li> there highest end offered with Amazon and absolutely love it especially the base it fits in and charging mechanism.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer was great...very helpful for sensitive areas but take it slowly.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve like it in black or grey colour.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s much easier to hold (I would drop the other one on occasion, due to poor ergonomics).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Norelco for making such a cheap product.</li>
            <li> This was my first electronic shaving/trimming tool beyond your basic hair cutting clippers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a Greek guy with thick black hair all over your ass, this baby will make short work of it.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little less red skin/irritation than shaving with a razor, but</li>
            <li> This product works, and I continue to use it since I purchased it months ago, but the attachments come off very easily during use which can be annoying.  </li>
            <li> initial thoughts were that the new style stand is kinda lame...</li>
            <li> But it has other ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have listened to what some of the other viewers posted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had this problem with trimmers in the past, but I&#x27;ve also only ever had two others.   </li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use it daily</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use it daily</li>
            <li> I have been making due with the other attachments but a replacement on a part like that I felt</li>
            <li> The attachments work well for trimming my beard, and any other manscaping that needs to happen.</li>
            <li> /Ear hair clipper: This is the one that I was the most disappointed with.</li>
            <li> /Ear hair clipper: This is the one that I was the most disappointed with.</li>
            <li> When you have to guide combs on, it helps lock the trimmer in, but when you&#x27;re using the other pieces, they can come off.</li>
            <li> You can always use the extras for other parts.</li>
            <li> but the shoddy build quality and plastic material is quite apparent.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I HAVE BOUGHT OTHER</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t braze my skin like all the other shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> the nose/ear one in the other.</li>
            <li> other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as some other reviewer said, you can be brushing your teeth while man-scaping..</li>
            <li> I may just throw the other ones away, finally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive and maybe not worth ~$60</li>
            <li> The plastic beard trimming guard piece had broken sometime, and I finally remembered enough to go to the Philips site and see if it could be replaced.  </li>
            <li> It certainly beats chemical methods, and has far less complications or danger than laser or other intrusive methods that are very expensive and with a small, yet real, danger of very serious side effects.</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be water resistant, but my husband has a theory that whenever it gets a little wet from moisture of the shower then the charge goes bananas.</li>
            <li> only other disappointment with this set is that the charger/accessory-holder only holds 2 of the 4 heads and only 1 of the 3 trimmer guides/combs</li>
            <li> only other disappointment with this set is that the charger/accessory-holder only holds 2 of the 4 heads and only 1 of the 3 trimmer guides/combs</li>
            <li> i am a little disappointed that the stand or cradle does not hold all or even most of the attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it now for 3 months and it blows away prior ones that used NiCad batteries or had dull trimmer blades.  </li>
            <li> I actually do not believe that the device is doing anything wrong, but just that shaving is a bit traumatic for the skin in general.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, not worth it for the money.  </li>
            <li> but it cuts my thick facial hair well.</li>
            <li> this one, hands down.</li>
            <li> I should file it down or something.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never come close to wearing it down.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;down there, but up top\\</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust moving parts around the \\&quot;down there and underneath\\&quot; area, so</li>
            <li> Those kept breaking down on me after about a year.</li>
            <li> its powerful, tight, and cuts close without cutting your skin or pulling hair.</li>
            <li> I checked out the reviews and it appeared that this product would exceed the performance of my previous set.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to charge it up after the typical 45 minutes of use - I&#x27;ve found that charging it after every 2-3 uses keeps me going without interupts.   </li>
            <li> A bit to worry is that you must take your time when shaving in difficult places such as the back...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken it on week-long trips and typically leave the charger at home.</li>
            <li> but the battery died and we&#x27;ve had it less than a year.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this razor for a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> When i purchased for it it was like HALF the price and even still after seeing this shatter on me, I wouldnt even give it that.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro to replace a menagerie of shaving tools previously needed for all of my hairy manly areas....</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Trim and shave all bodyzones with this skin protection shaver made of hypo-allergenic materials to keep your body hair under control with less skin irritation.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower half the time</li>
            <li> Recharge stand is a bit flimsy and needs some way of snapping tools into place as the attachments fall out of their slots with a slight touch.</li>
            <li> Had a previous one which I did not take on</li>
            <li> they won&#x27;t cut you, but you may end up with half a mustache if your not careful.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I bought it one and half month ago via amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not incredibly powerful but given a little patience</li>
            <li> this bad boy till full (about an hour), pressed the power button, and doesn&#x27;t turn on...</li>
            <li> Its not good enough of a shave for the face</li>
            <li> I will update if theres anything wrong with new one...</li>
            <li> , sometimes I feel like it shaves a little too close for comfort.</li>
            <li> A little ticklish though but no pulling whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one takes up a little bit of room on my sink</li>
            <li> About two weeks after that, I saw the little hole had doubled in size.  </li>
            <li> About two weeks after that, I saw the little hole had doubled in size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It hurts skin a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little mesh cover on the head cracked.</li>
            <li> I had this unit for a little over 2 years before it just went dead.</li>
            <li> Battery life sucked and the unit did not have enough power for tough beards/hair.</li>
            <li> By that I mean, the clippers have been known to catch a piece of loose skin and clip, clip, clip.</li>
            <li> The stand holds 2 trimmer heads, but they&#x27;re in an awkward position inside the frame of the stand that doesn&#x27;t leave much room for your fingers.</li>
            <li> It will really do head to toe and meet all your hair cutting needs.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been through a few.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheaper brands, by the time you blow through 3 or 4 in a year you could have invested in this one.</li>
            <li> The mini foil trimmer burned through the foil after running for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> After it went dead, I noticed there were hairline cracks in the plastic casing</li>
            <li> think that for the beard, could offer a narrow</li>
            <li> let battery drain but was dead when tried to use again.</li>
            <li> Stand is light-weight and does not fit all attachments.</li>
            <li> Stand is light-weight and does not fit all attachments.</li>
            <li> He would miss parts of his face and what he did end up trimming was an uneven nightmare.</li>
            <li> I then vacillated with barbers (and growing shoulder-length hair) for about half a dozen years (jeepers!).  </li>
            <li> Many moons ago, I went down the wireless trimmer/groomer/razor path and wound up very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it took WAY too long, and it was impossible to see my chest in the shower, so I was left with a few missed spots and a sprained neck from looking down to see if I missed anything.  </li>
            <li> Because the combs are either going to be jumbled in a drawer together or, worse, kept in the storage pouch, the first one you pick up will be the wrong one, 2/3 of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not easy as they say.</li>
            <li> A small foot print so it takes up little counter space.</li>
            <li> A small foot print so it takes up little counter space.</li>
            <li> The electric shaving heads are pretty bad though.</li>
            <li> The storage area is small and not practical for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Bit one day, a little over several months ago, it turned on randomly when no one was using it.</li>
            <li> Even slight angular pressure makes the head pop off, or at least disengages the drive from the blade head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but other is not good like mastash, beard, ear.</li>
            <li> I loathe non-DIY haircuts now for certain and have had some atrocious trims from barbers and salonists)</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the trick with very little effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;6)The comb guide doesn&#x27;t just pop onto the end of the trimmer, you have to align it with a pair of fairly small track-grooves on the trimmer and then slide it on.</li>
            <li> Instead, you have to grip a small exposed area on the side of the trimmer head while you pull off the comb</li>
            <li> The trimmer usually starts up after removing and reattaching the offending head, but is bothersome.  </li>
            <li> After about nine months of ownership, started stuttering and eventually failed to power on entirely.</li>
            <li> no more no less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> complaints about the various attachments popping off are slightly exaggerated.  </li>
            <li> , I usually just trim my body</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used my cordless clipper in the past to trim my body hair (chest,legs,arms)</li>
            <li> item is for a lady so it doesn&#x27;t need to work on a thick, heavy beard, etc.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> In addition to this expensive shiny blue \\&quot;Razor to End All Razors\\&quot;, I needed to purchase disposable razor blades to shave just the neck area...</li>
            <li> In addition to this expensive shiny blue \\&quot;Razor to End All Razors\\&quot;, I needed to purchase disposable razor blades to shave just the neck area...</li>
            <li> The battery replacement should be simple but they make it complicated like Apple.</li>
            <li> the second just randomly turned on and wouldnt shut off.</li>
            <li> , they do their job usually</li>
            <li> That is .. when you make a pass, its going to cut very uneven because the plastic guide gets in the way of an even trim.  </li>
            <li> I received the product and was very disappointed with how easily the shaver heads pop off.  </li>
            <li> not the ridiculous \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; personel (all female) that told me I had been shaving wrong all along.  </li>
            <li> not the ridiculous \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; personel (all female) that told me I had been shaving wrong all along.  </li>
            <li> Third, I have had some issues with the power on the unit cutting out - usually happens just after I change heads.  </li>
            <li> No problems, battery lasts a long time, and it has yet to yank a hair out or have any trouble at all cutting.</li>
            <li> How hard could that be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not normally a problem, but it is a bit of extra time in the morning that is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to detail</li>
            <li> And the nose picker, Yep it&#x27;s got one, will get those hard to reach hairs up your nose out of there.</li>
            <li> I just find it hard to imagine the people at Norelco sitting around thinking up products and someone says \\&quot;Hey</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way when the shaver head popped off and I stabbed myself in the face with the rotating piece</li>
            <li> an owner of several other Philips products, I&#x27;m disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> , I use it at least once a week to buy me a couple days on a shave</li>
            <li> The bodygroom head could also come with a level adjusting comb so that you could use it cutting in different highs.</li>
            <li> My beard is thick.</li>
            <li> The problem with this system is the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the plastic comb guide are thick.  </li>
            <li> cause my beard is so thick</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard, stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> That would mean it is indeed not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> i mean did what i wanted..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors in the past but always returned them as they usually irritate my skin so badly.</li>
            <li> Plus, the shallow slots allow the top-heavy heads to tip over easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seemed powerful and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy to get refund for a razor that dosen&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought a different one, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I&#x27;m going to spend the money to replace it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets 2-stars for incompetent design, 1-star is reserved for malicious design.</li>
            <li> I like that it has an attachment directly on the body of the shaver to plug in the charger as opposed to having to put the shaver in a base station to charge it.  </li>
            <li> second complaint is how the heads attach to the base.</li>
            <li> Something inside seemed to have misaligned and caused the thing to slowly get into worse and worse condition.</li>
            <li> i recently lost maybe in the garbage :(</li>
            <li> did encounter some irritating issues, however.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t broken it  yet.</li>
            <li> It may look like a million dollars but quality is poor.</li>
            <li> Within a week of very basic usage, attachments began popping off of the base unit with the slightest bit of pressure.</li>

            <li> I eventually lost it and was unable to find a place where I could just replace that part.  </li>
            <li> I heard this vibrating coming from the bathroom and found it had turned on randomly.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about wireless dry/wet trimmers.</li>

            <li> That is so clunky to use that it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> the stand is not that sturdy though and tends to fall over just by looking at it wrong.</li>

            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my husband who&#x27;d been disappointed by shavers and trimmers I&#x27;d picked out in the past.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately it broke</li>

            <li> My favorite shaving/grooming shaver, ordered this Jan 2013 and I like it more everyday I use it, can&#x27;t go wrong with Phillips, and you get what you pay for! a must have mulit purpose shaver!</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year now and it works awesome. Battery life is great and recharges quickly. Gets super smooth, my friends actually noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband as a christmas present. He was very pleased with all the attatchments and opened it up to start charging it. We took the christmas boxes and wrapping and burned them with our trash. A day later my husband went to use this and it did not work. I contacted the seller ( Electronics Warehouse Outlet ) and told them of the problem and the situation with the packaging. They told me that even though I had all of the pieces, literature and everything except the original box they would not exchange it. I will never by from this seller again and will never buy a product made by this company again.</li>
            <li> I bought it somewhere in 2011, and i have been using atleast twice a week... and i should say i did not had any complaints.. it&#x27;s doing what its supposed to do... it charges very fast... and fully waterproof... for a very reasonable price...and nearly after 18 months of use....It suddently stopped charging... since i did no had any backup... i was like.. going mad... until then i did not even thought about the Warrenty...&lt;br /&gt;so i googled product warranty... which is 24 months... now i was hoping that i should get something  from Philips..&lt;br /&gt;i went to their site product info ... there was live chat option... so i had a chat with CC agent... and they asked some questions and asked about the theprouct code.. which was on the main body of the groomer... i gave them they verified purchase and said.. they will ship to my home in 7 days and for Free :)  and with Shipping label for the old one to ship back.... they are shipping the Whole new Peice not just charging Body.. which i really liked... i was just hoping to get only the body not all Accesories... I will update if theres anything wrong with new one... cheers... hair never stops growing :((</li>
            <li> does the job but as has been said, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;jack of all trades, master of none&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3 more words were required to post but i really have nothing more to add ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this and the bodygroom to compare. this one, hands down. it&#x27;s better for close quarters &amp; travel, more attachments. it&#x27;s easy and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bodygroom is heavy, and the silver seems nicer, but the weight means it&#x27;s more likely to slip out of your hands in the shower. there is also a larger ridge than the multigroom, which makes it hard to get into the intimate crevices, and leads to some unexpected bites.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - Powerful motor  - Multiple attachments for different grooming  - Great for sensitive skin/areas  - Nice docking bay for charging and holding all attachments  - Wet/dry operation  Cons:  - None</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moREOJBOLLD32D]]At this time this is simply an unboxing video for the Norelco Multigroom Pro. I will update my review as time goes on. From my initial impression I will give it 5 stars. I&#x27;ll update my review when I have had more time with it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, light, compact and with the right attachments to take care of your whole body. Very gentle on the family jewels, I own a Norelco Body Groomer 2040 and this is definitely a step up. I would&#x27;ve like it in black or grey colour.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it seems to do a good job at the actual business of trimming, I&#x27;m fairly unhappy with it because the poor design requires so much fussy handling. I just want a trimmer/shaver I can pick up in the morning when I&#x27;m half-asleep and shave and trim my beard (like my Norelco that finally broke). But it has other ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The stand is very lightweight and grips the shaver tightly enough that, to pick up the shaver, you have to hold the stand with your other hand - every single time you pick it up. Pick it up with one hand, and the stand will cling on, drop off and fall over, maybe into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The stand holds 2 trimmer heads, but they&#x27;re in an awkward position inside the frame of the stand that doesn&#x27;t leave much room for your fingers. Plus, the shallow slots allow the top-heavy heads to tip over easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The tightness of the recharging slot also means you can&#x27;t just drop the trimmer into its charging slot when you&#x27;re finished - it won&#x27;t seat itself with just gravity. You have to align it and press it in. Meanwhile, the lightweight stand slides around on the counter unless you again give it the two-handed attention it craves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The trim length is not controlled by an integrated sliding collar (like my old Norelco). Instead, you select one of 3 trimming comb guides. They are all clear plastic and look pretty much the same, until you have a cup of coffee. The tiny embossed icons aren&#x27;t much help. Because the combs are either going to be jumbled in a drawer together or, worse, kept in the storage pouch, the first one you pick up will be the wrong one, 2/3 of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The comb guides have numbers ranging up to 18, but your choices are limited to even numbers. The shortest length available, #2, is slightly longer than the length I want. If you wear a true \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; beard, this trimmer will be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6)The comb guide doesn&#x27;t just pop onto the end of the trimmer, you have to align it with a pair of fairly small track-grooves on the trimmer and then slide it on. Then when you&#x27;re done you can&#x27;t just grab it and pull it off - this will pull off the trimmer head with it. Instead, you have to grip a small exposed area on the side of the trimmer head while you pull off the comb guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the only time you&#x27;ll be handling this trimmer with one hand is when you are actually trimming or shaving. For everything else, you&#x27;ll be fussing with it with 2 hands and eyes, trying to avoid tipping over the stand, popping off the head, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this would be good choice if you have a ritual where you devote all your attention to \\&quot;man-scaping,\\&quot; but I just want to shave and trim in the morning without focusing more than I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 2-stars for incompetent design, 1-star is reserved for malicious design.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to what some of the other viewers posted. My big complaint with this product is that the beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim it close enough to my skin. What doesn&#x27;t make sense is that Norelco sells a beard trimmer that does have a setting that&#x27;s perfect, but not this unit. I bought this for traveling, since it has a face, beard, nose/ear trimmer built all into one. But if you&#x27;re looking for a close beard trim, look elsewhere</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it everyday. It shaves everything and even cuts hair. So many attachments that pretty much take care of every hair on your body. How did I live without this before.</li>
            <li> Worst Shaver ever purchased, does not give you a close shave and constantly has a problem charging. Called up Norelco several times and they would not fix or replace their product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to make this too long, so I&#x27;ll be brief.  I cut my own hair for first year at college in 2003.  It was magnificent.  I then vacillated with barbers (and growing shoulder-length hair) for about half a dozen years (jeepers!).  I&#x27;m back to cutting my own hair (and grooming body and nose hair and everything) and the hair cut I give myself with this INDESCRIBABLY elegant, useful, compact, efficient, sharp, and awesome device is the best haircut I&#x27;ve ever gotten (zero hyperbole) and I get to do it myself!  Back in 2003, I used a Wahls then (louder, clunkier, about twice the size and rusted easily and in a cheap plastic case with tons of parts, you needed a mini suitcase to carry around that hair trimmer).  Nothing compared to this elegant, slim, effective, VERY well-designed device.    This thing does everything (it has parts for face razor, but a separate razor might be best for that), but you can  shave face  trim face hair  shave body hair  trim body hair  trim nose hair  give self PROFESSIONAL (much better than barbers.  I loathe non-DIY haircuts now for certain and have had some atrocious trims from barbers and salonists) haircut.    ALL that is with seperate components so you won&#x27;t, for example, shave your balls and then do haircut with the same razor.  Sounds funny, but hey for proper bodygrooming and hygiene this is what works.    I feel like a norelco salesperson with this review and frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if I was (although I am not).      I am minimalist polishing a book on that topic and this device fits my system because it has so many features.  I would have paid $200 for this thing.  Seriously. Best haircut (that I&#x27;ve had) is now a DIY!    I love Norelco products and am saving up to replace my current 8000-model with one of their top 3d-senso-touch razors.</li>
            <li> Product arrived really quick after ordering.  Packaging was sufficient.  I have been using a Phillips Norelco Arcitec that is until I received this product.  After getting it out of the packaging and trying it I have started to use this more so than the other razor that I have (the Arcitec).  The razor does vibrate very strongly, but it is not bothersome to me.  It comes with a nice pouch to hold all the items and the razor.  I like how after a day or two of having not shaved the Trimmer/Shaver Foil takes care of the long stubble with out any hair pulling or pinching.  Though it says you can use it in the shower I have not done so yet.  The shaver looks very well put together and seems very sturdy.  I like that it has an attachment directly on the body of the shaver to plug in the charger as opposed to having to put the shaver in a base station to charge it.  Overall I would definitely recommend this product to friends, family and others as well as maybe buy it again as a gift for others.</li>
            <li> This groomer is awesome.    Having tried so many before this (Remington, VS etc) and getting on mediocre results - especially for beard hair, I am surprised at hoe effective this Philips is for everything it says. The only attachment which could use improvement is the mini-foil shaver - it&#x27;s ok.     Excellent multi-groomer. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Not a lot to complain about with this item.  I bought it hoping that it would work as advertised.  Pretty much does just that.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 5 different trimmers and this is the best one yet.  You do have to be careful where you place your hands so that you don&#x27;t change the length setting, but that is true with pretty much all of them.  This one works smoothly and has several different settings for whatever body part you are using it on.  I didn&#x27;t really think this one would be as good as it is, it seems they all lack at least something, but this one is great.  I hope they continue to offer this one, because I would buy it again, if and when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he seems to love it, haven&#x27;t heard any complaints yet</li>
            <li> Wow, I gotta say that this trimmer set certainly lives up to the reviews! I was sick of paying $20 every time I wanted a buzz cut, since it takes barbers about 10 minutes. How hard could that be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with a well-engineered set of plastic guards that slide into place; just set to your desired length and start buzzing. The hair trimmer guide is labeled with typical guard lengths (I use a #4), so you can match barbershop lengths easily. Three self-haircuts and this has already paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various attachments work great as well. The noise-hair trimmer didn&#x27;t pull hair at all, and the larger clippers will remove every piece of hair it touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a well-made and stylish kit. It even comes with a nice case and well-thought-out caddy that holds your commonly-used attachments. Pretty cool!</li>
            <li> First product i have purchased online.  Great price prompt delivery and was exactly what i thought it was. Works great and very east to change all the pieces.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for all kinds of uses. The only thing that is a pain about it is the the fact the button to run it is a pain to keep pressed down. That is the only problem that I have had with it. It keeps a charge for a while and takes no time at all to charge it up!</li>
            <li> Many moons ago, I went down the wireless trimmer/groomer/razor path and wound up very disappointed. Battery life sucked and the unit did not have enough power for tough beards/hair. I tossed those devices and purchased a wired unit and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to today. I recently moved and my new bathroom does not have an outlet close enough to the sink for my old wired unit. I could use an extension cord but I thought I would take a chance on a new unit, hoping that the tech had advanced enough to be useful. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a phenomenal device. It replaces at least 4 devices I had been using and the waterproofing has let me do my trimming in the shower- saving a good chunk of cleaning the sink/counter from tiny little whiskers. Not to mention the device itself. I&#x27;ve charged it once and have used it 5 times without having to charge it again and it shows no sign of running low on juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible downside I&#x27;ve seen so far has been that the interchangeable heads seem to pop off a bit easy. Other than that, you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old Remington trimmer which felt like it was yanking every hair, this trimmer trims like a hot knife through butter.  The design is ingenious with the ability to swap clippers and the guides that attach to them.  Pop on the guide you want to use, then set it to the length you want.  Also, the guides are sturdy and won&#x27;t flex under too much pressure (another problem with my Remington).  The trimmer itself is small, lightweight, and easy to travel with.  A great device!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1H62PWTBA886J]]after the first week the shaver started to stop working suddenly, it has been a severe pain to turn it back on. After couple miserable experience with this awful piece it stopped working forever. Rest in peace Philips shaver. AMAZON I NEED MY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> -Received the item, was exactly as I thought it would&lt;br /&gt;-Except the beard trimmer, NO way you can create a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look with that particular attachment(but i didn&#x27;t buy it for beard trimming so not too concerned....&lt;br /&gt;-The docking station doesn&#x27;t fit all the attachments and is VERY lightweight -.-&lt;br /&gt;-Charged this bad boy till full (about an hour), pressed the power button, and doesn&#x27;t turn on...so much for that.&lt;br /&gt;-Returning this item.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to replace an inexpensive beard trimmer that was on its last legs.  I checked out the reviews and it appeared that this product would exceed the performance of my previous set.  It does in some cases only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the positives.  The body trimming capability of this unit with the body trimming comb is good - gives me a capability that I did not have before.  The interchangeable heads are easy to attach, and the combs don&#x27;t have any moveable parts, making them much more durable.  My previous set had a spring loaded comb for the beard that broke - one of the reasons I had to look for a new unit.  No such problems with this one.  Beard trimming is also effective and fast.  The LiOn battery is also very good, and the warning light leaves enough charge to complete the task at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did encounter some irritating issues, however.  First, I had expected that the unit would come with a fine small head trimmer, but this may just have been a misconception on my part.  The detail trimmer included is mid-size and only works marginally well, and I wish they had included a smaller head.  Second, the holder does not accommodate all of the heads, requiring me to store the extra heads somewhere else instead of with the unit - a minor pain.  Third, I have had some issues with the power on the unit cutting out - usually happens just after I change heads.  The trimmer usually starts up after removing and reattaching the offending head, but is bothersome.  Finally, I haven&#x27;t had the need to use the body shaver (the large head that is waterproof), so it is extraneous for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say that if one is looking for a beard trimmer primarily, a cheaper option might be a better bet.</li>
            <li> Great product all in all!   Pros:  -Attachments for all sorts and sizes, places and curves, etc.   -Fits great in my hand, and did I mention that there&#x27;s an attachment for everything under the sun?   -The accompanying stand (as seen in the picture) does not hold all of the attachments but it does charge the hand held when it&#x27;s in the dock, so that&#x27;s a bonus for me.  -The battery life isn&#x27;t amazing, but it is cordless! Just remember to charge it up after the typical 45 minutes of use - I&#x27;ve found that charging it after every 2-3 uses keeps me going without interupts.   Cons:  -Don&#x27;t let the battery die. This puppy will not operate while the hand held is plugged in for charging, which I found a bit odd at first. It&#x27;s a great unit though, so this doesn&#x27;t have a major impact on my overall rating.   -In all seriousness, sometimes I feel like it shaves a little too close for comfort. By that I mean, the clippers have been known to catch a piece of loose skin and clip, clip, clip. Just a warning that you want to be sure to hold the clippers as flat as possible to your skin rather than raking it across. I&#x27;ve not had this problem with trimmers in the past, but I&#x27;ve also only ever had two others.   Great investment, and it&#x27;s holding up great compared to my past products of this nature!</li>
            <li> The product works great as a body groomer. I like it very much and all it&#x27;s multiple attachments. It works very well and has a good lasting battery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this groomer for my husband. He has a full beard and is very pleased with it.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and change attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;______&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very versitile. It trims any and all hair to a desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast charge on the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact and stylish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;______&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to make several passes with the shaver attachment to shave my face, and I still need to use a safety razor to clean up stray hairs. Shave at any angle you want, if you have soft facial hair, this won&#x27;t get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the clipping out of the clippers is difficult. The trimmings drop through the screen, past the blades, and land on the greasy axel of the connector and floor of the main razor compartment. You will never keep this thing fully clean. There will always be bits of hair mixed with the lubricant of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine this product lasting more than a few years. Safety razors are not cheap and they are not environmentally friendly, but at least they work on the first pass.</li>
            <li> i have used it twice already .it is a solid machine with a nice feel to it , but it&#x27;s very expensive.  if you wanna have a fancy , solid machine get it , otherwise you can find cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> This started out being a pretty good shaver. After owning this for a month or two the screen on the shaver disintegrated. Had to throw that part of it away. The rest of it has turned out to be okay. I would never order this again nor would I recommend this shaver. There are just too many pieces to this thing and hard to keep track of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for the past couple of months and so far it has been good.&lt;br /&gt;I use most attachments and the battery has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A bunch of different attachments&lt;br /&gt;Easy maintenance&lt;br /&gt;Rinse out under tap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Can&#x27;t really find an attachment for your nether regions.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is not user replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;no vacuum so all the hair falls into the sink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i would recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> Has been a great performer.  Would highly recommend.  Attachments work better than my original Remington groomer.  Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This groomer was purchased to simply keep a beard at stubble length and it works perfectly for that purpose.  Once you understand the idiosyncracies of the guide you are in good shape.</li>
            <li> The kit contains quite a few attachments, none of which do their job effectively. The instructions are printed on a large sheet of cheap paper, folded in half many times, in a type size that requires a magnifying glass to read, in too many languages to be taken in any way other than a joke. I should have returned this item when I had the chance.</li>
            <li> The product is really good and handy. Can be handled at ease. Good backup time. Adjustable lengths. Excellent all body hair removal kit.</li>
            <li> Love the body trimmer portion of this already. Got it yesterday and that part did an amazing job. Just be careful with the beard trimmer piece, it doesn&#x27;t lock in place too well and I had mine go shorter after I had already started trimming. Love all the attachments and the options for this at a great price.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for what it does. The attachments are really flimsy. When taking off the plastic comb, the whole thing comes apart. Getting it back on, it is again pretty flimsy. The description uses the terms water proof and water resistant - what is it? The instruction manual notes it may be rinsed under running water, but not submerged. That would mean it is indeed not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-term summary: The device was used about once a week. Cutting performance was fine. After about nine months of ownership, started stuttering and eventually failed to power on entirely. Product support tells me I might have overcharged it - you are only allowed to charge it when it&#x27;s drained, and then you have to charge it exactly one hour no more no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note: I have called customer support and have been waiting more than four weeks for a replacement. Effectively I am forced to buy a different product because obviously my body hair does not stop growing. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband and he loves it.  He can&#x27;t believe how well it sHAves and how close.  I have bought many shavers in the past but this is the first time he has stated how good it was.</li>
            <li> Not only does this grooming kit have a cool blue body to it but it&#x27;s water proof! This kit also has multiple attachments which I use religiously in and out of the shower. It helps me keep everything from my facial hair, hair on my head and just about everywhere else trimmed up. I don&#x27;t charge it every time but I throw it on it&#x27;s sweet stand set up and im off to my college classes! It&#x27;s very practical and versatile to be short!  Ok story time. I bought this product late September of 2011 October 2011 because it looked cool and I had another older trimmer that was nearing the end of it&#x27;s road. I decided to shell the bones for it. Just now January of 2012 it quit on me. I was using it in the shower and it was slowly dying, but the low power light wasn&#x27;t coming on. I finished up and put it on the stand to charge but the charge light didn&#x27;t come on. I hoped it was just the light going but the next day it wouldn&#x27;t work all together! WELL I went online and found it has a 2 YEAR WARRANTY. I called the hotline and not only was it quick and painless but they sent me a new Multigroom Pro at no cost (I just had to ship them the defective one in return). Couldn&#x27;t be any happier since I am a cheap college guy after all.  OVERALL This grooming kit is great! I love the color, the functions, the stand, the waterproofing, ESPECIALLY customer service. I\\&quot;ll be sad when mine quits for good, and my warranty is expired. This is a quality kit that I hope they manufacture for years. Phillips has a new loyal customer amongst them.</li>
            <li> What a great product. I have had absolutely no issues with any aspect of this device, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month. I still prefer to shave my face with a razor, hence my chosen title of the review. The foil body attachment works wonders, and will certainly tackle any job you may have for it. Well worth my 70 bucks.</li>
            <li> been using this thing for years now. although its a groomer and meant to be used for precision cuts I use this to shave my head every 3-4 days. it keeps my hair shorter than traditional head trimmers. would buy again</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best clipper I have bought.  The unit is solid and it has an option for every part of your body.  Love the blue and the charging base.  Completely recommend this for trimming beards and other parts.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new trimmer and this was the one for me.  I love it, it does not take up a lot of shelf space.  The trimming heads are easily removable/ interchangeable.  I mainly use it for grooming my face and neck and to shape up the back of my head.  It is easy to use and comfortably fits in my hand.  It holds a charge for a long time too which is nice.  It is also very easy to clean.  I am glad I bought this model.</li>
            <li> Firstly the basics: light, good looking device, ready to go after an hour or two charge.    Secondly what could be better: shaving heads can fall off occasionally (though not when in use, but mostly at time of storage).    Now, the device is very, very good at tackling body hair. It certainly beats chemical methods, and has far less complications or danger than laser or other intrusive methods that are very expensive and with a small, yet real, danger of very serious side effects. Body shaving with this device is instead something to be accomplished quickly and with no fuzz --much easier than an actual face shave, for example.    Highly recommended as a body shaver.    *** Update after six months of use, end of 2012 ***    The device continues to charge and it does a very reasonable job with body hair, though I have the feeling that it worked a bit better earlier. I tried it for face shaving once, and the product clearly could not handle it, so it is for the body only.    I tried too the wet method versus the dry shave. The device handled the water well, yet it did not seem to do nearly as good a job as when dry.    I have found too that it can irritate the skin, but that if I dry shave before having a shower, and if I lathe over shave cream in the shower just to moisturize and soothe (in my case I use Geo F Trumper&#x27;s shaving creams) the irritation does not happen nearly as often. I did try a post-shave lotion (Neutrogena) but it did not help to prevent irritation nearly as much as Geo F Trumper&#x27;s) if at all.    I actually do not believe that the device is doing anything wrong, but just that shaving is a bit traumatic for the skin in general. A bit to worry is that you must take your time when shaving in difficult places such as the back... If you rush, a few hours later it might look like you had a battle with a cat as red scratches can appear. However, moderate care prevents this from happening at all.    I continue to be happy with my shaver and recommend it still.    ** One year later, 2013 **    Continues to work. Have not noticed any further diminished efficiency in shaving. Battery recharges great and holds power w/o troubles. Given it has been used daily for over a year, I recommend it even more.    ** Two years later, 2014 **    Continues to work!!! No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have been using various shaving devices over the years but have never been as impressed over the quality and function as the multi pro by Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and dependable.  Works for me. The many adapters can be used for various applications. The pouch provide is used to store the accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many trimmers and this one is the best. It covers the job that used to take three trimmers to accomplish. Great design.</li>
            <li> Versatile and well-made.  Long battery life on each charge is a real plus.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with product especially considering Black Friday pricing.</li>
            <li> I was excited by the other reviews to try out this shaver. I&#x27;m a harry guy and have used a variety of shavers and trimmers over the years. I also have sensitive skin, so I have to be picky about what I use. I&#x27;ve worn a beard most of my life so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to scrape my skin with a razor regularly. Before getting the Multigroom, I used four different devices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A standard corded hair trimmer like the kind barbers use. My beard is thick. The hair trimmer would make short order of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. A cordless beard trimmer that never worked well enough to actually do my beard. I used it to touch up loose ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A battery-powered nose/ear hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope was to replace all of these at once and have the convenience of a lithium-battery device. Here&#x27;s how it breaks down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The trimmer on the Multigroom does do a great job on my beard. The plastic guard is pretty sharp and sometimes catches my skin. I should file it down or something. I decided to shave my head (just a buzz cut, not bare skin) recently and the trimmer manages that quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Since this is basically a beefier version of my old beard trimmer, it&#x27;s no surprise this trimmer manages loose ends even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The nose/ear hair trimmer on this is sub-par. My old one does a much better job. This one is good enough to get by with but every once in a while I get out the old trimmer to really zap those hard-to-reach hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The shaver attachment on the Multigroom works. It&#x27;s not as good as my old Braun rechargeable I had in the 80s. It does provide a passable shave but I typically go over the bare skin with a disposable razor every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Multigroom really shines on three other counts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s relatively compact and lightweight so it&#x27;s easier to travel with. My old shaving gear had to travel in a separate container. This one fits on my travel toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery life is great. I&#x27;ve taken it on week-long trips and typically leave the charger at home. I usually don&#x27;t use it daily but I&#x27;ve never come close to wearing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s water proof! I can clean it by just running water over it in the sink. I can even take it in the shower if I want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go from a harry guy... The Multigroom is not shaving nirvana but it&#x27;s a definite improvement over my old gear!me. I usually don&#x27;t use it daily but I&#x27;ve never come close to wearing it down.  3. It&#x27;s water proof! I can clean it by just running water over it in the sink. I can even take it in the shower if I want!  So there you go from a harry guy... The Multigroom is not shaving nirvana but it&#x27;s a definite improvement over my old gear!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading the many reviews here which raved about it. To say I was disappointed would understate my sentiment. I charged the razor and attached the trimmer to trim my sideburns. The directions said I would hear a \\&quot;click\\&quot; which I didn&#x27;t hear with that accessory or with any of them. I placed the trimmer on the handle. Once I turned on the shaver and started trimming, the top loosened and flew off. No damage done but it did startle me. I tried to look for something I was missing; I couldn&#x27;t believe the item was that cheap. It was. Contacted Amazon and am returning it for a full refund. Won&#x27;t buy again. The hair cutting heads looked rather chincy but can&#x27;t judge them since I didn&#x27;t use them. Item lasted 10 seconds. Seemed powerful and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read the many reviews and was optimistic about the Norelco Multigroom Pro shaver.  I received the product and was very disappointed with how easily the shaver heads pop off.  This product is really not usable for most shaving because the shaver head comes off when you apply even the smallest amount of pressure.  I&#x27;m sending the shaver back and buying a different brand.  I&#x27;m disappointed in Norelco for making such a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Whole body is taken care of by this set ( used all features)&lt;br /&gt;Liked the small space it occupies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had this for two months - completely satisfied and worth the money</li>
            <li> Recieved razor and didn&#x27;t work!! Trying to recieve a refund but that&#x27;s not easy as they say. Amazon&#x27;s A-Z Is trying to help me out but it&#x27;s not easy to get refund for a razor that dosen&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> This thing still works after I have been dropping it in the shower many times. Works in the water. Super tough.</li>
            <li> This razor does everything.  It doesn&#x27;t excel at anything though, but that isn&#x27;t a major detraction for me.  It&#x27;s not incredibly powerful but given a little patience it does the job right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts longer than I&#x27;ve ever needed and I&#x27;m meticulous about my beard.  Also, it&#x27;s fully waterproof so it&#x27;s quite easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each attachment has multiple functions and you need most of them to maintain facial hair.  Works well on the head and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complaints about the various attachments popping off are slightly exaggerated.  I&#x27;ve only had 2 (minor) mistakes happen while using this device over a year long period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only actual complaint is the stand does not hold the attachments very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, gave a great shave but the battery died and we&#x27;ve had it less than a year. It just would not charge anymore</li>
            <li> perfect for man-scapping all areas of the terrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gentle to the touch, and the diverese functionallity is perfect for those hard-to-get areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple of years and my blades are still sharp enough to do the job</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Does what is says and seems to be of good quality.  Not sure if worth the price, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> This body groomer was a good price and worked great.  I liked using the screen option shown in the picture.  I eventually lost it and was unable to find a place where I could just replace that part.  I even went to the Norelco site and submtted a query on it and didn&#x27;t get any response back.  I have been making due with the other attachments but a replacement on a part like that I felt should be easy.  This is why I didn&#x27;t rate this a 5</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco QG3280 Multigroom Pro, allowed me to easily keep my very closely trimmed goatee in check! Even on this questionable looking face, it makes me look good.</li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;ve owned 2 of the Philips Norelco QG3280 Multigroom Pro.  It&#x27;s a great product that has a very short life.  Each time the battery has stopped charging after about 6 months of use.  At this point they have newer versions out there of the product, but I will be cautious about the battery issues after my experience with these.</li>
            <li> Ordered this thing about a year ago, its still working strong like it did the day i got it.  Use it to shave and for hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Each head is well-crafted, fits into the main device perfectly, and the whole thing looks really nice on the charging station. My only annoyance is that the guides are all graded every 2 length units, which means to get the best sculpted look, I have to juggle them back and forth. Not normally a problem, but it is a bit of extra time in the morning that is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for body and face that works well even in the shower. The electric shaving heads are pretty bad though. Buy this for the trimmers not the electric razors.</li>
            <li> This is the best groomer out there! The battery seems to last forever compared to other devices, and you can count on it to work for years!</li>
            <li> Ordered it about a year ago, ended up never showing up in the mail. At one point (I think about 4 months after I ordered it) I remember checking the shipping again and it was stuck on the &amp;#34;shipping now&amp;#34; part. Didn&#x27;t know who to contact about it so I&#x27;m just gonna leave this review here. &amp;#34;Replace or Return&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t have an option for this so I guess I&#x27;ll just wait on you guys writing me back or putting another one in the mail so I finally get one. I think at the time I ended up spending quite a bit on this, so it kind of sucks that it&#x27;s been a year, but still I guess that&#x27;s an excuse but I was also very busy with work last year and every time I logged on amazon to check it I noticed and would get busy with work or family right away so I could never call customer service. I&#x27;m also unsure why amazon wouldn&#x27;t have something that automatically picked up &amp;#34;being delivered&amp;#34; in a queue for 4 months and try to work it out with the seller or the postal service they are using. I guess because they didn&#x27;t expect people as busy as I was to not worry about their money once it&#x27;s out there, but the truth is I just never had the time to follow up. I just don&#x27;t understand how it was sitting in my &amp;#34;Your Orders&amp;#34; tab for so long and no automated system picked it up or no one noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve never actually tried it and that&#x27;s not what this review is about, but I hope to. I guess if PR doesn&#x27;t reply to this comment I&#x27;ll contact customer service next.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this multi-groomer, I cut his hair (what hair he has left) with it, trim his beard.  Has all kinds attachments and does a great job.  Stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> In the past, my groomers have lost their battery life steadily and broken easily when dropped. I&#x27;ve dropped it several times, and it keeps on working. It has great battery life. The attachments work well for trimming my beard, and any other manscaping that needs to happen. I also love being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this razor for a year and a half now. It works great. Bit one day, a little over several months ago, it turned on randomly when no one was using it. I heard this vibrating coming from the bathroom and found it had turned on randomly. I kept flipping the switch off and on, but it wouldn&#x27;t turn off. Finally I plugged it into its cradle charger and it turned off. This product is supposed to be water resistant, but my husband has a theory that whenever it gets a little wet from moisture of the shower then the charge goes bananas. The only way to prevent this from happening is to keep it completely dry at all times. I&#x27;ve never had a razor do this before. But overall we like it just fine over other razors we&#x27;ve owned in the past. Not sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but that all depends on whether or not I find anything better after this one dies.</li>
            <li> Works great, charge lasts and lasts.  My husband and I share this trimmer.  We use different attachments, so there was no need to buy more than one. Great product.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this trimmer for nose hair (yep), but love the fact that it has so many other pieces too. It is light and cordless, so easy to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> Works well in most scenarios and very convenient overall.  The close shave attachment is pretty small though, and not nearly as effective as a dedicated shaver.  Not that you would/should expect it to be, and I don&#x27;t really SHAVE shave enough to care.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to charge it every 10 min and no oil required, waterproof too.After trying several others this one is the best,</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have used this a few times now and am nothing short of amazed. It has definitely surpassed my expectations after I read the reviews for other Norelco products. It is compact and fits comfortably in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had much luck with electric shavers and in the past and I&#x27;ve been through a few. Before this product I have had to use a combination of a razor and hair clippers for my face. This, with its dual clippers and foil does a awesome job even after a weeks growth of facial hair. Very, very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer is good, I wouldn&#x27;t say amazing, but it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It does certainly get the job done. A little ticklish though but no pulling whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair short so the hair clipper attachment is perfect and works well. I have really thick hair and my old Remmington Ceramic (that was electric) used to get stuck and pull. Not this bad boy! And it&#x27;s battery operated! I use it in the shower often just to keep the hair trimmed which is really convenient, no mess and no need to vacuum when done :) One caveat, be careful not to push the release button for the guide. I have not had a problem yet but I&#x27;ve been careful, mind where you are putting your fingers as you change angles and grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body trimmer attachment with the rounded edges is well designed and does a great job. Safely gets into sensitive areas without a problem ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has now replaced a hair clipper, beard trimmer, nose trimmer and my razor without issues and I am so happy I have thrown all the others away and gotten rid of the clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (10/18/2013):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is still going great with no noticeable degradation in battery life. My girlfriend has since discovered that the \\&quot;Bodygroom Shaver\\&quot; attachment with the two trimming edges works well on her legs. She has since replaced her shaver with mine. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about having to share thisshaver :( She does say that it works better than any groomer she has ever bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers and this one is by far the best ever. I highly recommend this product. Can&#x27;t remember being more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works okay. Feels light and plastic. Not the best designed product. Be careful when attaching the clips as they might slide off the groove and if you inadvertently force it too much it may break at some point. Happens to me all the time but I haven&#x27;t broken it  yet. It feels flimsy but it gets the job done so no real regrets. I&#x27;ll buy a better one next time. Maybe a Braun.</li>
            <li> this shaver/trimmer is very good. It has every attachment you could possibly want. It is well designed and very easy to use. I especially like that you can plug the charger directly into the trimmer so you don&#x27;t have to take the stand with you on trips. It is pretty expensive and maybe not worth ~$60 but I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> very good product and mainly charger fit all inputs across the world so no need to carry specific voltage convertor all the time :)</li>
            <li> Jack of all trades, master of none.  I was disapointed by this item&#x27;s inability to deliver on its promises.  For my face, the beard trimmer was too close on the lowest setting and too far on the second lowest setting.  My old remington mb-300 was perfect and had more \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; settings.  I&#x27;m not a fan of beard trimmers where the plastic attachment combs aren&#x27;t connected above the metal trimmer section beneath it.  Seems to poke my face and I have to trim more carefully, ie. slower and more time consuming.  For armpits, it was ok.  Really nothing to complain about here, but my mb-300 did just as good.  For chest, the included attachment wasn&#x27;t very good at all.  I had to repeatedly go over the same areas, regardless of what direction.  Stretching out my skin didn&#x27;t help it shave any closer.  Maybe a little less red skin/irritation than shaving with a razor, but it took WAY too long, and it was impossible to see my chest in the shower, so I was left with a few missed spots and a sprained neck from looking down to see if I missed anything.  Up by the top of my chest was nothing but guess work as to whether or not I got it all.  The \\&quot;down there, but up top\\&quot; area was its best performing area.  I don&#x27;t trust moving parts around the \\&quot;down there and underneath\\&quot; area, so I can&#x27;t review that.  All-in-all, not worth it for the money.  I&#x27;ll stick with a dedicated beard trimmer with more stubble settings and a razor for all the other areas.  Faster, cheaper and no missed spots.</li>
            <li> So this device tries to do a lot of things.  Trimming -- whether it be arm or back hair, facial hair or whatever, it does a pretty ok job of.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  The foil shaver does a good job as well.  But the product claimed to be great for cutting hair.  Well, for most people, it will disappoint.  The product comes with three plastic guide attachments, one which is suppose to be used for trimming hair.  You have settings from \\&quot;1\\&quot; to much higher.  The problem with this system is the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the plastic comb guide are thick.  Which means if you are trimming your head of hair (I had my wife do this), well if you want short hair, its going to create \\&quot;tiger stripes\\&quot;.  That is .. when you make a pass, its going to cut very uneven because the plastic guide gets in the way of an even trim.  My original cutter for hair has a guide that simply raises the trimmer from the head to varying lengths but keeps the head of the trimmer all exposed thus creating an even trim.  But the plastic guide here gets in the way.  Even if my wife keeps going over and over the area moving the trimmer from side to side, you still have terrible job.  We had to finish up using our old hair trimmer.  Too bad, I also wanted this trimmer to do many things.  Buy it JUST for a trimmer for body hair and NOT for cutting hair.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after his old (crappy) one died. He&#x27;s been so happy with it. He spent quite a lot of time checking out the different attachments lol. I really like the stand, it looks nice and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to go for the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look, yet still well groomed so as to not look like a bum. I already have a cordless shaver, a cordless hair clipper, and a nose hair trimmer but I decided to try this, as it wasn&#x27;t that much more expensive than just a plain \\&quot;stubble-look\\&quot; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used every single attachment that came with this item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual full razor head: I use this to shave my neck, my stubble look starts just below my jaw line. I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors in the past but always returned them as they usually irritate my skin so badly. This one only slighty irritates me, but I don&#x27;t rash out from it. Perhaps since I only use it every 2-3 days but it does a good job. As good as a blade? No. But not bad. You can also use it to shave your chest, it does well and close but I only do this once in a great while, I usually just trim my body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small/detail razor head: I&#x27;ve been using this one on my cheek areas to shape my stubble. It does a good, close job BUT if you press too hard or angle it too much the head pops off all too easily. Also, the razor isn&#x27;t as wide as the actual head - it would work so much better if it was the full width so you&#x27;re actually trimming exactly where you want. As it is, your trimming about 1/8\\&quot; away from the side so it&#x27;s hard to detail precisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair clipper/attachment: I have really thinning hair (pretty bald/thin on top) so I just buzz my hair. I&#x27;ve used this once so far and it did an outstanding job, although I did set the guard one notch too low - next time I&#x27;ll know better, I didn&#x27;t really want it THAT buzzed :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body hair attachment: I&#x27;ve used my cordless clipper in the past to trim my body hair (chest,legs,arms) yet it never did a good job unless you used the shortest setting, which makes it really obvious that you trimmed your body hair. This one did a great job on my leg and arm hair, cutting it shorter but not too short, it looks much more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard attachment: This is the one I use for my stubble length and I find I&#x27;m happiest with the shortest setting, maybe one higher. This does a great job, I&#x27;m very pleased with the look. Also works great on eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose/Ear hair clipper: This is the one that I was the most disappointed with. I have an older Panasonic nose hair trimmer and it works far better than this one. I swear the one included with this set did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other disappointment with this set is that the charger/accessory-holder only holds 2 of the 4 heads and only 1 of the 3 trimmer guides/combs and I do use all of them (except the nose hair trimmer). Not all of them everyday, but it leaves me with having attachments all over the counter top or in drawers which is not convenient. I does recharge quickly and I really like the electric blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the set and I would recommend it to others - just keep your old nose hair trimmers around.re natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard attachment: This is the one I use for my stubble length and I find I&#x27;m happiest with the shortest setting, maybe one higher.

            <li> Great groomer to keep hair at the proper length.</li>
            <li> Some heads is working good that for body it is nice but other is not good like mastash, beard, ear.</li>
            <li> I HAD NO LUCK. WILL DAMAGE THE HEAD</li>
            <li> Product is great for general grooming but it really didn&#x27;t do the job for my face. Just a lot of back and forth on my chin with no hair removed.  However shaving body and nose hair has never been safer and easier!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband last month and he still loves it. works great, quiet enough, all over great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a good motor for the size. Other than that, it&#x27;s a bad joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The (many, perhaps somewhat redundant) interchangeable heads are held in place by a magnet. Even slight angular pressure makes the head pop off, or at least disengages the drive from the blade head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally unusable unless the heads are taped on. They can be dislodged by a casual change of grip even when the comb-cowls are attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product is in no way damaged, and and works correctly otherwise. If it didn&#x27;t fall apart so much, I&#x27;d like it and give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised because other Phillips Norelco products have been quite good and solid to use. My confidence in this brand has been sorely shaken.</li>
            <li> Main shaving attachement broke within 3 months of use. Just waiting to use my two year warranty. The PLASTIC hair trim piece followed not long after. Warranty is warranted!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it :-) very easy to use charge last a long time , I highly recommend. I love that is cordless no more tangled up cord from my clippers</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about wireless dry/wet trimmers. This product more than exceeded my expectations. It will really do head to toe and meet all your hair cutting needs. The battery powered motor is surprisingly powerful for its size. The different blades do their intended job very well. I can say goodbye to my wired clippers finally.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer/shaver i&#x27;ve owned, it does everything you could possibly think of, very sturdy, charges quickly, and when you use the body grooming tool its just like you used a razor, but with zero irritation and no stubble (unless thats what you want, and there IS a attachement for that lol). Love this thing!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my Sweetheart for Christmas, he said it works better than the more expensive brands he&#x27;s used before; he loves all the attachments, they all work great.  This shaver was a big hit.  It arrived earlier than estimated. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the price.  Its instructions come in a huge thin paper and the hair attachedments are plastic with no instructions other that their name but now how to use them.  It comes with a very nice case you can carry the attachemetns.  The shaver itself is very easy to store and plug in.  The shaver is good ............and the trimmers seem to do a good job too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is for a lady so it doesn&#x27;t need to work on a thick, heavy beard, etc. so that could be a concern to think about.......</li>
            <li> This is very handy with a lot of add ons. At times you have to really push down hard when trimming your beard. I don&#x27;t mind it but it wasn&#x27;t quite as good as I expected in that area. Everything else is great though. Charges quickly when you are in a hurry, and has enough attachments to trim or shave anywhere on your body with precision. Great Product overall.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome do it all shaver! And the two year warranty is wonderful!! I had been using mine for almost a year now, and the body groom shaver got a snag in it, and the battery was no longer clicking into the units. I saved the box and called the customer service number, and they are sending me a whole new unit in 5-7 business days, and return packaging for the damaged unit. I am amazed at the quality and great customer service this company supplies :)</li>
            <li> I put this on my wishlist this year, since my old groomer was at least 5 years old, and was on its last legs.  I read the reviews, and I thought this might do the trick for me.  From my first week of use, it has pretty much exceeded all of my expectations.  It does everything.  It feels robust, and has a sturdy design.  It comes with a charging stand and a travel bag (crucial for me, since I travel 50% of the time).  It&#x27;s easy to use, and has a large selection of attachments.    I mostly wanted it to trim my beard, which is what I used my previous trimmer for, but it also comes with an additional attachment for body grooming, and another for hair (scalp) clipping.  I&#x27;ve been considering cutting my own hair, and I believe this trimmer will do the trick using the appropriate guard.  It&#x27;s not super-robust, like a barber&#x27;s clippers are, so slowing down may be in order to get the hair cut properly.  I feel confident, though, that with some care, I will be able to get my hair trimmed without having it break down or pull my hair out - only my lack of talent will result in a crappy hair cut.  Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I could be more happy with a grooming tool, particularly considering the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m chucking my corded trimmer.  This is a really well though out cordless trimmer that is waterproof, comes with a lot of attachments and just works very well. It&#x27;s replaced at least two individual devices I have already and seems to be working very well after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco grooming products products and haven&#x27;t been pleased with them. Their trimmers with NiCad batteries seem to die after a couple of years of light use. I had their trimmer with the vacuum for catching hairs, and the little catch that holds the door for trimmings broke off that in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to be a winner. Here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Lithium battery should help it last longer than a couple of years before throwing out and helps it retain a charge when not used&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer works great for different beard lengths or a manicured stubble look&lt;br /&gt;-Body groomer, while not perfect, seems to be the best on the market and is easier than any other way I&#x27;ve found of removing body hair in awkward places&lt;br /&gt;-Nose hair trimmer works nicely&lt;br /&gt;-Nicely designed stand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Attachments don&#x27;t snap on securely. I&#x27;ve accidentally removed them many times while just trying to adjust the comb length.&lt;br /&gt;-Not exactly a con, but more attachments then are really needed. Some of them seem to duplicate what others do, particularly the different combs for beard, body and face. I can&#x27;t really see that there is much of a difference between the 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend the trimmer, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly and was received exactly as described.  The person that recieved this item as a gift claims it works very well.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this modern trimmer from an old Philips Norelco (the black ones with NiCd batteries) and boy is it an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, having a fully waterproof trimmer makes shaving/trimming etc. in the shower a breeze.  It also makes cleaning out trimmed hairs from the inside of the trimmer a snap.  The device is well constructed, and feels good in the hand: not too big, not too small.  The various attachements are smart, and fulfill basically any trimming need you might have.  A real standout of this package is the body trimmer; it is gentle enough for even the most sensitive trimming jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had problems keeping all of the attachments in the stand (it is easy to accidentally knock the stand over and send them all flying) but this is a minor issue.  The Lithium-Ion battery is phenomenal and allows me to keep the device always charged; never again will I get midway through cutting my hair only to realize that the battery is about the die!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you own one of the older/cheaper Philips Norelco models I would HIGHLY recommend the upgrade; it is worth every penny.  And if you don&#x27;t own a trimmer yet, you will be hard pressed to find a better alternative.</li>
            <li> i am a little disappointed that the stand or cradle does not hold all or even most of the attachments. this may not be a big deal for some, but it is to me. it does come with a travel pouch and i guess i can put them in there, but i feel that it defeats the point. i will also say to be careful with the body trimmer attachment as shown in the main picture. its like driving a Ferrari on the freeway instead of my normal work truck. very quickly you will be running out of road and driving through brush and even swamps with that thing when you did not initially plan to. it was difficult to stop once i started. if you fail to catch what i&#x27;m saying, lets just say i am smooth in places that i have not been in almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> I had a older Norelco G380 grooming kit that this one replaced. They made many improvements to this one: better attachments, the upgraded battery.  Good Job.</li>
            <li> it has many useful aparatus. Especially body groom part very good.&lt;br /&gt;If hair cutter has a little long, it is better.</li>
            <li> I used remington grooming kit for almost more than 3years but not at all satisfied which made me to search for another cool product which philips made it.I have been using it since 5 days its really awesome. The thing i like the most is charging stand and it needs only 1hr time to charge which is excellent.I recommend this product to all. You will never feel regret believe me guys.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get wordy here but it works pretty well however, I feel that my previous one was better (it was a Philips Norelco as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly use it to shave my face once a week and does a decent job.  I would buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this same device that eventually just gave out.  This one is an awesome replacement.  I would give one word of caution... choose a higher setting and work down, I put this one on the same setting as my old one and...well... they weren&#x27;t the same settings!  Guess I&#x27;ll be regrowing my beard!</li>
            <li> I will admit I&#x27;ve only used one other brand so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s out there. This by far blows away my last one. I hesitated on the price but went ahead with purchase as my wife can use it in the shower as well. I wanted to put some tires on it and drive it. its powerful, tight, and cuts close without cutting your skin or pulling hair. I it charges fast and has the right attachments. We love it.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews before making this purchase.  All I can say is AWESOME.  Be careful where you need to be careful, but with the attachments, there is no other grooming device you will need!!!!</li>
            <li> than i have after buying this shaver.  Honestly you don&#x27;t need all of the attachments, I only use two of them, but i guess it&#x27;s nice to have options.  Probably should have bought a cheaper one but whatever, it&#x27;s nice to use it in the shower to trim my balls</li>
            <li> very good product, however carry-on bag very cheap and tore up as soon as I got it. machine works great thought....</li>
            <li> Great for keeping sensitive areas trimed. it is probably the one best product all around for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;you can use it no problem solo ...but best to get your spouse to lend a helping hand if possible.&lt;br /&gt;works in the shower also.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver/trimmer kit a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred a more slimmed down charging station though.  This one takes up a little bit of room on my sink area.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s large so it can hold some of the smaller items in the back, but come on.  That is so clunky to use that it&#x27;s useless.  I just keep a tray in my medicine cabinet for all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I used most of the attachments already and they all worked \\&quot;good\\&quot; or \\&quot;great\\&quot;.  Nothing was terrible.</li>
            <li> This baby does it all!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: compact, long battery life, complete grooming set fits in a nice bag.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my facial hair for over 35 years and this is the best trimmer ever. The multiple heads all are precise, easy to use guides and the most powerful rechargeable motor combine for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Amazing shaver and with all the attachments it serves every purpose you can imagine from body hair to facial hair it is great. Its all in one but i do still have a separate facial shaver also.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver exactly one year ago. I use it to shave and trim not only my facial hair, but my head as well. This product is amazing. The shave is close and the razor bumps are non existent (though my skin may not be as sensitive as others). The chassis is thick and pretty hefty giving off the impression of quality. About one month ago, the spinning metal piece which is critical for the heads to vibrate broke off after falling off of my sink. I chatted online with a  representative from Phillips and told him that the product fell. He told me it was covered under warranty, asked for my information and sent me a replacement one week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely deserves the 5 start rating.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast, decent product in the sense it doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave but great for trimming facial hair or small/tight areas for a hair cut ex: ear and neck. Very little cleaning required easy to maintain, I use it at least once a week to buy me a couple days on a shave</li>
            <li> It is a good product. It does exactly what it says in its description. Good Battery Life and the accessories are useful.</li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday on Mar 28, when i tried to use it the head came right off, evidently there is no locking mechanism. When you put on the cutting guide and try adjust cutting levels, the head comes off. To see if it was an isolated problem we used the return option and got a new one, today Mar 30. Guess what? The same problem. time to pack it up and send it back, this time I won&#x27;t be getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay for this one item, it is definitely worth it. Its waterproof and the body groomer attachment is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of razors/groomers/trimmers over the years, and this is the best one yet!  You get a hair cutter, body groomer, detailer, and ear/nose trimmer all in one package!!!  Save yourself some space, hassle, and money and buy this!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made for myself in a long time. It shaves great and fast. I cut my own hair and beard. It does a wonderfull job. And the nose picker, Yep it&#x27;s got one, will get those hard to reach hairs up your nose out of there. And painless too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I registered it online, I was given an extended warrantee. The battery lasts a long time too. It is fast &amp; easy to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had long waited to replace my old groomer and this was a great choice, for a pretty solid price.</li>
            <li> This was my first electronic shaving/trimming tool beyond your basic hair cutting clippers. I read lots of reviews for various products and picked this one as packing the most punch for the price. I put it on my wishlist and hoped Santa would deliver. He did and I was pretty excited to finally be able to keep my face groomed without it being a major time-consuming chore involving scissors, comb, razor, shaving cream, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first surprise with this \\&quot;Head to Toe\\&quot; grooming kit was reading the instructions and descriptions of all the different attachments and realizing there really isn&#x27;t an attachment for actually Shaving your face. Trimming sure, detail trimming and shaving yes, \\&quot;body\\&quot; hair shaving you bet, shaving your neck beard nope. It specifically says in the instructions that the big foil shaver attachment is for \\&quot;Below the neck only\\&quot;. The only other shaving foil is the tiny miniature one that takes many passes pressing hard to shave down a couple little stubbles, so getting a close shave on your neck will never happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a pretty nice set, though the stand isn&#x27;t great and doesn&#x27;t hold as many attachments as you&#x27;ll need to get through anything like a full face grooming. Glad they also threw in a bag to hold the rest of the pieces, as you&#x27;ll need to pull that out too almost any time you use this. Just trimming my beard/mustache and trying to shave my neck/cheek area and trim nose/ear hair I used 5 different heads and 1 guide. Spent as much time swapping parts out as getting any grooming done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard/mustache comb seemed to get clogged up very easily to where it didn&#x27;t seem to be trimming anymore. Hopefully now that I have it and can trim regularly this won&#x27;t be a continual issue. I ended up trimming shorter than intended because it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything at longer settings, probably due to clogging after a single pass. I felt like I had to go over and over and over and over and over any area to getit trimmed somewhat neatly. The length guide/comb thing had me worried with how it attaches, it seemed like it could very easily slip to a shorter setting with light pressure, or the adjustment \\&quot;button\\&quot; easily pressed during shaving as it is in a place your hand is likely to rest. But neither of these things has happened so far, it stays in place much better than I&#x27;d expected by looking at it. Time will tell if it stays that way, as the small plastic bit that holds it seems like it won&#x27;t take much time to wear down enough to slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, as a disclaimer this is the first product of this type I&#x27;ve owned/used. Perhaps there&#x27;s no device that&#x27;ll give a great trim/shave without spending hundreds, in which case this gives a decent trim for a good price. The only major flaw to me is the lack of an attachment intended to close shave the neck/jawline. All the various facial hair styles they display in the product info and on the box aren&#x27;t actually possibly using just this item, as many of them have various parts of the face clean shaven, which is NOT possible when using this device as per the instructions. Great for trimming, but don&#x27;t throw away your razors just yet!</li>
            <li> It does many jobs satisfactory, but no jobs excellent.  For the price though I think it&#x27;s a good deal.  I would recommend this to someone with minor facial or body maintenance.</li>
            <li> My new Phillips Norelco QG3280 Trimmer and Shaver is fantastic.  Received mine for a Christmas gift and started using it immediately. The quality and ease of switching the removable heads is fast and efficient. The ear and nose trimmer works fantastic.  I use it daily to shave and has become a part of my morning ritual. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is ok. It gets the job done, but I have to wonder if its required for companies to hire people with no common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first complaint is about the stand. I just can&#x27;t wrap my head around how they came up with the idea for this. I just find it hard to imagine the people at Norelco sitting around thinking up products and someone says \\&quot;Hey, how about we make a trimmer with 8 attachments, but only make a charging stand that has space for 3!\\&quot; I just can&#x27;t figure that one out. Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t sit quite right on the charger. You have to kind of press down and wiggle it to make sure that it actually makes enough contact to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second complaint is how the heads attach to the base. They just stick on. When you have to guide combs on, it helps lock the trimmer in, but when you&#x27;re using the other pieces, they can come off. I learned that the hard way when the shaver head popped off and I stabbed myself in the face with the rotating piece inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these two complaints, it is a very nice razor. If it weren&#x27;t for these two issues, I would have rated it a 5. I wish I had bought a different one, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I&#x27;m going to spend the money to replace it. These issues are really just an annoyance, but at the price of the item, I feel like it would have been common sense to fix these issues. I guess I just don&#x27;t understand how business works.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well and has a good variety of trimming heads for many jobs.  It cleans up easy and holds a charge for a decent time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that it doesnot always work well on long hair (body hair) but it may be that I am just not use to the trimmer yet.</li>
            <li> It has nice features but somehow the guide on how to use all the parts that comes with it is not quite clear. I found myself wondering &amp;#34;hmm what&#x27;s this for?&amp;#34; many times...</li>
            <li> As with many multi grooming tools, it does some functions better than others. Are you going to cut hair as well as a large plug in  clipper? No Way !!! Will it groom your beard and mustache Absolutely !!! I do however feel it is well made and time will tell how it holds up. The stand works for me for charging. The storage area is small and not practical for everyday use. I do however really like it&#x27;s size for it does not take up much room and therefor leaves lots of room for a small soap dish that hold attachments for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razer kit back on September 3, 2012  Not even a year ago.. and  i noticed just recently that the whole handle/motor assembly is all shattered to many peices.  It was NEVER dropped  and i am the only one that uses it and i only use it like once a month to trim a beard. The plastic on this model is so LOW quality that it litterally got brittle.. and  when i tried to put the attachment on it.. the thing shattered comepletely in my hand. There is cracks all over it that keep expanding and breaking off more peices as you touch it.  I know this sounds obsurd but this is TRUE as i said this unit was NEVER dropped and only used like once a month if that since September 3, 2012. and when i touch the peices they like break apart.  You know this WAS a nice system and had alot going for it.. everythign was included. i mean did what i wanted.. but the quality is so LOW END.. that it isnt worth spending the price that is being sold here. When i purchased for it it was like HALF the price and even still after seeing this shatter on me, I wouldnt even give it that.  It is almost like a disposable shaver kit.. use for a few months and then as it  gets old starts to wrtither away and break apart!..  and the funny thing is the warrenty isnt any good either. I tried to contact the company afor over a week now and they WILL NOT respond. Cheap Cheap! Save your money!!</li>
            <li> No problems, battery lasts a long time, and it has yet to yank a hair out or have any trouble at all cutting. I even use it to shave my head in place of my larger, more powerful clippers quite often.</li>
            <li> Nice battery when new. Stopped working after 2 years of occasional (monthly) use.  This unit was very nice when new, but did not hold up well.  Hair got inside of the unit, and caused electrical shorts and length adjustment issues.  At the 2.5 year mark it stopped working entirely -- I do not know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this unit to occasionally groom mostly during the summers (swimsuit weather).  It worked great to trim up excess chest and back hair.  The attachments are very nice, the shaver attachment shown in the photo is great for quickly removing hair.  Its not good enough of a shave for the face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed, as I thought I had spent more money to get a more reliable unit.  That was not the case.  I&#x27;ve just bought a Wahl instead.  Lets hope it holds up better.</li>
            <li> Attachments easily disconnect from the shaver body while using. They don&#x27;t lock to the shaver body properly.</li>
            <li> yea this is much better than the 15$ razor I had previously.  the stand is not that sturdy though and tends to fall over just by looking at it wrong.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco Groomer for my husband for Christmas. He had been looking for a personal groomer for quite some time but either they did not have the attachments he wanted, were to expensive or of poor quality.  This product ticked all the boxes, he said this is the best groomer he has ever had.  Uses it daily and it is:  easy to use, works super in the shower, has all the necessary attachments (and more) and is easy to clean.  He would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The only negative first. This isn&#x27;t a great product for shaving anywhere. Having said that, every other tool in there is excellent. The battery life is excellent, the tools look great and are very good quality and the beard/moustache trimmer (the reason I bought it) is the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my cousin&#x27;s 18th b-day, (he loves it) Turns out his dad has been using it as well (he loves it too) haha My uncle recently went on vacation &amp; wished he would have had this razor with him because the one he brought along didn&#x27;t do nearly half of the things the Philips Norelco Qg3280/41 Multigroom Pro, Blue does!!! Well, just bought him his own, planning on giving it to him as a gift. This is a great gift to give to any man, any age who cares about his appearance.</li>
            <li> had another Phillips trimmer that I dropped and it stopped working so had to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;decided to give this one a try as I have had good luck with the brand as long as I didn&#x27;t drop them.&lt;br /&gt;lots of adapters to this so I can trim and manscape from head to toe if I so desire.&lt;br /&gt;holds a charge for a long time as well</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it and uses it all the time now.</li>
            <li> Crappy and cheap. Sad.</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro to replace a menagerie of shaving tools previously needed for all of my hairy manly areas....also knowing that specifically, shaving with a traditional razor.  No matter how many blades are stacked up, gel strips applied, or vibrating handles in various speeds, I virtually ALWAYS get that irritating razor burn/razor bumps that are not only unsightly but also are small breeding hotspots for bacteria to fester.  Gross, huh?  Yeah....&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro Q3280 promised to be my panacea when it came to full body grooming.  I believed them...what with all of the various trimming attachements, combes the promise of being 100% waterproof and most importantly of all...the color blue.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is true.  sometimes I shop based on color first and details second.  But, not in this case.  Actually, it was the \\&quot;Body Groom Shaver\\&quot; attachement that was the final selling point for me.  \\&quot;Trim and shave all bodyzones with this skin protection shaver made of hypo-allergenic materials to keep your body hair under control with less skin irritation.\\&quot;  Yessir!  That&#x27;s the ticket for me!&lt;br /&gt;Now, having a full beard and mustache, I naturally used the beard trimmer with mustache comb to keep myself looking dapper.  For the neck area, I obviously used the Body Groom Shaver with the wide foil head...so I could make sure that the area most prone to razor bumps and razor irritation for any man \\&quot;I\\&quot; know looking smooth and blemish-free (or as close to it as possible).&lt;br /&gt;For about the first 4 months or so, we were great partners.  I&#x27;d give the ultra modern lithium ion battery some electrical fuel and in return, it would, provide me a complete battalion of hair-removing possibilities about every 3 days or so...&lt;br /&gt;The honey moon ended after that, though...&lt;br /&gt;One day, I noticed an extra large \\&quot;hole in the foil \\&quot;screen\\&quot; of the Body Groom Shaver.  Nothing major, you see, but something to make me take note.  I continued to use my trusty shaver as always.  About two weeks after that, I saw the little hole had doubled in size.  Oh.  Interesting.  Look at the intricately spinning blades that secretly hid beneath the shiny smooth exterior that I had come to trust on a bi-weekly basis to make me feel dashing...&lt;br /&gt;But...tragedy struck during week three.&lt;br /&gt;Not noticing  that the original hole had grown into a full-fledged window of sharp blades waiting to cut and scrape anything they could devour, I shaved as normal...noticing that the chore THAT morning seemed a bit forced...and almost felt like the old disposable razor blades of yore that I previously would fight with....&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off the soap with warm water, lo and behold, I saw that my entire neck, from ear to ear, was a racetrack of red scrapes, cuts...some with blood seeping through.  YIKES!  What had happened?!?&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on with my story, but this is a review about the product itself...not the ridiculous \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; personel (all female) that told me I had been shaving wrong all along.  In addition to this expensive shiny blue \\&quot;Razor to End All Razors\\&quot;, I needed to purchase disposable razor blades to shave just the neck area...sorta like I had done in the past...and had great wisdom to move away from and be welcomed into the embrace of Philips Norelco&#x27;s time-trusted line of shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;I beg to differ.  And so it went...I&#x27;d rather return what part of my original purchase I had left for a partial refund than to continue to use this shameful and pain-producing utensil of metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;(my trusty shaver as always.

            <li> I owned a Philips body groomer before, but after two years the battery died, I thought it will be easy to change it but is ain&#x27;t so. Called the Philips, they said I have to send it back to replace it. Instead of sending them back, I had to buy another one. The battery replacement should be simple but they make it complicated like Apple. Otherwise, it is a great product. I had to throw the previous one even though it was still in good condition.</li>
            <li> I bought them for a haircut, number one size. They do the job perfectly, you can even use them alone. So if you wear your hair short like me it’s a sound investment. You can always use the extras for other parts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the design shape but the actual functionality of the slide on click of adapting grooming tools does not work very well.  Once clicked it easily unclicks and there is not a locking mechanism that secures the adaptor grooming piece in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result unfortunately is that the razer, trimmer hair cutting grooming adapters fall off and disconnect frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage of adapters looks great in pic but is far from ergonomic.  I have designed medical products around the world and really like the stand for the main handle that can have one adapter grooming device attached but the rest of the stand is &amp;#34;SAD&amp;#34;  Philips should have sat down with the guys in the USA in various home or apartment bathrooms where space is limited either by the size of our sink counter space or the encrouchment of our female partners wide array of health and beauty items LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I may offer, Philips design engineers: trash the current stand and make one that has a wider base, better power connection and cord hiding, one that does not tip easily and one that can nicely hold all or most of the adapters and making it so they snap into their persepective base holders and it is clear for us male species to quickly know where to put each attachment without playing &amp;#34;round peg into square hole&amp;#34; time consuming games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought the Philips Diamond Sonicare  Electric Toothbrush (Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric) there highest end offered with Amazon and absolutely love it especially the base it fits in and charging mechanism.  Beard and Hair Engineers go over to the Dental Engineers, crack a Heineken some Dutch Treats and share the love.  Having lived in Europe designing user interface technology it all comes down to making sure the majority can easily adapt, use and care for consumer devices.  If this can be done without any male swearing in the morning after a fun night out......YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So can you build me what I want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Philips and Amazon for letting me help out for the future.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a Greek guy with thick black hair all over your ass, this baby will make short work of it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice groomer. The multiple attachments all work nicely. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice set of grooming tools.</li>
            <li> I have had this for two weeks now, and I really like it. It does what you need it to do, with lots of attachments and different foil and trimming heads. IMHO you cant go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> My husband had been complaining about the shaver he had because it only had three interchangeable heads so I bought this one kinda on a whim. I cannot express my/his enthusiasm and just plain happiness with this item. He actually looked at it and said he didn&#x27;t know why he hadn&#x27;t bought it before. Thank you Norelco via Amazon.</li>
            <li> No complaints, other than I wish they would come up with a better holder for all the heads for this thing.. but that is a nice problem to have, and it is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy and durable. I wish the stand could hold all attachments. This unit is loud, but I expect that since it seems to have a pretty strong motor on it.</li>
            <li> After about 10 months of use it will not turn on. I used it in the shower as directed but apparently it couldn&#x27;t handle it. Now it&#x27;s in the trash.</li>
            <li> Given the fact that I grow hair wont shine.The product met my expectations and zipped the hair off like a breeze!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> 1. Very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;2. Charges very fast&lt;br /&gt;3. Holds charge very long&lt;br /&gt;4. All attachment very good, especially for body grooming.</li>
            <li> Great trimming set. Recommended.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many grooming devices over the past 2 years. This is the best. I trim my husbands beard and have never found an electronic trimmer that works as well as hand held scissors until now. I can set the beard length and it trims evenly his entire face. With another attachment I can shave the top of his head (my sweetie has a beautiful bald head on top) and then clean up the nape of his neck. Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheaper brands, by the time you blow through 3 or 4 in a year you could have invested in this one. There is a special attachment for ears and nose trimming that works equally well without pulling.</li>
            <li> Shaver is really good while it was working but the shoddy build quality and plastic material is quite apparent. It may look like a million dollars but quality is poor. Mine broke after 12 months of use and that&#x27;s with very sparing use, maybe once or twice a week. I put it in the cupboard after it broke not realising it has 2 years warranty, currently trying to get a warranty replacement from Amazon, see how that works out. Will update afterwards.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again.  The only problem is the heads seem to fall off easily.  If I am trimming, the head falls off, so I have to keep the angle at a certain angle or it will keep falling off.  Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li> It is a favorite. It works very well, is quiet, nice close shave. The color is also very pleasing and unique.</li>
            <li> THE BEST. I HAVE BOUGHT OTHER AND HE WAS REJECTED BECAUSE NO THAT FOR WHAT met were announced. THIS IS THE BEST OF NORELCO AND DOES EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY IN THE DESCRIPTION, ALSO MAKES PERFECT</li>
            <li> I bought this product on October 2012 and in april 2013 ti stopped working. I took it to fix but they said the is no way to fix it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy but like to keep my chest and arms trimmed. This has enough power to trim me up and the battery last for both my arms and my chest. I also like that I can use it in the shower. Its much better than the previous models.</li>
            <li> Horrible design.  The multiple heads designed ti fit on the handle only sit on the handle and do not lock in place.  When you attempt to use the product the heads fall off.  Worthless razor.  My old Norelco worked great for about 10 years then the lock that holds the heads on broke.  Ironic that I purchased this POS to replace a dependable product that I paid 1/3 the price 10 years ago.  Someone at Norelco should be fired for allowing such a poor product to be sold at the top price point.  Shame on Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have had other rechargable trimmers in the past, but none were as useful as this one.  The clipper guards were tight when I first used them.  They would sometimes take the entire attachtment off if I tried to adjust them.  However, after only a few uses this seemed to go away.  The clipper guards now slide smoothly.  I give this trimmer a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Works very well, the use wet is better because avoid blades from heating up or harm the skin.  Change the head type is easy, and is very light too, I tried on my head and is better than the regular hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great! I had to replace the blade about 2 and half years into having it, but that&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Very good at all task and can take it in the shower. Great charge life.</li>
            <li> When you take off your shirt at the beach do people stop and ask why you&#x27;re wearing a sweater? Are you often mistaken for a Sasquatch ? do strangers throw bananas at you ?  Is your nose hair starting to look more and more like dreadlocks? is your goatee home to an actual live goat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve answered yes to any of the above - you&#x27;re in the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I&#x27;m not a comedian. But I take shaving pretty seriously, in addition to electrics I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for years and have an extensive collection of both. But when it comes to my goatee I&#x27;m all thumbs. Enter this excellent personal trimmer by Norelco, Once considered a low end  brand Norelco has re-vamped their product line and after 35 years as a devoted Braun fan I recently switched to the Norelco Senso-Touch 3D razor and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing this trimmer over other brands was an easy choice to make and the benefits are tremendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Charges in an hour and holds a charge equally as long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Comes with more attachments then you&#x27;ll probably ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Cuts with excellent precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Effortless to use, quick and fast. No razor burn, hair pulling or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your beard, moustache or goatee you can choose the length you want to leave it, mow it down and then shape it with one of two small heads that do an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body groomer glides effortlessly and lets you contour and define or shave it all off without leaving stubble. The older we get hair grows everyplace expect our heads. In that respect the ear and nose trimmer is fast and efficient. Changing heads, comb cutting guides and foils is a breeze. Each accessory comes in a marked plastic bag so they&#x27;re easy to store. Some reviewers have complained that the base doesn&#x27;t hold them all. If it did the base would be the size of an ottoman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem sells most everyplace at $70 - it&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon at $49.99. You can easily spend twice as much and still not get close to all this personal trimmer offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer. Lot&#x27;s of extras. A small foot print so it takes up little counter space. 2 year warrantee and sensational results all add up to an excellent buy for a personal groomer that performs beautifully.an easily spend twice as much and still not get close to all this personal trimmer offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer.

            <li> I purchased this unit over 18 months ago (here at Amazon).  The plastic beard trimming guard piece had broken sometime, and I finally remembered enough to go to the Philips site and see if it could be replaced.  I used their live chat functionality, and even though it was just one of the attachments that was broken and I was only hoping to get that single piece replaced, they&#x27;re going to be sending an entirely new unit to me -- and they suggested that solution.  Not only has the body groomer been working great for this entire time, but the customer service was amazing.  When this new one dies, I&#x27;m definitely going to be going back to Philips for the next one(s).</li>
            <li> Previously had the older version of this and it was time for an upgrade! This new version is amazing. I love all the attachments and the battery life is great!</li>
            <li> Simply it has every thing I need and it is waterproof. I think it is the best I used comparing with other brands.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave everything but my face. Nose, ear, pits and more. I use it in the shower half the time and it still works</li>
            <li> I think I have had this thing for over 2 years and I have charged it all but 10 times. This works great. I use it to trim my beard 3-4 times a month. Works great. It has multiple attachments that work great if you want to clean out your ear, nose etc as well. The stand is designed to keep the footprint compact and not clutter your bathroom. However if you plan to change the tops putting the other ones back in the stand always make one or the other loose attachments fall because they are kept so close together. Minor issue but the benefits outweigh the cons and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. The only attachment I haven&#x27;t used on this thing is the actual shaver since any electric shavers give me rashes, I cant review that.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The battery last forever, you can use it in the shower, and the attachments are easy to use. If I have any negative, it is that you can&#x27;t get as close cut around sideburns or under your nose because the clipper edges will cut into your hair (or skin, but I don&#x27;t take it that far). If you get to aggressive with the angle on the smooth shave and clipper attachment it will &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; you. Other than that, I have really enjoyed this clipper set. I grew my &amp;#34;no-shave November&amp;#34; beard and really enjoyed grooming it on December 1. Other than needing a razor for really close shaving and finesse work, this is the best electric razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> I have not tested all the options that comes with this, but so far is a very good deal, I would recomend it.</li>
            <li> I have found this groomer to be decent to use, and I like its quick charge and handy battery life.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I never intended too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that the stand that it comes with is not very easy to use, and serves more as a marketing device than a functional storage stand.  (It cannot hold all the attachments that come with the unit, and it is liable to fall over.)</li>
            <li> What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;The motor is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;100% waterproof. Use it under shower easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;It hurts skin a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove hair that neat.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it!  Best of all, his unruly beard is finally trimmed and under control!</li>
            <li> My husband says that the shaver is GREAT and not noisy!  I got it for him for a Christmas gift and apprediate the he is very impressed with it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best Trimmer I Ever Owned!  It&#x27;s quality built and should last many years like any Philips/Norelco product.  All of the attachments work great and built to last!</li>
            <li> I used it and it does work as advertised. The trimmer was great...very helpful for sensitive areas but take it slowly.</li>
            <li> This product works, and I continue to use it since I purchased it months ago, but the attachments come off very easily during use which can be annoying.  The adjustable guides slide up and down and lock in place with a simple &amp;#34;plastic bar in groove&amp;#34; mechanism that is also easy to slide out of place if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the nose/ear hair cutter, its the kind that spins around and just doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job, so I have kept my old one for this purpose (replaced it because other parts of it broke when it was dropped but that piece is undamaged).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are pretty sharp so far, though so it works pretty well as long as you are staying conscious of &amp;#34;not touching the wrong thing&amp;#34; while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-D</li>
            <li> This is a really good product from Philips that performs alot of functions for your body. I bought a seperate one for my chest hair and face, but than i came upon this product which helped me save money and space. The battery life is pretty decent for one to shave his chest and legs. Comes with a great storage tool as well. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> ...the stopper that holds the plastic guards in place came off way too easily, this is not what you&#x27;d expect for a $50 trimmer. Other than that everything works great. I&#x27;m tempted to give this three stars just for the little piece of plastic coming off so easily, but I do use this trimmer a lot and have no other gripes besides that. I lost that plastic piece so I just hold the guard in place with my hand instead of the plastic piece.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my husband who&#x27;d been disappointed by shavers and trimmers I&#x27;d picked out in the past. I&#x27;d say this thing has way too many options - but in all is a good pick because it will likely have whatever attachments and functions you are looking for. You can simply discard or store any that you won&#x27;t use or don&#x27;t need.  Purchased in Dec 2012 is still working great 2 months later.  Good value for the money compared to similarly priced competitors.</li>
            <li> The beard shaver and small trimmer are great, but the body groomer and the shave foil are poorly designed. I find that the attachments sometimes fall off when I use them to clean up my neckline or use on back hair. It would be nice if they attached more firmly.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Multigroom Pro is great. I love it. It probably is the best shaver I have gotten so fare and it doesn&#x27;t braze my skin like all the other shavers I have used. The only think I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t charge when you use it but I can work around that.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer. It cuts well and has good battery life. My only two complaints are the stand and the guards. The stand will not hold all the guards/attachments and it is cumbersome.  They would be better off with a stand like the Walh. The guards don&#x27;t clip on smoothly and will sometimes pull the cutting attachment off when you remove the guard.  Overall it&#x27;s worth the money. Just not a 5 star trimmer.</li>
            <li> First off I am a man who has a lot of facial hair. And the foil attachment is incredibly close and accurate. It is soo comfortable and close and never tugs.the clipper attachment is so accurate and requires very little skill.and for the mini foil trimmer,is perfect for etching designs if you like.i am very pleased with this mans best friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product from Philips. Easy to operate and does the job nicely. It also includes a small carrying case which is nice for traveling purposes. Also, the body groomer can be used under shower. Only con is that the charging stand is really light weight and comes along easily whenever you lift the trimmer. Overall, a nice product for people you a trimmer and a mini shaver, all in one</li>
            <li> I gave it a three start rating because the top part comes off when trimming.. so you have to secure it with your fingers to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come off. It trims well and it is a pretty accurate trimmer but.... it would be nice to be able to use it without having to worry about the thing coming off.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for shaving your chest, armpits, private area (really useful) and the face. i would recommend this product. it charges quickly, is durable and easy to carry anywhere you want. i recently lost maybe in the garbage :( anyway im going to order my second pair. try this product you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> When I bought this item I didn&#x27;t believe it would work as proposed, however it worked, I couldn&#x27;t believe when I saw all my face sleek and clean. I recommend.</li>
            <li> i took 1 star away cause the guard length selector thing that goes over blade is hard to adjust other than that its a decent razer for the price and i have to shave with the blade before shaving with the shaver head cause my beard is so thick and i tend to just shave before church (not everyday)</li>
            <li> The battery life is great and the trimming heads all work well.  I actually cut my own hair using two mirrors and was complimented on the job.  I use it weekly to trim my beard as well.  I&#x27;ve had it now for 3 months and it blows away prior ones that used NiCad batteries or had dull trimmer blades.  The fact that it&#x27;s water resistant makes it much more versatile.</li>
            <li> The mini foil trimmer burned through the foil after running for a few minutes. Had no idea that was possible. Was a great little attachment but that parts useless now.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it works well. The fine tuning trimmer head is plenty gentle. The other ones for thicker hair will grab skin if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend. He has very wire like hair on his face and most razors will not shave. This is a good razor that shaves his beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this! My old trimmer got lost so I really needed one and found this one on Amazon. I love that I can use it in the shower and that it has all of the different attachments. This is hands down a great investment</li>
            <li> I bought this and didn&#x27;t even notice at first because I didn&#x27;t use it for the first couple of weeks I had it. The clip to the mount broke and when you try to shave at a certain direction the attachment falls off. Not even worth trying to get another one I just went and bought an actuall hair clipper that was heavier built.</li>
            <li> I wanted somehting that shaved, trimeed my breard and deaql with those pesky noes and ear hairs ... this does it all ... I certainly can see some faults, but for the price and my needs it&#x27;s great ...</li>
            <li> I had this unit for a little over 2 years before it just went dead. Keep in mind I have very fair hair and I shave maybe 2 times per week for my face and maybe one time a month for the rest of my body.  I used it primarily in the shower and one day it was just dead. After it went dead, I noticed there were hairline cracks in the plastic casing and I never dropped it or abused it. I also cleaned and oiled it after almost every use. The cracks stemmed down the back from where the attachments go (on the side opposite to the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; switch), through the push mechanism (that is the lock for lengthening attachments), and beyond almost to the center of the unit&#x27;s body. So, I would guess some water finally made it inside this unit to end it&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I&#x27;m stuck overseas for the next four months with no shaver. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but razors give me pimples and ingrown hairs. I purchased this unit mainly because it was one of a few that advertised 100V-240V. Anyway, I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands that are maybe built a little better. This is the first unit I&#x27;ve had that died prematurely for something other than a battery issue. Then again, this is the first unit I&#x27;ve had that was &amp;#34;waterproof.&amp;#34; So, it might still be working if water wasn&#x27;t a factor.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer set is the best I&#x27;ve used for the price. Plenty of power and the ear nose attachment works awesome. Shave daily and this trimmer&#x27;s charge last&#x27;s a while and when a charge is needed, its quick.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, I think you will like the items.The performance is very rich, a lot of things can be done, fully waterproof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the different attachments.  I don&#x27;t use the shaver one, because I have a nice shaver.  But the nose hair trimmer and small clippers are indispensable.</li>
            <li> this product is excellent, because I can have everything in just one machine and the accesories work perfect, quality look good</li>
            <li> Other reviews might be more helpful than this one, but I would like to say that this product is exceptionally good. I have it for over a year now and it really does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things I would change about it: when you place the heads in that little base it comes with you might notice that they fit quite loosely and that a medium acceleration can make them fall off. The bodygroom head could also come with a level adjusting comb so that you could use it cutting in different highs. That&#x27;s somewhat done by using the regular trimming head with its adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver that I could use in the shower, and bought this on the recommendation of a friend. At first, all of the attachments and the fact that it was waterproof were really handy. But after only a few uses, it started to breakdown, with the seal between the motor and the shaver now being able to be dislodged with only a slight touch. Which means it&#x27;s no longer waterproof - the entire reason I bought it. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has done everything that I wanted,so far it has been great no problems easy to clean &amp; portable works great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son.  He wanted to shave his face and to give himself a haircut.  This product allows him to do just that.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Easy! Durable product!!! Will buy again for a gift!!!!! Great value! Very user friendly!!! Great product for men and women!</li>
            <li> I regret that I bought this product.I should buy another one. turbo systerm Norelco&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is powerless. Just look pretty</li>
            <li> Ok!&lt;br /&gt;Just think that for the beard, could offer a narrow shave.&lt;br /&gt;Don´t think gets a shaved appearance even with the shorter razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it too many times yet, but I&#x27;m so far satisfied.  I really like the short charge time.  It only takes about an hour and charges up to full strength.  The unit then stays charged for a very long time.  There&#x27;s no need to charge it for each use. It works good on chest hair, and with care, it works on private regions as well.  You can definitely get a good manscape.</li>
            <li> Best all-in-one clipper in this price range.  Can use it for all your manscaping needs.  Good battery life, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> great shaver/trimmer. long battery charge and a tool for every hair on your body. love this!!! I wish i would had gotten this alot sooner.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower to shave my head. Nice being able to do it more frequently without the mess.  It doesn&#x27;t get quite as short as I would like it but that&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body attachment doesn&#x27;t shave very well for me but overall I like being able to take in the shower and not being tied down with a cord.</li>
            <li> I usually go the cheap route on stuff like this and just use head clippers for the body. I splurged on this product and am very happy. The versatility is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a cheapo on this kind of stuff, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. I have not owned another that campares, The only thing that would make it better is if the charging station held all the attachments and was a little more stable, easy to knock over, The trimmer is excellent, You cant have it all, I guess.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and some unwanted hair around the face. This trimmer does the trick with very little effort.</li>
            <li> Only had it for about four days so far but - I was surprised how well all attachments work. The mini shaver was the best surprise, not only done it get in small places and allow styling but it cuts my thick facial hair well. The trimmers are rounded and so will not scratch my face or body. The body attachment seems to work with my long thick hair but seems it would take all day for a full body shave, the trimmer works great to trim my unwanted body hair. The trimmer guards stay set on the number you want, really well for now. This thing is small but powerful, very pleased for now. Oh the noise trimmer works great to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice looking, and it definitely has the power to get the job done. The foil shaver works pretty well, I use it regularly, holds a charge for a long time too. I do have some gripes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: the guards kind of suck in that I like to trim my facial hair very short, the shortest guard is still too long. I like the shaver so I dealt with it, but don&#x27;t be surprised if you think so too when you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: they give you a crap ton of heads, but the base only holds two, and poorly at that, the rest have to stay in the bag, a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like it though, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I want to like the product, but it is just not enough &#x27;scaper for this man. Call me metro, but I believe that a well groomed body is a hallmark of the modern gentlemen. Of Mediterranean descent,I cant help but say that this just feels like a toy when mowing over my thicket-ed woolly torso. The parts feel plasticky and cheap. On the other hand, I can see how people would like it with the interchangeable parts, so I don&#x27;t totally ding it.</li>
            <li> Cheap parts fell apart after 2 times i used it..</li>
            <li> My fiance was very pleased by this purchase.  He claims the razor works great!  He&#x27;s even considering changing from a manual razor to electric razor forever!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not do any of the jobs that has been listed, specially for shaving (assume main job) is absolutely useless ... unexpected from Philips...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great, not horrible. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the $50.00.  Has a pretty cheap look and feel to it.  It gets the job done, but takes a while.</li>
            <li> Product is durable and well made as advertised. Recharge stand is a bit flimsy and needs some way of snapping tools into place as the attachments fall out of their slots with a slight touch.</li>
            <li> works great for few months then breaks. first one head attachment broke. the second just randomly turned on and wouldnt shut off. let battery drain but was dead when tried to use again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older model of a similar device by Norelco that died after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This newer model is better in just about every way. The heads are of both better quality and variety. The fact that this one is wet or dry is also nice. It has replaced my regular razor as well, since I can now do everything with one device. I use it to trim or shave anywhere I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular clipper end works great and cuts very smooth, with the attachments you can cut to various different lengths, but I use it bare most often. The attachment comes in handy for trimming the goatee and eyebrows to a certain length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaver head is one of the things I like best about this device. Wet the shaver a little and apply some shaving cream to desired areas, and you get a pretty darn close shave. You have to go various different directions in some spots to make sure you get it well, but it&#x27;s so quick and easy that it&#x27;s not a problem at all. I&#x27;m able to use this anywhere I need, face or elsewhere such as more delicate areas. I&#x27;ve never been injured by the device and it has never pulled any hair. It cuts through nicely and my facial hair is pretty course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear &amp; nose hair trimmer works good, no problems there - never any snags or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thoughts were that the new style stand is kinda lame... The stand only holds 2 heads, 1 clipper height attachment, and the maintenance brush, besides the main unit itself. Well, after not long, I figured out that I only really use 3 heads anyway, so I keep the regular clipper on the device and I keep the shaver in one side of the stand and the nose/ear one in the other. The nice thing is actually that the stand holds the groomer nice and easily and also charges without needing to shove the groomer down onto it like the old one; just rest it down and it&#x27;s good to go. Also the stand is pretty sturdy although it&#x27;s real light-weight. The stand of the older style Norelco groomer was a problem too as the design of it pretty much sucked, so although this newer one doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the original&#x27;s stand, it&#x27;s a much better design in just about every other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, over-all I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer. Take care of it and it should take care of you for a while. It seems like Philips/Norelco are always improving these products, so when yet another newer version of this comes out, I&#x27;d be sure to check it out. This one has been a much better experience for me than the predecessor and am confident it will last longer, too. It sure is more useful to me since it also has taken place of my main way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to pick some gripes, it&#x27;s the following: 1) It&#x27;s blue... 2) Stand is light-weight and does not fit all attachments. 3) I have no idea if you can buy new foils for the shavers or anything.orelco groomer was a problem too as the design of it pretty much sucked, so although this newer one doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the original&#x27;s stand, it&#x27;s a much better design in just about every other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, over-all I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer.

            <li> My husband loves this. The instructions said it would probably take a while to figure it out and it did.</li>
            <li> It has everithing you need. Goog batery, multi voltage, excellent. Maybe the price would be cheeper but the machine is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to expect fare more from Philips/Norelco. Within a week of very basic usage, attachments began popping off of the base unit with the slightest bit of pressure. Furthermore, the trimmer&#x27;s performance under wet conditions was sub-par; the generic ten-dollar multi-purpose groomer I had before performed just as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an owner of several other Philips products, I&#x27;m disappointed to say the least. I&#x27;m returning this product immediately.</li>
            <li> After about three months, the outer foil on the head used for body hair grooming broke. Something inside seemed to have misaligned and caused the thing to slowly get into worse and worse condition. When I tried to get the foil back into position, I realized that it was torn. It would probably hurt a lot, or cause bleeding, if I were to use it in this state, so I can&#x27;t use that head anymore. It&#x27;s a real shame that such a vital part broke so soon without any way to get a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to Philips customer service and they will be sending me a replacement body shaver head once it is back in stock. That&#x27;s really good customer service and I highly appreciate that. The one thing is that it might take quite some time for me to get the head, but I guess I can wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will review again a few months after I get the new head; let&#x27;s see if that one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son for Christmas.  Although he had requested a lesser model bought him this one.  He has been so happy with this product that I ordered a second on for my husband, who also loves it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first Lithium Ion shaver, so I am pretty happy with the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most attachments work well. The exception is the beard trimmer which does work fine, but is a little clunky when changing heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the stand had a holder for all of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those two items, I really like the shaver.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a good woman&#x27;s razor but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that looked decent. This works well so far.</li>
            <li> after reading mixed reviews i was a bit concerned about the purchase but product is great! this is my first body groomer and cannot compare it well but it i can say it leaves a really close shave in all areas. and guys, its safe.. really safe for ALL areas. as some other reviewer said, you can be brushing your teeth while man-scaping.. Great product, the cheapy plastic holder for all the pieces if the least of concerns when it provides the results ones looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these several times with superb success, also use for facial hair if I fail to shave during a weekend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy.  I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 9am.  This thing plows through my beard like a charging rhino.  Buy it.  Battery lasts for a long time.  BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Works real nice. Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I was dumbfounded to discover that the head isn&#x27;t secured to the body and comes off once any pressure is applied to the trimmer making it unusable. I honestly wonder how this ever made it into production. I&#x27;ve never seen a product so badly designed.</li>
            <li> This product is Horrible...Very difficult to work with. The guards are very difficult to change and when trimming my beard it was very uneven and patchy. I then had to go to my barber to fix it. I&#x27;ve used a trimmer from Sharper Image for years that was Amazing. Unfortunately it broke and they are no longer in business. I&#x27;m very sorry I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I went through 3 of the original body groom trimmers. Those kept breaking down on me after about a year. So I decided to try this one out, and immediately, I could tell this was superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s much easier to hold (I would drop the other one on occasion, due to poor ergonomics). Second, the head holds onto the blade/trimmer much better (the other one would pop out after I had it for several months).</li>
            <li> I bought my fiance this for our anniversary and he uses it all the time. He&#x27;s very happy with it and I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s too cause I can&#x27;t have him hairy! Lol. Very good machine, recommend it to all. Good for shaving the body as well.</li>
            <li> Had a previous one which I did not take on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this and was well pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair (what&#x27;s left) very short and this does an excellent job of making it tidy.&lt;br /&gt;The facial hair pieces do a very good job.</li>
            <li> After couple of time using the product, I went back to my scissor and razor. The only thing that this product is good at, is the noise trim, but you can get something much cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Now before you read this review please note that my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t use this to trim his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver for men who don&#x27;t have the right equipment to control their hair growth. I was shopping for my boyfriend for a shaving kit that could do it all. This is the perfect shaver for all his needs. It has a body hair shaver, body hair trimmer, eye brow trimmer, nose trimmer and yes even the hair trimmer (though he doesn&#x27;t use that part). In the time that we&#x27;ve dated I couldn&#x27;t stand how he maintained his hair (or lack there of). His eyebrows would get so long that they&#x27;d go into eyes (so I trimmed them with hair scissors. He would miss parts of his face and what he did end up trimming was an uneven nightmare. And you could see his nose hairs from a mile away (not literally). But now thanks to the Phillips Norelco QG3280/41 Multigroom Pro, he looks like he actually cares about his appearance and he loves how user friendly it is.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have used this a few times now and am nothing short of amazed. It has definitely surpassed my expectations after I read the reviews for other Norelco products. It is compact and fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li> Capable of full head to toe grooming, fast recharge, portable and durable.  This product took the place of several separate devices.</li>
            <li> I put this on my Wish List for Christmas and my wife bought it for me. I really really didn&#x27;t need it because I have 3 other mini battery operated trimmers, 2 electric full sized and one battery nose trimmer. Too many trimmers that almost work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this one is the best ever. I may just throw the other ones away, finally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve a full beard now for ah jeez...40 years, so I&#x27;ve been through a lot of trimmers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you get a bunch of attachment, guides and trimmers and they all work as advertised. The Lithium Ion battery is the best, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like being able to wash the heads off under running water, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t nick yourself with this thing, the points are rounded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only conplaints, if you could call them that are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is silly, it falls over, it doesn&#x27;t hold all the attachments, but you need it for charging or i would toss it.&lt;br /&gt;The body groomer works great except it says not to shave your face with it. You can and it works well, except you have to be careful of the edge trimmers on top and bottom. they won&#x27;t cut you, but you may end up with half a mustache if your not careful.&lt;br /&gt;The carry bag is cheaply made, but who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all its well made, works great. I highly recommend it, except for the stand it&#x27;s a 5 star from me.</li>
            <li> My husband is VERY picky about his shavers/trimmers.  He loves this and has yet to complain about it. Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought it one and half month ago via amazon.com. It worked very good till yesterday. The little mesh cover on the head cracked. I couldn&#x27;t even see any instruction to install, clean or fix it. I used to be Philips fan, from now on I have to think about it carefully</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to use it as a nose hair trimmer. I now use it not only for that but to trim body hair. It also has a blade to edge facial hair. It was fairly inexpensive and i have had it for awhile now, so it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> I used to have hair on my body and after using this product it has been vanquished. This set of clippers blew through stubborn areas that other clippers missed and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple different shavers to maintain my goatee/mustache and it was cumbersome.  This thing was reasonably priced has a lot of different attachments (I haven&#x27;t tried the nose hair trimmer yet) that will allow you to sculpt your desired look and do it efficiently and with minimal effort.  The lithium ion battery maintains a charge well (so far) and charges up quickly when it runs out of juice.  Definitely very useful.</li>
            <li> Things like is are all the same, they do their job usually but the implementation of the organization of the items with it usually stinks.  This does a better job than normal but for the price you would think the organization mechanism would be a lot better.  You get a quality grooming tool but the organizer is the same shabby stuff you get no matter how much you spend.  I weighted that against the quality of the groomer and ended up with a 4.  I think this could be a 5 if the engineers thought of the second problem with all of these tools.... what do you do with all of the items with it?  They did not solve this problem well.  To prove my point, if you are a guy, how many adapters to shavers do you have in your drawers?</li>
            <li> This razor does not trim my beard evenly.  I literally have to take the guard off and trim manually with a comb as it left numerous hairs 1/8&amp;#34; to 1/4&amp;#34; long next to the section that it successfully trimmed.  Complete joke.  If you have a thick beard, stay away from this product.</li>
