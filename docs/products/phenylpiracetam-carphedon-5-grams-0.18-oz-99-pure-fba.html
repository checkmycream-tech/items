            <li>Also it mixes in great with a pre-workout drink and gets you focused real good.</li>

            <li>Was really happy to receive the product so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>it still has great effects.  </li>
            <li>Liftmode has a great product here.</li>
            <li>Great job.</li>
            <li>No therapeutic value experienced from taking this product with or without choline.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying more products from liftmode as they had excellent service and answered any questions that I had.</li>
            <li>This is excellent for immediately clearing brain fog, but it&#x27;s easy to build a tolerance.</li>
            <li>I loved the COA that came with the jar.</li>
            <li>Good communication/followup.</li>
            <li>all the reviews mention about LIFTMODE being good legit company...</li>
            <li>This stuff works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>(if you want a feel good &amp;#34;chill pill&amp;#34; try Aniracetam! :-) )</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>stick to the proven stuff unless you can get a nice placebo effect yourself.</li>
            <li>gave this three stars since it may not be a problem with the product, just my own chemistry may not mingle.  </li>
            <li>kind of &#x27;deal&#x27; is that?&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the seller LiftMode is very easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to get a more descriptive lab certificate instead of just an ambiguous graph with the product.  </li>
            <li>The scoop delivered seems to provide me with very accurate dosages as well.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It also makes me more sociable and outgoing.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I&#x27;m tapping into a greater percentage of my brain.</li>
            <li>I have bought from LiftMode before and was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the phenylpiracetam alone, I did experience more focus, but again, did not reach &amp;#34;zen,&amp;#34; as I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Painless from start to finish - I just love to shop with Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I feel more energetic, I have tons more focus, I&#x27;m happier, .....</li>
            <li>Make sure you get some form of choline to help out the brain functions, it works better that way.  </li>
            <li>As with anything, some people may have better results than others.</li>
            <li>felt mostly mood change with this.</li>
            <li>it gives more brain power.</li>
            <li>am impressed with Liftmode customer service and would give them six stars out of five for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>they sure can seem like it!]&lt;br /&gt;However, DO NOT buy itâ€”</li>
            <li>Words form more easily.</li>
            <li>Felt comfortable placing this order with them and to find this awesome product at such a great price, with super fast shipping -</li>
            <li>Having used piracetam I can honestly say that this stuff has been far more effective.</li>
            <li>My body grew a tolerance to it very quickly but if it is taken infrequently (3 times a week)</li>
            <li>Thankfully, my body takes to this supplement easily.</li>
            <li>go easy</li>
            <li>the focus wasn&#x27;t always where I would have liked but overall a good experience.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with my Amazon Prime shipping and it was fulfilled by Amazon so that criteria doesn&#x27;t really apply here, although I was happy to get it right on time.</li>
            <li>Really, the effect is a lot more impressive than I would&#x27;ve anticipated, and I&#x27;d like to purchase this stuff in bulk for the future.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such an awesome product at a reasonable price point!</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t become a super genius billionaire running for president, I was more focused, my mind was clearer and my senses were more powerful.  </li>
            <li>Over time, there is a strong and significant resistance that builds up, but I&#x27;ve stuck with it.</li>
            <li>Having consumed the entire product, I can say that I&#x27;m happy to have tried the product and have reordered it.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a chemical that is available in many other places, so I&#x27;m happy that Liftmode has decided to provide it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I added it to my bag of productivity tricks, and will definitely order more for special occasions like programming marathons and clutter-organizing.</li>
            <li>it gave energy to deal with those, and mood had been significantly changed and gave</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it has helped me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change with my brain fog/dizziness/overall &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I think it can be compared to having a great nights sleep after a mental marathon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more convenient than pounding over a tablespoon of powder, and while the taste still isn&#x27;t pretty, it&#x27;s definitely worth the effect for me.</li>
            <li>phenylpiracetam is like the cherry on top that really gets me in the zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yesterday I took two full scoops and was spot on in all of my work</li>
            <li>It really helps me get through my school work faster with more zeal and focus</li>
            <li>It effectively washes away my brain fog feeling in the morning consistently, and leaves me able to concentrate without the constant slippage into a daydream state that I&#x27;ve always struggled with otherwise while working my desk</li>
            <li>Even colors are more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>quick</li>
            <li>My body was very used to this easy schedule.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, at the 2 scoop dose I experienced an allergic reaction - my throat and tongue swelled up a little bit, but</li>
            <li>in my coffee earlier today and life is just easy, decisions are very easy to make, plans are easy to envision, relationship comes naturally...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a few months now and have been really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It was difficult to find information on a good starting point for dosing and best way to administer, but am at a point where I&#x27;m finding the &amp;#34;fine tuning&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you LiftMode!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This didn&#x27;t seem to have a clear line of that &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; that just &amp;#34;normalizes&amp;#34; someone with my condition (not stoned and able to focus).  </li>
            <li>I really like this, because its great for a &#x27;mental&#x27; boost, even tho</li>
            <li>the price was DOUBLE, compared to the seller&#x27;s own website [@Dec, 2013].&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>This stuff perked me right up.</li>
            <li>Free sample of the product indicating that the vendor has high confidence in the products that they sell</li>
            <li>Though I say &#x27;subtle&#x27;, it&#x27;s most effective in the way I personally need it to be, and for me it&#x27;s almost as effective as a prescription stimulant I used to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will certainly use your products repeatedly!</li>
            <li>I bought the hordenine and Phenylethylamine along with this product ... and those are pure bull***t too... don&#x27;t fall for it!</li>
            <li>The first few days was probably the best, I felt very &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; and the subsequent days that followed although i had some mild headaches with it until I coupled it with some choline.</li>
            <li>I was able to maintain alertness in class after getting only 2-3 hours of sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>My first encounter with a nootropic</li>
            <li>The friend that I gave the product to was able to take this dose and larger ones, and did not have an allergic reaction, so there was no problem with the product itself.  </li>
            <li>The only notable difference was increased dream state cognitive function i.e. while dreaming brain still focused on studying.  </li>
            <li>I would invest in LiftMode, if they were open to investors; that is how confident I am in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mood seemed brighter and my thoughts were more fluid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not a fault of the company, but after trying many different dosages in many different settings (empty/full stomach, with/without choline, morning/afternoon)</li>
            <li>I had to do some research on exactly how to measure the recommended dose</li>
            <li>There is always the placebo effect to consider, but after using this for several days, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>All of a sudden I am able to work on my to do list and get stuff done.</li>
            <li>the last couple of days, I have been stacking with my perennial favorite racetam (Aniracetam) and am in the process of assessing the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ONLY 1/3 more, for TWICE the product?&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, this product provided a very noticeable and significant boost to my energy and more importantly to my mental alertness.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped quickly, received in a nice container and supplied with a COA and two small scoops.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the effect is more subtle than coffee, but MUCH more targeted to where I want it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Phenylpiracetam has high potential and I would need more time to fully flush out the effects of this racetam.</li>
            <li>With the 1 scoop dose of this product, however, my extremities stayed warm even after half an hour of walking in the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also taken, throughout the day, the CILTEP stack, Uridine stack, and large doses of Fish Oil/Zinc/Green Tea extract/multi, so I&#x27;m unsure if those could be interfering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price is fair and competitive, but it is unfortunate that the price per dose is quite high because the clean, mild stimulation from the product, in my experience, is unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy, fast acting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;With the price being so high and nothing coming from this (not even a placebo), I can&#x27;t rate this higher than 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of this stuff</li>
            <li>The taste is absolutely wretched and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a &amp;#34;Limitless&amp;#34; type of reaction immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really helped me stay alert.  </li>
            <li>I had to take an intense 2 week course that involved a lot of reading and writing papers....</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend Liftmode and their products.</li>
            <li>For me, this is really a revolutionary product.</li>
            <li>I have no reason to doubt that this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is an intense substance.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints and truly do see a real difference in concentration when I use this.</li>
            <li>4 stars instead of 5 because this didn&#x27;t really work for me the way I wanted, but it still worked well for a friend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really talked a lot</li>
            <li>you really do study, it will be very helful</li>
            <li>in the morning in preparation for an intense day of studying.</li>
            <li>i started reading on line about ANYTHING that could get me out of bed and ready to take care of business.</li>
            <li>so this is a very preliminary review.</li>
            <li>, I get very motivated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten Phenibut from LiftMode in the past, and the stuff is very potent.  </li>
            <li>Not so much stimulating as alertness promoting.</li>
            <li>I also experienced a moderate cold-tolerance effect at this dose; I have Reynaud&#x27;s and normally can&#x27;t warm my extremities very well on a cold day.  </li>
            <li>It was the same old story, falling asleep and not being able to focus much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The professional packaging is the first thing you will notice when ordering anything from LiftMode.  </li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve considered my memory slightly lower-than-average before taking this, and now I do seem to notice more retention--</li>
            <li>, it is an allosteric modulator of the AMPA subfamily of glutamate receptors, the brain&#x27;s main excitatory pathway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found a profound difference at first with my ADHD.  </li>
            <li>The effect has been significantly more profound than I expected--</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for those who struggle with focus and concentration.  </li>
            <li>I am not one of those that is chasing a high or euphoria.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this if you are into extreme sports of any kind as piracetam is shown to help with head trauma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dosing more than that and haven&#x27;t noticed anything but a slight headache, so I&#x27;ve pretty much just stuck to the once-a-day white scoop in the morning.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a little &amp;#34;more&amp;#34;, but figure I need to do some more tweaking on dosing etc.</li>
            <li>Clarity focus and stamina are provided by this amazing product , I highly recommend trying it at least once .</li>
            <li>It comes with tiny spoons which roughly estimate how many milligrams are in each spoonful, but that really doesn&#x27;t help if I don&#x27;t know what dosage to start out with, or</li>
            <li>This product has a subtle, yet effective effect.</li>
            <li>spent that night mostly thinking, and not actually studying.-_-&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as memory goes, the effect I&#x27;ve noticed is pretty subtle, but seems to be more pronounced the longer</li>
            <li>At this dose my friend reported that he was much more productive and organized than usual.  </li>
            <li>The product came exactly as it was described and the quality is second to none.  </li>
            <li>The first time I consumed this product, I only took one scoop (150mg) and did not see results at all.</li>
            <li>Take it from a lazy college student who has gotten much more organized and focused.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;vivid dreaming&#x27; aspect.</li>
            <li>This phenyl form of Piracetam seems to be a little more powerful than the previous stuff.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product very hesitantly since chemicals such as painkillers and nootropics usually do not work on me.</li>
            <li>I have only tried it a couple times so far, but I am really liking the product.</li>
            <li>It helps to clear my mind, get rid of the brain fog, and get me to focus.</li>
            <li>nothing crazy, but enough to make me feel like I only did on my best days before.</li>
            <li>really I can&#x27;t rave enough.</li>
            <li>A 5 gram jar lasts about a month for me, dosing once a day, nearly every day.</li>
            <li>So I got my classes in the early morning and made them four classes in a row.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To experiment, I slept early again on a school night, and I did not take the product the morning after.</li>
            <li>Was hopeful that I could get on something natural for my ADD.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only briefly used any other racetam type supplements &amp; this one is easily my favorite.</li>
            <li>ME, I can tell a HUGE difference when I only take the other nootropics</li>
            <li>I am currently looking at their other products that are available through Amazon and plan on making an order over the weekend after talking with my buddies at the gym.  </li>
            <li>I had to consume too much powder at once, which tasted extremely bitter, to get a useful dose, and it left me feeling more tired than anything else.</li>
            <li>It might not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s most certainly not your average snake oil supplement.</li>
            <li>However, one day I just decided that this semester, my classes would be in the early morning since I didn&#x27;t want it to be dark right after I got out of class every day.</li>
            <li>However, keep in mind drugs work differently on different people and the metabolic clearance/ bioavailability may be adversely impacted by this new chemical structure in some candidates.  </li>
            <li>The first time I took less than one full scoop and not much happened The second time I took a heaping scoop and still not a lot of effect.</li>
            <li>benefits are too numerous to list, but for me, this makes so much difference that I now consider this a permanent addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>only speculated how much to take based on variable answers in forums, but not from any legitimate medical journals etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the 1 scoop dose, I noticed a mild antidepressant effect for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Was not at all very clear on dosing but took a big amount</li>
            <li>been using for nearly two weeks now and definite notice of difference in focus and alertness.</li>
            <li>I read up on it&#x27;s method of action and was intrigued by how it works (similarly to piracetam</li>
            <li>Have used the product a total of 5 times so far.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it only felt like I was either not taking enough or too much when I tried to up the dose to alleviate the feeling of not taking enough.  </li>
            <li>The only thing to be aware is that it is very bitter.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, so you have to figure it out largely for yourself based on what you can glean other users have done.</li>
            <li>Also he reports that using capsules is superior to taking the product mixed into a drink - capsules caused him no trouble but drinking the solution tasted bad and caused a stomachache.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s normal because my team is made up of remote contractors all over the world, so my sleeping habits are always irregular.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try a few other options on your website.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the club sandwich generation, husband with memory problems, mother with memory problems and single adult son with incapacitating (but temporary) motorcycle-accident injuries.</li>
            <li>The third time I took a scoop and a half and felt very alert and focused.</li>

            <li> all the reviews mention about LIFTMODE being good legit company...</li>
            <li> This stuff works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> (if you want a feel good &amp;#34;chill pill&amp;#34; try Aniracetam! :-) )</li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> stick to the proven stuff unless you can get a nice placebo effect yourself.</li>
            <li> gave this three stars since it may not be a problem with the product, just my own chemistry may not mingle.  </li>
            <li> kind of &#x27;deal&#x27; is that?&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the seller LiftMode is very easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to get a more descriptive lab certificate instead of just an ambiguous graph with the product.  </li>
            <li> The scoop delivered seems to provide me with very accurate dosages as well.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It also makes me more sociable and outgoing.</li>
            <li> I feel as though I&#x27;m tapping into a greater percentage of my brain.</li>
            <li> I have bought from LiftMode before and was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> the phenylpiracetam alone, I did experience more focus, but again, did not reach &amp;#34;zen,&amp;#34; as I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Painless from start to finish - I just love to shop with Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I feel more energetic, I have tons more focus, I&#x27;m happier, .....</li>
            <li> Make sure you get some form of choline to help out the brain functions, it works better that way.  </li>
            <li> As with anything, some people may have better results than others.</li>
            <li> felt mostly mood change with this.</li>
            <li> it gives more brain power.</li>
            <li> am impressed with Liftmode customer service and would give them six stars out of five for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> they sure can seem like it!]&lt;br /&gt;However, DO NOT buy itâ€”</li>
            <li> Words form more easily.</li>
            <li> Felt comfortable placing this order with them and to find this awesome product at such a great price, with super fast shipping -</li>
            <li> Having used piracetam I can honestly say that this stuff has been far more effective.</li>
            <li> My body grew a tolerance to it very quickly but if it is taken infrequently (3 times a week)</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my body takes to this supplement easily.</li>
            <li> go easy</li>
            <li> the focus wasn&#x27;t always where I would have liked but overall a good experience.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with my Amazon Prime shipping and it was fulfilled by Amazon so that criteria doesn&#x27;t really apply here, although I was happy to get it right on time.</li>
            <li> Really, the effect is a lot more impressive than I would&#x27;ve anticipated, and I&#x27;d like to purchase this stuff in bulk for the future.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such an awesome product at a reasonable price point!</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t become a super genius billionaire running for president, I was more focused, my mind was clearer and my senses were more powerful.  </li>
            <li> Over time, there is a strong and significant resistance that builds up, but I&#x27;ve stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Having consumed the entire product, I can say that I&#x27;m happy to have tried the product and have reordered it.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a chemical that is available in many other places, so I&#x27;m happy that Liftmode has decided to provide it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I added it to my bag of productivity tricks, and will definitely order more for special occasions like programming marathons and clutter-organizing.</li>
            <li> it gave energy to deal with those, and mood had been significantly changed and gave</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it has helped me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change with my brain fog/dizziness/overall &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think it can be compared to having a great nights sleep after a mental marathon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more convenient than pounding over a tablespoon of powder, and while the taste still isn&#x27;t pretty, it&#x27;s definitely worth the effect for me.</li>
            <li> phenylpiracetam is like the cherry on top that really gets me in the zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yesterday I took two full scoops and was spot on in all of my work</li>
            <li> It really helps me get through my school work faster with more zeal and focus</li>
            <li> It effectively washes away my brain fog feeling in the morning consistently, and leaves me able to concentrate without the constant slippage into a daydream state that I&#x27;ve always struggled with otherwise while working my desk</li>
            <li> Even colors are more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> quick</li>
            <li> My body was very used to this easy schedule.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, at the 2 scoop dose I experienced an allergic reaction - my throat and tongue swelled up a little bit, but</li>
            <li> in my coffee earlier today and life is just easy, decisions are very easy to make, plans are easy to envision, relationship comes naturally...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a few months now and have been really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find information on a good starting point for dosing and best way to administer, but am at a point where I&#x27;m finding the &amp;#34;fine tuning&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you LiftMode!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This didn&#x27;t seem to have a clear line of that &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; that just &amp;#34;normalizes&amp;#34; someone with my condition (not stoned and able to focus).  </li>
            <li> I really like this, because its great for a &#x27;mental&#x27; boost, even tho</li>
            <li> the price was DOUBLE, compared to the seller&#x27;s own website [@Dec, 2013].&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> This stuff perked me right up.</li>
            <li> Free sample of the product indicating that the vendor has high confidence in the products that they sell</li>
            <li> Though I say &#x27;subtle&#x27;, it&#x27;s most effective in the way I personally need it to be, and for me it&#x27;s almost as effective as a prescription stimulant I used to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will certainly use your products repeatedly!</li>
            <li> I bought the hordenine and Phenylethylamine along with this product ... and those are pure bull***t too... don&#x27;t fall for it!</li>
            <li> The first few days was probably the best, I felt very &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; and the subsequent days that followed although i had some mild headaches with it until I coupled it with some choline.</li>
            <li> I was able to maintain alertness in class after getting only 2-3 hours of sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> My first encounter with a nootropic</li>
            <li> The friend that I gave the product to was able to take this dose and larger ones, and did not have an allergic reaction, so there was no problem with the product itself.  </li>
            <li> The only notable difference was increased dream state cognitive function i.e. while dreaming brain still focused on studying.  </li>
            <li> I would invest in LiftMode, if they were open to investors; that is how confident I am in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mood seemed brighter and my thoughts were more fluid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not a fault of the company, but after trying many different dosages in many different settings (empty/full stomach, with/without choline, morning/afternoon)</li>
            <li> I had to do some research on exactly how to measure the recommended dose</li>
            <li> There is always the placebo effect to consider, but after using this for several days, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden I am able to work on my to do list and get stuff done.</li>
            <li> the last couple of days, I have been stacking with my perennial favorite racetam (Aniracetam) and am in the process of assessing the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ONLY 1/3 more, for TWICE the product?&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, this product provided a very noticeable and significant boost to my energy and more importantly to my mental alertness.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped quickly, received in a nice container and supplied with a COA and two small scoops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the effect is more subtle than coffee, but MUCH more targeted to where I want it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Phenylpiracetam has high potential and I would need more time to fully flush out the effects of this racetam.</li>
            <li> With the 1 scoop dose of this product, however, my extremities stayed warm even after half an hour of walking in the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also taken, throughout the day, the CILTEP stack, Uridine stack, and large doses of Fish Oil/Zinc/Green Tea extract/multi, so I&#x27;m unsure if those could be interfering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price is fair and competitive, but it is unfortunate that the price per dose is quite high because the clean, mild stimulation from the product, in my experience, is unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy, fast acting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;With the price being so high and nothing coming from this (not even a placebo), I can&#x27;t rate this higher than 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of this stuff</li>
            <li> The taste is absolutely wretched and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a &amp;#34;Limitless&amp;#34; type of reaction immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really helped me stay alert.  </li>
            <li> I had to take an intense 2 week course that involved a lot of reading and writing papers....</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend Liftmode and their products.</li>
            <li> For me, this is really a revolutionary product.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to doubt that this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is an intense substance.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints and truly do see a real difference in concentration when I use this.</li>
            <li> 4 stars instead of 5 because this didn&#x27;t really work for me the way I wanted, but it still worked well for a friend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really talked a lot</li>
            <li> you really do study, it will be very helful</li>
            <li> in the morning in preparation for an intense day of studying.</li>
            <li> i started reading on line about ANYTHING that could get me out of bed and ready to take care of business.</li>
            <li> so this is a very preliminary review.</li>
            <li> , I get very motivated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten Phenibut from LiftMode in the past, and the stuff is very potent.  </li>
            <li> Not so much stimulating as alertness promoting.</li>
            <li> I also experienced a moderate cold-tolerance effect at this dose; I have Reynaud&#x27;s and normally can&#x27;t warm my extremities very well on a cold day.  </li>
            <li> It was the same old story, falling asleep and not being able to focus much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The professional packaging is the first thing you will notice when ordering anything from LiftMode.  </li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve considered my memory slightly lower-than-average before taking this, and now I do seem to notice more retention--</li>
            <li> , it is an allosteric modulator of the AMPA subfamily of glutamate receptors, the brain&#x27;s main excitatory pathway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found a profound difference at first with my ADHD.  </li>
            <li> The effect has been significantly more profound than I expected--</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for those who struggle with focus and concentration.  </li>
            <li> I am not one of those that is chasing a high or euphoria.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this if you are into extreme sports of any kind as piracetam is shown to help with head trauma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dosing more than that and haven&#x27;t noticed anything but a slight headache, so I&#x27;ve pretty much just stuck to the once-a-day white scoop in the morning.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a little &amp;#34;more&amp;#34;, but figure I need to do some more tweaking on dosing etc.</li>
            <li> Clarity focus and stamina are provided by this amazing product , I highly recommend trying it at least once .</li>
            <li> It comes with tiny spoons which roughly estimate how many milligrams are in each spoonful, but that really doesn&#x27;t help if I don&#x27;t know what dosage to start out with, or</li>
            <li> This product has a subtle, yet effective effect.</li>
            <li> spent that night mostly thinking, and not actually studying.-_-&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as memory goes, the effect I&#x27;ve noticed is pretty subtle, but seems to be more pronounced the longer</li>
            <li> At this dose my friend reported that he was much more productive and organized than usual.  </li>
            <li> The product came exactly as it was described and the quality is second to none.  </li>
            <li> The first time I consumed this product, I only took one scoop (150mg) and did not see results at all.</li>
            <li> Take it from a lazy college student who has gotten much more organized and focused.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;vivid dreaming&#x27; aspect.</li>
            <li> This phenyl form of Piracetam seems to be a little more powerful than the previous stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product very hesitantly since chemicals such as painkillers and nootropics usually do not work on me.</li>
            <li> I have only tried it a couple times so far, but I am really liking the product.</li>
            <li> It helps to clear my mind, get rid of the brain fog, and get me to focus.</li>
            <li> nothing crazy, but enough to make me feel like I only did on my best days before.</li>
            <li> really I can&#x27;t rave enough.</li>
            <li> A 5 gram jar lasts about a month for me, dosing once a day, nearly every day.</li>
            <li> So I got my classes in the early morning and made them four classes in a row.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To experiment, I slept early again on a school night, and I did not take the product the morning after.</li>
            <li> Was hopeful that I could get on something natural for my ADD.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only briefly used any other racetam type supplements &amp; this one is easily my favorite.</li>
            <li> ME, I can tell a HUGE difference when I only take the other nootropics</li>
            <li> I am currently looking at their other products that are available through Amazon and plan on making an order over the weekend after talking with my buddies at the gym.  </li>
            <li> I had to consume too much powder at once, which tasted extremely bitter, to get a useful dose, and it left me feeling more tired than anything else.</li>
            <li> It might not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s most certainly not your average snake oil supplement.</li>
            <li> However, one day I just decided that this semester, my classes would be in the early morning since I didn&#x27;t want it to be dark right after I got out of class every day.</li>
            <li> However, keep in mind drugs work differently on different people and the metabolic clearance/ bioavailability may be adversely impacted by this new chemical structure in some candidates.  </li>
            <li> The first time I took less than one full scoop and not much happened The second time I took a heaping scoop and still not a lot of effect.</li>
            <li> benefits are too numerous to list, but for me, this makes so much difference that I now consider this a permanent addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> only speculated how much to take based on variable answers in forums, but not from any legitimate medical journals etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the 1 scoop dose, I noticed a mild antidepressant effect for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Was not at all very clear on dosing but took a big amount</li>
            <li> been using for nearly two weeks now and definite notice of difference in focus and alertness.</li>
            <li> I read up on it&#x27;s method of action and was intrigued by how it works (similarly to piracetam</li>
            <li> Have used the product a total of 5 times so far.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it only felt like I was either not taking enough or too much when I tried to up the dose to alleviate the feeling of not taking enough.  </li>
            <li> The only thing to be aware is that it is very bitter.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, so you have to figure it out largely for yourself based on what you can glean other users have done.</li>
            <li> Also he reports that using capsules is superior to taking the product mixed into a drink - capsules caused him no trouble but drinking the solution tasted bad and caused a stomachache.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s normal because my team is made up of remote contractors all over the world, so my sleeping habits are always irregular.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try a few other options on your website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the club sandwich generation, husband with memory problems, mother with memory problems and single adult son with incapacitating (but temporary) motorcycle-accident injuries.</li>
            <li> The third time I took a scoop and a half and felt very alert and focused.</li>
            <li> Really gives me an energy boost and helps me to focus even when slightly sleep-deprived!  </li>
            <li> I noticed that 100mg is too high for me since it causes a slight pressure at the temples, and increased anger/aggression (and minor anxiety issues) possibly indicating an elevation of blood pressure.&lt;br /&gt;However, at 50 mg, I am observing the following:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve notice less effect, perhaps I&#x27;ve developed a tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To preface this review, I will note that I&#x27;ve tried piracetam in the past, and didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> And, I typically err on the side of &amp;#34;skeptic&amp;#34; so I was pleasantly surprised by my findings.  </li>
            <li> this stuff gets my brain talking to itself and everything goes from unimaginably difficult to just easy...</li>
            <li> Once the initial boost wears off, after several weeks, I find it helps balance my mood, my energy, and my mental alertness.</li>
            <li> you hardly see people appraising the brand of real reviews ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice vastly improved cognition and mental clarity.</li>
            <li> However, after I started taking this product, although the sleepiness would not completely go away (I still yawn a lot)</li>
            <li> Not even a minor increase in memory retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What is also worth mentioning is I have not experienced any adverse side effects, no jittery feeling and no crash.</li>
            <li> However, I just don&#x27;t seem to respond to phenylpriacetam as well as I do to other racetams, such as oxiracetam.</li>
            <li> While regular piracetam may work due to the loading phase or duration of consumption, I did not experience any benefit taking this nootropic agent.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation is to be very careful with the dosage, because based on my limited experience dosages of 100mg or higher could cause negative side effects like impatience, anger/rage and aggression.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about a year, I started reading about the -racetam family of chemicals again and was intrigued by phenylpiracetam because of the much smaller active dose and claims of noticeable energy.</li>
            <li> Since I was skeptical of the product, I attributed this to my new habit of sleeping early.</li>
            <li> One needs to have a solid base of mental health before anything, ie adequate sleep, low stress, proper nutrition.</li>
            <li> I was feeling a little sluggish, mentally and physically.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, mine came with a spectrograph showing a single peak - but what it is measuring is unclear.  </li>
            <li> but it made me feel mentally awake and focused.  </li>
            <li> and I now can reliably perform without mental fatigue without having to rely on cycling stimulants and coffee just to stay &#x27;with it&#x27;.</li>
            <li> i feel mentally sharper and motivated to get work done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously I tried other nootropics, Focus Formula &amp; Procera, but neither produced the desired effect I was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;How can you tell if you&#x27;re stacking it with all those other nootropics, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any tolerance, but I still like to take breaks over the weekend, partially due to the price.</li>
            <li> It also gives me hope for some other -racetams now, specifically aniracetam.</li>
            <li> In addition, no focus enhancement or other cognitive functions were noted.  </li>
            <li> I waited two days after that since the reviews I have read on other websites say that the body immediately builds immunity to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken it by itself and with other supplements (like Fish Oil).  </li>
            <li> I will continue purchasing other Nootropics from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking into the effects of piracetam/phenylpiracetam and other nootropics on the brain.  </li>
            <li> Very bitter under the tongue, also I prefer that to drinking it.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the taste.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to explore other products and their benefits as well!</li>
            <li> I suggest using this every other day, as opposed to everyday.</li>
            <li> less irritability than coffee gives me.</li>
            <li> 8oz water post-choline gave slight dream enhancement, but no study time enhancement noted.  </li>
            <li> took a large dose broken up twice per day, and I&#x27;ve taken small doses broken up several times per day.  </li>
            <li> Powder was a little chunky.</li>
            <li> so I have not been taking it everyday.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Have recommended it to a few friends already.</li>
            <li> there is a very slight &#x27;stimulant&#x27; property, if you can even call it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I imagine anti-depressants to be, without any negative side effects other than I have to be careful not to take it too late in the day, otherwise it will make it hard to get to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to be such a multi-tasker but this product makes it a breeze to the point</li>
            <li> -- small amount does the trick.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually the product itself...</li>
            <li> Tastes awful, but seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li> For people who think this product only works because of a placebo effect, you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> and then some (the small amount that I spilled on my desk).&lt;br /&gt;Now, to explain how this product worked for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student who has had his mere three classes in the afternoon for the last 4 months.</li>
            <li> I just want focus and treatment of a real medical condition and unfortunately for me the answer is meds.</li>
            <li> I take one small scoop of the phenylpiracetam</li>
            <li> Believe me it is VERY uncomfortable to go overboard with any stimulant natural or pharmaceutical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not experienced any noticeable negative side effects, other than my sleeping habits being off.</li>
            <li> The drug claims to be 3x piracetam; however, I find these claims hard to swallow.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking the dose at about 7 am and by late afternoon /early</li>
            <li> I combine this with L-Theanine in the morning, and the sense of clarity is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> nothing serious.  </li>
            <li> Succinctly, I wouldnâ€™t recommend this product for serious studying or recreational use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this product works in a subtle fashion, I can guarantee that it works.</li>
            <li> have ADHD, and do however, receive subtle effects from</li>
            <li> It tastes really bad even when I mixed it with gatorade powder.  </li>
            <li> so initially I felt a bit disappointed upon seeing the size of the jar until I tried it.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it was crap.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, it&#x27;s been a game changer.</li>
            <li> It included a report to certify the purity of the product, a 0.15CC scoop, and a card explaining the approximate amount of the scoop in milligrams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worse, the company sent me a &amp;#34;discount coupon&amp;#34; for liftmode.com, that</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost scary.</li>
            <li> this product is fake..</li>
            <li> I just was unable to notice anything at all.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Having consumed the entire product, I can say that I&#x27;m happy to have tried the product and have reordered it.  I was inspired by the movie Limitless to try some nootropics.  Although I didn&#x27;t become a super genius billionaire running for president, I was more focused, my mind was clearer and my senses were more powerful.  Even colors are more vibrant.  I think it can be compared to having a great nights sleep after a mental marathon. Everything is just \\&quot;On\\&quot;.  I really liked it but it is a supplement.  One needs to have a solid base of mental health before anything, ie adequate sleep, low stress, proper nutrition.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. Having tried piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, and \\&quot;noopept,\\&quot; I can say that this one outstrips the others: It is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to take the dose higher--2 to 3 of the white scoops--but I am also 250 lbs. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice vastly improved cognition and mental clarity. It also makes me more sociable and outgoing. Words form more easily. My concentration improves. I don&#x27;t get the visual or auditory acuity as some others have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also suppresses my appetite, which is a welcome side benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a few months now and have been really happy with the results. This product has a subtle, yet effective effect. I feel as though I&#x27;m tapping into a greater percentage of my brain. I highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Clarity focus and stamina are provided by this amazing product , I highly recommend trying it at least once .</li>
            <li> I have bought from LiftMode before and was satisfied with my purchase. As before, this purchase came with what I believe to be legitimate lab data for the batch, as well as a appropriately-sized scoop. However, I just don&#x27;t seem to respond to phenylpriacetam as well as I do to other racetams, such as oxiracetam. Therefore, I&#x27;m giving 5 stars to the company, 3 stars to the product itself.</li>
            <li> I loved the COA that came with the jar. The product itself works great on those days when I need a boost and coffee just won&#x27;t cut it!</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it was crap.  The taste is absolutely wretched and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a &amp;#34;Limitless&amp;#34; type of reaction immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I tried other nootropics, Focus Formula &amp; Procera, but neither produced the desired effect I was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the phenylpiracetam alone, I did experience more focus, but again, did not reach &amp;#34;zen,&amp;#34; as I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I stacked Focus Formula and Procera, with Profiderall and phenylpiracetam it worked AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can you tell if you&#x27;re stacking it with all those other nootropics, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST ME, I can tell a HUGE difference when I only take the other nootropics but without the phenylpiracetam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phenylpiracetam is like the cherry on top that really gets me in the zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any noticeable negative side effects, other than my sleeping habits being off. But that&#x27;s normal because my team is made up of remote contractors all over the world, so my sleeping habits are always irregular.</li>
            <li> Was really happy to receive the product so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for nearly two weeks now and definite notice of difference in focus and alertness. Was hoping for a little &amp;#34;more&amp;#34;, but figure I need to do some more tweaking on dosing etc. It was difficult to find information on a good starting point for dosing and best way to administer, but am at a point where I&#x27;m finding the &amp;#34;fine tuning&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you LiftMode! I will certainly use your products repeatedly! I&#x27;m excited to try a few other options on your website.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all.. Did not like the way it made me feel would cause headaches, Then again everyone is different.</li>
            <li> This product was excellent!  I didn&#x27;t feel like I was on a stimulant at all but it made me feel mentally awake and focused.  There are no jitters and when taken with 500 mg of choline there was no brain fog or headache (I never took without choline).  My body grew a tolerance to it very quickly but if it is taken infrequently (3 times a week) it still has great effects.  I plan on trying more products from liftmode as they had excellent service and answered any questions that I had.</li>
            <li> This product really helped me stay alert.  I had to take an intense 2 week course that involved a lot of reading and writing papers....something I haven&#x27;t had to do in over 20 years.  I was able to maintain alertness in class after getting only 2-3 hours of sleep at night.  I started out with 50 mg and increased to 100-150mg.  There were no jittery side effects or mood swings.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the taste.  I paired this with choline as recommended by others.  I don&#x27;t think it made me smarter and the focus wasn&#x27;t always where I would have liked but overall a good experience.</li>
            <li> Painless from start to finish - I just love to shop with Amazon.com.  Felt comfortable placing this order with them and to find this awesome product at such a great price, with super fast shipping - I look forward to replenishing my stock with their products.  I would absolutely recommend Liftmode and their products.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped quickly, received in a nice container and supplied with a COA and two small scoops. This isn&#x27;t a chemical that is available in many other places, so I&#x27;m happy that Liftmode has decided to provide it on Amazon. The price is fair and competitive, but it is unfortunate that the price per dose is quite high because the clean, mild stimulation from the product, in my experience, is unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I added it to my bag of productivity tricks, and will definitely order more for special occasions like programming marathons and clutter-organizing.</li>
            <li> To preface this review, I will note that I&#x27;ve tried piracetam in the past, and didn&#x27;t really like it. I had to consume too much powder at once, which tasted extremely bitter, to get a useful dose, and it left me feeling more tired than anything else. After about a year, I started reading about the -racetam family of chemicals again and was intrigued by phenylpiracetam because of the much smaller active dose and claims of noticeable energy. I read up on it&#x27;s method of action and was intrigued by how it works (similarly to piracetam, it is an allosteric modulator of the AMPA subfamily of glutamate receptors, the brain&#x27;s main excitatory pathway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to pull the trigger and give a racetam another shot. The product was well-packaged, came with a certificate of analysis, and two dosing spoons. I&#x27;ve been taking about a level white (larger) scoop once a day in the morning. The effect has been significantly more profound than I expected-- there is a very slight &#x27;stimulant&#x27; property, if you can even call it that, but with no physical effect. It effectively washes away my brain fog feeling in the morning consistently, and leaves me able to concentrate without the constant slippage into a daydream state that I&#x27;ve always struggled with otherwise while working my desk job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more convenient than pounding over a tablespoon of powder, and while the taste still isn&#x27;t pretty, it&#x27;s definitely worth the effect for me. I&#x27;ve tried dosing more than that and haven&#x27;t noticed anything but a slight headache, so I&#x27;ve pretty much just stuck to the once-a-day white scoop in the morning. I haven&#x27;t noticed any tolerance, but I still like to take breaks over the weekend, partially due to the price. But overall, I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of this stuff and I now can reliably perform without mental fatigue without having to rely on cycling stimulants and coffee just to stay &#x27;with it&#x27;. I&#x27;d say the effect is more subtle than coffee, but MUCH more targeted to where I want it. There are no jitters, and less irritability than coffee gives me. Though I say &#x27;subtle&#x27;, it&#x27;s most effective in the way I personally need it to be, and for me it&#x27;s almost as effective as a prescription stimulant I used to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as memory goes, the effect I&#x27;ve noticed is pretty subtle, but seems to be more pronounced the longer I take it. I would&#x27;ve considered my memory slightly lower-than-average before taking this, and now I do seem to notice more retention-- nothing crazy, but enough to make me feel like I only did on my best days before. Really, the effect is a lot more impressive than I would&#x27;ve anticipated, and I&#x27;d like to purchase this stuff in bulk for the future. It also gives me hope for some other -racetams now, specifically aniracetam.</li>
            <li> I have only tried it a couple times so far, but I am really liking the product. It helps to clear my mind, get rid of the brain fog, and get me to focus. I have read where you can build a tolerance quick so I have not been taking it everyday. The only thing to be aware is that it is very bitter. I do not know if I am supposed to do this or not, but I end up putting it in V8 to help mute some of the taste.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee that this will work or provide benefits for everybody, but for me, I now consider phenylpiracetam to be a daily supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, this product provided a very noticeable and significant boost to my energy and more importantly to my mental alertness. Over time, there is a strong and significant resistance that builds up, but I&#x27;ve stuck with it. Now, I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;rush&amp;#34; so to speak, but after several months of regular, almost daily use, I have to say, I truly appreciate the difference that phenylpiracetam makes for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits are too numerous to list, but for me, this makes so much difference that I now consider this a permanent addition to my daily routine. Once the initial boost wears off, after several weeks, I find it helps balance my mood, my energy, and my mental alertness. I feel more energetic, I have tons more focus, I&#x27;m happier, ..... really I can&#x27;t rave enough. This is life changing. It&#x27;s what I imagine anti-depressants to be, without any negative side effects other than I have to be careful not to take it too late in the day, otherwise it will make it hard to get to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part? I don&#x27;t find it to be in any way addictive. If I skip a day or a week, no biggie. For me, this is really a revolutionary product. It might not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s most certainly not your average snake oil supplement. In my experience, it&#x27;s been a game changer.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to doubt that this is the real deal. My first encounter with a nootropic so I am learning as I use the product how I react to it and how to use it. Everyone is different, so you have to figure it out largely for yourself based on what you can glean other users have done. Start with lower doses though, I recommend. This is an intense substance. Fast shipping. Good communication/followup. Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> I was feeling a little sluggish, mentally and physically. This stuff perked me right up. i feel mentally sharper and motivated to get work done. What is also worth mentioning is I have not experienced any adverse side effects, no jittery feeling and no crash. Liftmode has a great product here. Great job.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks now.  Very impressed and comforted by the scientific background.  Will continue to explore other products and their benefits as well!</li>
            <li> It works the way others have described.  Make sure you get some form of choline to help out the brain functions, it works better that way.  Also it mixes in great with a pre-workout drink and gets you focused real good.</li>
            <li> Really gives me an energy boost and helps me to focus even when slightly sleep-deprived!  The scoop delivered seems to provide me with very accurate dosages as well.  The only negative is the taste.  Very bitter under the tongue, also I prefer that to drinking it.  It tastes really bad even when I mixed it with gatorade powder.  Definitely not a deal-breaker, though :D.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product for the second time now. I don&#x27;t have any complaints and truly do see a real difference in concentration when I use this. Trust me when I say that I stay on the go ALLOT! It&#x27;s difficult to be such a multi-tasker but this product makes it a breeze to the point it&#x27;s almost scary. As with anything, some people may have better results than others. Thankfully, my body takes to this supplement easily.</li>
            <li> As an author, MFA student and mom, I realized I needed a kick in the butt to get going in the morning. I&#x27;m taking two tiny scoopfuls in mid-morning. Not only does it help with focus, I&#x27;ve noticed increased intensity during my daily fitness routines. A 5 gram jar lasts about a month for me, dosing once a day, nearly every day. Plus, I&#x27;ve noticed no undesirable side effects. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> easy, fast acting.  not jittery like with a lot of coffee.  go easy -- small amount does the trick.  solid energy for 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this twice a day (in tandem with 250 mg Citicholine, also twice a day) for almost 2 months now.  I found a profound difference at first with my ADHD.  I call it &amp;#34;Adderall Lite&amp;#34;.  Recently, I&#x27;ve notice less effect, perhaps I&#x27;ve developed a tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm with this medication is that there are no instructions on recommended dosages to take.  It comes with tiny spoons which roughly estimate how many milligrams are in each spoonful, but that really doesn&#x27;t help if I don&#x27;t know what dosage to start out with, or what the max daily dose is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only speculated how much to take based on variable answers in forums, but not from any legitimate medical journals etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like everyone has a different reaction with the med, so take this review with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> 4 stars instead of 5 because this didn&#x27;t really work for me the way I wanted, but it still worked well for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived promptly and was well-packaged.  It included a report to certify the purity of the product, a 0.15CC scoop, and a card explaining the approximate amount of the scoop in milligrams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the card, the scoop provides about 50-90mg of this product.  I put 1 level scoop each into capsules and took 1 per dose, as well as giving them to a friend.  At the 1 scoop dose, I noticed a mild antidepressant effect for a few hours.  I also experienced a moderate cold-tolerance effect at this dose; I have Reynaud&#x27;s and normally can&#x27;t warm my extremities very well on a cold day.  With the 1 scoop dose of this product, however, my extremities stayed warm even after half an hour of walking in the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, at the 2 scoop dose I experienced an allergic reaction - my throat and tongue swelled up a little bit, but nothing serious.  The friend that I gave the product to was able to take this dose and larger ones, and did not have an allergic reaction, so there was no problem with the product itself.  At this dose my friend reported that he was much more productive and organized than usual.  Also he reports that using capsules is superior to taking the product mixed into a drink - capsules caused him no trouble but drinking the solution tasted bad and caused a stomachache.</li>
            <li> I found this product very effective!  And, I typically err on the side of &amp;#34;skeptic&amp;#34; so I was pleasantly surprised by my findings.  I highly recommend this for those who struggle with focus and concentration.  Great job, LiftMode!!</li>
            <li> This is excellent for immediately clearing brain fog, but it&#x27;s easy to build a tolerance. I suggest using this every other day, as opposed to everyday.</li>
            <li> This phenyl form of Piracetam seems to be a little more powerful than the previous stuff. If you are male your brain hemispheres quit cooperating at puberty. If you develop your personality as a child to use both hemispheres [intuitive-thinking or sensing-feeling] you lose a lot at puberty. I was devastated as a teenager, I lost everything I gained before that... this stuff gets my brain talking to itself and everything goes from unimaginably difficult to just easy... I put 50mg. in my coffee earlier today and life is just easy, decisions are very easy to make, plans are easy to envision, relationship comes naturally...</li>
            <li> Have used the product a total of 5 times so far.  I combine this with L-Theanine in the morning, and the sense of clarity is unbelievable!  Will be buying future products from LiftMode.  Thank you for making such an awesome product at a reasonable price point!</li>
            <li> I had been using it for 3 weeks (2 scoops a day before studying), and didn&#x27;t notice effects at all. Effects like people wrote on this review. one day, I used 2 scoop at noon and 2 scoops around 4~5, and I felt something.&lt;br /&gt;I felt mostly mood change with this. I really talked a lot better.&lt;br /&gt; I broke up with girl friend, and having final at the same time. I was depressed and powerless(?)&lt;br /&gt;but it gave energy to deal with those, and mood had been significantly changed and gave confidence.&lt;br /&gt;also it gives more brain power. I guess it made me a philosopher.&lt;br /&gt;I spent that night mostly thinking, and not actually studying.-_-&lt;br /&gt;if you really do study, it will be very helful</li>
            <li> No therapeutic value experienced from taking this product with or without choline.  While regular piracetam may work due to the loading phase or duration of consumption, I did not experience any benefit taking this nootropic agent.  The only notable difference was increased dream state cognitive function i.e. while dreaming brain still focused on studying.  In addition, no focus enhancement or other cognitive functions were noted.  Rx: two white scopes with 8oz water gave no results.  Rx: two white scopes with 8oz water post-choline gave slight dream enhancement, but no study time enhancement noted.  The drug claims to be 3x piracetam; however, I find these claims hard to swallow.  However, keep in mind drugs work differently on different people and the metabolic clearance/ bioavailability may be adversely impacted by this new chemical structure in some candidates.  Succinctly, I wouldnâ€™t recommend this product for serious studying or recreational use.</li>
            <li> Was not at all very clear on dosing but took a big amount and I have to say it  woke my brain up. The level of alertness is very good.</li>
            <li> You know I bought this after reading all the reviews here... Let me tell you the truth... this product is fake.. it&#x27;s not what it claims to be... if you notice... all the reviews mention about LIFTMODE being good legit company... you hardly see people appraising the brand of real reviews .. it&#x27;s usually the product itself... I bought the hordenine and Phenylethylamine along with this product ... and those are pure bull***t too... don&#x27;t fall for it!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, mine came with a spectrograph showing a single peak - but what it is measuring is unclear.  It would be nice to get a more descriptive lab certificate instead of just an ambiguous graph with the product.  Powder appears uniform and crystalline.  Tastes awful, but seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li> This product has delivered on every occasion and my investment has paid off. I use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;phenylpiracetam in the morning in preparation for an intense day of studying. The nootrope enhances my ability to consolidate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;vast amounts of information, and it also improves accessibility and recall of stored&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;information. In addition to these cognitive benefits, I&#x27;ve noticed enhanced visual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;acuity that has sometimes even progressed to visual distortions. Colors are vivid,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and nature trail walks or just being outside in nature is thoroughly refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product has enhanced my productivity and I have intentions of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any different after taking this for 30 days or so.. It might work for you tho&#x27;. Powder was a little chunky.</li>
            <li> The professional packaging is the first thing you will notice when ordering anything from LiftMode.  The product came exactly as it was described and the quality is second to none.  I am currently looking at their other products that are available through Amazon and plan on making an order over the weekend after talking with my buddies at the gym.  I would invest in LiftMode, if they were open to investors; that is how confident I am in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging adn Marketing are flawless.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with my Amazon Prime shipping and it was fulfilled by Amazon so that criteria doesn&#x27;t really apply here, although I was happy to get it right on time. For people who think this product only works because of a placebo effect, you&#x27;re wrong. I ordered this product very hesitantly since chemicals such as painkillers and nootropics usually do not work on me. The first time I consumed this product, I only took one scoop (150mg) and did not see results at all. I waited two days after that since the reviews I have read on other websites say that the body immediately builds immunity to it. Then two days later, I took two scoops and then some (the small amount that I spilled on my desk).&lt;br /&gt;Now, to explain how this product worked for me, I need to give you some background information. I&#x27;m a college student who has had his mere three classes in the afternoon for the last 4 months. My body was very used to this easy schedule. However, one day I just decided that this semester, my classes would be in the early morning since I didn&#x27;t want it to be dark right after I got out of class every day. It would always ruin my day. So I got my classes in the early morning and made them four classes in a row.&lt;br /&gt;I went to these classes and I fell asleep in some, couldn&#x27;t focus in the rest. However, after I started taking this product, although the sleepiness would not completely go away (I still yawn a lot) I would not fall asleep during class, and I wouldn&#x27;t miss a word that the teacher spoke. Since I was skeptical of the product, I attributed this to my new habit of sleeping early. To experiment, I slept early again on a school night, and I did not take the product the morning after. It was the same old story, falling asleep and not being able to focus much.&lt;br /&gt;Although this product works in a subtle fashion, I can guarantee that it works. Take it from a lazy college student who has gotten much more organized and focused.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  I could tell the difference immediately.  My mood seemed brighter and my thoughts were more fluid.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not a fault of the company, but after trying many different dosages in many different settings (empty/full stomach, with/without choline, morning/afternoon) I just was unable to notice anything at all. Not even a minor increase in memory retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the price being so high and nothing coming from this (not even a placebo), I can&#x27;t rate this higher than 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Just stick to the proven stuff unless you can get a nice placebo effect yourself.</li>
            <li> I have used this product four times now. The first time I took less than one full scoop and not much happened The second time I took a heaping scoop and still not a lot of effect. The third time I took a scoop and a half and felt very alert and focused. Yesterday I took two full scoops and was spot on in all of my work I did that day. I have been taking the dose at about 7 am and by late afternoon /early evening I am feeling like relaxing. No problems falling asleep or staying asleep. I am going to continue using when I need to be focused at work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the club sandwich generation, husband with memory problems, mother with memory problems and single adult son with incapacitating (but temporary) motorcycle-accident injuries. Depression and inability to overcome inertia are the issues i&#x27;m dealing with and out of desperation i started reading on line about ANYTHING that could get me out of bed and ready to take care of business. Phenylpiracetam seems to be the non-prescription chemical which works. I ordered it and it was delivered as promised. I had to do some research on exactly how to measure the recommended dose but I&#x27;m pretty sure it has helped me. There is always the placebo effect to consider, but after using this for several days, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I started using this product last week so this is a very preliminary review. I hope to post an updated review after I finish the container. So the comments on Phenypiracetam below are initial observations which may evolve/change  with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIFTMODE CUSTOMER SERVICE:&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with Liftmode customer service and would give them six stars out of five for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Prompt shipping and delivery. I received product within 48 hours of ordering.&lt;br /&gt;2. Free sample of the product indicating that the vendor has high confidence in the products that they sell&lt;br /&gt;3. Prompt responses to e-mails from me regarding dosage, interactions and recommendations&lt;br /&gt;4. Periodic follow-up from Liftmode&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHENYLPIRACETAM:&lt;br /&gt;I am still playing with the dosing of this product. I noticed that 100mg is too high for me since it causes a slight pressure at the temples, and increased anger/aggression (and minor anxiety issues) possibly indicating an elevation of blood pressure.&lt;br /&gt;However, at 50 mg, I am observing the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. A sense of motivation. All of a sudden I am able to work on my to do list and get stuff done. Simple stuff like laundry, cleaning the bathroom, folding clothes, doing dishes etc. get done---and it&#x27;s like laziness and lethargy are bypassed in favor of action&lt;br /&gt;2. Clarity of thought---making it easier to plan stuff in a systematic and symmetrical way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last couple of days, I have been stacking with my perennial favorite racetam (Aniracetam) and am in the process of assessing the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Phenylpiracetam has high potential and I would need more time to fully flush out the effects of this racetam. My recommendation is to be very careful with the dosage, because based on my limited experience dosages of 100mg or higher could cause negative side effects like impatience, anger/rage and aggression.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a I don&#x27;t care how you feel &amp;#34;motivation pill&amp;#34;this is it! (if you want a feel good &amp;#34;chill pill&amp;#34; try Aniracetam! :-) )&lt;br /&gt;Hope to update this review at a later time.</li>
            <li> Bought piracetam (from another seller) before in bulk and the package was a lot bigger so initially I felt a bit disappointed upon seeing the size of the jar until I tried it. This is a quality product. The first few days was probably the best, I felt very &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; and the subsequent days that followed although i had some mild headaches with it until I coupled it with some choline. It really helps me get through my school work faster with more zeal and focus and then some. I like this stuff when I&#x27;m working out as well, I get very motivated. Having used piracetam I can honestly say that this stuff has been far more effective. Definitely reccomend it. Although I do notice the next day feeling a bit drained.</li>
            <li> Was hopeful that I could get on something natural for my ADD.  Doesn&#x27;t even scratch the surface of the effectiveness of meds.  As a matter of fact, it only felt like I was either not taking enough or too much when I tried to up the dose to alleviate the feeling of not taking enough.  Believe me it is VERY uncomfortable to go overboard with any stimulant natural or pharmaceutical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t seem to have a clear line of that &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; that just &amp;#34;normalizes&amp;#34; someone with my condition (not stoned and able to focus).  I am not one of those that is chasing a high or euphoria.  I just want focus and treatment of a real medical condition and unfortunately for me the answer is meds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten Phenibut from LiftMode in the past, and the stuff is very potent.  This however, I did not respond to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a large dose broken up twice per day, and I&#x27;ve taken small doses broken up several times per day.  I&#x27;ve taken it by itself and with other supplements (like Fish Oil).  I&#x27;ve taken it mixed in purified water and sublingually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not received a noticeable effect from it.  I have also taken, throughout the day, the CILTEP stack, Uridine stack, and large doses of Fish Oil/Zinc/Green Tea extract/multi, so I&#x27;m unsure if those could be interfering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ADHD, and do however, receive subtle effects from Piracetam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this three stars since it may not be a problem with the product, just my own chemistry may not mingle.  Also, the seller LiftMode is very easy to deal with. You can email them back and forth, they&#x27;re responsive and helpful.  I will continue purchasing other Nootropics from them.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with some vertigo/tinnitus issues recently.  I&#x27;ve been looking into the effects of piracetam/phenylpiracetam and other nootropics on the brain.  I take one small scoop of the phenylpiracetam 950-100mg) with 1-2g of piracetam along with choline (to prevent the headache) 4-5 mornings a week.  I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change with my brain fog/dizziness/overall &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; feelings.  I definitely recommend this if you are into extreme sports of any kind as piracetam is shown to help with head trauma.</li>
            <li> This stuff works surprisingly well. Not so much stimulating as alertness promoting. I work one job at night and another during the day a couple times a week so when i have to be awake for extended periods this helps a lot without making me feel &amp;#34;wired&amp;#34; or otherwise uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d only briefly used any other racetam type supplements &amp; this one is easily my favorite. I only use it a couple or three times a week, but when i run out will probably be getting the 10g quantity. Have recommended it to a few friends already.</li>
            <li> I really like this, because its great for a &#x27;mental&#x27; boost, even tho I don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;vivid dreaming&#x27; aspect. [Dreams are *not* &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;!â€”but they sure can seem like it!]&lt;br /&gt;However, DO NOT buy itâ€”the price was DOUBLE, compared to the seller&#x27;s own website [@Dec, 2013].&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, the company sent me a &amp;#34;discount coupon&amp;#34; for liftmode.com, that WOULDN&#x27;T WORK!&lt;br /&gt;As I checked the price today, its $32 [apprx] for FIVE GRAMS on amazon, but TEN GRAMS is $42 [apprx] on the seller&#x27;s website.  ONLY 1/3 more, for TWICE the product?&lt;br /&gt;What kind of &#x27;deal&#x27; is that?&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER!&lt;br /&gt;DO THE MATH!&lt;br /&gt;The price I paid is $6.40 PER GRAM!&lt;br /&gt;At that price, I paid $2,902.99 per pound!&lt;br /&gt;WHAT a RIPOFF!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s ONE-HUNDRED-EIGHTY-ONE DOLLARS &amp; FORTY-FOUR CENTS an OUNCE!&lt;br /&gt;Nobody can rip you off, unless You LET them!</li>
