    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Makes me look great!!</li>
            <li>It is best with a bathing suit..does it help with stretch marks</li>
            <li>but it gives a very nice shimmer, legs look good!</li>
            <li>This lotion does moisturize and smells great but has almost no color.</li>
            <li>, the finish is superb, though, it looks amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>It looks so nice, even without a tan; I can&#x27;t wait to see how great it is this summer when I get some sun!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice glow!</li>
            <li>If you have an event to go to and want that nice glow without the sparkles, this is your product!</li>
            <li>color blends well into fair and tanned skin.</li>
            <li>though I have fair skin, the Medium shade provided zero color or coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients list is great, it smells ok.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love the gold glimmer!</li>
            <li>it amazing.</li>
            <li>Instead of adding color, it adds a shimmering glow which is nice but does not cover anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells nice , goes on well.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice sheen when applied.</li>
            <li>I have had more than one client decline to use it because the scent would ecplipse her own perfume</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product after seeing it on some tv show about makeup, but it&#x27;s not as good as it looked )-:  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just great for photographs (when the flash is used), but it does nothing impressive for everyday use...</li>
            <li>Good for special occasions.</li>
            <li>sally hansen has got much better covering products sparys ..</li>
            <li>I love the vegan, skin-benefiting formula, but I add a generous amount of liquid foundation when I want to convincingly cover up my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>have not achieved a better result from one product alone.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more color.  </li>
            <li>It is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>love the texture and firming power.</li>
            <li>I love this product but</li>
            <li>I think in a dryer climate the product would feel better on the skin.</li>
            <li>So.. for that reason, I am not 100% sure I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>As soon as I heard about this product from my favorite trainer Tracy Anderson, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this lotion.</li>
            <li>I just wear it because I love the color, smell and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this to give my legs a nice even glow and to cover up the veins that can be seen through my light skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll wear it more in summer with a bathing suit not in the wintwe when I have lots of clothes.</li>
            <li>a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly the moment I was aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;Might be wonderful for someone else.  </li>
            <li>But for the rest of my body, and when just hanging out less-than-fully-clothed with my guy, I love how this bumps my feelings of fabulousness up a notch or two in an easy, healthy, fun way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The lotion has a light, refreshing fragrance and light - not greasy texture.</li>
            <li>It would probably work just fine for someone med-darker skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aways just kind of...moist... and it certainly will rub off on people you rub up against-</li>
            <li>Awesome cream, lightly shimmery, smells natural and makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li>its just a light lotion with light shimmering or coloring thats it</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4, but it does seem to lightly rub off on clothes.  </li>
            <li>Really wanted this to be great, but I just couldn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the product smells lovely and the ingredients are natural and your skin will look amazing!</li>
            <li>First, and most importantly to me</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this lotion out.  </li>
            <li>When I received this lotion, I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I am a bridal makeup artist and finding a lovely soft glow for the body was very important for me-</li>
            <li>The glittery effect is a bit much, but still quite lovely.</li>
            <li>It was very pricey, and I hoped it would be more of a leg make-up...</li>
            <li>Love this so much.  </li>
            <li>Second and (almost) equally important is that it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>worth it for me.</li>
            <li>The color is subtle and is easy to use and the smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and has a subtle yet beautiful glow- not chunky or glittery at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I feel this product would be best used in a photoshoot scenario and it has been relegated to that arena in my practice, sadly.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a daily - more for special occasions but it is a solid staple when I&#x27;m glamming up!</li>
            <li>I also read that it has a huge celebrity following too...</li>
            <li>this one really does nothing does nothing at alll ...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hide much.  </li>
            <li>really works well.</li>
            <li>the one thing I don&#x27;t really care for is the greasy sticky feel.</li>
            <li>This seemed to do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it has \\&quot;skin tightening\\&quot; effects as</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, is a tad bit sticky but doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothing or anything like that.</li>
            <li>, I have dehydrated skin, but i&#x27;m also 24, so this should be absorbing into my skin no problem.</li>
            <li>If you already have decent skin, it just gives a natural-looking glow similar to one you might have if you ate only the healthiest foods, worked out vigorously every day, had great sex regularly and medi-spa exfoliating treatments once a week.</li>
            <li>Maybe other people have better luck with it.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and the humidity is very high here...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but drugstore brands are better for less than half the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like it gives a slight sheen and shimmer than anything else.</li>
            <li>Seriously high priced and overrated..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for use on face and body.</li>
            <li>Makes this 50 yr old girl look 40 again!!</li>
            <li>I will say that in reality it is a little &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t give the magical results that the article seemed to promise.  </li>
            <li>It does not have the strong odor of other self tan products.  </li>
            <li>I do feel a better tightness, and I swear it makes my &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; in my upper thigh less noticeable.</li>
            <li>sit near, etc...</li>
            <li>It makes skin look like it has a natural glow and smoothness.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this would work on bad varicose veins but it works great for small or light imperfections.</li>
            <li>A little creamier and has more shimmer than the average tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Even with the color medium, you can barely see it on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Anytime I&#x27;m going out with bare legs</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and chose medium - the result is less dramatic than a bronzer but gives you a glow.  </li>
            <li>There was a very little shimmer that it added to my skin, but my legs looked pretty much the same and despite waiting for a couple of hours to let it dry before I put clothes on, I still saw traces of the color on the inside of my off-white skirt.</li>
            <li>It rubbed off onto my clothes and was pretty messy.</li>

            <li> It rubbed off onto my clothes and was pretty messy.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get enough on the first try, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the container.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really tightens my skin.</li>
            <li> This is not bad -- tanning lotions are worse, plus they smell.  </li>
            <li> it constantly dispensed way too much or was hard to get any out.  </li>
            <li> It goes on really sticky, and it&#x27;s hard to get out of the squeeze thing it comes in.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not cover even minor discrepancies in skin color or texture.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> I applied the lotion just as the directions told, waited for it to dry before dressing.  </li>
            <li> Once you allow it to dry it will not rub off on clothes.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I gave the Clear one as a gift this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> i will get the dark next time.</li>
            <li> that is not really what I was looking for when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> When I read about this product I was curious, we all want the miracle.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is there is a slight tacky feeling, but</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars just because of the ingredients list, other than that</li>
            <li> This product stays wet longer than average.</li>
            <li> It is a bit shimmery but not nearly worth the price.  </li>
            <li> This leaves your skin with a heavy metallic finish -- not really the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of an oily residue but gives you that slight shimmer that accentuates.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I live in Las Vegas and it is crazy dry here?!</li>
            <li> I would return it ,but the price of returning the item, makes it not worth !</li>
            <li> The lotion never stained my clothes, but I never felt like it dried.  </li>
            <li> anyway, when I used this lotion, it was extremely greasy!!!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> , I am very, very pale.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale legs.</li>
            <li> And I feel much less inclined to strictly ration Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion, because it&#x27;s so much less expensive than Prtty Peaushun.</li>
            <li> The packaging sucks -</li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> I know some people complained about it being greasy</li>
            <li> I also experimented with amounts &amp; its just not a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> but it feels thick.</li>
            <li> It is VERY subtle colorwise.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment, and an expensive disappointment!</li>
            <li> Part of me loves this stuff and part of me is disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I put it on and went to a party, and ended up in the bathroom trying to wash it off, as it felt just awful and everytime someone hugged me</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!!</li>
            <li> worst part was the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel to my skin all evening.  </li>

            <li> sally hansen has got much better covering products sparys ..this one really does nothing does nothing at alll ... its just a light lotion with light shimmering or coloring thats it .. its a waste of money really i wish i didnt bought it ...</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s not glittery. If you already have decent skin, it just gives a natural-looking glow similar to one you might have if you ate only the healthiest foods, worked out vigorously every day, had great sex regularly and medi-spa exfoliating treatments once a week. However, it does not cover even minor discrepancies in skin color or texture. I love the vegan, skin-benefiting formula, but I add a generous amount of liquid foundation when I want to convincingly cover up my keratosis pilaris. Basically, if I&#x27;m showing my upper arms at an event, I&#x27;m adding whatever is necessary to give me the fuller coverage I desire in that area. But for the rest of my body, and when just hanging out less-than-fully-clothed with my guy, I love how this bumps my feelings of fabulousness up a notch or two in an easy, healthy, fun way.&lt;br /&gt;I have not achieved a better result from one product alone. I will say, though, I&#x27;ve achieved almost identical results by mixing Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Body Lotion and MAC Cosmetics Face and Body Foundation... And I feel much less inclined to strictly ration Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion, because it&#x27;s so much less expensive than Prtty Peaushun.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this lotion out.  What I specifically wanted was something to wear on my legs out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am very, very pale.  This lotion does moisturize and smells great but has almost no color. Even with the color medium, you can barely see it on my legs.  I assumed the product since it says it covers imperfections would be darker and/or thicker-this is not the case.  Instead of adding color, it adds a shimmering glow which is nice but does not cover anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using it but will keep looking for something that makes skin look sun-kissed and covers imperfections.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more color.  A little goes a long way. Good for special occasions. Smells nice , goes on well.</li>
            <li> I like it, I improved it by adding a drop of lavender essential oil, the fragrance, is lacking :no luxurious fragrance, the finish is superb, though, it looks amazing on my skin.I give it 4 stars, because of this detail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky. It is a bit shimmery but not nearly worth the price.  It doesn&#x27;t hide much.  The packaging sucks - it constantly dispensed way too much or was hard to get any out.  whoever came up with putting lotion in a bag was a bit flaky.</li>
            <li> Part of me loves this stuff and part of me is disappointed.  I am a bridal makeup artist and finding a lovely soft glow for the body was very important for me- this product seemed like a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous glow. No doubt.  Goes on evenly and has a subtle yet beautiful glow- not chunky or glittery at all. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The scent. It is overwhelming. I have had more than one client decline to use it because the scent would ecplipse her own perfume and/or she just didn&#x27;t like the fragrance.  I wish this came unscented.&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t dry.  Ever.  It&#x27;s aways just kind of...moist... and it certainly will rub off on people you rub up against- which, in a wedding scenario, is everyone you hug, dance with, sit near, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel this product would be best used in a photoshoot scenario and it has been relegated to that arena in my practice, sadly.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product after seeing it on some tv show about makeup, but it&#x27;s not as good as it looked )-:  It goes on really sticky, and it&#x27;s hard to get out of the squeeze thing it comes in.  If you don&#x27;t get enough on the first try, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the container.  I put it on and went to a party, and ended up in the bathroom trying to wash it off, as it felt just awful and everytime someone hugged me I felt uncomfortable-my friends told me YUCK, acquaintences just tried to wipe their hands off without me noticing!  What a disappointment, and an expensive disappointment!</li>
            <li> Amazing! love the texture and firming power. really works well. color blends well into fair and tanned skin. will keep buying</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  The color is subtle and is easy to use and the smell is pleasant.  It does not have the strong odor of other self tan products.  It smooths and firms the skin while leaving a glow.</li>
            <li> It would probably work just fine for someone med-darker skin tone. It rubbed off onto my clothes and was pretty messy. I would return it ,but the price of returning the item, makes it not worth ! So,I hopefully can find someone else that it might work well for.&lt;br /&gt;Best for olive skin tone or darker.-</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like a movie star. The glittery effect is a bit much, but still quite lovely. Haven&#x27;t noticed any firming effect yet.</li>
            <li> Makes me look great!! Makes this 50 yr old girl look 40 again!! I use it on all my exposed skin, even my face!! Gives you a nice glow!</li>
            <li> I applied the lotion just as the directions told, waited for it to dry before dressing.  The lotion never stained my clothes, but I never felt like it dried.  I felt damp and sticky all night.  I was so disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I love this product but the one thing I don&#x27;t really care for is the greasy sticky feel. I live in Hawaii and the humidity is very high here...I think in a dryer climate the product would feel better on the skin. On the positive side, the product smells lovely and the ingredients are natural and your skin will look amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading an article that touted it&#x27;s use.  I will say that in reality it is a little &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t give the magical results that the article seemed to promise.  It has a somewhat sticky feel and I worry that it will rub off on my clothes.. especially when I would be wearing white pants or shorts in the summer.  So.. for that reason, I am not 100% sure I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> As soon as I heard about this product from my favorite trainer Tracy Anderson, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this lotion. I give it 2 stars just because of the ingredients list, other than that, there is nothing about this product that I like. It was very pricey, and I hoped it would be more of a leg make-up... It&#x27;s not. There was a very little shimmer that it added to my skin, but my legs looked pretty much the same and despite waiting for a couple of hours to let it dry before I put clothes on, I still saw traces of the color on the inside of my off-white skirt. Maybe it&#x27;s just great for photographs (when the flash is used), but it does nothing impressive for everyday use... At least not for me. Maybe other people have better luck with it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends and I did a comparison test. It&#x27;s OK, but drugstore brands are better for less than half the price. This product stays wet longer than average. It is VERY subtle colorwise. It&#x27;s more like it gives a slight sheen and shimmer than anything else. Overall, it&#x27;s better than nothing but this is definitely a one time purchase.</li>
            <li> I agree it is a bit sticky but it gives a very nice shimmer, legs look good!</li>
            <li> I dint get it. This seemed to do absolutely nothing. I saw no difference after applying this product. A friend compared it to Perfekt&#x27;s body perfection gel but it&#x27;s not even close. Wished I could send back after one try.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of an oily residue but gives you that slight shimmer that accentuates.</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to be great, but I just couldn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream, lightly shimmery, smells natural and makes your skin soft! Highly recommend it for use on face and body.</li>
            <li> Anytime I&#x27;m going out with bare legs I have to put this on. First, and most importantly to me it&#x27;s made with all vegan ingredients without animal testing. Second and (almost) equally important is that it&#x27;s an amazing product. It makes your skin tone even and shimmery without looking like you have sparkles on (like you are going to a rave or something). I know some people complained about it being greasy but I only felt refreshed and moisturized. Maybe because I live in Las Vegas and it is crazy dry here?! I don&#x27;t really know if it has \\&quot;skin tightening\\&quot; effects as that is not really what I was looking for when I purchased this product. I just wear it because I love the color, smell and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! It looks so nice, even without a tan; I can&#x27;t wait to see how great it is this summer when I get some sun!  It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, is a tad bit sticky but doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothing or anything like that. If you have an event to go to and want that nice glow without the sparkles, this is your product!</li>
            <li> When I received this lotion, I was so excited to try it. The ingredients list is great, it smells ok. I also read that it has a huge celebrity following too... anyway, when I used this lotion, it was extremely greasy!!! &amp; I exfoliate 3 to 4 times a week, I have dehydrated skin, but i&#x27;m also 24, so this should be absorbing into my skin no problem. I also experimented with amounts &amp; its just not a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff truly transforms your skin.  Makes you look at dewy and pretty...evens out your skin tone.  I don&#x27;t use it as a daily - more for special occasions but it is a solid staple when I&#x27;m glamming up!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion any time I expose my legs. I have very pale legs. I use this to give my legs a nice even glow and to cover up the veins that can be seen through my light skin. I don&#x27;t think this would work on bad varicose veins but it works great for small or light imperfections.</li>
            <li> A little creamier and has more shimmer than the average tanning lotion. Overall satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take it everywhere with me. Poolside in Vegas or going to a wedding it amazing. I&#x27;m not sure if it really tightens my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this so much.  Once you allow it to dry it will not rub off on clothes.  It makes skin look like it has a natural glow and smoothness.  I will always keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> I like the shimmer but it feels thick. Maybe I&#x27;ll wear it more in summer with a bathing suit not in the wintwe when I have lots of clothes.</li>
            <li> This product came used. It was opened and I want to return it</li>
            <li> After reading glowing reviews in several magazines, I purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have fair skin, the Medium shade provided zero color or coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part was the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel to my skin all evening.  I was wearing a strapless gown and my skin felt tacky to the touch.  (both mine and my dance partners)  Not exactly the moment I was aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;Might be wonderful for someone else.  Definitely not a product I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love the gold glimmer! The only downside that it stains.. My car seat is stained with gold.. My white clothes are stained.. It is best with a bathing suit..does it help with stretch marks😛no!! Does it hide imperfections... No!! It just add a glow to your skin that stains your clothes...</li>
            <li> I was already a fan of this product.  I like it.  I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4, but it does seem to lightly rub off on clothes.  This is not bad -- tanning lotions are worse, plus they smell.  This lotion has a nice scent.  Recommending it is not a problem.  In fact, I gave the Clear one as a gift this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> When I read about this product I was curious, we all want the miracle. I am now on my third one because I use it every day! I do feel a better tightness, and I swear it makes my &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; in my upper thigh less noticeable. There is a nice sheen when applied. I use it on my arms and chest as well. The only down fall is there is a slight tacky feeling, but worth it for me.</li>
            <li> This is a sheer lotion with a translucent tint and just a hint of shimmer.  It gives legs, arms, neckline, etc. a healthy glow.  I am fair skinned and chose medium - the result is less dramatic than a bronzer but gives you a glow.  The lotion has a light, refreshing fragrance and light - not greasy texture.</li>
            <li> I like this.... Gives a sheen... You must apply and let it set for an hour or so on your skin... That way it wont transfer to clothes and it won&#x27;t make you feel sticky... i will get the dark next time.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin with a heavy metallic finish -- not really the look I was going for.</li>
