            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I do my own nails at home and found after a week</li>
            <li>There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love Harmony Gelish products.</li>
            <li>If you get the foundation, polish or top coat on your cuticle, you have about 24 hours and it will start peeling.  </li>
            <li>Lift easily, break easily, crack easily.  </li>
            <li>Does not soak off as easily as the rest of the product line, which is fine, a bit of buffing takes it off.</li>
            <li>The soak off gels stay on fine, so</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails.</li>
            <li>These lamps are available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>, my thumb and index finger nail on my prominate hand would start to lift off so that i couldnt get 2 full weeks out of them.  </li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>Use the PH Bond first if you want (I don&#x27;t) but don&#x27;t miss this step before your foundation step!</li>
            <li>It is a good price for this stuff hard to find in town which when I found ones but wasn&#x27;t acid free.</li>
            <li>I did my nails last night so far so good.</li>
            <li>I use a professional LED light and gelish products.  </li>
            <li>Good price, helps adherence to soak off and hard gel.</li>
            <li>I really like the Gelish brand, and the PRO bond seems to do what it was designed for.</li>
            <li>Want your gel polish to really bond well?</li>
            <li>When I take the proper time to prep my nails correctly (instructional Videos on You Tube show how) I get a manicure that truely lasts two weeks.</li>
            <li>I have experienced some lifting along the back edge after 1 week, but I apply some nail glue and press it back down and it lasts for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Between using this and running a brush with a little nail polish remover around my cuticle with the foundation, polish, and top coat</li>
            <li>Use Gelish pH Bond first, let dry, then use this.  </li>
            <li>Use the PH bond first, then this and cure as you would the other gels.</li>
            <li>An LED light is required to set the hard gel.</li>
            <li>My manicures are hard and strong and last up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The hard gels still are not lasting more than a few hours before they start flaking off.</li>

            <li> The hard gels still are not lasting more than a few hours before they start flaking off.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole line for hard gel and they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> It was even hard for me to get the gel polish off when i used it on the whole nail.</li>
            <li> I use Pro Bond to dry the natural nail surface so the hard gel will adhere.</li>
            <li> Rather than go to the salon to get gel (powder) nails with plastic tips or a gel manicure, I use Harmony hard gel to add thickness to my natural nail surface.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because the hard builder gels were not adhering to my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I am on my second round with results.  </li>
            <li> THE TRICK IS TO LET IT DRY!!!  </li>
            <li> I needed a bond to cure the hard gel into place on my  nail so that It wouldn&#x27;t left up.</li>
            <li> I added this to the line up and got 2 and a half weeks out of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try some of the other hard gels from other companies eventually, it just sucks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted almost $50 (all together) on hard gels that don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Get this product and a small brush</li>
            <li> A must have for hard gel.  </li>
            <li> Doing hard gel</li>
            <li> You can not use Harmony hard gel without the pro bond.</li>
            <li> A must have if you are using the Gelish Hard Gel.</li>
            <li> But I wanted gels that would strengthen my nails for the winter, and I could polish over with RNP, sadly gelish is not working for me.</li>
            <li> Sorry to shout, but a lot of people don&#x27;t wait and then complain of lifting.</li>
            <li> I tried with just the ph for the hard gel and had terrible lifting.</li>
            <li> Am very frustrated with the system.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic! Love the gelish range!</li>
            <li> This seems to help with the lifting I was having on some of my gel nails.  I really like the Gelish brand, and the PRO bond seems to do what it was designed for.</li>
            <li> Good price, helps adherence to soak off and hard gel. A must have for hard gel.  I tried with just the ph for the hard gel and had terrible lifting.</li>
            <li> Doing hard gel I needed a bond to cure the hard gel into place on my  nail so that It wouldn&#x27;t left up. Great I did my nails last night so far so good. It is a good price for this stuff hard to find in town which when I found ones but wasn&#x27;t acid free. I was happy that I found this on amazon I didn&#x27;t want to damage my nails with acid. So this was a great find I would recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Super product. I do my own nails at home and found after a week, my thumb and index finger nail on my prominate hand would start to lift off so that i couldnt get 2 full weeks out of them.  I use a professional LED light and gelish products.  I added this to the line up and got 2 and a half weeks out of it.  I am on my second round with results.  Excellent product and i will be ordering again as i need it.</li>
            <li> Love Harmony Gelish products. They work so well for me. When I take the proper time to prep my nails correctly (instructional Videos on You Tube show how) I get a manicure that truely lasts two weeks. You can not use Harmony hard gel without the pro bond. It preps the nail so that the gel adheres correctly.</li>
            <li> This product is great. The hold on my gel nails is perfect.No peeling or lifting! Does not soak off as easily as the rest of the product line, which is fine, a bit of buffing takes it off. My nails did not lift at all, which was what I was looking for. Highly recommend. Use the PH bond first, then this and cure as you would the other gels.</li>
            <li> If you are using builder gel or structure gel then you WANT THIS. Use the PH Bond first if you want (I don&#x27;t) but don&#x27;t miss this step before your foundation step!</li>
            <li> Rather than go to the salon to get gel (powder) nails with plastic tips or a gel manicure, I use Harmony hard gel to add thickness to my natural nail surface.  I use Pro Bond to dry the natural nail surface so the hard gel will adhere. My manicures are hard and strong and last up to 2 weeks. I have experienced some lifting along the back edge after 1 week, but I apply some nail glue and press it back down and it lasts for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails. An LED light is required to set the hard gel. These lamps are available on Amazon. There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the hard builder gels were not adhering to my natural nails. This has not helped at all. The hard gels still are not lasting more than a few hours before they start flaking off. The soak off gels stay on fine, so I&#x27;ll probably just use this under the soak off foundation. But I wanted gels that would strengthen my nails for the winter, and I could polish over with RNP, sadly gelish is not working for me. I&#x27;ll try some of the other hard gels from other companies eventually, it just sucks I&#x27;ve wasted almost $50 (all together) on hard gels that don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is a MUST if you want your gels to adhere properly.  Use Gelish pH Bond first, let dry, then use this.  THE TRICK IS TO LET IT DRY!!!  Sorry to shout, but a lot of people don&#x27;t wait and then complain of lifting.</li>
            <li> A must have if you are using the Gelish Hard Gel. It does its job and that is all you can ask of a product.</li>
            <li> It helped solve my polish peeling issues! it worked great i finally get two weeks out of my manicure instead of 48hrs...</li>
            <li> I bought the whole line for hard gel and they don&#x27;t last.  Lift easily, break easily, crack easily.  Don&#x27;t like this at all...going back to IBD</li>
            <li> bought because gelish was not staying on. Did not help adhere the gel. Am very frustrated with the system. don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> this is great for an adhesive base for gel. It was even hard for me to get the gel polish off when i used it on the whole nail.</li>
            <li> Want your gel polish to really bond well? Buy this and use it in place of ph bond. I get close to two solid weeks using this.</li>
            <li> this product works good,</li>
            <li> I was having an issue with my gel nails peeling off in one entire sheet.  This helped quite a bit.  Between using this and running a brush with a little nail polish remover around my cuticle with the foundation, polish, and top coat so the products didn’t bleed onto my skin, I’ve been doing great with my Gelish kit.  If you get the foundation, polish or top coat on your cuticle, you have about 24 hours and it will start peeling.  Get this product and a small brush and you are in business.</li>
