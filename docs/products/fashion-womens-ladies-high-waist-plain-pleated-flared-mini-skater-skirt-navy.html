            <li>the skirt is right</li>
            <li>I dislike that plus sizes really on fit normal sized women.</li>
            <li>The material is nice and thick and the pleated style is lovely, but the length of the skirt is what made it unwearable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you have more of the same skirts please let me know thankyou</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not suffocating.</li>
            <li>More or less fit as described, which was stretchy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tight, so you might wanna be smart in what kind of size you pick out.</li>
            <li>The fabric has a little stretch to it and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>All in all, cute as expected.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>The skirt I received was much darker and shorter than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>and it still did not even cover my whole butt.</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t waster your money trying out this skirt if you&#x27;re an actual female with curves and nice sized butt.</li>
            <li>It does fit very tightly, which works for me but a person with more hips than I have, would have a harder time being comfortable in it.</li>
            <li>also wasn&#x27;t able to return it due to finals and the very short-time I could return it.</li>
            <li>its cute and all but the skirt itself have no volume, each time I sit down the skirt becomes flat but other than that its cute generally :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but the skirt is a bit too small.</li>
            <li>A few minor strings hanging, but nothing that scissors can&#x27;t fix :) Enjoy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is described as being high waist, but if I wear it at that point on my body, it becomes too obscene to wear.</li>
            <li>It was definitely well worth the money.</li>
            <li>, Bought a Black and this blue one :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think my little sister who is 9 can fit a size L of this</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this online because I have trouble finding clothes that fit my petite size.</li>
            <li>If you do purchase this item buy it in a size bigger that you normally would.</li>
            <li>It runs kind of short, thought it would go down a little farther, but no biggie.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wear it, but I&#x27;ll lose a little weight first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little small and the navy color I ordered turned out to be closer to black than blue, but its well made and the material is good quality.</li>

            <li> Customers keep in mind that this product is a darker color than it is in the picture: it looks almost black, usually, not noticeably blue.</li>
            <li> My backside is clearly visible, even if I pull the skirt down to my hips, and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but I expected a blue skirt.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that the skirt is a grey black color... not the stated navy blue.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this unless you are a size 00 or a small child.</li>
            <li> I was constantly having to pull it down</li>
            <li> color is almost black, not blue.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that it was a little bit tight around my waist.</li>
            <li> The fabric is very rough.</li>
            <li> It has a little patterned texture that I didn&#x27;t notice in the picture, but it&#x27;s a really cute skirt and crazy affordable!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all..DON&#x27;T WASTE MONEY at all.</li>
            <li> I bought a black one as well.</li>
            <li> Not the color or length in picture.suggested for little child to wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too noticeable since the fabric is quite stretchy, but it still does cut into my side a little bit.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s not really a huge deal either, I suppose.</li>
            <li> The material is very thin and completely see threw.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the color was not a dark blue, but almost black.</li>
            <li> It was really small.</li>
            <li> so my butt wouldn&#x27;t show and I am a relatively small person.</li>
            <li> I really like to wear skirts around my waist, but when I wear this around my waist, my butt is exposed! :(</li>
            <li> it will come small</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, this skirt was not a winner.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it now sits in my dresser drawer, banished to the land of unwearables.</li>
            <li> hated it came to small going to probably return</li>

    <ol>
            <li> For a friend. this is what she indicated.</li>
            <li> The skirt is a bargain at this price! It&#x27;s a great fit and the material is really light weight, but not sheer. It&#x27;s perfect to wear with many different tops. It was definitely well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly for me and the length was fine&lt;br /&gt;I like the material used, its like stretchy and comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;nice color too, recommend!!</li>
            <li> More or less fit as described, which was stretchy. It runs kind of short, thought it would go down a little farther, but no biggie. Largest concern was that the material it&#x27;s made of is very different than it looks to be in the image. However, that&#x27;s not really a huge deal either, I suppose. Customers keep in mind that this product is a darker color than it is in the picture: it looks almost black, usually, not noticeably blue. All in all, cute as expected.</li>
            <li> So cute, nice fabic. Seems a bit darker in person but I still love it. Its perfect. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> It was really small. I cant wear it but I gave it to a friend of mine thats a size 0. She fit in it great</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all..DON&#x27;T WASTE MONEY at all.Not the color or length in picture.suggested for little child to wear.</li>
            <li> Very cute. It&#x27;s comfortable, and well made. A few minor strings hanging, but nothing that scissors can&#x27;t fix :) Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great deal and nicely made. The skirt fits well and the material is nice and light. The fabric has a little stretch to it and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I dislike that plus sizes really on fit normal sized women. Not every female is a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is almost black, not blue. The fabric is very rough. I don&#x27;t even think my little sister who is 9 can fit a size L of this skirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wasn&#x27;t able to return it due to finals and the very short-time I could return it. I will admit the feedback I retrieved from the company was on time. However, I wouldn&#x27;t waster your money trying out this skirt if you&#x27;re an actual female with curves and nice sized butt.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast the skirt is right but I guess the sizing is my fault the fabric is like a kitchen cloth and the top is kind of bumpy</li>
            <li> love the way the skirt falls and leiant of it, just the way i like it and how it feels around me, when i wake. if you have more of the same skirts please let me know thankyou</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, this skirt was not a winner. I love the skater skirt style so I decided to test my luck on this. The material is nice and thick and the pleated style is lovely, but the length of the skirt is what made it unwearable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is described as being high waist, but if I wear it at that point on my body, it becomes too obscene to wear. My backside is clearly visible, even if I pull the skirt down to my hips, and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;. Sadly, it now sits in my dresser drawer, banished to the land of unwearables.</li>
            <li> The material is very thin and completely see threw. If you do purchase this item buy it in a size bigger that you normally would.</li>
            <li> The skirt I received was much darker and shorter than the picture shows. I was constantly having to pull it down so my butt wouldn&#x27;t show and I am a relatively small person. I was disappointed that the color was not a dark blue, but almost black. It does fit very tightly, which works for me but a person with more hips than I have, would have a harder time being comfortable in it.</li>
            <li> I love this skirt so much! I love the color and the material is very nice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5, however, is because it&#x27;s (centimeters) too short for me. I really like to wear skirts around my waist, but when I wear this around my waist, my butt is exposed! :( However, at the hips, they look really lovely. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and 130 lbs.</li>
            <li> The skirt is comfortable and cute. Great price. Its short, so chose your size wisely. looks just like it does in the picture. AMAZING</li>
            <li> I bought a black one as well. Both are great quality. I do not recommend if you are tall though. The seller, BestDealUSA/US I don&#x27;t remember, was awesome. I got this item in two days. Color looks the same as the one in the picture. Thanks!</li>
            <li> its cute and all but the skirt itself have no volume, each time I sit down the skirt becomes flat but other than that its cute generally :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and a size 0 and it fits great. It&#x27;s about mid-thigh length and the material is nice. It has a little patterned texture that I didn&#x27;t notice in the picture, but it&#x27;s a really cute skirt and crazy affordable! Well made and super cute :)</li>
            <li> I LOve this Skirt, Bought a Black and this blue one :)</li>
            <li> This is cheap and hideous, honestly. Get up, go to a store and buy something better.&lt;br /&gt;( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</li>
            <li> I am a 5&#x27;2 and size 0. I was hesitant to buy this online because I have trouble finding clothes that fit my petite size. However this fits wonderfully and its a very good length! It is cute and comfortable. Only down side is that the skirt is a grey black color... not the stated navy blue. I&#x27;m okay with it because I wanted a skirt this color but I expected a blue skirt.</li>
            <li> four stars cause the color shows slightly different from the screen, everything else are very good.</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars I would. Do not waste your money on this unless you are a size 00 or a small child. I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;3 and it still did not even cover my whole butt.</li>
            <li> hated it came to small going to probably return do not buy i recomend not buying  it will come small</li>
            <li> This skirt is absolutely adorable and it really does fit with almost any outfit. I love how the pleats look. The only issue I had was that it was a little bit tight around my waist. It&#x27;s not too noticeable since the fabric is quite stretchy, but it still does cut into my side a little bit. A good plus though is how fast it got to me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but the skirt is a bit too small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small and the navy color I ordered turned out to be closer to black than blue, but its well made and the material is good quality. I&#x27;ll wear it, but I&#x27;ll lose a little weight first so I&#x27;m not suffocating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tight, so you might wanna be smart in what kind of size you pick out.</li>
