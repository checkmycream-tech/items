            <li>My stones were perfectly sorted by color and did not get mixed up in shipping</li>
            <li>I love the variety of rhinestones.</li>
            <li>This was a good package of tools for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I think these work pretty good.</li>
            <li>Loved the gems, to many for just one person but a great deal for nail shops and or people who change their nails every other day.</li>
            <li>Rhinestones seem fine, not about to count how many I received.</li>
            <li>The tweezers work absolutely perfect for placement of the jewels and even make it easy to remove a single one from the wheel without spilling anything..</li>
            <li>The tweezers help in an easy application of whatever pattern you want on your nails.</li>
            <li>The tweezers make it easy to pick and apply the color of gemstone you want.</li>
            <li>These are smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can see myself using these up quick!</li>
            <li>The marbling/dotting tools are nice as well, and really make DIY manicures easy.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li>dotting tools are cool looking and work well, the gems have a nice selection of colors and the tweezers are perfectly angled and fine enough for the tiny gems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My daughter and i are having so much fun with these!</li>
            <li>glue on great, stay on very long - depending on your glue.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I really got these for the tweezers but the rhinestones turned out to be a good thing to have because they are a bit bigger than any of the others I had and who can&#x27;t use more dotting tools?</li>
            <li>The rhinestones and the dotting tools are OK, but it&#x27;s the tweezers that are really nifty.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery love it</li>
            <li>I received all three items and they are a shown, I&#x27;m really liking everything so far, they are easy to put on using the Tweezers, no hardship whatsoever and the dotting tool makes me able to decorate my nails more easy and really pretty.</li>
            <li>The rhinestones are pretty, tweezers work, dotting pens are nice, bigger than I expected but varied tips are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expert, but I do know the importance of having the right tools in order to get the right look.</li>
            <li>Product was as advertised and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 3 different items for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Took longer than I would have expected or liked for the shipping</li>
            <li>It looks really pretty on the nails too.</li>
            <li>The rhinestones are also pretty</li>
            <li>Everything came exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved nail polish, but only recently have I started doing nail art</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast considering it came from China.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are a real lifesaver when dealing with the rhinestones.</li>
            <li>It was so cheap and came with 6 different size dotters plus the gems and tweezers.</li>
            <li>It is better than waht I expected.</li>
            <li>got here much sooner than scheduled.</li>
            <li>And I really doubt there are 2400 gems</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really need that much.</li>
            <li>The top turns so that only one color is open at a time, and prevents mixing!</li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter really loves it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s well worth the money if you want to customize your nails.</li>
            <li>Cost to much to send back.</li>
            <li>She is 13 years old, and loves to decorate her nails.  </li>
            <li>The dotting tools were as expected, tweezers work well and rhinestones are nice and small, which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li>The dotting tools were as expected, tweezers work well and rhinestones are nice and small, which is what I prefer.</li>

            <li> Worth the few bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Dotting tools are standard- all different on one side and all the same on the other.</li>
            <li> The other ends are all the same size.</li>
            <li> she likes it well enough, however there is a lot of small pieces obviously</li>
            <li> The stones did come a little mixed up and scattered</li>
            <li> - jus expected what i saw in the image</li>
            <li> Everything was as promised and expected</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and my daughter loves doing her nails and other people&#x27;s nails too.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase all of these item separately from a different seller until I came across this bundle, which was almost half the price!!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it took FOREVER to arrive.</li>
            <li> and you need to be real careful opening it up.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones come in all sorts of colors, including black.</li>
            <li> I waited for a month and a half for my set just to not have them arrive within a few days after the month and a half</li>
            <li> Not exactly easy to use.</li>
            <li> they were so poorly made they didn&#x27;t match up when closed (defeating their purpose).  </li>
            <li> Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much you can do wrong with a dotting tool.</li>
            <li> in all - I will use the dotting tools and the rhinestones, but the tweezers are worthless.</li>
            <li> Awful</li>

            <li> My daughter and i are having so much fun with these! The tweezers help in an easy application of whatever pattern you want on your nails. The top turns so that only one color is open at a time, and prevents mixing!</li>
            <li> Fun product, they finally arrived extremely late, or they may have sent a second set out because it had never arrived, no way to tell i suppose, so watch who you order this from. I waited for a month and a half for my set just to not have them arrive within a few days after the month and a half wait and then they said they sent me out another set. The rhinestones are pretty, tweezers work, dotting pens are nice, bigger than I expected but varied tips are great. Worth the few bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li> It met my needs perfectly!  I&#x27;m not an expert, but I do know the importance of having the right tools in order to get the right look.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of rhinestone colors. The tweezers make it easy to pick and apply the color of gemstone you want. Great price ($12), although like an hour after I ordered they lowered it to $6. I haven&#x27;t used the dot tools yet. They are sturdy and good quality though. I also ordered a set for my sister and she really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not 2400 rhinestones, the tweezers arrived and they were so poorly made they didn&#x27;t match up when closed (defeating their purpose).  The dotting tools are the only thing that arrived as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - I will use the dotting tools and the rhinestones, but the tweezers are worthless.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift and she was very excited with the great assortment of stones..</li>

            <li> i got a cuticle clipper instead of a tweezer ...oh well, i will still use it - jus expected what i saw in the image</li>
            <li> Very cute gems that are easy to apply with the tools that are provided. The price is great as well. I bought several.</li>

            <li> The rhinestones and the dotting tools are OK, but it&#x27;s the tweezers that are really nifty.  They have good weight, balance, hand feel. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>

            <li> Bought this for my wife and daughter because they just got into doing there own nails. It was so cheap and came with 6 different size dotters plus the gems and tweezers. They do their nails all the time with this stuff now. Shipping was pretty fast considering it came from China. Arrived in about a week.</li>

            <li> fast delivery love it</li>

            <li> Product was as advertised and the price was right.  A gift for my teen step daughter, she loved it !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved nail polish, but only recently have I started doing nail art so I&#x27;ve been working on growing my collection of tools and decorations. I wanted dotting tools, so while looking around I found this 3-in-1 combo and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The dotting tools are cool looking and work well, the gems have a nice selection of colors and the tweezers are perfectly angled and fine enough for the tiny gems.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this kit for anyone looking to add to their polish collection.</li>
            <li> This was a good package of tools for a very reasonable price. The rhinestones are a decent quality, and the tweezers are awesome. The marbling/dotting tools are nice as well, and really make DIY manicures easy.</li>
            <li> Love the item.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect Combination set. I love this set and at a good price too. Great tweezer tool for picking up and placing items onto my nails.</li>
            <li> This offer was really great and my daughter loves doing her nails and other people&#x27;s nails too. It looks really pretty on the nails too.</li>
            <li> Great price for so many rhinestones, plus tweezer and 5 piece nail art tools.&lt;br /&gt;Rhinestones glue on great, stay on very long - depending on your glue.&lt;br /&gt;It got here much sooner than scheduled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this buy. It&#x27;s 3 different items for such a great price. All these items probably would cost me $9 a piece at my local beauty store! The stones did come a little mixed up and scattered but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal. And I really doubt there are 2400 gems but I don&#x27;t really need that much. The dotting tools are just what I wanted. 5 different dotting sizes! The other ends are all the same size. The tweezers are excellent quality. They feel sturdy in my hand. This would make an excellent gift for a nail art enthusiast!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to actually use these. I think the dotting tools are neat. They have a trippy design. The rhinestones come in all sorts of colors, including black. I can see myself using these up quick!</li>
            <li> Nice three in one kit. Each product comes individually packaged.  This is a perfect at home nail art starter kit.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Looked like something thrown together. Not pleased at all. Cost to much to send back. Awful</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was very pleased to receive this as one of her Christmas gift.  She is 13 years old, and loves to decorate her nails.  She expressed delight when she opened the gift.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase - many different tools to use and very good quality - I highly recommend :)~</li>
            <li> I ordered this convo because I wanted the dotting tools and the rhinestone instrument I am happy for the quality and price. The rhinestones are also pretty</li>
            <li> The dotting tools were as expected, tweezers work well and rhinestones are nice and small, which is what I prefer. My stones were perfectly sorted by color and did not get mixed up in shipping</li>
            <li> Thank you great item.</li>
            <li> The tweezers came opened in their packaging. Not exactly easy to use. Dotting tools are standard- all different on one side and all the same on the other. Rhinestones seem fine, not about to count how many I received.</li>
            <li> I love this nail art kit ! My only complaint is that it took FOREVER to arrive.</li>
            <li> Everything came exactly as shown. The wheel is very nice for keeping the jewels separated. The tweezers work absolutely perfect for placement of the jewels and even make it easy to remove a single one from the wheel without spilling anything.. There&#x27;s not much you can do wrong with a dotting tool. These are smooth and easy to use. Overall, it&#x27;s well worth the money if you want to customize your nails.</li>
            <li> I added this on as a birthday gift for my daughter to go with the nail art kit. She loves it !!!!</li>
            <li> Good value. I dont know it there are 2,400 rhinestones, but they have a lot in each wheel</li>
            <li> I love the variety of rhinestones.</li>
