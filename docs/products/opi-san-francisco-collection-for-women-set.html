            <li>I buy a lot of these mini collections as gifts for friends but this one was so cute</li>
            <li>The colors are striking.</li>
            <li>OPI has fantastic names for polish!</li>
            <li>who doesnt love nail polish</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>If you love burgundies, reds and purples</li>
            <li>Love, Peace, OPI is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and the smal size.</li>
            <li>I love the sample sizes.</li>
            <li>Else, I&#x27;m sure they stay for more than 7 days.</li>
            <li>Nice to get smaller sizes and more choices at a great rate instead of full size bottles!</li>
            <li>They chip easily, though, even with a top coat.</li>
            <li>her favorite right now is Peace &amp; Love &amp;OPI</li>
            <li>Cute polish, good size, especially since I tend to use a color once or twice and then move on.</li>
            <li>My friend loved it and the colors are nice and dark.</li>
            <li>mini anything and these mini polishes are perfect for my small collection.</li>
            <li>they dont stay for more than one day in my nails, it is very dissapointed</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to get smaller sizes sometimes to try them out.</li>
            <li>The polish is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Apparently it&#x27;s a nice kit with multiple colors.</li>
            <li>She was happy they were small</li>
            <li>I love the various color options they have.  </li>
            <li>I think the deal is you get the samples, find your favorite color and then buy a bigger bottle of that.</li>
            <li>Love the San Francisco collection;  proper homage to my home away from home!</li>
            <li>and she was able to try the colors out before buying a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>This was my first try on the minis</li>
            <li>but the shades are pretty.</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish as it lasts a long time without chipping or wearing off.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>very small bottles, but great if you&#x27;d like to test new colors out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI and only use OPI products.</li>
            <li>Anyways, OPI doesn&#x27;t chip nearly as much as Essie, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with these mini sets from now on.</li>
            <li>I love this mini set of nail polish, it allows me to try different colors, without a big investment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding a color that I don&#x27;t already own, until I went with OPI.  </li>
            <li>I am a trauma nurse and nail polish never lasted more than a few hours while at work, until I started using OPI.  </li>
            <li>The feed back was very positive.  </li>
            <li>Love this little sample set!</li>
            <li>Pretty, but tiny.  </li>
            <li>Love them all and have a hard time choosing.  </li>
            <li>Only sad part is they are tiny silver need to purchase full size in my favorite color cable car pool.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t finish the regular size up before it gets old</li>
            <li>Fun, color changing green tint.</li>
            <li>I like little bottles, they don&#x27;t dry out as quickly.</li>

            <li> The colors are great, but the mini brush is terrible; it doesn&#x27;t allow for those long, sweeping application motions, and results in faster chipping</li>
            <li> I am the type of girl that  could wear pink all year, but I don&#x27;t because I need to be fashionable.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey for them being so small, but that is OPI for ya.</li>

            <li> I got this for my wife for her birthday. I am very impressed. The quality is wonderful the packaging is nice. The colors are beautiful her favorite right now is Peace &amp; Love &amp;OPI she made her nails look galaxy like. So this product is very awesome I will be buying more OPI stuff.</li>
            <li> very small bottles, but great if you&#x27;d like to test new colors out</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish as it lasts a long time without chipping or wearing off.  I love the various color options they have.  I have a hard time finding a color that I don&#x27;t already own, until I went with OPI.  I am a trauma nurse and nail polish never lasted more than a few hours while at work, until I started using OPI.  Now my polish lasts about a week, even with all the handwashing and alcohol gel use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The wife likes them and said OPI is one of the better/expensive brands out there. I think the deal is you get the samples, find your favorite color and then buy a bigger bottle of that. Wife is now (OH YEAH, I forgot I had those!) painting her nails. Ha Ha!</li>
            <li> Love the San Francisco collection;  proper homage to my home away from home! Gorgeous color with lots of staying power</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and great quality! Nice to get smaller sizes and more choices at a great rate instead of full size bottles!</li>
            <li> Love the colors in this collection. I buy a lot of these mini collections as gifts for friends but this one was so cute I had to keep it for myself.</li>
            <li> I did not use the nail polish myself, but gave 2 sets as gifts.  My friends loved them!  They were shipped promptly and were in good shape upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Althoug the colors aré beautiful they dont stay for more than one day in my nails, it is very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I like little bottles, they don&#x27;t dry out as quickly. The colors are striking. They chip easily, though, even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> Great Item! Great Seller! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I would have loved it if this was the item that was sent to me as ordered. I received the opi take 10 instead. I do like some of the colors in the one I received, especially Tickle my Francie. May be next year I will try and repurchase it as a holiday gift to myself again.</li>
            <li> OPI has fantastic names for polish! Always so quirky. These colors are good for fall/winter. I am the type of girl that  could wear pink all year, but I don&#x27;t because I need to be fashionable. Anyways, OPI doesn&#x27;t chip nearly as much as Essie, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with these mini sets from now on.</li>

            <li> This San Francisco OPI mini polish collection is amazing. If you love burgundies, reds and purples this is a great collection to sample.</li>
            <li> I got this set for a Christmas present for my sister, and wish I would have ordered another set for myself.  The colors are beautiful and the OPI product is superior!</li>
            <li> I loved all the lockers they were all beautiful. Only sad part is they are tiny silver need to purchase full size in my favorite color cable car pool. Can&#x27;t beat opi</li>
            <li> The polish is very pretty. Great color selection. Get many coats of polish out of each bottle and give chance to see which polish like the best.</li>
