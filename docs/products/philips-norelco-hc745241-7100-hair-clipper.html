            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>After my wife ran the clippers through my hair, I received a fairly even cut.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing this since the 90&#x27;s, so I have used my fair share of clippers.</li>
            <li>I would without a doubt recommend, we bought 2 of them because there that good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good multipurpose clipper, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Not so good for trimming beard.</li>
            <li>Good bye attachments.</li>
            <li>Good product, to solve my problem</li>
            <li>Clippers are comfortable to hold and cut excellent without the guard on...</li>
            <li>Not even a good hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>good quality!&lt;br</li>
            <li>my family like it.it feel good.</li>
            <li>The blades seem good and are removable for washing.</li>
            <li>good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product .easy&#x27;to</li>
            <li>So this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Just started using - seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>good price ï¼Œnice hair cliper</li>
            <li>Everything about it sounded good.  </li>
            <li>It was cordless, had an adjustible length guard and seemed like an over all good match for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seconds into using the clipper</li>
            <li>my husband determined that it wasn&#x27;t as good as it seemed.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>but it good</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>

            <li>Packaging and machine state is really good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Norelco is well known for its good shavers and the Lithium-ion cordless hair clipper is no exception.  </li>
            <li>so you must keep going over and over to get a good even look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I loved the design, simplifying all those clipper guards that always get lost and are a pain to change.</li>
            <li>The built in comb doesn&#x27;t do a good job of lifting the hair, so hair is missed.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, not the best but gives a good trim.</li>
            <li>1 more star because I&#x27;m so happy with</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>

            <li>bought this for my husband, he is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>While we have been pleased with the Wahl brand clippers, the capability to go cordless with the Philips Norelco HC7452/41 7100 hair clippers was an attractive</li>

            <li>Amazing battery upto 2 hours in a charge of 1 hour.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing.</li>
            <li>its amazing experience</li>
            <li>had read a review where someone said this caused it to change on its own as you used it.</li>
            <li>The selectable height is nice</li>
            <li>it is nice not worrying about loosing all of the combs that set the height.</li>
            <li>Nicely done.</li>
            <li>It is nicely designed but it just does not cut hair evenly even on turbo.</li>
            <li>nice battery life&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quieter; a nice plus.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to my mom and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>I really like the cordless aspect and am impressed by the battery.</li>

            <li>mo2HOE2LU3A25HQ]]The Philips Norelco 7100 Hair Clipper is a highly effective grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>You can own a haircut.</li>
            <li>Nice feel in my hand</li>
            <li>when 1st time using it, I got nice haircut by my self.</li>
            <li>It comes in a handy plastic carrying case with a charging cord, brush for cleaning, and a hair combing attachment.</li>
            <li>You can kind of see where the blades rest in relation to the guides and where you use the dial to click set</li>
            <li>That said I liked the performance of this Phillips cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I very much liked this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold,  and very nice looking design.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>In particular, A / s are points that I want Is not progress five years best advantage.</li>
            <li>light and cordless, easy to maneuver, very good for travel</li>
            <li>This trimmer has good battery life, nice ergonomics, and an easy height adjustment.</li>
            <li>Did not read the instructions, very easy to use</li>
            <li>Great product,and at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I think is a wonderful machine; easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The way u can change the size is amazingly nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>Even for a person who never cut own hair before (myself), i was able to do &amp;#34;2 block hair style&amp;#34; without difficuty.</li>
            <li>If you are over 80 years old, you might think it&#x27;s wonderful -</li>
            <li>honestly liked my wahl better because even on turbo</li>
            <li>It is super nice!</li>
            <li>very nice, and my wife use it on me for fun.</li>
            <li>Very good, is strong, the only fly in the ointment is that the fuselage can&#x27;t wash</li>
            <li>Therefore, this product is probably best for touch ups and light jobs rather than intense hair clipping.  </li>
            <li>better then the reviews say it is, best shaver i ever had so far</li>
            <li>Its sleek and felt good in the hand, has good power and cleared a path real well.  </li>
            <li>at first glance seems like a great product until you use it.</li>
            <li>Since it has a Li ion battery, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>The design is also quite ergonomic and very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very precisely.</li>
            <li>The plastic case it is very cheap.</li>
            <li>Easy (can be used corded or not) and effective.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking, and operate easily.</li>
            <li>I realize that most men have nice silky hair that buzzes really easy and for that</li>
            <li>Very fast , is simply amazing speed !</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Power is ok.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave my head in minutes without any difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have been better served to have just thrown my money in the trash.</li>
            <li>better off with philips multigroom machine&lt;</li>
            <li>In order to finish my hair cut , my wife had to stop more then 50 times</li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>Growing a beard takes a lot more attention than just shaving off all of the hair off of the face.  </li>
            <li>These blades seem more geared toward longer hair shaping and grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more like a toy than a hair clipper, there is no comparison between this toy and the WAHL.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a gimmick in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They also fit nicely into your hand.</li>
            <li>We used these on my husband&#x27;s hair and beard and the results were not that satisfying.</li>
            <li>The guides are quite accurate and my husband is able to confidently do his own hair if I&#x27;m not around to assist.</li>
            <li>love the lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li>With so many settings for hair length</li>
            <li>Ok clipper, except the adjustable comb.</li>
            <li>love that there is no need for lubricant at all.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity and performance of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>would love it.</li>
            <li>This one has wider blade which is way better for me because my trimming takes shorter nowitIts baterry is better than the one i had.</li>
            <li>think i need many time to practice.</li>
            <li>I was also able to remove my winter beard with this with the attachment removed.</li>
            <li>im so glad with my purchase ))</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a veteran, and have been giving myself military-reg fades for 10 years, and these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>i love this hair clipper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and all many adjustments with one turn</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Still can cut hair ok</li>
            <li>This has an OK feel and heft to it, but not like the Remington HC5550 (which I returned)</li>
            <li>love it&lt;</li>
            <li>Of the three different razors I&#x27;ve tried, the remington was the best.</li>
            <li>use it mostly for grooming.</li>
            <li>Mostly touch up stuff in between haircuts.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Performance vice top notch.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s always used clippers either from Remington or Wahl and has been pleased with the results, even when using a cheapie set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Sure you won&#x27;t have a lot of clips to manage with this clipper</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;Tthe clipper works OK.</li>
            <li>I believe the turbo boost will save more time for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Users may accidentally change the length by touching the dial/wheel.</li>
            <li>Its an all in one gadget that you will get to love over the years.  </li>
            <li>It works ok...</li>
            <li>I love the concept of all the pieces in one machine, but it just didn&#x27;t work like we had hoped.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>I have been using hair clippers for many years.</li>
            <li>I love how minutely adjustable it is.  </li>
            <li>I love the cordless design, makes the bi-weekly clipping a breeze.  </li>
            <li>First review: The design looks great and works fine.</li>
            <li>Nice clean cut and the adjustable clip is better than adding and removing attachments.  </li>
            <li>This clipper has a very unique design with just one attachment.</li>
            <li>high quality, great price,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I was so satisfied and super happy with it that I decided to write a review , right after I used it on my 3 sons.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Pros - Nice Design, Grip. Easy &amp; Comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than the Wahl, and so more pleasant for me, the designated clipper.</li>
            <li>Shave my head on 3 every week and cuts very clean</li>
            <li>I see this product got pretty good reviews, so the one thing I have concluded is</li>
            <li>Nice concept, but the blade does not cut anywhere near as good as my plugin Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure this will work fine.</li>
            <li>I have some really fine hair on top of my head</li>
            <li>These clippers are a great price and have worked perfectly so far.</li>
            <li>So far its great.</li>
            <li>Good product, very well make .</li>
            <li>Its well built, sturdy, good for those who like to get things done fast and well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean and cuts hair too!</li>
            <li>And what is especially great about this clipper is that the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; does NOT slip when I use it, like I&#x27;ve had problems with all other hair clippers.</li>
            <li>This one is just as great but actually a little superior, buy it.</li>
            <li>Product very good work quietly and precisely.</li>
            <li>Easily 10-12 years every three weeks or so.</li>
            <li>star for easy installation&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>star for easy cleaning</li>
            <li>Attachment is easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use with the comb packed in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The guard is easily removed for close trims and edge work and the blade is easily removed for thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very quick although traveling and APO 15 days to Afghanistan.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its easy to hold and use</li>
            <li>to resemble and easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It turned out that the adjustable proximity knob is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love all but can&#x27;t water clean...</li>
            <li>It is so easy to adjust on the go and way eaiser than changing guides.&lt;br /&gt;+Clean cut, not pulls, sharpe blades.&lt;br /&gt;+Comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;+Solid build;</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any issues with the guard preventing me from getting where I need to go, and the guard easily pulls out for detail areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>So if the battery runs out you can easily plug the unit and continue with the hair cut.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Excellent Clipper, simple and powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sturdy but easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to find the number for the length that I would like to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper is cordless, which makes it easy to use anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>but you can easily pop it off and it clears itself then re-attach.</li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon for such a great service and amazon prime customer coverage, returned it - now looking for a good working model.</li>
            <li>The first time I cut my own hairï¼Œfailedã€‚need someone to help me</li>
            <li>He has a close cropped hair cut, super easy to just run over with some clippers and be done with, but these took forever to make sure the hair was cut evenly.</li>
            <li>Units performs quickly and is easy to use with many adjustable levels.  </li>
            <li>Well, I figured I was fine since I had used dial clippers before without issue.</li>
            <li>Rest everything is fine.</li>
            <li>The blades are too fine and too close together which ends up pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>used twice--works fine.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>In a week it looks fine.</li>
            <li>It performs better with the cord in terms of power, but is adequate working cordless.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>The design is ergonomic and comfortable to manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great set of clippers.</li>
            <li>They work great and are what I would suggest for clippers that will last years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean when done.</li>
            <li>star because the clippers were a success while they were working, plus 1 more star because Norelco is honoring the 2-year warranty by sending a replacement unit.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling since its charger adjust itself to different grid voltages; US or Europe.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hair clipper.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I am very irritated that I can no longer return it, having passed that return date.</li>
            <li>The attachment itself is cheap plastic</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really fantastic</li>
            <li>Smooth and comfort.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>But overall a great looking product that gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>What you&#x27;d expect out of a cheap razor.  </li>
            <li>You can see light patches of hairs that are longer than others.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Trim smoothly.</li>
            <li>Easy to Clean</li>
            <li>Great clipper, I keep my hair cut close since, having a cochlear implant last year.</li>
            <li>light weight</li>
            <li>I invested a lot of time looking through trimmers, and a fair amount of money on this one, and it has resulted in a complete disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;DO</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>most is that it is much quieter than most electric razors.</li>
            <li>so far so good its a well meant product.</li>
            <li>This cordless Norelco with Lithium Ion battery holds a charge that is effective to get both of them clipped and not to worry about the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  mobility,  decent charge, comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>With cheap clippers I always had to take out the screws and clean them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The level of charge and the runtime are great with Lithium-ion, I&#x27;m still on my first charge after running it all week for my modest shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I find that one pass is all it takes to make a smooth, clean cut.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in a foreign country to buy things, very excited, very good stuff , with the likes of&lt;br /&gt;ç¬¬ä¸€æ¬¡åœ¨å›½å¤–æ·˜ä¸œè¥¿ï¼Œå¾ˆä¾¿å®œï¼Œå¾ˆå–œæ¬¢ï¼Œå°½ç®¡å›½å†…æœ‰ï¼Œä½†å”®ä»·é«˜ã€‚å“ˆå“ˆï¼Œåœ¨è¿™é‡Œç§€ä¸€æ¬¡ä¸­æ–‡....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep em around since they&#x27;re really portable and could come in handy for a quick trim in a pinch</li>
            <li>I am liking this more than I thought I would, and it is turning out to be my go to trimmer because its just so easy to use being cordless and always ready in the drawer.</li>
            <li>you are used to Osters or even cheapy Wahl clippers, you&#x27;re not going to be too excited about these.</li>
            <li>Took significantly longer to cut hair than with corded clippers.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s much easier to use, much more effective, simpler, and modern.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and battery holds a good charge where you can possible trim a full head of hair 3 times.</li>
            <li>and so far so good, it is working great without any need to do any maintenance or blade adjustments as I always have to do on my other clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t enough for a good smooth even cut.  </li>
            <li>Cuts clean.</li>
            <li>Cuts clean.</li>
            <li>It cut through the hair quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The hair gets stuck infront of the blades causing you to clean it out every 1/2 of a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li>Clippers should be easy to use, cut well and have the right sizes.</li>
            <li>Powerful and cuts super close if you use it with out the guide covers!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The storage case is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to use an older clipper to salvage my hair cut.</li>
            <li>Works great the only issue a little bulky, great price.</li>
            <li>Their all in one multi-groom beard trimmer, however, which I bought alongside this, was a great deal - its just a pity</li>
            <li>I purchased a different Philips hair clipper about 4 years ago that I absolutely loved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is quite good lasting me almost 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is just something that sounded cool during design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seems like a sweet</li>
            <li>not as powerful as any corded clipper, a corded clipper feels like a light saber the way it cuts hair.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>These clippers fit the bill for most people and I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the overall quality of the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a lithium ion battery that lasts up to 120 minutes on a full charge.  </li>
            <li>The product looks good but in comparison to when my barber clips my goatee; it falls short.  </li>
            <li>Product that  give full exp for the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it gave a fair haircut but took longer because of what I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a really good machine.</li>
            <li>I used them for a second cut on my sons and myself in an attempt to be fair to the product.</li>
            <li>It is true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>For the past 17 years my husband has been clipping his own hair so he&#x27;s gone through his fair share of hair clippers in that time.</li>
            <li>First the good: the battery charges relatively quickly (a matter of a couple hours) and lasts multiple trims, and the height adjustments are about as easy as they could be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, yet light weight and has lots of length settings built right in.  </li>
            <li>This one helps me trim my beard, mush, cut my own hair, something which I&#x27;m quite happy to do myself, I feel liberated, I know that sounds strange but this simple act is both gratifying and makes you feel self sufficient.  </li>
            <li>super, i use it every day.</li>
            <li>Quickly transportation.</li>
            <li>The guard is easy to remove to clean - just pull straight up and it pops out of the channels it locks into.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, nothing about it really impressed me but it is a solid hair clipper.</li>
            <li>The unit charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick Charge&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic... it works fanatastic... and very user friendly</li>
            <li>Be forewarned: it goes from incredibly close to extremely close to very close.</li>
            <li>I thought that this even that it was not a professional clipper it was a good one.</li>
            <li>I use it to trim my beard and the &amp;#34;adjustable wheel&amp;#34; length setter moves easily and is large.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s charging fast, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great machine, works perfectly, it takes up very little space and it comes with a hard plastic case.</li>
            <li>I have no way of knowing how well it will hold up over the long haul (I&#x27;ve been using a corded Wahl clipper for many years that is built like a tank), but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Charge seems to be able to last for 2 haircuts before recharging which is fine for my use.  </li>
            <li>And I really like the smooth points on the blades for gliding over the skin.</li>
            <li>since I cut my own short hair, I don&#x27;t need more) and the built in length dial with clearly marked length numbers (up to 23?)</li>
            <li>For my short, curly hair, the speed and power are effective.</li>
            <li>So far I love the adjustability.</li>
            <li>If the cordless feature is something that could be useful to you, then this might be a product worth trying.</li>
            <li>Clipper cuts perfectly without leaving antennas behind.</li>
            <li>The comb attachment is easy to dump hair out of, no need to remove it and bang it on the trash can, another improvement over older models.</li>
            <li>really fun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many different clippers in 50+ years of cutting my own hair and these are the best.</li>
            <li>Like the product worth the price</li>
            <li>I cut my hair myself most of the time with a professional Andis clipper so that is what I am comparing it to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have adjustable length setting right on the handle and not have to change to different blades.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of hair clippers, from Phillips to Corsair, and this Norelco is better than most hair clippers, but it&#x27;s not as versatile as some of their other offerings.</li>
            <li>This is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars is not as easy to glide through the hair and see what you are doing than a normal hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very nice if you have forgotten to charge them and they die half way through shaving your head!</li>
            <li>it is a gap in plastic attachment right</li>
            <li>I was stressed finding the right one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m smart enough to know that these are the best types of clippers on the market, also smart enough to tweak and fix things.</li>
            <li>Trimmed my face first and that was really fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>This clipper is also much easier to clean than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the guard is easy to clear and doesn&#x27;t jam up with hair in tiny crevices, hair doesn&#x27;t seem to want to fall out on its own.</li>
            <li>It is good for quick trims or little adjustments, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to change the setting, while you are clipping, without having to substitute a different size guard to get a shorter clip around ears, etc.</li>
            <li>Best part of all--no need to mess with a ton of different guards to get the right length.</li>
            <li>The Phillips would work great for grooming a child (or maybe even a small animal).  </li>
            <li>Works great when fully charged... usually 2-3 uses to buzz my head...</li>
            <li>The bare blade also shaves skin-close, making it even better as a fade trimmer.</li>
            <li>It makes this thing readily accessible at pretty much any time without having to worry about charging it.</li>
            <li>A dial on the back allows for very fine adjustment of the length.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little static electricity at play, yes, but without going into detail let me assure you this is more a design flaw than static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had many different ones in the past and so far this is the best one I&#x27;ve had I recommend this product</li>
            <li>very sharp, good quality.</li>
            <li>Despite some negative reviews, I purchased this on sale and have so far been impressed with it.</li>
            <li>Returning and going back to good old Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to open and clean during and after haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charging is super fast</li>
            <li>so I am not new to trimming my own hair.</li>
            <li>The battery is outstanding at how quickly it charges and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>but i think that is why it is not so good in tight places.</li>
            <li>Delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the adjustable guard, but I actually like it.</li>
            <li>as long as you don&#x27;t actually need to cut hair with it its great.</li>
            <li>Adjustability is intuitive if you start with higher level and adjust.</li>
            <li>most likely stay with the Wahl clippers for hair cuts, and the Wahl trimmers for closer trimming of beards and mustaches.  </li>
            <li>This is the first cordless clipper that performs like a corded variety.</li>
            <li>Our most recent brand of hair clippers is a Wahl 79300-400.  </li>
            <li>The guard length settings on the dial are listed in mm from 1mm - 23mm (3/64&amp;#34; - 7/8&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I can set the length with a number on the dial, and be assured the length will be consistent every time I use it.</li>
            <li>but they shouldn&#x27;t be your first choice.</li>
            <li>Works great long and short.</li>
            <li>pretty short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many different Wahl brand hair clippers over a span of about 10 years.</li>
            <li>It doesnt bother me, but they should have just removed it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the remington I bought from walmart much better, but the guard was lost, so I was trying something different.  </li>
            <li>wheel to adjust the length was a bit grabby at first</li>
            <li>The first thing he noticed was his fully charged clipper lacked power.  </li>
            <li>So this review is more for a person looking for hair clippers for very short or no hair.  </li>
            <li>the blades are actually are most of the time.</li>
            <li>Hold the end rather than the middle part, because you may twist the dial/wheel and cut more hair.</li>
            <li>Would gladly return this product if I had only kept the box!!!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I made sure the clippers were plugged in to charge for a while prior to the haircuts.</li>
            <li>it gave me uneven cut and the power is not that good as it advertised</li>
            <li>Since Philips has a good name in home appliances, I decided to buy the Norelco 7100 after a few research on Internet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not half as good as my mom, but I still enjoy this little helper a lot.</li>
            <li>Although the cleaning sets you back a bit more than other clippers, i love the cut on this one and find the benefit of having a cleaner cut outweighing the fact that i have to clean it ore often.</li>
            <li>Positive: fast delivery, easy to use, does not need many attachments, competitively prized from other leading brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy ,it&#x27;s good,but the length I control is limited</li>
            <li>The blades are quite sharp and it&#x27;s nice to grip.</li>
            <li>The points on the metal are sharp, and kind of scratch and dig into my skin.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s old haircut without significant loss of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then again: it&#x27;s easier to please someone with a new sharp tool, if that someone had been using very old trimmer for over 10 years lol</li>
            <li>If you are just cutting your own hair, i do not think Turbo is  needed, however, for 5 more dollars to get strong power, I would not hesitate to invest it.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference to not have a cord in the way, tangling up, and to be able to use it outside away from a power source if I wanted.</li>
            <li>potential.&lt;br /&gt;The titanium blades should keep their edge longer but will only be as good as thier initial sharpening when manufactured.</li>
            <li>I have other Norelco trimmers (beard) and the claim of maintenance free is pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>This usually means to attach an extension cord to be able to use it in a space that is easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it gets the job done for what it is unless you have steel wool or kryptonian hair,  plus you&#x27;re pretty much have all the clips at your disposal.</li>
            <li>Looking good and small noisy.</li>
            <li>it cuts really good when the hair comb is adjusted to small sizes.</li>
            <li>Very Sharp, easy to go through hair, but the size adjustment isnt that smooth.</li>
            <li>I like how simple and easy to adjust comb settings without taking it out.</li>
            <li>The adjustable guide on it is a big bonus and it is easy to remove when you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, powerful, and one charge goes a long way.</li>
            <li>clippers feel like they are of good quality and the charge does seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Large cutter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a lot about this cutter to like, but the cons are large.</li>
            <li>They are smart to work on improving and doing well with the adjustable head on this elevated product.</li>
            <li>I previously owned the Panasonic rechargeable hair clipper and this one is far superior.</li>
            <li>pro: quiet, easy to handle, ergonomic and robust touch, fast charge</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Does a good job in cutting hair close to the skin and is easy to adjust to the right length for beard trimming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, easy to use, feels fine in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery charges fast and holds charge sufficiently for my needs.</li>
            <li>I expected much better than this from Norelco.</li>
            <li>And the turbo button , you can really see a difference when using it.</li>
            <li>Really like the Norelco brand for hair clippers.</li>
            <li>They need to add the blades extension because with the plastic extension you can not cut the low hair comfortably.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very goor tool, does its job very well</li>
            <li>Have use it three times and it performed very well.  </li>
            <li>Does not cut hair, very week</li>
            <li>really did not see a need to use the turbo on the clippers.  </li>
            <li>you can really get the haircut you want.</li>
            <li>Very practical, and it&#x27;s dual voltage, so you can use it anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s modern and sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast cut</li>
            <li>It is also very convenient.</li>
            <li>,  fast charging.  </li>
            <li>really given these some time to see if it was just me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d grab them if you need a portable kit that doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li>Charging cord could be much longer to make it somewhat functional as a corded clipper, should have made it USB</li>
            <li>-11-17&lt;br /&gt;Finally died after 2 years, signs of it dying are the lack of low battery orange light, it will just continue to work until it shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I use it to trim beard and moustache, it works really well.</li>
            <li>They work well and are priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>This one is ready to go, no oiling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really want this product will come out permanently.</li>
            <li>I use it to buzz my head and my beard and it works really really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>But still worth it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to wash the blades and it has a two hours of usage after charging it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for this type of product.</li>
            <li>Also, the dial to select the guard depth seems really</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this item</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need a whole bunch of combs.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than the corded Whal</li>
            <li>we bought cuts so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>I have own a few others Philips clipper/trimmer products.</li>
            <li>I am going back to the old one until I find a more reliable battery operated clipper.</li>
            <li>It might be good but not if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li>The adjustment is very easy and does not change accidentally like one I used previously.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a dire problem, just one that the user must be aware of, and correct by slowing down a bit to make sure the blade guard rests squarely on your scalp.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp which is the only good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that only uses one comb for all settings makes it unique.</li>
            <li>and this one holds its charge better than the other cordless brand I used.  </li>
            <li>I think the Phillips rates up with the Conair cutters, although I have a little cordless Conair beard trimmer that has remarkable battery and blade life and remains the standard for me.</li>
            <li>It cut hair but got so bound up with the hair that you had to stop every second to clean it out.</li>
            <li>It cuts really short and clean.  </li>
            <li>The battery doesnt hold that long of a charge, so cordless is not an available feature for me.</li>
            <li>though not nearly as well as my cheap corded Wahl clippers.  </li>
            <li>It safes me tons of time just doing the whole proces with these clippers and normal ones.</li>
            <li>and I used the Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable for travel, but good luck trying to do a decent fade with that or maintaining a slightly longer haircut.  </li>
            <li>Not near as good as other clippers out there.  </li>
            <li>You have to clean it very often when trimming long hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Was pleased to see it came in an attractive hard case, an improvement, so I thought over the small Conair bag full of loose components.</li>
            <li>This new &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; functions very well and is what I was looking for to to replace my older Norelco &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34;. .</li>
            <li>Dealing with a cable is better than dealing with lack of power and odd ergonomics.</li>
            <li>My previous one worked more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>My last model was smaller and more of a beard/hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Super simple!</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve seen in stores, it is slightly larger than many currently offered.  </li>
            <li>Their updated version seems to have some problems the older model didn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li>But for what it&#x27;s work it gives a decent cut.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t quite get the same shave as a powerful corded one, but really does a heck of a job</li>
            <li>Quick, simple and convenient.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this  trimmer and would definitely give it as a present to anyone who uses a trimmer knowing they too</li>
            <li>Philips delivers high quality grooming products and at 34.95 this is a product you will use for years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The dial is adjustable in a small area on top and a super large area on back.</li>
            <li>With the ability to adjust cutting length, I am able to shape and trim my beard very easily.  </li>
            <li>He keeps his beard very short and this clipper, though a little large, is easy enough, and certainly handy enough, that he always manages to look well-groomed.</li>
            <li>It does not work so well for beards and it does not work around the ears of my young boy but the fast speed helped to not pull on hair.</li>
            <li>Fast charging, noise is not that loud.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts more than long enough.</li>
            <li>Also, try cutting a length longer than what you need to begin with; it&#x27;s good to test the length before you do the full cut.</li>
            <li>She has beauty license in Taiwan yet she only cut family member&#x27;s hair for fun (and to save money).</li>
            <li>There is something with the comb design that just does not seem to fit well when trying to groom areas that are not smooth consistent surfaces.  </li>
            <li>Did not like this - Did not cut well or as evenly as a normal size plug in clipper.</li>
            <li>I have tried several times and it doesn&#x27;t work.i have better luck using my Norelco beard trimmer but is to small to use for my hair.i have been using several corded trimmers for many years</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to go over several times to get that even fresh look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how cost effective that is, but at least there is that option.  </li>
            <li>If you want it to run as any clippers normally would, you would just set to &amp;#34;turbo.&amp;#34; There is one thing however.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s from the dead :)  </li>
            <li>Sharp, a little noise, but better than my old one, and package is very cool.</li>
            <li>This will be my main all around travel/home clipper as it has easy maintenance and way less</li>
            <li>My 8 year old Wahl is better then this, half these size, and twice the power even with &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; turned on.</li>
            <li>easy to use for cutting your own hair</li>
            <li>It is not very obvious but right under the power button there is a button with the letter &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and you can press it after you turn the clipper on to boost the power.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a long time and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The clippers did not pull and yank my hair as I have had other cheap clippers do.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, contoured shape, sharp blades and lots of power.</li>
            <li>and I received a brand new clipper.</li>
            <li>The new cordless (Conair 22 Piece Cord/</li>
            <li>I found out quickly that the blade must be held absolutely flat against your head, or else it digs in a bit too far or misses areas.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold, well balanced, powerful enough to cut through with bogging down and</li>
            <li>The only two things I would improve about it is the carrying case (pretty flimsy and overly big) and at least make it water resistant to be able to clean it after uses.</li>
            <li>After using for a month and looking bad I&#x27;ve figured it out and now cut my own hair better than who I had been going too</li>
            <li>only real downfall with this clipper is that is just did not do very well on surfaces where the contours are changing like with manscaping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not powerful enough for professional use, but it&#x27;s certainly good enough for use at home.</li>
            <li>is right where I naturally hold the clippers, so as I am cutting its very easy to accidentally change lengths..which isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li>You can pass over the same spot over and over again and it will randomly cut more and more hair.</li>
            <li>I should have sent it back after the first use.</li>
            <li>I only use electric hair trimmers to shave my face or to give myself a crew-cut during the hot months.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Would have been better if this distance was similar to other levelers.</li>
            <li>No more looking for the correct size with the all in one fitting.</li>
            <li>This one goes to SOooooo many levels that if you were to buy ordinary clippers you would get like 20 pieces.</li>
            <li>I also feel that the clip &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; better than conventional clips because it has better support against your head as the main length of the clipper is behind the comb.  </li>
            <li>You do have to go over the same spot several times to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>others have mentioned, the case is flimsy plastic with a cheap cardboard insert and too large for the trimmer and accessories, which includes the charging cord and adaptor, and a small cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>you see that this trimmer is not only cordless, oiless, the blades detach for easy cleaning and it has a single attachment that adjusts it all</li>
            <li>At this low price point I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations, but surely with such light use the clippers should last at least a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for turbo boost, I have not needed it because the hair I cut is not very thick.  </li>
            <li>the positive side for these clippers, they are fairly quiet and the unit is handheld.</li>
            <li>We enjoy the freedom of not having to mess with a cord while trying to groom.</li>
            <li>The brush broke at first use!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s larger than most clipper, at least to my expectation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it holds a charge more than long enough to trim the scruff off my head, and my head is freakishly big.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through way to many pairs of clippers to count and the biggest annoyance is the mess of attachments and cord you have to deal with cramming back into the case each time you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb does not work well for the shorter lengths because the front projection remains the same size (large).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only flaw that I&#x27;ve found so far after several uses is that my hair constantly clogs the guard quite easily.</li>
            <li>While it gives a good clean cut on the top and sides of the head, getting behind the ears is very difficult.</li>
            <li>If you had used other measurements in the past you may have to experiment to learn what length is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; is more of a plastic sales container.</li>
            <li>When I purchased it roughly two months ago, I cut my own hair and it cut incredibly short and uneven, and I immediately ran to a professional barber to have it fixed the day before a large graduation ceremony bear in mind.</li>
            <li>And I always had to clean the clippers half way doing their hair, cleaning the clippers of their clogged up hair.</li>
            <li>clear why its not listed when search for philips haircut products</li>
            <li>Used only once but much lighter and easier to maneuver than my old corded model.</li>
            <li>My husbands hair is kept short and these clippers leave very blotchy patches of hair as well as needing cleaned frequently during a trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts cleanly and the coated blades pull a lot less than the old style ones.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t cut your hair unless comb is clear</li>
            <li>It also only runs 1/2 as fast as my 6 year-old Remington adjustable clippers, and that&#x27;s when this is in &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a soft case for storing this unit over the box it came in.</li>
            <li>Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]].</li>
            <li>(Like drills of old.)</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>hair adjustment is fast and simple.</li>
            <li>Used one time so far.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very quiet and very efficient.</li>
            <li>my wife cuts like a professional stylist and it&#x27;s quicker and easier to get a trim on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far no cons.</li>
            <li>, very said, used only 3 times.</li>
            <li>no where near close to pro cutters.</li>
            <li>in all, I am staying with my old trusty beard trimmer, also for trimming may hair.</li>
            <li>Does a professional job.</li>
            <li>None so far.</li>
            <li>they seem to last a really long time on a full charge.</li>
            <li>gets stuck to everything, especially if you oil your blades as often as you should and ultimately it&#x27;s just kind of a messy pain.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>it is not as easy to glide through the hair as a normal hair clipper, because of the guard it is hard to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers rated this unit with lower stars, because the comb was a bit wide and they weren&#x27;t able to use it to trim other areas.  </li>
            <li>Yet less than 3 months after purchase, the clippers take a full charge but refuse to power on at all.</li>
            <li>Most you can do is a high and tight haircut or crew cut due to the lack of settings on clippers.</li>
            <li>Even with the turbo they dont seem to go fast enough or maybe they&#x27;re just not sharp</li>
            <li>The one adjustable attachment is easily removable for fine sideburn cutting.</li>
            <li>There were some stragglers in my hair that did not seem to get cut, but overall it did a decent job.  </li>
            <li>The problem with this model is the guard flexes a bit when you press it on your head, because it adjusts by simply raising higher above the shaver head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the main con is that the guard doesnâ€™t get close enough to even cut hair at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Norelco 7100 hair clipper for Men who use clippers on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Well if I grew out my hair there&#x27;s a high chance I would bring back the 70&#x27;s fro</li>
            <li>It seems as if the trimmer normally runs at only 80% power which conserves battery energy, then when switched to Turbo</li>
            <li>The guard is also fairly short and without long teeth to lift hair up before it reaches the blade you may need to go over the hair several times to lift out hair that may not be showing its full length.</li>
            <li>The angle was very different than a normal clipper.</li>
            <li>This clipper is so much slower and less accurate than my previously clippers (12 yr old Wahl corded).  </li>
            <li>This is perhaps my least satisfied purchase to date from Amazon and a total miss-sell on the part of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>This product is better suited for cutting hair not beard trimming (unless you have a big full beard).</li>
            <li>but you also won&#x27;t have consistent results so the single adjusable clip is essentially a fail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just plain does not trim well, gets backed up quickly and</li>
            <li>case sucks, so that docks a star, but otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>but without it the case was just a large empty box where the contents would just bang around.</li>
            <li>You have to remove the guard, clear the hair and snap it back on after every cut.</li>
            <li>It takes me twice as long to cut my hair because it misses half of the hair on each pass, and I also need to clean out the clipper head between every pass (on the Wahl</li>
            <li>This clipper is similar in size to my old one, which we used for 15+ years on my husband&#x27;s hair and beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once so far and have used it three times.</li>
            <li>but I developed an alternate way to select</li>
            <li>Norelco offers a 45-day money back guarantee on the trimmer</li>
            <li>My wife who was cutting my hair loved the fact she did not have to keep changing combs on the clipper when going from the sides to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I had been using a clipper set by Wahl for the past 15 years, but hoped a low-maintenance, cordless model with new technology would have made the process a little quicker and better, especially with the young boys.</li>
            <li>The one piece plastic guard that covers the entire shaver makes it difficult to get into the crevices of one&#x27;s face, and so I can&#x27;t make as precise a trim to my beard as I can with other clippers that have more open designs.</li>
            <li>and I have to detach the dead, clean it, place it back several times during one hair trimming, and sometime it even does not work when I do so</li>
            <li>The blade itself is in a small housing that can be removed by pushing from the back, allowing you to clean inside (and it will need it).</li>
            <li>instructions come in English and Spanish, and at least the English instructions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does clog much easier than any other hair clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>cause you might accidently turn it off, but other then that very close shave without the guards.</li>
            <li>At 2mm or 1mm, you can easily inadvertently press it down to less.</li>
            <li>back to my old set of wired, traditional clippers.</li>
            <li>But this was the only battery powered clipper I could find that had an overall length setting near 1 inch.  </li>
            <li>Down side of this product is comb, Product have 1 to 23 setting which is good for cutting hair but the way the comb make is kind of wied for first time user, You will have to adjust or change your hair cutting technique becasue comb</li>
            <li>Got these clippers for my husband to keep his very short hair trimmed---really, these clippers barely had to do any work at all!</li>
            <li>Guard is easy and nice, but if you are cutting close, have to watch for the pieces to move apart and not push them down to hard on curves or you will cut your hair too short(my eybrows, haha.)  </li>
            <li>It butchered my hair once again and proved just to be a completely flawed machine in terms of easily trimming consistent levels of hair even when locked at the same technical length; it just doesn&#x27;t cut consistently as a standard trimmer would, simply because of the design of the adjustable comb.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it but the large plastic guard makes it hard to shave accurately and impossible under the nose.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair very smoothly/effectively, and the charge last a long long time.</li>
            <li>works well, cuts well, expect some noise from it especially when using the turbo speed, tho overall not as loud, but not quiet either.</li>
            <li>Unlike my old, bulky hair clipper with tons of changeable heads, this clipper only needs two, so easy and less messy!</li>
            <li>Logistics is very fast, a few days time to Chinese.</li>
            <li>Since it is quite powerful and sturdy it takes me way less than half the time it took me with my old one.</li>

            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> After my wife ran the clippers through my hair, I received a fairly even cut.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing this since the 90&#x27;s, so I have used my fair share of clippers.</li>
            <li> I would without a doubt recommend, we bought 2 of them because there that good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good multipurpose clipper, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not so good for trimming beard.</li>
            <li> Good bye attachments.</li>
            <li> Good product, to solve my problem</li>
            <li> Clippers are comfortable to hold and cut excellent without the guard on...</li>
            <li> Not even a good hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> good quality!&lt;br</li>
            <li> my family like it.it feel good.</li>
            <li> The blades seem good and are removable for washing.</li>
            <li> good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> good product .easy&#x27;to</li>
            <li> So this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Just started using - seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> good price ï¼Œnice hair cliper</li>
            <li> Everything about it sounded good.  </li>
            <li> It was cordless, had an adjustible length guard and seemed like an over all good match for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seconds into using the clipper</li>
            <li> my husband determined that it wasn&#x27;t as good as it seemed.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> but it good</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> Packaging and machine state is really good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Norelco is well known for its good shavers and the Lithium-ion cordless hair clipper is no exception.  </li>
            <li> so you must keep going over and over to get a good even look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I loved the design, simplifying all those clipper guards that always get lost and are a pain to change.</li>
            <li> The built in comb doesn&#x27;t do a good job of lifting the hair, so hair is missed.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, not the best but gives a good trim.</li>
            <li> 1 more star because I&#x27;m so happy with</li>

            <li> bought this for my husband, he is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> While we have been pleased with the Wahl brand clippers, the capability to go cordless with the Philips Norelco HC7452/41 7100 hair clippers was an attractive</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with these clippers.</li>

            <li> Amazing battery upto 2 hours in a charge of 1 hour.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing.</li>
            <li> its amazing experience</li>
            <li> had read a review where someone said this caused it to change on its own as you used it.</li>
            <li> The selectable height is nice</li>
            <li> it is nice not worrying about loosing all of the combs that set the height.</li>
            <li> Nicely done.</li>
            <li> It is nicely designed but it just does not cut hair evenly even on turbo.</li>
            <li> nice battery life&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quieter; a nice plus.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my mom and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> I really like the cordless aspect and am impressed by the battery.</li>

            <li> mo2HOE2LU3A25HQ]]The Philips Norelco 7100 Hair Clipper is a highly effective grooming tool.  </li>

            <li> Nice feel in my hand</li>
            <li> when 1st time using it, I got nice haircut by my self.</li>
            <li> It comes in a handy plastic carrying case with a charging cord, brush for cleaning, and a hair combing attachment.</li>
            <li> You can kind of see where the blades rest in relation to the guides and where you use the dial to click set</li>
            <li> That said I liked the performance of this Phillips cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I very much liked this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold,  and very nice looking design.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> In particular, A / s are points that I want Is not progress five years best advantage.</li>
            <li> light and cordless, easy to maneuver, very good for travel</li>
            <li> This trimmer has good battery life, nice ergonomics, and an easy height adjustment.</li>
            <li> Did not read the instructions, very easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product,and at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I think is a wonderful machine; easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The way u can change the size is amazingly nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Even for a person who never cut own hair before (myself), i was able to do &amp;#34;2 block hair style&amp;#34; without difficuty.</li>
            <li> If you are over 80 years old, you might think it&#x27;s wonderful -</li>
            <li> honestly liked my wahl better because even on turbo</li>
            <li> It is super nice!</li>
            <li> very nice, and my wife use it on me for fun.</li>
            <li> Very good, is strong, the only fly in the ointment is that the fuselage can&#x27;t wash</li>
            <li> Therefore, this product is probably best for touch ups and light jobs rather than intense hair clipping.  </li>
            <li> better then the reviews say it is, best shaver i ever had so far</li>
            <li> Its sleek and felt good in the hand, has good power and cleared a path real well.  </li>
            <li> at first glance seems like a great product until you use it.</li>
            <li> Since it has a Li ion battery, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> The design is also quite ergonomic and very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very precisely.</li>
            <li> The plastic case it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Easy (can be used corded or not) and effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice looking, and operate easily.</li>
            <li> I realize that most men have nice silky hair that buzzes really easy and for that</li>
            <li> Very fast , is simply amazing speed !</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Power is ok.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave my head in minutes without any difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have been better served to have just thrown my money in the trash.</li>
            <li> better off with philips multigroom machine&lt;</li>
            <li> In order to finish my hair cut , my wife had to stop more then 50 times</li>
            <li> and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> Growing a beard takes a lot more attention than just shaving off all of the hair off of the face.  </li>
            <li> These blades seem more geared toward longer hair shaping and grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more like a toy than a hair clipper, there is no comparison between this toy and the WAHL.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a gimmick in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They also fit nicely into your hand.</li>
            <li> We used these on my husband&#x27;s hair and beard and the results were not that satisfying.</li>
            <li> The guides are quite accurate and my husband is able to confidently do his own hair if I&#x27;m not around to assist.</li>
            <li> love the lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li> With so many settings for hair length</li>
            <li> Ok clipper, except the adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> love that there is no need for lubricant at all.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity and performance of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> would love it.</li>
            <li> This one has wider blade which is way better for me because my trimming takes shorter nowitIts baterry is better than the one i had.</li>
            <li> think i need many time to practice.</li>
            <li> I was also able to remove my winter beard with this with the attachment removed.</li>
            <li> im so glad with my purchase ))</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a veteran, and have been giving myself military-reg fades for 10 years, and these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i love this hair clipper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and all many adjustments with one turn</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Still can cut hair ok</li>
            <li> This has an OK feel and heft to it, but not like the Remington HC5550 (which I returned)</li>
            <li> love it&lt;</li>
            <li> Of the three different razors I&#x27;ve tried, the remington was the best.</li>
            <li> use it mostly for grooming.</li>
            <li> Mostly touch up stuff in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Performance vice top notch.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s always used clippers either from Remington or Wahl and has been pleased with the results, even when using a cheapie set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> Sure you won&#x27;t have a lot of clips to manage with this clipper</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;Tthe clipper works OK.</li>
            <li> I believe the turbo boost will save more time for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Users may accidentally change the length by touching the dial/wheel.</li>
            <li> Its an all in one gadget that you will get to love over the years.  </li>
            <li> It works ok...</li>
            <li> I love the concept of all the pieces in one machine, but it just didn&#x27;t work like we had hoped.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair clippers for many years.</li>
            <li> I love how minutely adjustable it is.  </li>
            <li> I love the cordless design, makes the bi-weekly clipping a breeze.  </li>
            <li> First review: The design looks great and works fine.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut and the adjustable clip is better than adding and removing attachments.  </li>
            <li> This clipper has a very unique design with just one attachment.</li>
            <li> high quality, great price,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I was so satisfied and super happy with it that I decided to write a review , right after I used it on my 3 sons.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Pros - Nice Design, Grip. Easy &amp; Comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than the Wahl, and so more pleasant for me, the designated clipper.</li>
            <li> Shave my head on 3 every week and cuts very clean</li>
            <li> I see this product got pretty good reviews, so the one thing I have concluded is</li>
            <li> Nice concept, but the blade does not cut anywhere near as good as my plugin Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure this will work fine.</li>
            <li> I have some really fine hair on top of my head</li>

            <li> This one is just as great but actually a little superior, buy it.</li>

            <li> It is so easy to adjust on the go and way eaiser than changing guides.&lt;br /&gt;+Clean cut, not pulls, sharpe blades.&lt;br /&gt;+Comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;+Solid build;</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any issues with the guard preventing me from getting where I need to go, and the guard easily pulls out for detail areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> So if the battery runs out you can easily plug the unit and continue with the hair cut.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent Clipper, simple and powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sturdy but easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I found it easy to find the number for the length that I would like to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper is cordless, which makes it easy to use anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> but you can easily pop it off and it clears itself then re-attach.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon for such a great service and amazon prime customer coverage, returned it - now looking for a good working model.</li>
            <li> The first time I cut my own hairï¼Œfailedã€‚need someone to help me</li>
            <li> He has a close cropped hair cut, super easy to just run over with some clippers and be done with, but these took forever to make sure the hair was cut evenly.</li>
            <li> Units performs quickly and is easy to use with many adjustable levels.  </li>
            <li> Well, I figured I was fine since I had used dial clippers before without issue.</li>
            <li> Rest everything is fine.</li>
            <li> The blades are too fine and too close together which ends up pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> used twice--works fine.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> In a week it looks fine.</li>
            <li> It performs better with the cord in terms of power, but is adequate working cordless.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Light weight.  </li>
            <li> The design is ergonomic and comfortable to manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great set of clippers.</li>
            <li> They work great and are what I would suggest for clippers that will last years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean when done.</li>
            <li> star because the clippers were a success while they were working, plus 1 more star because Norelco is honoring the 2-year warranty by sending a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling since its charger adjust itself to different grid voltages; US or Europe.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair clipper.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I am very irritated that I can no longer return it, having passed that return date.</li>
            <li> The attachment itself is cheap plastic</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really fantastic</li>
            <li> Smooth and comfort.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> But overall a great looking product that gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> What you&#x27;d expect out of a cheap razor.  </li>
            <li> You can see light patches of hairs that are longer than others.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> Trim smoothly.</li>
            <li> Easy to Clean</li>
            <li> Great clipper, I keep my hair cut close since, having a cochlear implant last year.</li>
            <li> light weight</li>
            <li> I invested a lot of time looking through trimmers, and a fair amount of money on this one, and it has resulted in a complete disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;DO</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> most is that it is much quieter than most electric razors.</li>
            <li> so far so good its a well meant product.</li>
            <li> This cordless Norelco with Lithium Ion battery holds a charge that is effective to get both of them clipped and not to worry about the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  mobility,  decent charge, comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> With cheap clippers I always had to take out the screws and clean them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The level of charge and the runtime are great with Lithium-ion, I&#x27;m still on my first charge after running it all week for my modest shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I find that one pass is all it takes to make a smooth, clean cut.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in a foreign country to buy things, very excited, very good stuff , with the likes of&lt;br /&gt;ç¬¬ä¸€æ¬¡åœ¨å›½å¤–æ·˜ä¸œè¥¿ï¼Œå¾ˆä¾¿å®œï¼Œå¾ˆå–œæ¬¢ï¼Œå°½ç®¡å›½å†…æœ‰ï¼Œä½†å”®ä»·é«˜ã€‚å“ˆå“ˆï¼Œåœ¨è¿™é‡Œç§€ä¸€æ¬¡ä¸­æ–‡....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep em around since they&#x27;re really portable and could come in handy for a quick trim in a pinch</li>
            <li> I am liking this more than I thought I would, and it is turning out to be my go to trimmer because its just so easy to use being cordless and always ready in the drawer.</li>
            <li> you are used to Osters or even cheapy Wahl clippers, you&#x27;re not going to be too excited about these.</li>
            <li> Took significantly longer to cut hair than with corded clippers.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s much easier to use, much more effective, simpler, and modern.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and battery holds a good charge where you can possible trim a full head of hair 3 times.</li>
            <li> and so far so good, it is working great without any need to do any maintenance or blade adjustments as I always have to do on my other clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t enough for a good smooth even cut.  </li>
            <li> Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> It cut through the hair quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The hair gets stuck infront of the blades causing you to clean it out every 1/2 of a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> Clippers should be easy to use, cut well and have the right sizes.</li>
            <li> Powerful and cuts super close if you use it with out the guide covers!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The storage case is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I was able to use an older clipper to salvage my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Works great the only issue a little bulky, great price.</li>
            <li> Their all in one multi-groom beard trimmer, however, which I bought alongside this, was a great deal - its just a pity</li>
            <li> I purchased a different Philips hair clipper about 4 years ago that I absolutely loved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is quite good lasting me almost 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is just something that sounded cool during design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seems like a sweet</li>
            <li> not as powerful as any corded clipper, a corded clipper feels like a light saber the way it cuts hair.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These clippers fit the bill for most people and I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the overall quality of the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a lithium ion battery that lasts up to 120 minutes on a full charge.  </li>
            <li> The product looks good but in comparison to when my barber clips my goatee; it falls short.  </li>
            <li> Product that  give full exp for the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it gave a fair haircut but took longer because of what I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really good machine.</li>
            <li> I used them for a second cut on my sons and myself in an attempt to be fair to the product.</li>
            <li> It is true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is not a bad product.  </li>
            <li> For the past 17 years my husband has been clipping his own hair so he&#x27;s gone through his fair share of hair clippers in that time.</li>
            <li> First the good: the battery charges relatively quickly (a matter of a couple hours) and lasts multiple trims, and the height adjustments are about as easy as they could be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, yet light weight and has lots of length settings built right in.  </li>
            <li> This one helps me trim my beard, mush, cut my own hair, something which I&#x27;m quite happy to do myself, I feel liberated, I know that sounds strange but this simple act is both gratifying and makes you feel self sufficient.  </li>
            <li> super, i use it every day.</li>
            <li> Quickly transportation.</li>
            <li> The guard is easy to remove to clean - just pull straight up and it pops out of the channels it locks into.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, nothing about it really impressed me but it is a solid hair clipper.</li>
            <li> The unit charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick Charge&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic... it works fanatastic... and very user friendly</li>
            <li> Be forewarned: it goes from incredibly close to extremely close to very close.</li>
            <li> I thought that this even that it was not a professional clipper it was a good one.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard and the &amp;#34;adjustable wheel&amp;#34; length setter moves easily and is large.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s charging fast, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great machine, works perfectly, it takes up very little space and it comes with a hard plastic case.</li>
            <li> I have no way of knowing how well it will hold up over the long haul (I&#x27;ve been using a corded Wahl clipper for many years that is built like a tank), but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Charge seems to be able to last for 2 haircuts before recharging which is fine for my use.  </li>
            <li> And I really like the smooth points on the blades for gliding over the skin.</li>
            <li> since I cut my own short hair, I don&#x27;t need more) and the built in length dial with clearly marked length numbers (up to 23?)</li>
            <li> For my short, curly hair, the speed and power are effective.</li>
            <li> So far I love the adjustability.</li>
            <li> If the cordless feature is something that could be useful to you, then this might be a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> Clipper cuts perfectly without leaving antennas behind.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is easy to dump hair out of, no need to remove it and bang it on the trash can, another improvement over older models.</li>
            <li> really fun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many different clippers in 50+ years of cutting my own hair and these are the best.</li>
            <li> Like the product worth the price</li>
            <li> I cut my hair myself most of the time with a professional Andis clipper so that is what I am comparing it to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have adjustable length setting right on the handle and not have to change to different blades.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of hair clippers, from Phillips to Corsair, and this Norelco is better than most hair clippers, but it&#x27;s not as versatile as some of their other offerings.</li>
            <li> This is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars is not as easy to glide through the hair and see what you are doing than a normal hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very nice if you have forgotten to charge them and they die half way through shaving your head!</li>
            <li> it is a gap in plastic attachment right</li>
            <li> I was stressed finding the right one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m smart enough to know that these are the best types of clippers on the market, also smart enough to tweak and fix things.</li>
            <li> Trimmed my face first and that was really fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> This clipper is also much easier to clean than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the guard is easy to clear and doesn&#x27;t jam up with hair in tiny crevices, hair doesn&#x27;t seem to want to fall out on its own.</li>
            <li> It is good for quick trims or little adjustments, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to change the setting, while you are clipping, without having to substitute a different size guard to get a shorter clip around ears, etc.</li>
            <li> Best part of all--no need to mess with a ton of different guards to get the right length.</li>
            <li> The Phillips would work great for grooming a child (or maybe even a small animal).  </li>
            <li> Works great when fully charged... usually 2-3 uses to buzz my head...</li>
            <li> The bare blade also shaves skin-close, making it even better as a fade trimmer.</li>
            <li> It makes this thing readily accessible at pretty much any time without having to worry about charging it.</li>
            <li> A dial on the back allows for very fine adjustment of the length.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little static electricity at play, yes, but without going into detail let me assure you this is more a design flaw than static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had many different ones in the past and so far this is the best one I&#x27;ve had I recommend this product</li>
            <li> very sharp, good quality.</li>
            <li> Despite some negative reviews, I purchased this on sale and have so far been impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Returning and going back to good old Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to open and clean during and after haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging is super fast</li>
            <li> so I am not new to trimming my own hair.</li>
            <li> The battery is outstanding at how quickly it charges and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> but i think that is why it is not so good in tight places.</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the adjustable guard, but I actually like it.</li>
            <li> as long as you don&#x27;t actually need to cut hair with it its great.</li>
            <li> Adjustability is intuitive if you start with higher level and adjust.</li>
            <li> most likely stay with the Wahl clippers for hair cuts, and the Wahl trimmers for closer trimming of beards and mustaches.  </li>
            <li> This is the first cordless clipper that performs like a corded variety.</li>
            <li> Our most recent brand of hair clippers is a Wahl 79300-400.  </li>
            <li> The guard length settings on the dial are listed in mm from 1mm - 23mm (3/64&amp;#34; - 7/8&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I can set the length with a number on the dial, and be assured the length will be consistent every time I use it.</li>
            <li> but they shouldn&#x27;t be your first choice.</li>
            <li> Works great long and short.</li>
            <li> pretty short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many different Wahl brand hair clippers over a span of about 10 years.</li>
            <li> It doesnt bother me, but they should have just removed it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the remington I bought from walmart much better, but the guard was lost, so I was trying something different.  </li>
            <li> wheel to adjust the length was a bit grabby at first</li>
            <li> The first thing he noticed was his fully charged clipper lacked power.  </li>
            <li> So this review is more for a person looking for hair clippers for very short or no hair.  </li>
            <li> the blades are actually are most of the time.</li>
            <li> Hold the end rather than the middle part, because you may twist the dial/wheel and cut more hair.</li>
            <li> Would gladly return this product if I had only kept the box!!!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I made sure the clippers were plugged in to charge for a while prior to the haircuts.</li>
            <li> it gave me uneven cut and the power is not that good as it advertised</li>
            <li> Since Philips has a good name in home appliances, I decided to buy the Norelco 7100 after a few research on Internet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not half as good as my mom, but I still enjoy this little helper a lot.</li>
            <li> Although the cleaning sets you back a bit more than other clippers, i love the cut on this one and find the benefit of having a cleaner cut outweighing the fact that i have to clean it ore often.</li>
            <li> Positive: fast delivery, easy to use, does not need many attachments, competitively prized from other leading brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy ,it&#x27;s good,but the length I control is limited</li>
            <li> The blades are quite sharp and it&#x27;s nice to grip.</li>
            <li> The points on the metal are sharp, and kind of scratch and dig into my skin.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s old haircut without significant loss of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then again: it&#x27;s easier to please someone with a new sharp tool, if that someone had been using very old trimmer for over 10 years lol</li>
            <li> If you are just cutting your own hair, i do not think Turbo is  needed, however, for 5 more dollars to get strong power, I would not hesitate to invest it.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference to not have a cord in the way, tangling up, and to be able to use it outside away from a power source if I wanted.</li>
            <li> potential.&lt;br /&gt;The titanium blades should keep their edge longer but will only be as good as thier initial sharpening when manufactured.</li>
            <li> I have other Norelco trimmers (beard) and the claim of maintenance free is pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li> This usually means to attach an extension cord to be able to use it in a space that is easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it gets the job done for what it is unless you have steel wool or kryptonian hair,  plus you&#x27;re pretty much have all the clips at your disposal.</li>
            <li> Looking good and small noisy.</li>
            <li> it cuts really good when the hair comb is adjusted to small sizes.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp, easy to go through hair, but the size adjustment isnt that smooth.</li>
            <li> I like how simple and easy to adjust comb settings without taking it out.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guide on it is a big bonus and it is easy to remove when you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, powerful, and one charge goes a long way.</li>
            <li> clippers feel like they are of good quality and the charge does seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Large cutter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot about this cutter to like, but the cons are large.</li>
            <li> They are smart to work on improving and doing well with the adjustable head on this elevated product.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Panasonic rechargeable hair clipper and this one is far superior.</li>
            <li> pro: quiet, easy to handle, ergonomic and robust touch, fast charge</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Does a good job in cutting hair close to the skin and is easy to adjust to the right length for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, easy to use, feels fine in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery charges fast and holds charge sufficiently for my needs.</li>
            <li> I expected much better than this from Norelco.</li>
            <li> And the turbo button , you can really see a difference when using it.</li>
            <li> Really like the Norelco brand for hair clippers.</li>
            <li> They need to add the blades extension because with the plastic extension you can not cut the low hair comfortably.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very goor tool, does its job very well</li>
            <li> Have use it three times and it performed very well.  </li>
            <li> Does not cut hair, very week</li>
            <li> really did not see a need to use the turbo on the clippers.  </li>
            <li> you can really get the haircut you want.</li>
            <li> Very practical, and it&#x27;s dual voltage, so you can use it anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s modern and sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast cut</li>
            <li> It is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> ,  fast charging.  </li>
            <li> really given these some time to see if it was just me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d grab them if you need a portable kit that doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> Charging cord could be much longer to make it somewhat functional as a corded clipper, should have made it USB</li>
            <li> -11-17&lt;br /&gt;Finally died after 2 years, signs of it dying are the lack of low battery orange light, it will just continue to work until it shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I use it to trim beard and moustache, it works really well.</li>
            <li> They work well and are priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> This one is ready to go, no oiling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really want this product will come out permanently.</li>
            <li> I use it to buzz my head and my beard and it works really really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> But still worth it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to wash the blades and it has a two hours of usage after charging it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for this type of product.</li>
            <li> Also, the dial to select the guard depth seems really</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this item</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need a whole bunch of combs.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the corded Whal</li>
            <li> we bought cuts so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> I have own a few others Philips clipper/trimmer products.</li>
            <li> I am going back to the old one until I find a more reliable battery operated clipper.</li>
            <li> It might be good but not if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li> The adjustment is very easy and does not change accidentally like one I used previously.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dire problem, just one that the user must be aware of, and correct by slowing down a bit to make sure the blade guard rests squarely on your scalp.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp which is the only good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that only uses one comb for all settings makes it unique.</li>
            <li> and this one holds its charge better than the other cordless brand I used.  </li>
            <li> I think the Phillips rates up with the Conair cutters, although I have a little cordless Conair beard trimmer that has remarkable battery and blade life and remains the standard for me.</li>
            <li> It cut hair but got so bound up with the hair that you had to stop every second to clean it out.</li>
            <li> It cuts really short and clean.  </li>
            <li> The battery doesnt hold that long of a charge, so cordless is not an available feature for me.</li>
            <li> though not nearly as well as my cheap corded Wahl clippers.  </li>
            <li> It safes me tons of time just doing the whole proces with these clippers and normal ones.</li>
            <li> and I used the Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable for travel, but good luck trying to do a decent fade with that or maintaining a slightly longer haircut.  </li>
            <li> Not near as good as other clippers out there.  </li>
            <li> You have to clean it very often when trimming long hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Was pleased to see it came in an attractive hard case, an improvement, so I thought over the small Conair bag full of loose components.</li>
            <li> This new &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; functions very well and is what I was looking for to to replace my older Norelco &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34;. .</li>
            <li> Dealing with a cable is better than dealing with lack of power and odd ergonomics.</li>
            <li> My previous one worked more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> My last model was smaller and more of a beard/hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Super simple!</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve seen in stores, it is slightly larger than many currently offered.  </li>
            <li> Their updated version seems to have some problems the older model didn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> But for what it&#x27;s work it gives a decent cut.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite get the same shave as a powerful corded one, but really does a heck of a job</li>
            <li> Quick, simple and convenient.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this  trimmer and would definitely give it as a present to anyone who uses a trimmer knowing they too</li>
            <li> Philips delivers high quality grooming products and at 34.95 this is a product you will use for years.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The dial is adjustable in a small area on top and a super large area on back.</li>
            <li> With the ability to adjust cutting length, I am able to shape and trim my beard very easily.  </li>
            <li> He keeps his beard very short and this clipper, though a little large, is easy enough, and certainly handy enough, that he always manages to look well-groomed.</li>
            <li> It does not work so well for beards and it does not work around the ears of my young boy but the fast speed helped to not pull on hair.</li>
            <li> Fast charging, noise is not that loud.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts more than long enough.</li>
            <li> Also, try cutting a length longer than what you need to begin with; it&#x27;s good to test the length before you do the full cut.</li>
            <li> She has beauty license in Taiwan yet she only cut family member&#x27;s hair for fun (and to save money).</li>
            <li> There is something with the comb design that just does not seem to fit well when trying to groom areas that are not smooth consistent surfaces.  </li>
            <li> Did not like this - Did not cut well or as evenly as a normal size plug in clipper.</li>
            <li> I have tried several times and it doesn&#x27;t work.i have better luck using my Norelco beard trimmer but is to small to use for my hair.i have been using several corded trimmers for many years</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to go over several times to get that even fresh look.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how cost effective that is, but at least there is that option.  </li>
            <li> If you want it to run as any clippers normally would, you would just set to &amp;#34;turbo.&amp;#34; There is one thing however.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s from the dead :)  </li>
            <li> Sharp, a little noise, but better than my old one, and package is very cool.</li>
            <li> This will be my main all around travel/home clipper as it has easy maintenance and way less</li>
            <li> My 8 year old Wahl is better then this, half these size, and twice the power even with &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; turned on.</li>
            <li> easy to use for cutting your own hair</li>
            <li> It is not very obvious but right under the power button there is a button with the letter &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and you can press it after you turn the clipper on to boost the power.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The clippers did not pull and yank my hair as I have had other cheap clippers do.  </li>
            <li> Light weight, contoured shape, sharp blades and lots of power.</li>
            <li> and I received a brand new clipper.</li>
            <li> The new cordless (Conair 22 Piece Cord/</li>
            <li> I found out quickly that the blade must be held absolutely flat against your head, or else it digs in a bit too far or misses areas.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold, well balanced, powerful enough to cut through with bogging down and</li>
            <li> The only two things I would improve about it is the carrying case (pretty flimsy and overly big) and at least make it water resistant to be able to clean it after uses.</li>
            <li> After using for a month and looking bad I&#x27;ve figured it out and now cut my own hair better than who I had been going too</li>
            <li> only real downfall with this clipper is that is just did not do very well on surfaces where the contours are changing like with manscaping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not powerful enough for professional use, but it&#x27;s certainly good enough for use at home.</li>
            <li> is right where I naturally hold the clippers, so as I am cutting its very easy to accidentally change lengths..which isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li> You can pass over the same spot over and over again and it will randomly cut more and more hair.</li>
            <li> I should have sent it back after the first use.</li>
            <li> I only use electric hair trimmers to shave my face or to give myself a crew-cut during the hot months.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Would have been better if this distance was similar to other levelers.</li>
            <li> No more looking for the correct size with the all in one fitting.</li>
            <li> This one goes to SOooooo many levels that if you were to buy ordinary clippers you would get like 20 pieces.</li>
            <li> I also feel that the clip &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; better than conventional clips because it has better support against your head as the main length of the clipper is behind the comb.  </li>
            <li> You do have to go over the same spot several times to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, the case is flimsy plastic with a cheap cardboard insert and too large for the trimmer and accessories, which includes the charging cord and adaptor, and a small cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> you see that this trimmer is not only cordless, oiless, the blades detach for easy cleaning and it has a single attachment that adjusts it all</li>
            <li> At this low price point I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations, but surely with such light use the clippers should last at least a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for turbo boost, I have not needed it because the hair I cut is not very thick.  </li>
            <li> the positive side for these clippers, they are fairly quiet and the unit is handheld.</li>
            <li> We enjoy the freedom of not having to mess with a cord while trying to groom.</li>
            <li> The brush broke at first use!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s larger than most clipper, at least to my expectation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it holds a charge more than long enough to trim the scruff off my head, and my head is freakishly big.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through way to many pairs of clippers to count and the biggest annoyance is the mess of attachments and cord you have to deal with cramming back into the case each time you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> The adjustable comb does not work well for the shorter lengths because the front projection remains the same size (large).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only flaw that I&#x27;ve found so far after several uses is that my hair constantly clogs the guard quite easily.</li>
            <li> While it gives a good clean cut on the top and sides of the head, getting behind the ears is very difficult.</li>
            <li> If you had used other measurements in the past you may have to experiment to learn what length is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; is more of a plastic sales container.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it roughly two months ago, I cut my own hair and it cut incredibly short and uneven, and I immediately ran to a professional barber to have it fixed the day before a large graduation ceremony bear in mind.</li>
            <li> And I always had to clean the clippers half way doing their hair, cleaning the clippers of their clogged up hair.</li>
            <li> clear why its not listed when search for philips haircut products</li>
            <li> Used only once but much lighter and easier to maneuver than my old corded model.</li>
            <li> My husbands hair is kept short and these clippers leave very blotchy patches of hair as well as needing cleaned frequently during a trim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts cleanly and the coated blades pull a lot less than the old style ones.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t cut your hair unless comb is clear</li>
            <li> It also only runs 1/2 as fast as my 6 year-old Remington adjustable clippers, and that&#x27;s when this is in &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a soft case for storing this unit over the box it came in.</li>
            <li> Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]].</li>
            <li> (Like drills of old.)</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> hair adjustment is fast and simple.</li>
            <li> Used one time so far.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very quiet and very efficient.</li>
            <li> my wife cuts like a professional stylist and it&#x27;s quicker and easier to get a trim on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far no cons.</li>
            <li> , very said, used only 3 times.</li>
            <li> no where near close to pro cutters.</li>
            <li> in all, I am staying with my old trusty beard trimmer, also for trimming may hair.</li>
            <li> Does a professional job.</li>
            <li> None so far.</li>
            <li> they seem to last a really long time on a full charge.</li>
            <li> gets stuck to everything, especially if you oil your blades as often as you should and ultimately it&#x27;s just kind of a messy pain.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> it is not as easy to glide through the hair as a normal hair clipper, because of the guard it is hard to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers rated this unit with lower stars, because the comb was a bit wide and they weren&#x27;t able to use it to trim other areas.  </li>
            <li> Yet less than 3 months after purchase, the clippers take a full charge but refuse to power on at all.</li>
            <li> Most you can do is a high and tight haircut or crew cut due to the lack of settings on clippers.</li>
            <li> Even with the turbo they dont seem to go fast enough or maybe they&#x27;re just not sharp</li>
            <li> The one adjustable attachment is easily removable for fine sideburn cutting.</li>
            <li> There were some stragglers in my hair that did not seem to get cut, but overall it did a decent job.  </li>
            <li> The problem with this model is the guard flexes a bit when you press it on your head, because it adjusts by simply raising higher above the shaver head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the main con is that the guard doesnâ€™t get close enough to even cut hair at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Norelco 7100 hair clipper for Men who use clippers on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Well if I grew out my hair there&#x27;s a high chance I would bring back the 70&#x27;s fro</li>
            <li> It seems as if the trimmer normally runs at only 80% power which conserves battery energy, then when switched to Turbo</li>
            <li> The guard is also fairly short and without long teeth to lift hair up before it reaches the blade you may need to go over the hair several times to lift out hair that may not be showing its full length.</li>
            <li> The angle was very different than a normal clipper.</li>
            <li> This clipper is so much slower and less accurate than my previously clippers (12 yr old Wahl corded).  </li>
            <li> This is perhaps my least satisfied purchase to date from Amazon and a total miss-sell on the part of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This product is better suited for cutting hair not beard trimming (unless you have a big full beard).</li>
            <li> but you also won&#x27;t have consistent results so the single adjusable clip is essentially a fail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just plain does not trim well, gets backed up quickly and</li>
            <li> case sucks, so that docks a star, but otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> but without it the case was just a large empty box where the contents would just bang around.</li>
            <li> You have to remove the guard, clear the hair and snap it back on after every cut.</li>
            <li> It takes me twice as long to cut my hair because it misses half of the hair on each pass, and I also need to clean out the clipper head between every pass (on the Wahl</li>
            <li> This clipper is similar in size to my old one, which we used for 15+ years on my husband&#x27;s hair and beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once so far and have used it three times.</li>
            <li> but I developed an alternate way to select</li>
            <li> Norelco offers a 45-day money back guarantee on the trimmer</li>
            <li> My wife who was cutting my hair loved the fact she did not have to keep changing combs on the clipper when going from the sides to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I had been using a clipper set by Wahl for the past 15 years, but hoped a low-maintenance, cordless model with new technology would have made the process a little quicker and better, especially with the young boys.</li>
            <li> The one piece plastic guard that covers the entire shaver makes it difficult to get into the crevices of one&#x27;s face, and so I can&#x27;t make as precise a trim to my beard as I can with other clippers that have more open designs.</li>
            <li> and I have to detach the dead, clean it, place it back several times during one hair trimming, and sometime it even does not work when I do so</li>
            <li> The blade itself is in a small housing that can be removed by pushing from the back, allowing you to clean inside (and it will need it).</li>
            <li> instructions come in English and Spanish, and at least the English instructions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does clog much easier than any other hair clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> cause you might accidently turn it off, but other then that very close shave without the guards.</li>
            <li> At 2mm or 1mm, you can easily inadvertently press it down to less.</li>
            <li> back to my old set of wired, traditional clippers.</li>
            <li> But this was the only battery powered clipper I could find that had an overall length setting near 1 inch.  </li>
            <li> Down side of this product is comb, Product have 1 to 23 setting which is good for cutting hair but the way the comb make is kind of wied for first time user, You will have to adjust or change your hair cutting technique becasue comb</li>
            <li> Got these clippers for my husband to keep his very short hair trimmed---really, these clippers barely had to do any work at all!</li>
            <li> Guard is easy and nice, but if you are cutting close, have to watch for the pieces to move apart and not push them down to hard on curves or you will cut your hair too short(my eybrows, haha.)  </li>
            <li> It butchered my hair once again and proved just to be a completely flawed machine in terms of easily trimming consistent levels of hair even when locked at the same technical length; it just doesn&#x27;t cut consistently as a standard trimmer would, simply because of the design of the adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it but the large plastic guard makes it hard to shave accurately and impossible under the nose.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair very smoothly/effectively, and the charge last a long long time.</li>
            <li> works well, cuts well, expect some noise from it especially when using the turbo speed, tho overall not as loud, but not quiet either.</li>
            <li> Unlike my old, bulky hair clipper with tons of changeable heads, this clipper only needs two, so easy and less messy!</li>
            <li> Logistics is very fast, a few days time to Chinese.</li>
            <li> Since it is quite powerful and sturdy it takes me way less than half the time it took me with my old one.</li>
            <li> the old single sheet, 16&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hair is stuck under the comb, very hard to clean it</li>
            <li> I was worried, but this also runs right through my really thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, having just cut my hair again, because only recently has it grown long enough to justify another hair cut, and bearing in mind the proper levels at which to cut, I discovered it is actually a piece of trash.</li>
            <li> Now I only hope the clippers last long enough .</li>
            <li> although i&#x27;ve only used it once the battery seems to last long, it&#x27;s as noisy as my last one.</li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s rotary electric razors last a long time, hopefully with a lithium-ion battery and quality parts the hair clipper will do the same.</li>
            <li> use trimmers not only to get my hair cut but to quickly widdle down my lazy mans beard before I shave, in both circumstances these blades have snagged my hairs.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer has made cutting my sons&#x27; and grandson&#x27;s hair very easy.  </li>
            <li> While cutting loose hair pile up at the top of the clip and needs to be removed after frequent intervals, which is time consuming.</li>
            <li> My last one&#x27;s power supply went dead, so it was time to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Tons of power, nice even cutting, and wide enough to be efficient.</li>
            <li> The Lithium Ion technology used should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> charge does not last long.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Washable blades.&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively short charge time and long endurance of the battery</li>
            <li> This clipper works fine for cutting hair, but not so much for other uses.  </li>
            <li> Also, the battery doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> The very long comb has a second problem: a lot of hair will get stuck in there.</li>
            <li> So far with a few tests (waiting for my hair to gow back), it seems ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only disadvantage is about its head, not fit for fixed use.</li>
            <li> Been cutting hair fo about 25 years, love these clippers, plenty of power, and last a long time between charging.</li>
            <li> one concern with using a battery powered clipper was that the unit would be less powerful than the corded clippers I usually use.  </li>
            <li> Another neat innovation is that there is only one guard which is EASILY adjusted for long or short cutting.  </li>
            <li> We were a little surprised how close the cut was when we chose setting number 5 out of 12.</li>
            <li> The cutting area is pretty large, and restricts your view when trying to use it to trip or shape.  </li>
            <li> The clipper works fine in cutting my facial hair short.</li>
            <li> We have had a variety of Phillips clippers over the years and this return to a conventional style is a big improvement over the L shaped version that had two different length guides to deal</li>
            <li> During last 14 years since she cuts my hair,we tried more then 10 brands and models,  we never had such a bad hair clipper as this Philips model.</li>
            <li> To give you 24 levels of cutting length, they changed the numbering system to something most people are not used to.</li>
            <li> any more because they foul up- getting clogged with hair and then stop cutting.</li>
            <li> lithium battery is fast to charge and holds the charge at least two weeks</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re doing home grooming and/or hair cutting, get a better set like Oster.</li>
            <li> Like some others have said the guard/comb gets clogged with cut hair and it prevents cutting more hair until it is cleared.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get my hair even.  </li>
            <li> The battery last longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well and battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> long battery life - supposedly.</li>
            <li> : The comb has long &#x27;tongs&#x27; that I think are too long.</li>
            <li> : the cap design is too big for difficult tasks such as mustache trimming and around ears, not useful for 15mm+ hair cuts or precise trimming lengths below 4mm.</li>
            <li> I think you will be in the future are expected to adhere to a neat hairstyle</li>
            <li> This Norelco has a long battery life (I&#x27;ve used it a lot without any slowdown).  </li>
            <li> The plastic comb over the blades is so long that you cannot see were</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- long battery life</li>
            <li> The charging was fast, and the discharging was slow.  </li>
            <li> Now it brings us to what really defines thick hair?  </li>
            <li> Its quiet for a hair clipper, but also in this regard not very powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adjustments are odd because they don&#x27;t follow the general guard measurements</li>
            <li> It seems like the comb is much bigger than the removable combs I have used on other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other cordless clippers I have used, you can actually used these while plugged in to the charger.</li>
            <li> Unlike every other cordless trimmer, the battery on this one actually works just as well as with the charging cord plugged in.</li>
            <li> Very quiet due to lack of power.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it might store all my extra pens and markers, allowing me to re-claim some beer glasses.</li>
            <li> Especially compared to other buzzers.</li>
            <li> was initially unimpressed after I charged it and turned it on to a little baby buzz, its only saving grace is turbo switch mode that kicks up the buzz.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I had an older cordless trimmer that would change to a shorter length if you pressed to hard.  </li>
            <li> sure have bad feelings about the brand, especially after seeing the &amp;#34;Product Manual&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> (yes my hair was dry).  </li>
            <li> Two stars because of a few major issues:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for several years and this is my first cordless hair clipper, which brought a lot of disappointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a single guard that adjusts in millimeters.</li>
            <li> Adjustable Length with single comb</li>
            <li> Cutting edges run smooth, not too much of noise, fast to charge, long battery discharge while cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Even if you hold it upside down after a few &#x27;runs&#x27; on your head with hairs that are near an inch long it refuses to let them go without blowing on it</li>
            <li> however, i have to go over the same spot at least 2x to make sure that there isn&#x27;t a spot left behind; my other issue is that the hair gets stuck in the corners of the hair guards and needs to be cleaned after every 1 or 2 passes through my hair - which causes hair spots to get left behind, which when traveling, i don&#x27;t mind so much because of the small size and weight of the unit.</li>
            <li> experience is once a cutter&#x27;s blades get dull I just buy a new cutter, but the blades on this cutter can be replaced.  </li>
            <li> ; piece, English, Spanish on the other with the 21 little no word 3/4&amp;#34; X 3/4&amp;#34; instruction sketches.</li>
            <li> I can use the same charger I use with my Norelco shaver, so I have less clutter.  </li>
            <li> They require constant maintainence which for me is not worth the time spent, so I go to a barber for my haircuts.  </li>
            <li> enough.&lt;br /&gt;You really have to slow it down to get the trim or cut you want</li>
            <li> They cut very unevenly and I often have to go over the same spot several times before it&#x27;s cut.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not clear where the other components were supposed to go.</li>
            <li> This means I am not new to the idea and possible trouble of a dial setting on clippers.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting my hair for 15min and finally grabbed my cheap Wahl that did the work in half the time and cut all the hair that this thing didn&#x27;t after 10 passes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-7/8&amp;#34; is the largest size, which may be a little short for some.</li>
            <li> The trim head was unaligned and I had to take it off by screwing head off and bending the wire a little bit and then putting the head back on and cuts like a pro.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously I wasn&#x27;t able to test anything else like battery life but the product is so bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very flimsy and feels poorly made than the shiny pictures</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> But once that cardboard is removed you have a empty box with nothing to hold things in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful as the numbers do not correspond to existing clipper numbers.</li>
            <li> Charging only took a few hours and the unit is now in the case awaiting the next hair clipping marathon in a few months.</li>
            <li> These are a must have (just don&#x27;t get them wet).</li>
            <li> Not really feasible.</li>
            <li> We fully expected this Philips Norelco hair clipper to be a hit.  </li>
            <li> not as i was expected</li>
            <li> Cuts slowly - not much speed or power&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fast - even on turbo mode</li>
            <li> And, after I finished trimming my husband&#x27;s hair, I had to go back over it because there were some uneven spots.</li>
            <li> Really pi$$ed me off and annoyed me.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair get ready to remove the attachment/comb after each pass b/c your hair will get trapped inside it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress it enough, if everyone had thick hair this buzzer would have either been recalled or simply never made it to production.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with a little brush for cleaning the blades like other clippers sometimes do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not a selling point for this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cuts well , the only problem is , need to clean the haisr that stuck on the clipper every few seconds while cutting the hair...</li>
            <li> It only moves the blades faster, which does not help with thick long hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This is a major negative, since we don&#x27;t want to have a pile of clippers in a cabinet all for</li>
            <li> not powerful enough and/or sharp enough for cutting normal hair</li>
            <li> Very little power, takes 3 times the regular time to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> The other issue I had was the hair doesn&#x27;t fall off and away from these clippers at all, it&#x27;s like your hair is magnetically attacked to it.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a problem due to it clogging the blades.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as sharp as other clippers and this is the issue,</li>
            <li> The distance from the tip of the comb to the window for hair is too long, so just the variation of the curves of my head gives me an uneven cut.</li>
            <li> I picked this product out of all the other clippers because of its simplicity.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this works pretty doggone well as a beard trimmer as well...</li>
            <li> For the past ten years I&#x27;ve been dealing with a clipper that needed to be oiled before each use.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find any other hair clippers for that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but you have to pay for return insured shipping plus there are other hoops to jump through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that title is not exactly a glowing recommendation but lets see whats going on and what to expect here.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slower than my other clippers.</li>
            <li> He can use it for beard trimming and any other hair maintenance he&#x27;d like, but not his head.</li>
            <li> Please be careful, when you cut your hair!</li>
            <li> Keeps me from having to keep up with all the attachments that other clippers use.  </li>
            <li> I had some other norelco with the head that was always breaking</li>
            <li> if Not I would have bought from some other company.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t use this long because it cut unevenly.</li>
            <li> length adjustment is well designed, as a side rotation on the handle it will NOT accidently drop if you put pressure on the guard pressing down on the scalp resulting in a shorter than expected cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cordless, Adjustable cutting length, Quiet, Charges Fast.</li>
            <li> I use this item every other month for my hair (about an hour) and every other week for trimming my beard (about 15-20 mins or less).</li>
            <li> I can only attribute this to the width of the blade, as other trimmers I&#x27;ve had were narrower and didn&#x27;t suffer this problem or at least not as noticeably.</li>
            <li> No more little bag of different size guards.  </li>
            <li> This product is very quiet and you can hardly hear the noise when you cut hair.</li>
            <li> where the blade is, which makes it difficult to keep an even cut in some spots on very close adjustment setting.</li>
            <li> Vine gives us a month to review a product, I have 2 days left, I&#x27;m still just not really thrilled with them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is slow going and will take you two to three times longer to get all the hairs in the same path cut evenly.</li>
            <li> For thick hair like mine, it doesn&#x27;t cut even, you have to do twice the lines to get the same cut that the wahl can do in one.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I am not one to dish out a 1 star (1st time in 87 reviews); however, these clippers are an utter disaster if used on thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Also trimmed down groin area and didn&#x27;t pull or cut.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t push down this time.</li>
            <li> little louder than other models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> The plastic case it comes in --- is a really large, useless waste.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, do not clip the hair.</li>
            <li> THIS TRIMERWORKS GRATE VERY SHARP AND QUITE plus</li>
            <li> Our typical every-day clippers are the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have to shake it out regularly to keep the path clear so it can keep cutting.</li>
            <li> half cut and fix the device and cut again and fix the device again.</li>
            <li> one clip, less clutter</li>
            <li> This problem would be much less noticeable at longer lengths.</li>
            <li> not very easy to shave back-head hair.</li>
            <li> It took less than an hour to charge.  </li>
            <li> For the performance, this should sell for half the price.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, it barely makes any noise when switched!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the comb attachment is a bit wide, so it&#x27;s hard to reach smaller areas - behind the ears.  </li>
            <li> I wish the combs were a little shorter...</li>
            <li> you have to take a little leap of faith there).</li>
            <li> Plus, back head side is a tough spot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these clippers cut uneven and leave very noticiable stripes in your hair that is hard to blend out.</li>
            <li> Not cutting evenly is really bad if you&#x27;re using this clipper to cut your hair.  </li>
            <li> It took at least 3 times as long as usual for my wife to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> The only way to bend the combs is by applying unnecessary pressure.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with these and save your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> heavy duty metal blade</li>
            <li> , now I need to wear a hat out everyday......</li>
            <li> When It arrived my wife was asking why so few attachments?</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this clipper as I have very short thin hair and like to touch my hair up once a week.but will not cut my hair evenly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the 0.5 mm is not really 0.5 (at least on my opinion)</li>
            <li> This makes every swipe result in an uneven length.</li>
            <li> It conforms to practically any size hand and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It misses quite a few each pass</li>
            <li> Trimming hair becomes a hit or miss activity with that, not a precise action.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only poor design is the dial/wheel for length setting.</li>
            <li> When you use plastic with number 1 or gets uneven cut.</li>
            <li> , I cut my hair, come back after a few weeks and cut it again, then in hardly 15 min its fully charged, I mean I dont&#x27; think about charging it anymore that often.  </li>
            <li> only negative is that it has a wide blade width which is not easy to maneuver around  some areas or angles like behind the ears.</li>
            <li> i usually keep my hair less than 1/4&amp;#34;, but i can tell the difference in 1/8&amp;#34;, 3mm, 1mm,</li>
            <li> too heavy and not easy to cut hair yourself</li>
            <li> , I hate to have to remove the head to clean it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, if you press too hard to get some of the tough to cut places, the fins on the guide can splay open and bring the cutter closer to the skin, which defeats the purpose of the depth guide.</li>
            <li> The on off button in a bad spot for cutting your own hair</li>
            <li> Impossible to use for whole haircut.</li>
            <li> By &#x27;a while&#x27;, I mean that they were plugged in since the last haircuts, approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not only is it bad enough that the largest adjustment part of the knob is on the bottom of the unit, the worst place, but it is too easy to switch with little resistance.</li>
            <li> As stated above, this dial is flawed by design.</li>
            <li> yes it works no better on turbo mode.</li>
            <li> Jury is out on whether this makes it past the trial period.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair, Remington, and Wahl cutters in the past and rate those brands in that order.  </li>
            <li> Or a small lawn.</li>
            <li> Cuts VERY unevenly.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with ridiculously curly, thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and you have trouble finding and not losing individual combs for cutting hair</li>
            <li> Clipper works well, but the comb system is not very good.</li>
            <li> This gadget is not suitable for profession use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lacks a dedicated small clipper, like I have on my beard trimmer, for the hard to get to areas (behind the ears, for instance).&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because a few things are ok:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps the single adjustable clip is to blame for the uneven cutting.  </li>
            <li> itâ€™s hard to have a haircut with oneself</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the blades were on the Wahl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a hard case where you can put the clipper.  </li>
            <li> Either the blades were dull or misaligned.</li>
            <li> The back part is right where you hold it due to balance and gravity and cannot be avoided unless you want to get a crap shave due to bad leverage and awkward holding positions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a conversion on the plastic carrier box for conversion to common guard sizes.</li>
            <li> I assume the titanium blades will be self-sharpening, at least that&#x27;s what they advertise.</li>
            <li> this clipper is easier to use because you don&#x27;t have to keep changing combs for different lengths of cutting.  </li>
            <li> it too late to return these??</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, to common guys,like u and me , that would be enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fastest speed, this clipper is slow.  </li>
            <li> The other complaints about flexible combs is exaggerated.</li>
            <li> no more trips to the barber for me!</li>
            <li> worst razor ever - the idea is cool, but I tried to shave my head on the shortest setting with the adapter and got chunked, patches.</li>
            <li> After getting used to the guide and how to adjust the thing (you don&#x27;t really know the cutting length until you are cutting so</li>
            <li> That would be ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time justifying spending another $45ish bucks for a new set of clippers, but these are terrible and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not the person who writes reviews, BUT this is a special case since I am frustrated because of the fact that bad products get hundreds of 5 stars review...</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is not good because of my think hair,</li>
            <li> Not exactly fair to the norelco</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re about 3/8-1/2&amp;#34; long, making it very difficult to trim your mustache under your nose.</li>
            <li> the bad, and luckily it&#x27;s relatively minor: patchy trims.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment!</li>
            <li> I do have very thick hair</li>
            <li> The worse purchase I have ever made &amp;</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit on the thin side.  </li>
            <li> These are not great clippers, but they will eventually get the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find how to use it, with my poor skill</li>
            <li> The blade guard has thin plastic slats that BEND when you put the clippers against your head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is poor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guard design is poor.</li>
            <li> I was so confused if I need to get this and a beard trimmer, but now the beard trimmer is collecting dust.  </li>
            <li> this is a poor replacement.  </li>
            <li> Not a smooth cut, I gotta keep removing hair from the guard to keep cutting</li>
            <li> When I opened the case I was shocked to see an ugly inner molded paper liner which looked like thin egg carton material.</li>
            <li> Even the turbo mode is slow, and disappointing.  </li>
            <li> But personally, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t cut my hair, it&#x27;s very weak</li>

            <li> Inside is a useless cardboard packaging insert to hold the cutter during shipping.</li>
            <li> or worst only 3yrs life span???</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Guards prevent cutting behind ears</li>
            <li> Turbo Boost is useless.</li>
            <li> Instead of using combs to select the length you would like to cut you must twisted dial and picking number instead.  </li>
            <li> Another Norelco fail.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it just does not cut hair well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was depending on it to perform with the comb attached and utilizing its 23 built in length settings.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the review is strictly about the item</li>
            <li> Very poor design.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This trimmer has good battery life, nice ergonomics, and an easy height adjustment. It&#x27;s only flaw that I&#x27;ve found so far after several uses is that my hair constantly clogs the guard quite easily. I do have very thick hair so it could just be me however.</li>
            <li> performs as advertised, very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Good work, good quality.</li>
            <li> Pros - Nice Design, Grip. Easy &amp; Comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - 23 mm is max length it supports. 40 would make it perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li> Bad, just bad. A budget cordless shaver at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;dial&amp;#34; setting cordless clippers for years, always Remington. Easily 10-12 years every three weeks or so. This means I am not new to the idea and possible trouble of a dial setting on clippers. These clippers the dial setting is flawed beyond belief. The dial is adjustable in a small area on top and a super large area on back. The back part is right where you hold it due to balance and gravity and cannot be avoided unless you want to get a crap shave due to bad leverage and awkward holding positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read a review where someone said this caused it to change on its own as you used it. Well, I figured I was fine since I had used dial clippers before without issue. I was wrong. As stated above, this dial is flawed by design. Not only is it bad enough that the largest adjustment part of the knob is on the bottom of the unit, the worst place, but it is too easy to switch with little resistance. Worse yet, it barely makes any noise when switched! In short, whoever designed these clippers is an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already boxed mine back up and it&#x27;s sitting on my porch to be picked up via return. Horrible product. These aren&#x27;t the only issues with this device either. It also only runs 1/2 as fast as my 6 year-old Remington adjustable clippers, and that&#x27;s when this is in &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; mode. What a joke! The other issue I had was the hair doesn&#x27;t fall off and away from these clippers at all, it&#x27;s like your hair is magnetically attacked to it. Even if you hold it upside down after a few &#x27;runs&#x27; on your head with hairs that are near an inch long it refuses to let them go without blowing on it and that&#x27;s a problem due to it clogging the blades. There&#x27;s a little static electricity at play, yes, but without going into detail let me assure you this is more a design flaw than static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I wasn&#x27;t able to test anything else like battery life but the product is so bad I had to immediately return it after the one use which was a horrible experience that messed up my hair both in length and coverage. Bad product. Avoid at all costs.I had to immediately return it after the one use which was a horrible experience that messed up my hair both in length and coverage. Bad product.

            <li> Packaging is very beautiful, and the first shopping was very successful~</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Panasonic rechargeable hair clipper and this one is far superior. I have no issues with this clipper. The battery charges fast and holds charge sufficiently for my needs. The other complaints about flexible combs is exaggerated. The only way to bend the combs is by applying unnecessary pressure. This clipper is also much easier to clean than the Panasonic. I recommend these. You can&#x27;t go wrong for $30.00.</li>
            <li> no more trips to the barber for me! these clippers works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely disappointed in this clipper.  It simply does not cut hair.  With each pass, hair clippings collect inside of the guard and plug up the cutting blade, rendering it useless.  It&#x27;s a fatal design flaw.  I expected much better than this from Norelco.</li>
            <li> After using for a month and looking bad I&#x27;ve figured it out and now cut my own hair better than who I had been going too gonna save 3-4 hundred bucks this year</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing this product. Unfortunately, these clippers cut uneven and leave very noticiable stripes in your hair that is hard to blend out. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for several years and this is my first cordless hair clipper, which brought a lot of disappointment. Don&#x27;t waste your time with these and save your money.</li>
            <li> great product well designed and easy to use</li>
            <li> ship fast,cut hair good</li>
            <li> larger than I imagine it, but It is convenient to care.</li>
            <li> Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used-highly recommended!</li>
            <li> On par with Norelco shavers.  Easy (can be used corded or not) and effective.  Light weight.  The turbo feature is great.  I can use the same charger I use with my Norelco shaver, so I have less clutter.  Love it.</li>
            <li> itâ€™s hard to have a haircut with oneself</li>
            <li> The brush broke at first use!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s larger than most clipper, at least to my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very flimsy and feels poorly made than the shiny pictures here.&lt;br /&gt;A little louder than other models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Awful experience.  It hacked my hair and I returned it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. But if you want perfect you need practice more</li>
            <li> Fantastic... it works fanatastic... and very user friendly</li>
            <li> Its not meant to cut mustache with the guard.  it gave me uneven cut and the power is not that good as it advertised</li>
            <li> For the first time in a foreign country to buy things, very excited, very good stuff , with the likes of&lt;br /&gt;ç¬¬ä¸€æ¬¡åœ¨å›½å¤–æ·˜ä¸œè¥¿ï¼Œå¾ˆä¾¿å®œï¼Œå¾ˆå–œæ¬¢ï¼Œå°½ç®¡å›½å†…æœ‰ï¼Œä½†å”®ä»·é«˜ã€‚å“ˆå“ˆï¼Œåœ¨è¿™é‡Œç§€ä¸€æ¬¡ä¸­æ–‡....ä¹ˆä¹ˆå“’.</li>
            <li> Thank you! All orderly!</li>
            <li> I was so satisfied and super happy with it that I decided to write a review , right after I used it on my 3 sons.&lt;br /&gt;1 star for maneuverability&lt;br /&gt;1 star for easy installation&lt;br /&gt;1 star for easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;1 star for turbo button&lt;br /&gt;And 1 more star because I&#x27;m so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re probably wondering why?&lt;br /&gt;First of all of my sons hair are though. And I always had to clean the clippers half way doing their hair, cleaning the clippers of their clogged up hair. With cheap clippers I always had to take out the screws and clean them. That was a chore. But with these you can take out the clippers with a push of a button. And the turbo button , you can really see a difference when using it. Cuts through their hair like butter.&lt;br /&gt;And why I&#x27;m so happy . It safes me tons of time just doing the whole proces with these clippers and normal ones. Now I only hope the clippers last long enough .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beard and mustache, it&#x27;s very good for beard, but can&#x27;t use the comb for mustache.</li>
            <li> It cut hair but got so bound up with the hair that you had to stop every second to clean it out. Impossible to use for whole haircut. Returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair very smoothly/effectively, and the charge last a long long time. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the adjustable guard, but I actually like it. The trimmer is not any heavier than the corded one it replaced. The battery lasts more than long enough.</li>
            <li> Great hair trimmer love the cordless feature makes it very easy to use and cuts nicely!!!</li>
            <li> Power is ok. Comb is not so good.</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have bought this during last Thanksgiving event. It is perfect. So I bought it again. Delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d2b14d37ad59f0614ef97d7bdcc7ec4e]]Adjustable cutting length from 1/64\\&quot; to 7/8\\&quot; makes this beard trimmer tops in my book.</li>
            <li> Despite some negative reviews, I purchased this on sale and have so far been impressed with it. For my short, curly hair, the speed and power are effective. I was able to shave my head in minutes without any difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only word of caution I would offer is for one to read the conversion chart between the numbers on the clipper and the standard barber&#x27;s numbers, because they are not the same. To give you 24 levels of cutting length, they changed the numbering system to something most people are not used to. Also, try cutting a length longer than what you need to begin with; it&#x27;s good to test the length before you do the full cut.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Battery life if favorable.  Attachment is easy to use.</li>
            <li> worst razor ever - the idea is cool, but I tried to shave my head on the shortest setting with the adapter and got chunked, patches. I am keeping it but only using it to shave my head bald.  The adapter is horrible!</li>
            <li> The best hair clippers I have even purchased</li>
            <li> It does not work so well for beards and it does not work around the ears of my young boy but the fast speed helped to not pull on hair. The selectable height is nice but i think that is why it is not so good in tight places. it is nice not worrying about loosing all of the combs that set the height.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> nice box,&lt;br /&gt;can not wait to use it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was supposed to adjust to whatever length one wanted to cut his hair. The setting does not hold and the the result is a mangled hair cut. i am returning it. Fortunately I was able to use an older clipper to salvage my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Really like the Norelco brand for hair clippers. My last clippers lasted 16 years. I cut my husband and two boys hair.</li>
            <li> not powerful enough and/or sharp enough for cutting normal hair</li>
            <li> its really amazing and the best thing the turbo button</li>
            <li> But then again: it&#x27;s easier to please someone with a new sharp tool, if that someone had been using very old trimmer for over 10 years lol&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is a gap in plastic attachment right where the blade is, which makes it difficult to keep an even cut in some spots on very close adjustment setting.</li>
            <li> They need to add the blades extension because with the plastic extension you can not cut the low hair comfortably.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy ,it&#x27;s good,but the length I control is limited</li>
            <li> super, i use it every day.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is super nice! My cousin decided to get one for his brother. The way u can change the size is amazingly nice and smooth! Love it!</li>
            <li> Nicely done. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very high quality. Cut perfect!I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very goor tool, does its job very well</li>
            <li> Bought this as a quality item after my Conair bit the dust. Was pleased to see it came in an attractive hard case, an improvement, so I thought over the small Conair bag full of loose components. When I opened the case I was shocked to see an ugly inner molded paper liner which looked like thin egg carton material. It appeared that it was throwaway packaging but without it the case was just a large empty box where the contents would just bang around. I presume the product manager wanted us to keep the paper liner which did have a depression for the trimmer but it&#x27;s not clear where the other components were supposed to go. Score one for the cost cutters, hope they earned their bonus. They also hurt the corporate image, negating some of those advertising dollars promoting the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure have bad feelings about the brand, especially after seeing the &amp;#34;Product Manual&amp;#34;, the old single sheet, 16&amp;#34; x 20&amp;#34; piece, English, Spanish on the other with the 21 little no word 3/4&amp;#34; X 3/4&amp;#34; instruction sketches. The trimmer works.</li>
            <li> good experience with no disapointment</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. Used three times and it no longer works. I have fully cleaned the unit and it still will not engage the clipper edge. Total disappointment! I would have been better served to have just thrown my money in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product is better suited for cutting hair not beard trimming (unless you have a big full beard). Also, it is larger than I thought. My last model was smaller and more of a beard/hair trimmer.  5stars for cutting hair, 3 stars for face or body trimming.</li>
            <li> Good item. Self haircut can be done with the help of 2 mirrors. While cutting loose hair pile up at the top of the clip and needs to be removed after frequent intervals, which is time consuming. Rest everything is fine. I recommend this product for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to be dependable to the barbers.</li>
            <li> better off with philips multigroom machine&lt;br /&gt;better heavy duty metal blade&lt;br /&gt;faster,stronger&lt;br /&gt;not clear why its not listed when search for philips haircut products</li>
            <li> I am not the person who writes reviews, BUT this is a special case since I am frustrated because of the fact that bad products get hundreds of 5 stars review... I bought this clipper based on customer&#x27;s reviews - now I am totally disappointed ;(  how people can leaf 5 stars for a clipper which clogged after literally everys 2 moves. In order to finish my hair cut , my wife had to stop more then 50 times it made my hair cut 4 times longer. During last 14 years since she cuts my hair,we tried more then 10 brands and models,  we never had such a bad hair clipper as this Philips model. Thanks to amazon for such a great service and amazon prime customer coverage, returned it - now looking for a good working model.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband, he is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> easy to use with the comb packed in it.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this hair clipper. I am a black woman with ridiculously curly, thick and frizzy hair. I keep my hair in a pixy cut to maintain my sanity. I purchased a different Philips hair clipper about 4 years ago that I absolutely loved. When the head piece broke, I asked my husband to look into replacing it (because he used it to). He bought this one and I HATE it. It&#x27;s the wimpiest hair clipper in the world! I realize that most men have nice silky hair that buzzes really easy and for that, I&#x27;m sure this will work fine. But personally, I was very disappointed. I&#x27;m going to have to buy a totally different one to manage my hair.</li>
            <li> Have use it three times and it performed very well.  Charge seems to be able to last for 2 haircuts before recharging which is fine for my use.  Power was sufficient for our short to medium hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to report back later on durability.</li>
            <li> Nice looking, and operate easily. Quickly transportation. Good.</li>
            <li> as long as you don&#x27;t actually need to cut hair with it its great. Wonderful design, feels great in your hand, seems well made, and I love the integrated comb so you don&#x27;t have to be fussing with combs. But all that being said it cuts hair horrible! You can pass over the same spot over and over again and it will randomly cut more and more hair. Not even and takes forever. I tried cutting my hair for 15min and finally grabbed my cheap Wahl that did the work in half the time and cut all the hair that this thing didn&#x27;t after 10 passes. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Hair seems to get clogged in the guide.  Took a long time to get my hair even.  Shame as I like the feel of them and the fact they&#x27;re battery powered.  Probably going to return to Phillips :(</li>
            <li> The worse purchase I have ever made &amp; I like Norelco products. It is nicely designed but it just does not cut hair evenly even on turbo. I will NEVER use it again ,not even on a dog.</li>
            <li> Still use it and I still love it.  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> works great&lt;br /&gt;and nice battery life&lt;br /&gt;i cut my hair around 3 times i didnt charge it yet</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  Motor on it is very slow which affects the cutting and even using the turbo button it isn&#x27;t enough for a good smooth even cut.  I should have sent it back after the first use.</li>
            <li> Does not cut hair, very week</li>
            <li> Very good, is strong, the only fly in the ointment is that the fuselage can&#x27;t wash</li>
            <li> So far I love the adjustability. Been cutting hair since college. Adjustability is intuitive if you start with higher level and adjust. Will update with changes.</li>
            <li> Not trimming the hair to the short length I want. The trim well, but not meeting the needs of really short hair !</li>
            <li> Growing a beard takes a lot more attention than just shaving off all of the hair off of the face.  With the ability to adjust cutting length, I am able to shape and trim my beard very easily.  The design is ergonomic and comfortable to manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage of this set of clippers is that it is cordless.  Because of this feature, I would venture to say that it would be great for working with pets (if he or she is amenable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is quite good lasting me almost 2 weeks.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great set of clippers.</li>
            <li> This clipper works fine for cutting hair, but not so much for other uses.  The cutting area is pretty large, and restricts your view when trying to use it to trip or shape.  I like the fact that it is a cordless clipper.  The charging was fast, and the discharging was slow.  It appears to be well made and durable. though I prefer the blades from the Wahl clippers for close cutting.  These blades seem more geared toward longer hair shaping and grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would keep it simple and most likely stay with the Wahl clippers for hair cuts, and the Wahl trimmers for closer trimming of beards and mustaches.  The Phillips would work great for grooming a child (or maybe even a small animal).  The blades don&#x27;t appear to be as durable as the Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This clipper is a winner for us. I have no way of knowing how well it will hold up over the long haul (I&#x27;ve been using a corded Wahl clipper for many years that is built like a tank), but so far, so good. It&#x27;s much lighter than the Wahl, and so more pleasant for me, the designated clipper. It really does make a difference to not have a cord in the way, tangling up, and to be able to use it outside away from a power source if I wanted. It&#x27;s very easy to change the setting, while you are clipping, without having to substitute a different size guard to get a shorter clip around ears, etc. It&#x27;s sharp! I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the blades were on the Wahl. It&#x27;s also quieter; a nice plus. Be forewarned: it goes from incredibly close to extremely close to very close. We were a little surprised how close the cut was when we chose setting number 5 out of 12.</li>
            <li> I have my head every month or so. I&#x27;ve been looking for a cordless solution for quite some time. This is the first cordless clipper that performs like a corded variety. Tons of power, nice even cutting, and wide enough to be efficient. Best part of all--no need to mess with a ton of different guards to get the right length. With this unit, you simply use on guard and dial in the length you want. Super simple!</li>
            <li> It might be good but not if your hair is thick. It is more like a toy than a hair clipper, there is no comparison between this toy and the WAHL. Perhaps it is not good because of my think hair, i dunno, but i am not going to use it again.</li>
            <li> Charged for about 30 mins then it automatically turned on, cannot be turned off. I have to let the battery run out to stop the noise.</li>
            <li> It works as expected. I would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> First the good: the battery charges relatively quickly (a matter of a couple hours) and lasts multiple trims, and the height adjustments are about as easy as they could be. With a spin of the wheel mounted dead-center on the trimmer, the blade guard is lifted or lowered. The guard is easy to remove to clean - just pull straight up and it pops out of the channels it locks into. The blade itself is in a small housing that can be removed by pushing from the back, allowing you to clean inside (and it will need it). There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; button just under the power button but I can&#x27;t say I quite understand the point of it. Will it trim faster? I didn&#x27;t see any difference - it&#x27;s louder, and the blade does seem to move faster, but perhaps on my thinning hair it isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad, and luckily it&#x27;s relatively minor: patchy trims. I found out quickly that the blade must be held absolutely flat against your head, or else it digs in a bit too far or misses areas. I can only attribute this to the width of the blade, as other trimmers I&#x27;ve had were narrower and didn&#x27;t suffer this problem or at least not as noticeably. It&#x27;s not a dire problem, just one that the user must be aware of, and correct by slowing down a bit to make sure the blade guard rests squarely on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my mom and she really liked it. She has beauty license in Taiwan yet she only cut family member&#x27;s hair for fun (and to save money). It is light weight, powerful, and one charge goes a long way. I soon purchased another one for myself, I&#x27;m a self learner and I cut my husband&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m not half as good as my mom, but I still enjoy this little helper a lot. Unlike my old, bulky hair clipper with tons of changeable heads, this clipper only needs two, so easy and less messy! It&#x27;s probably not powerful enough for professional use, but it&#x27;s certainly good enough for use at home.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used the corded Wahl clippers to inexpensively keep my boys hair under control.  This usually means to attach an extension cord to be able to use it in a space that is easily cleaned.  This cordless Norelco with Lithium Ion battery holds a charge that is effective to get both of them clipped and not to worry about the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  mobility,  decent charge, comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I&#x27;d prefer a soft case for storing this unit over the box it came in.</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for years.  Our most recent brand of hair clippers is a Wahl 79300-400.  While we have been pleased with the Wahl brand clippers, the capability to go cordless with the Philips Norelco HC7452/41 7100 hair clippers was an attractive option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I charged the clippers, clipped the comb on, and let my wife cut my hair.  My hair is a bit on the thin side.  Being the recipient of the hair cut, I thought that this clipper cut through my hair quite well.  The clippers did not pull and yank my hair as I have had other cheap clippers do.  After my wife ran the clippers through my hair, I received a fairly even cut.  There were some stragglers in my hair that did not seem to get cut, but overall it did a decent job.  My wife who was cutting my hair loved the fact she did not have to keep changing combs on the clipper when going from the sides to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really did not see a need to use the turbo on the clippers.  I do not quite understand this option personally.  Maybe it is just something that sounded cool during design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one concern with using a battery powered clipper was that the unit would be less powerful than the corded clippers I usually use.  I did not try the cordless and corded clippers side by side, but this cordless clipper seems to hold its own when it came to its cutting abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downfall with this clipper is that is just did not do very well on surfaces where the contours are changing like with manscaping.  There is something with the comb design that just does not seem to fit well when trying to groom areas that are not smooth consistent surfaces.  It seems like the comb is much bigger than the removable combs I have used on other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is not a bad product.  If the cordless feature is something that could be useful to you, then this might be a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it but the large plastic guard makes it hard to shave accurately and impossible under the nose.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic design helps to prevent tennis elbow</li>
            <li> Did not like this - Did not cut well or as evenly as a normal size plug in clipper.</li>
            <li> I do not use the &amp;#34;trimmer guides&amp;#34; any more because they foul up- getting clogged with hair and then stop cutting. They require constant maintainence which for me is not worth the time spent, so I go to a barber for my haircuts.  I only use electric hair trimmers to shave my face or to give myself a crew-cut during the hot months.&lt;br /&gt;As for the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; setting... it&#x27;s more of a gimmick in my opinion. It seems as if the trimmer normally runs at only 80% power which conserves battery energy, then when switched to Turbo it reaches it&#x27;s 100% power potential.&lt;br /&gt;The titanium blades should keep their edge longer but will only be as good as thier initial sharpening when manufactured.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer has made cutting my sons&#x27; and grandson&#x27;s hair very easy.  The clippers I had before didn&#x27;t have enough length settings and so sometimes the haircut ended up being too short.  Not a problem with these clippers.  They also fit nicely into your hand.</li>
            <li> These are not great clippers, but they will eventually get the job done. We used these on my husband&#x27;s hair and beard and the results were not that satisfying. He has a close cropped hair cut, super easy to just run over with some clippers and be done with, but these took forever to make sure the hair was cut evenly. They&#x27;re not as sharp as other clippers and this is the issue, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side for these clippers, they are fairly quiet and the unit is handheld. These would be great for travel or for using on a child. The price is also steep for me. I know that factor can change, but currently priced at $38 makes me think twice about recommending them. Our typical every-day clippers are the [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]]. They work great and are what I would suggest for clippers that will last years.</li>
            <li> Looking good and small noisy.</li>
            <li> This clipper is similar in size to my old one, which we used for 15+ years on my husband&#x27;s hair and beard. From what I&#x27;ve seen in stores, it is slightly larger than many currently offered.  Keep that in mind when considering this purchase. I really like the cordless aspect and am impressed by the battery. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once so far and have used it three times. The guides are quite accurate and my husband is able to confidently do his own hair if I&#x27;m not around to assist. He keeps his beard very short and this clipper, though a little large, is easy enough, and certainly handy enough, that he always manages to look well-groomed.</li>
            <li> The only point of having something like this is convenience and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lithium ion battery. It makes this thing readily accessible at pretty much any time without having to worry about charging it. (Like drills of old.) It&#x27;s small, easy to use, feels fine in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case sucks, so that docks a star, but otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> I have own a few others Philips clipper/trimmer products. It&#x27;s awesome not to have a cord attached.  I like how simple and easy to adjust comb settings without taking it out. It&#x27;s easy to clean when done. The plastic housing feels a bit cheap but Titanium blade seems working great.</li>
            <li> Got these clippers for my husband to keep his very short hair trimmed---really, these clippers barely had to do any work at all! Yet less than 3 months after purchase, the clippers take a full charge but refuse to power on at all. At this low price point I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations, but surely with such light use the clippers should last at least a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star because the clippers were a success while they were working, plus 1 more star because Norelco is honoring the 2-year warranty by sending a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> Not near as good as other clippers out there.  The blades are too fine and too close together which ends up pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend as a valentines day gift, he uses it every 2 weeks  and loves it.</li>
            <li> I think is a wonderful machine; easy to use and easy to clean. With so many settings for hair length you can really get the haircut you want. The fact that only uses one comb for all settings makes it unique. Great for traveling since its charger adjust itself to different grid voltages; US or Europe. It looks great and feels great. And the manufacturer warranty; Wow</li>
            <li> Ok clipper, except the adjustable comb. The design comes with a learning curve and I am not there. The distance from the tip of the comb to the window for hair is too long, so just the variation of the curves of my head gives me an uneven cut. Would have been better if this distance was similar to other levelers. Disappointed, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again:(</li>
            <li> Charges quickly. Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair clipper. Very practical, and it&#x27;s dual voltage, so you can use it anywhere in the world. Ideal for either beard or hair. Since it has a Li ion battery, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HC7452/41 7100 Hair Clipper is a great clipper. It is comfortable to hold, well balanced, powerful enough to cut through with bogging down and the battery will last through several cuttings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length adjustment is well designed, as a side rotation on the handle it will NOT accidently drop if you put pressure on the guard pressing down on the scalp resulting in a shorter than expected cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the guard is easy to clear and doesn&#x27;t jam up with hair in tiny crevices, hair doesn&#x27;t seem to want to fall out on its own. I have to shake it out regularly to keep the path clear so it can keep cutting. The guard is also fairly short and without long teeth to lift hair up before it reaches the blade you may need to go over the hair several times to lift out hair that may not be showing its full length. The guard length settings on the dial are listed in mm from 1mm - 23mm (3/64&amp;#34; - 7/8&amp;#34;). If you had used other measurements in the past you may have to experiment to learn what length is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; is more of a plastic sales container. Inside is a useless cardboard packaging insert to hold the cutter during shipping. But once that cardboard is removed you have a empty box with nothing to hold things in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are listed as not needing oil and so far so good, it is working great without any need to do any maintenance or blade adjustments as I always have to do on my other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard is easily removed for close trims and edge work and the blade is easily removed for thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> Used only once but much lighter and easier to maneuver than my old corded model.</li>
            <li> Works great when fully charged... usually 2-3 uses to buzz my head... however, i have to go over the same spot at least 2x to make sure that there isn&#x27;t a spot left behind; my other issue is that the hair gets stuck in the corners of the hair guards and needs to be cleaned after every 1 or 2 passes through my hair - which causes hair spots to get left behind, which when traveling, i don&#x27;t mind so much because of the small size and weight of the unit.</li>
            <li> Clipper cuts perfectly without leaving antennas behind. Cutting edges run smooth, not too much of noise, fast to charge, long battery discharge while cutting hair. love that there is no need for lubricant at all.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco NC7452/41 7100 Hair Clipper instantly feels like a quality product in your hands.  It&#x27;s modern and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wireless functionality is also superb, who wants to fight a cord?  The Lithium Ion technology used should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the power compared to a wall plugged clipper seems low.  Therefore, this product is probably best for touch ups and light jobs rather than intense hair clipping.  Recommended product in the correct application.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, not the best but gives a good trim.</li>
            <li> Clipper works well, but the comb system is not very good. The adjustable comb does not work well for the shorter lengths because the front projection remains the same size (large).</li>
            <li> I shave my head once a week, every week. I have been doing this since the 90&#x27;s, so I have used my fair share of clippers. These clippers are a great price and have worked perfectly so far. Unlike some of the other cordless clippers I have used, you can actually used these while plugged in to the charger. This is very nice if you have forgotten to charge them and they die half way through shaving your head! That being said, I have not had these die as of yet ... they seem to last a really long time on a full charge.</li>
            <li> just plain does not trim well, gets backed up quickly and charge does not last long.  My husbands hair is kept short and these clippers leave very blotchy patches of hair as well as needing cleaned frequently during a trim.</li>
            <li> This is quite literally the worst hair clipper I have ever owned. When I purchased it roughly two months ago, I cut my own hair and it cut incredibly short and uneven, and I immediately ran to a professional barber to have it fixed the day before a large graduation ceremony bear in mind. When I looked into why this may have been, I figured out it may have been my fault because it wasn&#x27;t emphasized the levels/lengths at which one cuts for this trimmer are not the same as the typical.&lt;br /&gt;However, having just cut my hair again, because only recently has it grown long enough to justify another hair cut, and bearing in mind the proper levels at which to cut, I discovered it is actually a piece of trash. It butchered my hair once again and proved just to be a completely flawed machine in terms of easily trimming consistent levels of hair even when locked at the same technical length; it just doesn&#x27;t cut consistently as a standard trimmer would, simply because of the design of the adjustable comb. To be honest, I am very irritated that I can no longer return it, having passed that return date. I invested a lot of time looking through trimmers, and a fair amount of money on this one, and it has resulted in a complete disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS. This is perhaps my least satisfied purchase to date from Amazon and a total miss-sell on the part of the manufacturer. Their all in one multi-groom beard trimmer, however, which I bought alongside this, was a great deal - its just a pity this wasn&#x27;t as well.</li>
            <li> We have had a variety of Phillips clippers over the years and this return to a conventional style is a big improvement over the L shaped version that had two different length guides to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium battery is fast to charge and holds the charge at least two weeks so we don&#x27;t have to charge it before each use like the nicad or nimh battery powered models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts cleanly and the coated blades pull a lot less than the old style ones. The comb attachment is easy to dump hair out of, no need to remove it and bang it on the trash can, another improvement over older models.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very quick although traveling and APO 15 days to Afghanistan. Product very good work quietly and precisely.</li>
            <li> I not like the product. He has no strength to cut my hair. I use it just to cut my beard.</li>
            <li> Great clipper, easy to use. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that is uses the same charger as their shavers.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great! I had a DIY, now I need to wear a hat out everyday......really fun</li>
            <li> The adjustment is very easy and does not change accidentally like one I used previously.  I would order this one again.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the easiest to use hair clippers I have owned. It is lightweight, and best thing wireless so I can charge and go. Like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing the different size clip ons, instead you clip it on once and you can adjust the setting to your hair length. I would without a doubt recommend, we bought 2 of them because there that good.</li>
            <li> First review: The design looks great and works fine. The battery last longer than I expected. (four stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Review (One star)&lt;br /&gt;The item was bought July 10, 2015 today is March 11,2016. I use this item every other month for my hair (about an hour) and every other week for trimming my beard (about 15-20 mins or less). The device is still working, however, there is a connection part between the cutting part and the motor it is come out from its place and the blade stopped cutting. Thank god it was the end of my beard trimming. It might  be the epoxy worn off from that part and it came out, but I cannot use this anymore. I wouldn&#x27;t want my hair half cut and fix the device and cut again and fix the device again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s charging fast, easy to use. I&#x27;ve used about 5 hair clippers, This is the best hair clipper ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of hair clippers, from Phillips to Corsair, and this Norelco is better than most hair clippers, but it&#x27;s not as versatile as some of their other offerings. The one piece plastic guard that covers the entire shaver makes it difficult to get into the crevices of one&#x27;s face, and so I can&#x27;t make as precise a trim to my beard as I can with other clippers that have more open designs. If you&#x27;re looking for a good multipurpose clipper, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair cut and no cord.</li>
            <li> Very little power, takes 3 times the regular time to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> what an improvement over prior model!</li>
            <li> used twice--works fine.  Fast cut</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity and performance of this trimmer.  The guard in front has a short overhang so that it is easier to evenly trim hair at a longer setting.  The battery is outstanding at how quickly it charges and how long it lasts.  The guard stays at the setting you put it at.  I had an older cordless trimmer that would change to a shorter length if you pressed to hard.  I am happy this trimmer does not do that.  Overall I am very satisfied with this  trimmer and would definitely give it as a present to anyone who uses a trimmer knowing they too would love it.</li>
            <li> Not so good for trimming beard. Also, the battery doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair clipper for just a month now. Overall, nothing about it really impressed me but it is a solid hair clipper. The clipper has just one attachment which you can adjust  the length from a twisting slider on the clipper. It works pretty well. The attachment itself is cheap plastic though so i dont know if it can take a fall or such. Since there&#x27;s only one of it you&#x27;d be out of luck if it broke until you got a replacement. Its easy to hold and use i had no problems in that regard. Its quiet for a hair clipper, but also in this regard not very powerful.</li>
            <li> I had a norelco trimmer before this one. This one has wider blade which is way better for me because my trimming takes shorter nowitIts baterry is better than the one i had. I happy with it for now</li>
            <li> Works well and battery lasts long. Width size works well for buzzing head. Also trimmed down groin area and didn&#x27;t pull or cut.</li>
            <li> Works really great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great clippers.! I&#x27;ve owned many different clippers in 50+ years of cutting my own hair and these are the best. Light weight, contoured shape, sharp blades and lots of power. And I really like the smooth points on the blades for gliding over the skin. Trimmed my face first and that was really fast and smooth. I have some really fine hair on top of my head but they didn&#x27;t push down this time. Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper! I can set the length with a number on the dial, and be assured the length will be consistent every time I use it. There is no cord to get in the way either. And what is especially great about this clipper is that the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; does NOT slip when I use it, like I&#x27;ve had problems with all other hair clippers. Great product,and at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really fantastic i get more than i expect,easy to use &amp; Sharpe!</li>
            <li> Smooth and comfort. It has adjustable head so you don&#x27;t need anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think i need many time to practice.</li>
            <li> I picked this product out of all the other clippers because of its simplicity. The best feature of it is the adjustable hair guider hence you don&#x27;t need to change hair guider every time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to resemble and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;They delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts hair well. Even for a person who never cut own hair before (myself), i was able to do &amp;#34;2 block hair style&amp;#34; without difficuty. Even without &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; mode (which simply double to triple its speed), it cuts hair well and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Its been almost 3 weeks since i purchased it and used twice only. So far its great.</li>
            <li> Good bye attachments. This clipper has a very unique design with just one attachment. A dial on the back allows for very fine adjustment of the length. Be careful as the numbers do not correspond to existing clipper numbers. I cut my hair, and my two sons in about 40 minutes with this unit. Excess hair is easily removed and the clippers held a great charge for all three clippings. The one adjustable attachment is easily removable for fine sideburn cutting. The design is also quite ergonomic and very comfortable to hold. I was also able to remove my winter beard with this with the attachment removed. Charging only took a few hours and the unit is now in the case awaiting the next hair clipping marathon in a few months.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve used already four times on one charge. Nice quality blades. Since it is quite powerful and sturdy it takes me way less than half the time it took me with my old one. It doesn&#x27;t take lots of room</li>
            <li> Good product, to solve my problem</li>
            <li> Excellent Battery life. I charge for an hour and could use for my entire haircut. When It arrived my wife was asking why so few attachments? It turned out that the adjustable proximity knob is so easy to use. My wife loves it and gives it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Logistics is very fast, a few days time to Chinese. It is also very convenient. Very sharp, do not clip the hair. Awesome</li>
            <li> junk I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this clipper as I have very short thin hair and like to touch my hair up once a week.but will not cut my hair evenly I have tried several times and it doesn&#x27;t work.i have better luck using my Norelco beard trimmer but is to small to use for my hair.i have been using several corded trimmers for many years so I am not new to trimming my own hair.Norelco could not have done product testing on this clipper or they would of found out its short commings .and yes it works no better on turbo mode.</li>
            <li> easy to use, does a great job.</li>
            <li> Very nice, like the way it cuts.  Easy to clean,  fast charging.  Comfortable to hold,  and very nice looking design.</li>
            <li> im so glad with my purchase )) very good product</li>
            <li> Love all but can&#x27;t water clean...</li>
            <li> THIS TRIMERWORKS GRATE VERY SHARP AND QUITE plus hair adjustment is fast and simple.</li>
            <li> Used one time so far. Achieved intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The clipper works fine in cutting my facial hair short. I am very impressed with the 7100 clipper performance and ease of use,</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a beard trimmer and the guard on this one seemed to have the durability and adjustability I was seeking. Lithium Ion battery was a plus, the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; button seems handy for thicker cutting duties. The blades are quite sharp and it&#x27;s nice to grip. I jumped at this one because it checked all the boxes for me, but I ignored one simple fact: it&#x27;s marketed as a HAIR clipper. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this works pretty doggone well as a beard trimmer as well... but, the problem lies in the length of the tines of the blade guard. They&#x27;re about 3/8-1/2&amp;#34; long, making it very difficult to trim your mustache under your nose. I gave 5 stars because the product works admirably well for it&#x27;s intended purpose. As a beard trimmer, I&#x27;d knock off a star since you can&#x27;t do close trimming with it.</li>
            <li> Works well, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Clippers are comfortable to hold and cut excellent without the guard on...with the gurad on I have to make numerous passes to get an even cut.</li>
            <li> I can have my hair cut all by myself.</li>
            <li> Awful beard trimmer. Not even a good hair trimmer. Hair gets gummed up in the guard. Returning and going back to good old Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few times. feels great and works great. I&#x27;m waiting to update after I use it for longer time.</li>
            <li> Large cutter. Amazing battery upto 2 hours in a charge of 1 hour. Silent as well</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut and the adjustable clip is better than adding and removing attachments.  It cuts really short and clean.  Have charged only once and used it 4 times (~40 minutes) without any sign of battery loss.</li>
            <li> works well, cuts well, expect some noise from it especially when using the turbo speed, tho overall not as loud, but not quiet either.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. They&#x27;re very quiet and very efficient.</li>
            <li> Nice Hair Clipper! That is all you need! Very Sharp, easy to go through hair, but the size adjustment isnt that smooth. Overall, I recommend it !</li>
            <li> good quality!&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t find how to use it, with my poor skill</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Does a good job in cutting hair close to the skin and is easy to adjust to the right length for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a veteran, and have been giving myself military-reg fades for 10 years, and these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve used. If you cut fades, you won&#x27;t have to deal with the incessant blade-guard-changing. I was worried, but this also runs right through my really thick hair. The bare blade also shaves skin-close, making it even better as a fade trimmer. Unlike every other cordless trimmer, the battery on this one actually works just as well as with the charging cord plugged in. These are a must have (just don&#x27;t get them wet).</li>
            <li> excellent product I loved it from the moment I got it, fast shipping and great quality materials!!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to struggle to get through my hair. I found myself giving up and going back to my wired clippers just to save time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through way to many pairs of clippers to count and the biggest annoyance is the mess of attachments and cord you have to deal with cramming back into the case each time you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Hair gets stuck to everything, especially if you oil your blades as often as you should and ultimately it&#x27;s just kind of a messy pain.&lt;br /&gt;But my wife cuts like a professional stylist and it&#x27;s quicker and easier to get a trim on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you see that this trimmer is not only cordless, oiless, the blades detach for easy cleaning and it has a single attachment that adjusts it all seems like a sweet deal.&lt;br /&gt;And it is but the problem is that the trimmers themselves just aren&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use trimmers not only to get my hair cut but to quickly widdle down my lazy mans beard before I shave, in both circumstances these blades have snagged my hairs. Even with the turbo they dont seem to go fast enough or maybe they&#x27;re just not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;You really have to slow it down to get the trim or cut you want and you have to pay close attention that the trimmers are cutting correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really given these some time to see if it was just me but I dont think it is. Vine gives us a month to review a product, I have 2 days left, I&#x27;m still just not really thrilled with them.&lt;br /&gt;I think they have a great design but they are just not up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;If you are used to Osters or even cheapy Wahl clippers, you&#x27;re not going to be too excited about these. I&#x27;ll keep em around since they&#x27;re really portable and could come in handy for a quick trim in a pinch but they wont be my go to clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, they work but they shouldn&#x27;t be your first choice. I&#x27;d grab them if you need a portable kit that doesn&#x27;t take up much room. But if you&#x27;re doing home grooming and/or hair cutting, get a better set like Oster.</li>
            <li> Now I can shave my hair by myself</li>
            <li> the bottom part does not fully convince me</li>
            <li> Works great long and short. Doesn&#x27;t pull. I use it regularly to trim or for preshave. I was stressed finding the right one and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast charging, noise is not that loud.</li>
            <li> Awful clippers.  Left Vanilla Ice stripes in my hair.  If that is your thing then you should buy these.  You&#x27;ll be awesome.</li>
            <li> Positive: fast delivery, easy to use, does not need many attachments, competitively prized from other leading brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: misleading 5yr. warranty from Manufacturer as written in the warranty card and retail box....but when you register it, it says only additional 6 months from the basic 2yr.....so only 2yr and 6months in total.......now, I&#x27;m having a second thought about its reliability as claimed by manufacturer......may or may not last for 5yrs. or worst only 3yrs life span???</li>
            <li> Sharp, a little noise, but better than my old one, and package is very cool.</li>
            <li> i love this hair clipper. high quality, great price,&lt;br /&gt;the only cons - it won&#x27;t trim ur head/face as dedicated Balding trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;the 0.5 mm is not really 0.5 (at least on my opinion)</li>
            <li> Titanium blades are awesome</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and all many adjustments with one turn&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient to have a cordless hair clipper</li>
            <li> my family like it.it feel good.</li>
            <li> Great clipper! The battery on it seems to last forever I have not charged it in over 6 months and it&#x27;s still got power.. After all this time I had it I found out there is a turbo button that adds more power to it! It is not very obvious but right under the power button there is a button with the letter &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and you can press it after you turn the clipper on to boost the power. The only two things I would improve about it is the carrying case (pretty flimsy and overly big) and at least make it water resistant to be able to clean it after uses. But overall a great looking product that gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> Like some others have said the guard/comb gets clogged with cut hair and it prevents cutting more hair until it is cleared. You have to remove the guard, clear the hair and snap it back on after every cut. Not really feasible. So i removed the guard and just cut my hair without it so it is cut as short as is possible. In a week it looks fine. The blades seem good and are removable for washing. The lithium ion battery is great. I used to have the QC5170 and it worked well for 4 1/2 years until the guard broke. Their updated version seems to have some problems the older model didn&#x27;t have so i didn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Good product, very well make . If you are just cutting your own hair, i do not think Turbo is  needed, however, for 5 more dollars to get strong power, I would not hesitate to invest it. Down side of this product is comb, Product have 1 to 23 setting which is good for cutting hair but the way the comb make is kind of wied for first time user, You will have to adjust or change your hair cutting technique becasue comb is not curve enough.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. Only facial shaver I use.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Don&#x27;t ever use the turbo boost. Don&#x27;t know you would need too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 15 years and I used the Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable for travel, but good luck trying to do a decent fade with that or maintaining a slightly longer haircut.  Most you can do is a high and tight haircut or crew cut due to the lack of settings on clippers. So i got this instead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. light and cordless, easy to maneuver, very good for travel&lt;br /&gt;2. one clip, less clutter&lt;br /&gt;3. long battery life - supposedly. I&#x27;m guessing you can leave the charger home for 1 trip if fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;4. maintenance - no oil needed and washable&lt;br /&gt;5. Very quiet due to lack of power. Still can cut hair ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. not as powerful as any corded clipper, a corded clipper feels like a light saber the way it cuts hair. On the upside it won&#x27;t burn against your head and feel like a lawnmower/cattle prod.&lt;br /&gt;2. Charging cord could be much longer to make it somewhat functional as a corded clipper, should have made it USB like remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it gets the job done for what it is unless you have steel wool or kryptonian hair,  plus you&#x27;re pretty much have all the clips at your disposal. I also feel that the clip &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; better than conventional clips because it has better support against your head as the main length of the clipper is behind the comb.  This will be my main all around travel/home clipper as it has easy maintenance and way less clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: -4-11-17&lt;br /&gt;Finally died after 2 years, signs of it dying are the lack of low battery orange light, it will just continue to work until it shuts off.  Still cheaper than 2 haircuts, contemplating on buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 05/17&lt;br /&gt;If you register it online you extend the warranty to 5 years, Phillips paid for both ways shipping and I received a brand new clipper. Great service. I upgraded to a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Been cutting hair fo about 25 years, love these clippers, plenty of power, and last a long time between charging. Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> hey, just got this and tried it out...it&#x27;s not going to work for me. everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but i was wanting a trimmer for very short haircuts. i usually keep my hair less than 1/4&amp;#34;, but i can tell the difference in 1/8&amp;#34;, 3mm, 1mm, even different shavers with no guard (0 guard) cut my hair differently. The problem with this model is the guard flexes a bit when you press it on your head, because it adjusts by simply raising higher above the shaver head. At 2mm or 1mm, you can easily inadvertently press it down to less. The result was after i used it, i could see about 3 different lengths that had been cut around my head. This problem would be much less noticeable at longer lengths. I&#x27;ll have to go back to the standard separate guards that don&#x27;t flex or move at all.</li>
            <li> The first time I cut my own hairï¼Œfailedã€‚need someone to help me</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and cuts hair too! I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic box that I can use to store the clipper. I use it to trim beard and moustache, it works really well. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with a little brush for cleaning the blades like other clippers sometimes do</li>
            <li> Clippers should be easy to use, cut well and have the right sizes. These clippers fit the bill for most people and I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the overall quality of the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Love the dial to change sizes. It is so easy to adjust on the go and way eaiser than changing guides.&lt;br /&gt;+Clean cut, not pulls, sharpe blades.&lt;br /&gt;+Comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;+Solid build; good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-7/8&amp;#34; is the largest size, which may be a little short for some. (It was for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with these clippers. They work well and are priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper! For the past ten years I&#x27;ve been dealing with a clipper that needed to be oiled before each use. This one is ready to go, no oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any issues with the guard preventing me from getting where I need to go, and the guard easily pulls out for detail areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to use the turbo button at all although I keep my hair pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a single guard that adjusts in millimeters. There&#x27;s a conversion on the plastic carrier box for conversion to common guard sizes.</li>
            <li> good product .easy&#x27;to use, value&#x27;for&#x27;money</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my face and bony head</li>
            <li> What you&#x27;d expect out of a cheap razor.  Did not even compare to my $80 Wahl clippers.  Spend the extra $25-50.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2HOE2LU3A25HQ]]The Philips Norelco 7100 Hair Clipper is a highly effective grooming tool.  It has a lithium ion battery that lasts up to 120 minutes on a full charge.  And it&#x27;s cordless.  This is a great benefit when using and angling the clippers to make cuts.  The blades are self sharpening and washable titanium.  The Norelco only comes with one clipper attachment with 23 built in length settings ranging from one sixty fourth of an inch up to seven eigths of an inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a completely different set of features compared to a traditional trimmer such as Wahl.  In my opinion it&#x27;s much easier to use, much more effective, simpler, and modern.  I highly recommend the Norelco 7100 hair clipper for Men who use clippers on a regular basis.  Philips delivers high quality grooming products and at 34.95 this is a product you will use for years.</li>
            <li> This has an OK feel and heft to it, but not like the Remington HC5550 (which I returned) with it&#x27;s rubberized feel, heavier weight and mini-USB recharger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: I like the one built in comb (since I cut my own short hair, I don&#x27;t need more) and the built in length dial with clearly marked length numbers (up to 23?) It&#x27;s got a regular and turbo speed, but regular means too-slow, and turbo means normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The comb has long &#x27;tongs&#x27; that I think are too long. Jury is out on whether this makes it past the trial period. So far with a few tests (waiting for my hair to gow back), it seems ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG Con: The plastic case it comes in --- is a really large, useless waste. If you are over 80 years old, you might think it&#x27;s wonderful - but it&#x27;s not. Shame on them for selling this in anything but a recyclable box. On the other hand, it might store all my extra pens and markers, allowing me to re-claim some beer glasses.</li>
            <li> Awesome&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;It works very precisely. This is what I wanted because I wanted 4mm cut for my head but I couldn&#x27;t find any other hair clippers for that.&lt;br /&gt;I really want this product will come out permanently.</li>
            <li> I have used many different Wahl brand hair clippers over a span of about 10 years. The moment I felt these cut, i knew I would never go back. No more looking for the correct size with the all in one fitting. It&#x27;s also really easy to open and clean during and after haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does clog much easier than any other hair clippers I have ever used. The battery doesnt hold that long of a charge, so cordless is not an available feature for me. It doesnt bother me, but they should have just removed it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is the best I have ever tried within its price range. I don&#x27;t buy clippers if they are over $50. So this is as good as it gets. Although the cleaning sets you back a bit more than other clippers, i love the cut on this one and find the benefit of having a cleaner cut outweighing the fact that i have to clean it ore often. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> It will be very difficult to find worse clippers then this one. Phillips should been ashamed to have their name on this. My 8 year old Wahl is better then this, half these size, and twice the power even with &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; turned on.</li>
            <li> cuts well , the only problem is , need to clean the haisr that stuck on the clipper every few seconds while cutting the hair...</li>
            <li> not very easy to shave back-head hair.</li>
            <li> It come with very good packaging, also come with a well build plastic carry/storage case.</li>
            <li> The points on the metal are sharp, and kind of scratch and dig into my skin.  Batteries last a long time.  Guard is easy and nice, but if you are cutting close, have to watch for the pieces to move apart and not push them down to hard on curves or you will cut your hair too short(my eybrows, haha.)  I like the remington I bought from walmart much better, but the guard was lost, so I was trying something different.  Of the three different razors I&#x27;ve tried, the remington was the best.</li>
            <li> easy to use. Now I can save some money. Plus, back head side is a tough spot.</li>
            <li> It gives very good handing feelings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,but I didn&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li> The product looks good but in comparison to when my barber clips my goatee; it falls short.  You can see light patches of hairs that are longer than others. It&#x27;s not an even cut.  I figured since it&#x27;s cordless it won&#x27;t have the cuttin efficiency of a corded machine.  But for what it&#x27;s work it gives a decent cut. If you&#x27;re not as meticulous as me you&#x27;ll find this product appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly for grooming. It cuts hair. You&#x27;ll have to go over several times to get that even fresh look.  My goatee will look patchy when I trim it with this. It just doesn&#x27;t compare to barber clippers. But for the price, and for what I need. It will do.  Mostly touch up stuff in between haircuts. And body grooming.  It does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The only con I can think of - I wish the combs were a little shorter...</li>
            <li> The product is very good, I tried, very good use. You can own a haircut. Logistics soon ah, USA time only a week to dalian.</li>
            <li> Just started using - seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ...</li>
            <li> Best shaver from this company I ever bought. The on off button in a bad spot for cutting your own hair cause you might accidently turn it off, but other then that very close shave without the guards. Love it.</li>
            <li> pro: quiet, easy to handle, ergonomic and robust touch, fast charge&lt;br /&gt;con: the cap design is too big for difficult tasks such as mustache trimming and around ears, not useful for 15mm+ hair cuts or precise trimming lengths below 4mm.</li>
            <li> good price ï¼Œnice hair cliper</li>
            <li> Seems to be the ideal clipper.</li>
            <li> Did not read the instructions, very easy to use</li>
            <li> Performance vice top notch.</li>
            <li> its amazing experience</li>
            <li> Nice feel in my hand, I hate to have to remove the head to clean it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wheel to adjust the length was a bit grabby at first but I developed an alternate way to select , I only use my index finger instead of also using my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;The level of charge and the runtime are great with Lithium-ion, I&#x27;m still on my first charge after running it all week for my modest shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the trimmer a bit hefty to hold, my Panasonic is lighter</li>
            <li> better then the reviews say it is, best shaver i ever had so far</li>
            <li> Very poor design. Hair is constantly getting clogged in the gaurd and you are having to always remove it and shake it off. It takes forever to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good,  excellent battery life,  very  convenient.  i recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this. I use it to buzz my head and my beard and it works really really well. Especially compared to other buzzers.</li>
            <li> I keep my head shaved all the time. My hair is thinning and I say oh well keep it cut short. It works great though. for the price and being a Norelco, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> These clippers worked well.  It cut through the hair quickly and smoothly.  This trimmer has one comb instead of a variety of combs.  This is helpful, especially is you have teens that tend to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; the combs.  You simply select the hair length setting.  My only complaint is that the comb attachment is a bit wide, so it&#x27;s hard to reach smaller areas - behind the ears.  The unit charges quickly.  It took less than an hour to charge.  It can be used with a cord or cordless.  So if the battery runs out you can easily plug the unit and continue with the hair cut.  Some reviewers rated this unit with lower stars, because the comb was a bit wide and they weren&#x27;t able to use it to trim other areas.  I didn&#x27;t deduct any stars, because the promo doesn&#x27;t say it can be used as a &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; trimmer.  For the price, I think these are great clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb settings go up in 1mm increments from 1mm - 23mm (3/64&amp;#34; - 7/8&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco offers a 45-day money back guarantee on the trimmer but you have to pay for return insured shipping plus there are other hoops to jump through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer except for cutters and comb has a two-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the case is flimsy plastic with a cheap cardboard insert and too large for the trimmer and accessories, which includes the charging cord and adaptor, and a small cleaning brush. I would have preferred a storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions come in English and Spanish, and at least the English instructions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> For the past 17 years my husband has been clipping his own hair so he&#x27;s gone through his fair share of hair clippers in that time. He&#x27;s always used clippers either from Remington or Wahl and has been pleased with the results, even when using a cheapie set of clippers.  We fully expected this Philips Norelco hair clipper to be a hit.  Everything about it sounded good.  It was cordless, had an adjustible length guard and seemed like an over all good match for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seconds into using the clipper my husband determined that it wasn&#x27;t as good as it seemed.  The first thing he noticed was his fully charged clipper lacked power.  Worst of all, the clipper didn&#x27;t cut evenly.  So it left tracks or 80&#x27;s style stripes as he clipped his hair.  So once he was done testing out this clipper he had to break out his Wahl balding clippers and finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tubro speed on this clipper gets to about 75% of the speed of the Wahl balding clipper so even at it&#x27;s fastest speed, this clipper is slow.  Not cutting evenly is really bad if you&#x27;re using this clipper to cut your hair.  Perhaps the single adjustable clip is to blame for the uneven cutting.  Sure you won&#x27;t have a lot of clips to manage with this clipper but you also won&#x27;t have consistent results so the single adjusable clip is essentially a fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage case is nothing special.  It had a cardboard insert that I think it meant to just be packing material.  It&#x27;s just a hard case where you can put the clipper.  It&#x27;s certainly not a selling point for this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want all of your hair cut to the same desired length then I&#x27;d advise you to keep looking.  The Wahl Balding Clipper is an excellent alternative that gets great results.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, excellent products</li>
            <li> Like the product worth the price</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Easy to use. Good battery life. So far no cons.</li>
            <li> I like it.It is just what I wanted and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Only a fool will design such an anti-ergonomic thing.</li>
            <li> The blades have no â€˜Titaniumâ€™ carved on it. And I found a scratch on the front face of the blades which makes the Clipper like an used one.&lt;br /&gt;Tthe clipper works OK.</li>
            <li> Product that  give full exp for the money</li>
            <li> not as i was expected</li>
            <li> update on Jul/25/2015: it stopped working and I have to detach the dead, clean it, place it back several times during one hair trimming, and sometime it even does not work when I do so, very said, used only 3 times. I have another philips trimmer with wire, used for 4 years, still work well.    too heavy and not easy to cut hair yourself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as noisy as I suspect, I bought two Hair Clippers, one is this for myself and another one is CC5059 for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;this one is almost as quite as the CC5059 if without turbo, and the charge time is also perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent Clipper, simple and powerful. I was impressed when 1st time using it, I got nice haircut by my self.</li>
            <li> This clipper is so much slower and less accurate than my previously clippers (12 yr old Wahl corded).  It takes me twice as long to cut my hair because it misses half of the hair on each pass, and I also need to clean out the clipper head between every pass (on the Wahl it would just effortlessly fall way).  This is a pain in the butt and a downgrade.</li>
            <li> may be used! but it good</li>
            <li> Cuts VERY unevenly. My hair now looks like a bulldog puppy chewed on my head. The blade guard has thin plastic slats that BEND when you put the clippers against your head. This makes every swipe result in an uneven length. Horrible. I&#x27;m RMA-ing this thing immediately.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> These clippers lack the power of any wired clippers, I thought this wouldn&#x27;t bother me since the convenience of being cordless would outweigh the lack of power.. I was wrong. It took multiple passes to cut my not-too-thick hair and the location of the length adjustment is right where I naturally hold the clippers, so as I am cutting its very easy to accidentally change lengths..which isn&#x27;t fun. I returned them and went with a the Remington HC5850 Virtually Indestructible Haircut Kit. Dealing with a cable is better than dealing with lack of power and odd ergonomics.</li>
            <li> great idea and love not having a cord.  Doesn&#x27;t quite get the same shave as a powerful corded one, but really does a heck of a job and I will be using this from now on.  Battery has lasted the entire time each time used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit slippery and hair clippings get caught inside.  But still worth it so far.</li>
            <li> The only reason why it&#x27;s not 5 stars - it isn&#x27;t washable...&lt;br /&gt;Works great.</li>
            <li> excellent power and precision</li>
            <li> Light weight. Trim smoothly. Quiet.</li>
            <li> Really good. Packaging and machine state is really good. In particular, A / s are points that I want Is not progress five years best advantage. Before says anywhere in the world. I think you will be in the future are expected to adhere to a neat hairstyle</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product. shipping has been delay 1 day</li>
            <li> Norelco is well known for its good shavers and the Lithium-ion cordless hair clipper is no exception.  It&#x27;s sturdy, yet light weight and has lots of length settings built right in.  It comes in a handy plastic carrying case with a charging cord, brush for cleaning, and a hair combing attachment. It&#x27;s very convenient to wash the blades and it has a two hours of usage after charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy but easy to use.  It conforms to practically any size hand and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  It&#x27;s nice to have adjustable length setting right on the handle and not have to change to different blades.  That makes it faster to cut hair when you aren&#x27;t fussing around with attachments.  I assume the titanium blades will be self-sharpening, at least that&#x27;s what they advertise. As for turbo boost, I have not needed it because the hair I cut is not very thick.  However, if needed, I think the turbo should be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it has a wide blade width which is not easy to maneuver around  some areas or angles like behind the ears. I still need a mini-clipper for that. The price is reasonable for this type of product. Norelco&#x27;s rotary electric razors last a long time, hopefully with a lithium-ion battery and quality parts the hair clipper will do the same.</li>
            <li> Now that title is not exactly a glowing recommendation but lets see whats going on and what to expect here. I cut my hair myself most of the time with a professional Andis clipper so that is what I am comparing it to. Not exactly fair to the norelco but hey they put the product out into haircut land and are attempting to go up against the big boys; welcome to the fight.&lt;br /&gt;I was initially unimpressed after I charged it and turned it on to a little baby buzz, its only saving grace is turbo switch mode that kicks up the buzz.&lt;br /&gt;You will always want to use turbo unless you are trimming neck lines and slower progressive cuts. After getting used to the guide and how to adjust the thing (you don&#x27;t really know the cutting length until you are cutting so you have to take a little leap of faith there). You can kind of see where the blades rest in relation to the guides and where you use the dial to click set it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news, it does work if you have patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news, it comes no where near close to pro cutters. It is slow going and will take you two to three times longer to get all the hairs in the same path cut evenly. It misses quite a few each pass so you must keep going over and over to get a good even look. Don&#x27;t even think of using it as a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price, not in same league as the big boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9.3.14&lt;br /&gt;Ok I am liking this more than I thought I would, and it is turning out to be my go to trimmer because its just so easy to use being cordless and always ready in the drawer. I am adding a star.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This Norelco has a long battery life (I&#x27;ve used it a lot without any slowdown).  The settings are all very nice.  I have other Norelco trimmers (beard) and the claim of maintenance free is pretty accurate.  The blades just need washing but not oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is a great clipper for the price range.  It doesn&#x27;t have tons of bells and whistles, but it&#x27;s a solid value clipper.</li>
            <li> For details you can just check out my review for the 5100 model. This one is just as great but actually a little superior, buy it.</li>
            <li> Things We Liked:&lt;br /&gt;+ Quick Charge&lt;br /&gt;+ Self-Sharpening Titanium Blades - no oil needed&lt;br /&gt;+ Adjustable Length with single comb&lt;br /&gt;+ Runs Quiet&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be better:&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts slowly - not much speed or power&lt;br /&gt;- Guards prevent cutting behind ears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot about this cutter to like, but the cons are large. It&#x27;s not fast - even on turbo mode it&#x27;s slower than my other clippers. While it gives a good clean cut on the top and sides of the head, getting behind the ears is very difficult. And, after I finished trimming my husband&#x27;s hair, I had to go back over it because there were some uneven spots.</li>
            <li> I use this clipper to cut my hair as short as I can get it.  So this review is more for a person looking for hair clippers for very short or no hair.  I also use it to trim my beard.  That said I liked the performance of this Phillips cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; is a big plus for me and this one holds its charge better than the other cordless brand I used.  It performs better with the cord in terms of power, but is adequate working cordless.  The blades are very good and I find that one pass is all it takes to make a smooth, clean cut.  Another neat innovation is that there is only one guard which is EASILY adjusted for long or short cutting.  No more little bag of different size guards.  That is a great feature.  I use it to trim my beard and the &amp;#34;adjustable wheel&amp;#34; length setter moves easily and is large.  For cutting my hair I took the guard off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is once a cutter&#x27;s blades get dull I just buy a new cutter, but the blades on this cutter can be replaced.  I don&#x27;t know how cost effective that is, but at least there is that option.  I have used Conair, Remington, and Wahl cutters in the past and rate those brands in that order.  I think the Phillips rates up with the Conair cutters, although I have a little cordless Conair beard trimmer that has remarkable battery and blade life and remains the standard for me.</li>
            <li> Two stars because of a few major issues:&lt;br /&gt;- The plastic comb over the blades is so long that you cannot see were the blades are actually are most of the time. Trimming hair becomes a hit or miss activity with that, not a precise action.&lt;br /&gt;- The very long comb has a second problem: a lot of hair will get stuck in there. You have to clean it very often when trimming long hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Turbo Boost is useless. It only moves the blades faster, which does not help with thick long hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;- It lacks a dedicated small clipper, like I have on my beard trimmer, for the hard to get to areas (behind the ears, for instance).&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because a few things are ok:&lt;br /&gt;- No oil needed to lubricate the blades.&lt;br /&gt;- Washable blades.&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively short charge time and long endurance of the battery&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am staying with my old trusty beard trimmer, also for trimming may hair.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my husband hair with hair clippers for years.  This Philips Norelco is different because it doesn&#x27;t come with individual combs for different lengths of haircutting. Instead of using combs to select the length you would like to cut you must twisted dial and picking number instead.  I found it easy to find the number for the length that I would like to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros this clipper is easier to use because you don&#x27;t have to keep changing combs for different lengths of cutting.  The clipper is cordless, which makes it easy to use anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con it is not as easy to glide through the hair as a normal hair clipper, because of the guard it is hard to see what you are doing. This is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars is not as easy to glide through the hair and see what you are doing than a normal hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it gave a fair haircut but took longer because of what I mentioned above.  I would recommend this product if you need a cordless hair clipper and you have trouble finding and not losing individual combs for cutting hair</li>
            <li> We enjoy the freedom of not having to mess with a cord while trying to groom. Also, the dial to select the guard depth seems really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the main con is that the guard doesnâ€™t get close enough to even cut hair at all. My husband has his head shaved close and these clippers cannot help him with that. He can use it for beard trimming and any other hair maintenance he&#x27;d like, but not his head. This is a major negative, since we don&#x27;t want to have a pile of clippers in a cabinet all for different features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers feel like they are of good quality and the charge does seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips hair trimmer. My previous one worked more than 10 years. Since Philips has a good name in home appliances, I decided to buy the Norelco 7100 after a few research on Internet. This product is very quiet and you can hardly hear the noise when you cut hair. The Norelco cuts hair quickly enough in the standard mode. I believe the turbo boost will save more time for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only poor design is the dial/wheel for length setting. Users may accidentally change the length by touching the dial/wheel. Please be careful, when you cut your hair! Hold the end rather than the middle part, because you may twist the dial/wheel and cut more hair.</li>
            <li> Great machine, works perfectly, it takes up very little space and it comes with a hard plastic case. Incredible tool for the price</li>
            <li> verygood verygood verygood verygood verygood verygood verygood verygood</li>
            <li> For this price is perfect!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li> Trims like a champ! Shave my head on 3 every week and cuts very clean</li>
            <li> This new &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; functions very well and is what I was looking for to to replace my older Norelco &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34;. .</li>
            <li> Took significantly longer to cut hair than with corded clippers.  Hair appeared to jam in guard/blades.  Would gladly return this product if I had only kept the box!!! ;)</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really good machine. although i&#x27;ve only used it once the battery seems to last long, it&#x27;s as noisy as my last one. it cuts really good when the hair comb is adjusted to small sizes. I cut my hair with the 23cm length,  i had to go back and forth a couple of times to get an even cut</li>
            <li> Bad/cheap quality. I thought that this even that it was not a professional clipper it was a good one. When you use plastic with number 1 or gets uneven cut. Some 1 or 0,5. The plastic case it is very cheap. Don&#x27;t recommended</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and it charges quickly. The adjustable guide on it is a big bonus and it is easy to remove when you don&#x27;t need it. The thing I like about it most is that it is much quieter than most electric razors.</li>
            <li> Units performs quickly and is easy to use with many adjustable levels.  No need to change combs or try to find them.  Does a professional job.</li>
            <li> this Clipper is very good! I bought it to my father for  Father&#x27;s Day,I think he will like it!</li>
            <li> very nice design works well it&#x27;s especially good if you want a close cut on your beard I have had many different ones in the past and so far this is the best one I&#x27;ve had I recommend this product</li>
            <li> at first glance seems like a great product until you use it. The blades are sharp which is the only good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustments are odd because they don&#x27;t follow the general guard measurements but there is a conversion chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is poor. Couldn&#x27;t finish my 18mo.&#x27;s old haircut without significant loss of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guard design is poor. The hair gets stuck infront of the blades causing you to clean it out every 1/2 of a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back to my old set of wired, traditional clippers. Another Norelco fail.</li>
            <li> I very much liked this purchase.  I with pleasure use and I recommend to each person to get this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Works Great. Pros:Cordless, Adjustable cutting length, Quiet, Charges Fast. Cons: None so far. Great Product for the Cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I loved the design, simplifying all those clipper guards that always get lost and are a pain to change. This design is superior, the iPhone of hair clippers! Impressive work! All hair clippers should use this design!!!</li>
            <li> Nice concept, but the blade does not cut anywhere near as good as my plugin Wahl clipper. It is good for quick trims or little adjustments, but</li>
            <li> very good!!!, easy haircut</li>
            <li> Its an all in one gadget that you will get to love over the years.  I was so confused if I need to get this and a beard trimmer, but now the beard trimmer is collecting dust.  This one helps me trim my beard, mush, cut my own hair, something which I&#x27;m quite happy to do myself, I feel liberated, I know that sounds strange but this simple act is both gratifying and makes you feel self sufficient.  The charging is super fast, I cut my hair, come back after a few weeks and cut it again, then in hardly 15 min its fully charged, I mean I dont&#x27; think about charging it anymore that often.  Its well built, sturdy, good for those who like to get things done fast and well.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from having to keep up with all the attachments that other clippers use.  The only fault I can find with it is hair will stick in the guard but you can easily pop it off and it clears itself then re-attach.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t to solidly built.  It felt like it would break in an instant.  Didn&#x27;t cut well either. Either the blades were dull or misaligned.</li>
            <li> The adjustable clipper is convenient but it gives inconsistent results.  I am going back to the old one until I find a more reliable battery operated clipper.</li>
            <li> This is EVERYTHING I&#x27;ve been looking for. &amp;#62;&amp;#62;Adjustable Head&amp;#60;&amp;#60; that goes 20 levels. I had some other norelco with the head that was always breaking and I tried to get just the head piece from the company but they said no. So I think I bought 3 of them in the end. Really pi$$ed me off and annoyed me. It was the Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System. I went searching for same idea ..Clippers with ADJUSTABLE HEAD and I found this one and it Did happen to be a Norelco, if Not I would have bought from some other company. They are smart to work on improving and doing well with the adjustable head on this elevated product. This one goes to SOooooo many levels that if you were to buy ordinary clippers you would get like 20 pieces. That&#x27;s a Lot ..lol. That would be ridiculous. It&#x27;s strong and battery holds a good charge where you can possible trim a full head of hair 3 times. It has 2 speeds to conserve the battery. If you want it to run as any clippers normally would, you would just set to &amp;#34;turbo.&amp;#34; There is one thing however. The trim head was unaligned and I had to take it off by screwing head off and bending the wire a little bit and then putting the head back on and cuts like a pro. Yes ..I&#x27;m smart enough to know that these are the best types of clippers on the market, also smart enough to tweak and fix things. They are great and its greatness makes up for the unaligned issue. Still gets 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper because my current set is on its way out and i like that this one was cordless and had the one adjustable comb. I really wanted to like this item but unfortunately, it just does not cut hair well. It took at least 3 times as long as usual for my wife to cut my hair. I also missed the return deadline so now im stuck with clippers that don&#x27;t clip....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used regular hair clippers this is a poor replacement.  The built in comb doesn&#x27;t do a good job of lifting the hair, so hair is missed.</li>
            <li> This is a great cordless hair clipper, with built in adjustments so you don&#x27;t need a whole bunch of combs. Much easier to use than the corded Whal I have ben using.</li>
            <li> Excellent clipper, love it.</li>
            <li> It works ok... though not nearly as well as my cheap corded Wahl clippers.  Even the turbo mode is slow, and disappointing.  But this was the only battery powered clipper I could find that had an overall length setting near 1 inch.  For the performance, this should sell for half the price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clipper. Powerful and cuts super close if you use it with out the guide covers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review for a while, but after cutting my hair today, I was reminded that I really hate these things.  I&#x27;m really disappointed with this set of clippers.  These replaced another pair of rechargeable clippers that worked significantly better, but unfortunately died and I this is what I got instead.  I like that these clippers are rechargeable, lightweight, and relatively quiet, but they do not cut well.  At all.  They cut very unevenly and I often have to go over the same spot several times before it&#x27;s cut.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, either.  I&#x27;m a balding guy and use the clippers without a guard.  I&#x27;m having a hard time justifying spending another $45ish bucks for a new set of clippers, but these are terrible and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it too late to return these??</li>
            <li> Excellent  cordless  easy to use for cutting your own hair</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t use this long because it cut unevenly. The angle was very different than a normal clipper. I love the concept of all the pieces in one machine, but it just didn&#x27;t work like we had hoped. The new cordless (Conair 22 Piece Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Haircut Kit)  we bought cuts so much smoother.</li>
            <li> so far so good its a well meant product.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars, if possible. The battery makes it through 1/2 of a haircut, so I have to plug it in to use it. Even after plugging it in, the clippers lag intermittently and result in a patchy haircut. The results were the same when I cut my hair and also when I cut my sons&#x27; hair. I used them for a second cut on my sons and myself in an attempt to be fair to the product. I made sure the clippers were plugged in to charge for a while prior to the haircuts. By &#x27;a while&#x27;, I mean that they were plugged in since the last haircuts, approximately 3 weeks. This made no difference. The clippers still performed miserably and resulted in patchy haircuts. The plastic guide clogs regularly. Also, if you press too hard to get some of the tough to cut places, the fins on the guide can splay open and bring the cutter closer to the skin, which defeats the purpose of the depth guide. I had been using a clipper set by Wahl for the past 15 years, but hoped a low-maintenance, cordless model with new technology would have made the process a little quicker and better, especially with the young boys. Guess I will be sharpening and oiling up the Wahl again or buying something from their line.</li>
            <li> Works great the only issue a little bulky, great price.</li>
            <li> Great clipper, I keep my hair cut close since, having a cochlear implant last year.</li>
            <li> very sharp, good quality.</li>
            <li> This is really wonderful machine and really useful. love it.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely.</li>
            <li> It is true. Very good product, arrived in time.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> This gadget is not suitable for profession use.&lt;br /&gt;However, to common guys,like u and me , that would be enough.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea about  the American brand for  gadgets of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage is about its head, not fit for fixed use.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth cut, I gotta keep removing hair from the guard to keep cutting</li>
            <li> Very fast , is simply amazing speed !</li>
            <li> very nice, and my wife use it on me for fun.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair clippers for many years. My last one&#x27;s power supply went dead, so it was time to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- light weight&lt;br /&gt;- long battery life&lt;br /&gt;- one comb for all sizes&lt;br /&gt;- comes with a plastic box, power supply and a tiny brush&lt;br /&gt;- has a turbo button which boosts its power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Hair is stuck under the comb, very hard to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t cut your hair unless comb is clear</li>
            <li> This thing is great!  I love how minutely adjustable it is.  Also, it holds a charge more than long enough to trim the scruff off my head, and my head is freakishly big.  Really.  I would bet that you could mow your lawn with this thing on one charge.  Well, if you had the time.  Or a small lawn.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t cut my hair, it&#x27;s very weak</li>
            <li> honestly liked my wahl better because even on turbo this thing is very weak. For thick hair like mine, it doesn&#x27;t cut even, you have to do twice the lines to get the same cut that the wahl can do in one. I do like the convenience of having only one buzzer.</li>
            <li> Charged it only twice in the last 6 months. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Works great. You do have to go over the same spot several times to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I love the cordless design, makes the bi-weekly clipping a breeze.  I would recommend if you are going for the look I was.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I am not one to dish out a 1 star (1st time in 87 reviews); however, these clippers are an utter disaster if used on thick hair.  Let me explain.  If you have thick hair get ready to remove the attachment/comb after each pass b/c your hair will get trapped inside it.  Yes it will literally fill up with hair and it will have no place to go unless you remove the attachment.  If you decide to be stubborn and leave the hair lodged in there than the buzzer will not work.  Its as simple as that (yes my hair was dry).  Now I am not ignorant here b/c I see this product got pretty good reviews, so the one thing I have concluded is I sure do fall in the minority with hair thickness.. !! LOL.  B/c I can&#x27;t stress it enough, if everyone had thick hair this buzzer would have either been recalled or simply never made it to production.  Now it brings us to what really defines thick hair?  Well if I grew out my hair there&#x27;s a high chance I would bring back the 70&#x27;s fro&#x27;s from the dead :)  Without the comb I was impressed with this buzzer.  Its sleek and felt good in the hand, has good power and cleared a path real well.  Unfortunately, I was depending on it to perform with the comb attached and utilizing its 23 built in length settings.  PS - I returned this item and immediately received a refund from Amazon.  Quick, simple and convenient.  Unfortunately the review is strictly about the item so my 1 star remains.</li>
            <li> The best hair clipper I ever had.</li>
