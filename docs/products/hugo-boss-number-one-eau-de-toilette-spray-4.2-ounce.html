            <li> great product and excellent transaction</li>
            <li> Good product at good price</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best, it&#x27;s number in many ways...</li>
            <li> I had ordered the same item from Amazon.com but came from different vendor. The smell was a bit different - might have been old. I had seen similar complaint in its review. When I saw it was shiped by amazon.com, then I ordered it. The product was not sealed. The smell is OK (better than the last one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also ordered &#x27;obsession&#x27; for women as a gift at the same time; this item was sealed. Boss may be either a tester or returned item; I was disappointed. I would be careful in ordering such item.</li>
            <li> met my expectations, price is very reasonable. I have got the product on time. For most part, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is what I thought I was ordering and it met my expectations.  Pleased with purchase and with the product.</li>
            <li> Bought as a 63rd birthday gift for my dad, he loves it and and is very happy with it. D</li>
            <li> Kind of a negative title I know, but I&#x27;ve tried so many &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; colognes that just don&#x27;t last.  I have other fragrances that maybe I like better, but if I&#x27;m wearing it to work and they only last a couple of hours, what&#x27;s the point.  Just last week I wore my Number One during a work day and went out to dinner afterwards and was complimented on my cologne (without reapplying)!</li>
            <li> Good product,It is a good product complies with all the features expected and cost-benefit ratio. I recommend it to people who want to buy</li>
            <li> Hugo Boss Number One is the very best men&#x27;s cologne I have found.  Of course this is my opinion and a fragrance smells different on different skin.  I can tell you one thing, I have never worn a cologne that gives me as many compliments as Hugo Boss Number One.  Not long ago a lady came up to my wife and me and she asked my wife if she could make a comment about me.  My wife told her of course, she said, &amp;#34;your husband smells the best of any man I have ever been around&amp;#34;.  Give it a try and I hope you will love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  My sister-in-law gave me this cologne for Christmas at least 30 years ago and I have never been without it.  I have never seen it at a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from random strangers sometimes. Many inquire what I was wearing. The smell really lasts. It never gets boring. Been using for the last 7 years and I know for the first time I wore it, that this is the one that I am going it stick on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider:&lt;br /&gt;When Perfumania offers buy 1 and get 1 50% off, I got two for $54. If you want it right away amazon has a decent price too.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second bottle&lt;br /&gt;its the best I think it wears all day&lt;br /&gt;People stop him great price&lt;br /&gt;Great men&#x27;s Parfum&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> My Favorite!  Wish one could still get the aftershave and deodorant stick...</li>
            <li> S&amp;H and prices were excellent (5 stars). Unfortunately, this is not the same flavor that my wife got used to but was not labeled enough to tell what to buy again. Hence the 4 stars overall.</li>
            <li> I always recieve compliments when wearing this fragrance. It&#x27;s classic.</li>
            <li> Projects like a BEAST! Not for teens or really anyone under the age of 40. You will fill the room if you wear this scent. People will tell you that you smell like old man. Hugo Boss has many great fragrances, but this one is not for young people.</li>
            <li> use for long time, hard to switch, i fell in love and addicted to it like a lover, can&#x27;t go out withou it.</li>
            <li> Great parfum long lasting scent.</li>
