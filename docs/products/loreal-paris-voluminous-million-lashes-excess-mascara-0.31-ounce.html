            <li>the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why everyone else didn&#x27;t like it, this is awesome!</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect for separating lashes.</li>
            <li>One of the best mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li>i think its best i have used</li>
            <li>Best mascara since loreal discontinued Lash Out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as Benefit!</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was tampered with, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!!</li>
            <li>Always a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love it!</li>
            <li>It also has a nice rose smell, which I&#x27;m sure does nothing for the quality, but is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I liked the loreal voluminous million lashes..</li>
            <li>This is a nice volumn mascara.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara for separating each lash, and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>lol ;)</li>
            <li>I admit that I&#x27;m a Sephora-holic, and most of the make-up I buy comes from there, but I do love L&#x27;Oreal for not forcing me to spend $30 on mascara.  </li>
            <li>Will for sure buy again.</li>
            <li>nice mascara that can clean off easily</li>
            <li>This was amazing the first time I tried it, the difference was very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Really separates lashes better than any mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My routine has always been to wear three coats on both the top and bottom of my top lashes, combing in between to separate, and with this mascara I only need two.  </li>
            <li>both upper and lower lashes brush is awesome starts to clump after it gets old by far</li>
            <li>Easy to remove, but does not smudge or run - and I live in the land of perpetual rain.</li>
            <li>and I actually like the cheaper Loreal Voluminous Mascara better.</li>
            <li>If your lashes clump together easily, this is definitely the product for you.</li>
            <li>I ordered my second one easy to apply on</li>
            <li>I certainly did not feel like I had a million lashes.. not even close..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really liking their stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lengthen much, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Loreal products for years and was excited to try this product, but it was way overpriced compared to if I bought it in a regular store</li>
            <li>I get asked pretty frequently if my eyelashes are real.  </li>
            <li>This makes my eyelashes look super long without getting overly clumpy or making my eyelashes stick together.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like big brushes, try the regular Voluminous Million Lashes, as it will give a similar result but with a more manageable brush.</li>
            <li>This looks great on my lashes -- it did clump on my first few uses, but I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s user error and not something wrong with the product.</li>
            <li>The brush actually does help with clumps while still applying a decent amount of mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of their mascaras over the years, and any time they have a new one that has something to do with volume, I give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It would have received five stars, but the brush is a bit unwieldy to use at first because it is a lot longer compared to other mascaras.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes so long, full, and black without clumping or flaking.</li>

            <li> I wish I would have bought the waterproof formula as well, because as it is a bit wet it weights down your lashes a liiiittle bit; but if you add a thin layer of a waterproof mascara underneath it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Makes application difficult and messy.</li>
            <li> It truly add dramatic volume to your lashes, they look false-like.</li>
            <li> I always get complimented on my lashes with some women thinking I wear false ones!</li>

            <li> Is not really I was looking for</li>
            <li> I liked the loreal voluminous million lashes..and then I tried the loreal voluminous million lashes EXCESS and omg! Makes my lashes so long, full, and black without clumping or flaking. I always get complimented on my lashes with some women thinking I wear false ones! Two coats and I look like a celebrity lol ;) the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. On my 4th tube!! Hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara for separating each lash, and it&#x27;s easy to remove. It would have received five stars, but the brush is a bit unwieldy to use at first because it is a lot longer compared to other mascaras. It does help with getting those little lashes, though. If you don&#x27;t like big brushes, try the regular Voluminous Million Lashes, as it will give a similar result but with a more manageable brush.</li>
            <li> Not my fav prefer regular voluminous</li>
            <li> I certainly did not feel like I had a million lashes.. not even close.. even after numerous applications... was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone else didn&#x27;t like it, this is awesome! This is my third time trying a Loreal mascara and I&#x27;m really liking their stuff. I&#x27;m usually a Maybelline girl. The brush is perfect for separating lashes.If your lashes clump together easily, this is definitely the product for you. It&#x27;s almost as good as Benefit!</li>

            <li> I like it I ordered my second one easy to apply on both upper and lower lashes brush is awesome starts to clump after it gets old by far i think its best i have used</li>
            <li> I need to apply once and it stay all the day even when i wash my face, it only remove with makeup remover</li>
            <li> Really separates lashes better than any mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  Applies evenly as well.</li>
            <li> This looks great on my lashes -- it did clump on my first few uses, but I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s user error and not something wrong with the product.</li>

            <li> The mascara was opened when I bought it. It seemed like it was tampered with, but it works great. I don&#x27;t understand why it was opened.</li>
            <li> My recommended mascara. It separates each lash and volumizes every individual strand of hair.</li>
            <li> Go Baby Go! On par with some of the big league designer brands for much less the cost. Always a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Best mascara since loreal discontinued Lash Out. This makes my eyelashes look super long without getting overly clumpy or making my eyelashes stick together. Easy to remove, but does not smudge or run - and I live in the land of perpetual rain.</li>
