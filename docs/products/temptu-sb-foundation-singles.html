            <li>Definitely a great product and this is the line I use in my kit.</li>
            <li>and when I do break out, this does a great job covering it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because I know it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Good stuff...</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation!  </li>
            <li>it is better than paramedical foundation by Dinair or s</li>
            <li>I love the coverage and it stays on until I take it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pay more for the luminesse.  </li>
            <li>And now,  I get so many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it to makeup professionals.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works great with airbrushing, but I needed to put on multiple applications to get any coverage.</li>
            <li>Happy Airbrushingred or pink  undertone  </li>
            <li>B. Amazing NATURAL looking coverage.  </li>
            <li>Much cleaner look and lighter feel, and stays put MUCH better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks natural and it has a nice glow to it - even in pictures.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but after application it lose it quickly</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I got the brand and color name from her, threw away my old foundation, and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stays better than most other foundations I have used, but it will eventually rub off over time.  </li>
            <li>When applied correctly it looks light and natural.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion you are better off buying a regular foundation.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But wish it has a little bit more coverage!</li>
            <li>It is very nice silicone based foundation , the sand color iscompared more to classic ivory with slight yellow undertone , not reddish undertone but also will not make you looks yellow</li>
            <li>( Asian, Latino , South European or South American)  Happy Airbrushing</li>
            <li>Very bummed.</li>
            <li>it stays much</li>
            <li>/b by Kett as Tempu S/B does not make me feel like wearing a mask and mimic better the skin surface as any other silicon based foundation for airbrush systems .</li>
            <li>This is the best foundation that I have found for coverage and color, but it is a little too thick for the Luminess system.</li>
            <li>Forgot to add that this make up will stay on your skin and will not rub into your clothing , not matter you finish it with powder or not , it dry to the smooth touch</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>it is good for warmer days and even if you sweat it will not run down from your face, I love my water based foundation as they just feel much more natural, but I use silicone base for occasional situations where I am sure it will stay on no matter the situation , it is more elastic and will not dry out your skin as much as water based , it have slightly smell when you snuff it from the bottle</li>
            <li>I use it in my airbrush, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use a foundation that is the consistency of water as a normal foundation.</li>
            <li>, it is very natural,dry little slower as water based ,willmake you skin looking smooth with slightly shimmer ( glow) but not as much as satin kust very natural glow depend of how much you going to use it and cover your face , due to the slight yellow under tone it will cover nice purple and darker skin areas, SAND is one of my favorite , it is just exact</li>
            <li>, I will recommend it as well ,not because of the quality but also for the price as the bottle is 1 oz , and if you go to pay in other store you will spend at last $46 or not more , a good product with a nice price , i guess it will last for 3-4 months when used slightly everyday .</li>
            <li>If you use too much it does not look natural so the key is to use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out as often as I did with my old foundations</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all skin tones from classic ivory to light golden beige and skin with slight yellow undertone without red or pink  undertone  ( Asian, Latino , South European or South American)  </li>
            <li>figured that airbrush makeup would be too heavy to wear every day, but I have found the opposite to be true.  </li>
            <li>The new pods only hold about a third of what&#x27;s in this bottle and costs close to double the amount.</li>
            <li>But it is very long wearing and natural.</li>

            <li> Not pleased with this particular pod.</li>
            <li> Temptu has supposedly quit making the foundation in a squeaze out bottle and they only come in the little pods now.</li>
            <li> If a little water gets mixed in with the foundation when its wet, the foundation gets powdery and the color is off...</li>
            <li> The 1 oz bottle lasts roughly 4 months.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long</li>
            <li> Has lasted long past the duration I had expected.</li>
            <li> what i like , i think it have slightly shimmer effect as I see little sparkles after it dried</li>
            <li> You can use a brush, but this stuff is hard to wash out of makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be careful of, you don&#x27;t want to have any water on your face or hands when applying it.  </li>
            <li> Too thin, too runny for regular application.  </li>
            <li> I usually like the Temptu products.</li>
            <li> and it is delicate and not glamour effect, just for every day , as it is silicone foundation</li>
            <li> This makeup is too thick to use with that airbrush.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, too thick and 2 hours after it started to peel off.</li>
            <li> bought this for my airbrush, but it was too thick.</li>
            <li> It made a mess but is so expensive I had to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> but this one was horribly leaky right from the start.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every expensive foundation from Sephora and</li>
            <li> My skin is mediocre .</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because this product is too thick to be used with my airbrush.</li>

            <li> I ordered this to use with the Belloccio system I purchased. This makeup is too thick to use with that airbrush. You can still apply this with your fingertips. I love the coverage and it stays on until I take it off. I am in the process of ordering the Temptu pro system that comes with the 12 bottles of foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation!  When applied correctly it looks light and natural.  I use a kabuki brush and it literally only takes 3 or 4 drops.  If you use too much it does not look natural so the key is to use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Temptu is the gold standard for airbrush makeup IMHO...the Mrs.</li>
            <li> Best airbrush makeup for brides.  Last forever, and looks like skin.  Best applied with airbrush gun, but can be applied with brush or fingers as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year. I recently switched to the temptu pod system and wish I hadn&#x27;t. The new pods only hold about a third of what&#x27;s in this bottle and costs close to double the amount. This product has great coverage for all skin types!</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product and this is the line I use in my kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because I know it&#x27;s good but I tried using it in another airbrushing system and it sprayed out all speckly and messed up my machine. DO NOT use this is anything that&#x27;s not a temptu machine!</li>
            <li> Great product! Has lasted long past the duration I had expected. The cost verses the pod is such a savings!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, too thick and 2 hours after it started to peel off. I sent it back a month ago &amp; Amazon haven&#x27;t respond my messages about my refund. Really bad customer service.</li>
            <li> bought this for my airbrush, but it was too thick. I tried putting it on with a brush, but it was too oily and didn&#x27;t cover well. Even with the primer.  Silicone also caused a breakout.  I&#x27;ll pay more for the luminesse.  Much cleaner look and lighter feel, and stays put MUCH better. Also no breakouts.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best makeup on the market.  I&#x27;ve used just about every expensive foundation from Sephora and nothing has come close to S/B. Amazing NATURAL looking coverage.  It makes my skin look flawless.  My skin is mediocre . And now,  I get so many compliments on my skin.  When I tell people, it&#x27;s not my skin it&#x27;s my make up, they don&#x27;t believe me. The 1 oz bottle lasts roughly 4 months.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on ALL day.  My days consist of 10 hours, and it doesn&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  Give it  try. Superb!</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation that I have found for coverage and color, but it is a little too thick for the Luminess system.</li>
            <li> I have a Belletto studios airbrush but wanted to try this after seeing some awesome youtube reviews. I was very disappointed because this product is too thick to be used with my airbrush. I tried thinning the Temptu makeup with both water and glycerin to no avail. I tried using this as a foundation with out the airbrush and find it gets oily after awhile. In my opinion you are better off buying a regular foundation. Very bummed.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation!  It gives a flawless look with my airbrush. I strongly recommend it to makeup professionals. Thanks!</li>
            <li> For my wedding, my makeup artist used this foundation applied with a brush.  I loved it so much that I got the brand and color name from her, threw away my old foundation, and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;I figured that airbrush makeup would be too heavy to wear every day, but I have found the opposite to be true.  Since I started using this I don&#x27;t break out as often as I did with my old foundations (I have tried a lot of foundations, loreal bb cream, cover girl, lancome teint idole...) and when I do break out, this does a great job covering it up.&lt;br /&gt;It looks natural and it has a nice glow to it - even in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;It stays better than most other foundations I have used, but it will eventually rub off over time.  I think if you use the primer it stays much longer.&lt;br /&gt;I use my fingers to apply it.  You can use a brush, but this stuff is hard to wash out of makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be careful of, you don&#x27;t want to have any water on your face or hands when applying it.  If a little water gets mixed in with the foundation when its wet, the foundation gets powdery and the color is off...&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it in my airbrush, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use a foundation that is the consistency of water as a normal foundation. But whatever. Temptu has supposedly quit making the foundation in a squeaze out bottle and they only come in the little pods now. But it is very long wearing and natural. It stays on my face, not my husband&#x27;s clothes.</li>
            <li> Good stuff... But wish it has a little bit more coverage!</li>
            <li> Needs to be thinned in my airbrush system.</li>
            <li> Too thin, too runny for regular application.  Maybe it works great with airbrushing, but I needed to put on multiple applications to get any coverage. Definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> lasts longer than airpods.better color match</li>
            <li> I have had several Temptu pods but this one was horribly leaky right from the start.  It made a mess but is so expensive I had to continue to use it.  I was using their bronze rand blush so I know the equipment worked. Not pleased with this particular pod. I usually like the Temptu products.</li>
