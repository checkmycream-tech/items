            <li> This color did not last as long as the red color that I bought, but it lasts about 3 days, which is A LOT longer than my regular nail polish lasts!</li>
            <li> Totally dry within five minutes, and last three times as long as regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments on the color and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I do find these polishes harder to remove than regular nail polish</li>
            <li> This lasted 8+ days with only slight wear on the tips ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> My nail polish usually chips the next day using regular polish.  </li>
            <li> Some of the polishes are a little clumpy - like they are a little old -</li>
            <li> I know they say it does not need a base coat, but whenever I do my nails with Vinylux, I start with Orly Bonder, then two coats of Vinylux, followed by the Vinylux top coat.  </li>
            <li> Nail polish usually chips within a day on me ...</li>

            <li> I love the vinylux polishes. They definitely have lasting power!!! I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on! The Vinylux lasts about a week for me, which is amazing. Some of the polishes are a little clumpy - like they are a little old - but it&#x27;s ok. Decent price too!</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly and multiple compliments on the color. Lasted about a week.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is beautiful, long-lasting, and a great color for Spring!  The color is vibrant and pretty, and I love the staying power of Vinylux.  I used to get gel polish done at the salon every 2 weeks and since I started buying Vinylux polishes, I am no longer dropping $40 every time I get my nails done!  It dries quickly and lasts close to a week before it starts chipping.  I know they say it does not need a base coat, but whenever I do my nails with Vinylux, I start with Orly Bonder, then two coats of Vinylux, followed by the Vinylux top coat.  It really does dry quickly and it lasts longer than any other nail polish.  I do find these polishes harder to remove than regular nail polish so I just use pure acetone to take the polish off.</li>
