            <li>and I have had many others comment and ask what I use for my flawless skin</li>
            <li>It exfoliates, cleanses, and leaves moisture which is awesome since every moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used has made my face more shiny than a disco ball.   </li>

            <li>the scent is earthy and pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Even with a good soap, you MUST use moisturizer</li>
            <li>Everybody at work said how my skin was glowing and how good it looked.  </li>
            <li>i did get good results but dont expect overnight miracles.</li>
            <li>so again I did research on the best light one to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap every morning and evening for three months, and now I can tell this is realy a good stuff for my skin which is of combination.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s on the cheaper side for good skin care.</li>
            <li>It felt good when I was soaping the affected areas, but there was no improvement.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t eat junk food that&#x27;s a good start.</li>
            <li>It lathers up good and does not stink.</li>
            <li>This soap really is good for people who have eczema.</li>

            <li>Does a Good Job, Switching from my Sephora face wash, to this, was a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Have combination skin and this soap is drying, so it works good for my oily areas.  </li>
            <li>While I do not suffer from any of these things I still loved the soap.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my face feel so incredibly moisturized.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of products, but this one is really good, it treats my skin.</li>
            <li>it is good for any skin type  </li>

            <li>It is really good to know what I am putting on my skin.</li>
            <li>Since this product was reasonably-priced and claimed to be good against bacne, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not bad, but I don&#x27;t feel its the best for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Adovia Mud IS STILL EXCEPTIONALLY FAB, however not a longterm relief when an outbreak occurs.</li>

            <li>and she was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It does hurt a bit if you get it in your eyes, but just put a warm washcloth over them and it should be good.</li>
            <li>By the way this brand (Adovia)is very popular in Europe and cost there much more.</li>
            <li>Very nice soap with good lather, and very mild.  </li>
            <li>Also, another detail I did notice is that my pores are closing which is phenomenal!</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>soap has a light fragrance which I was happy about because some soaps are so overpowering with perfume.</li>
            <li>This soap is so amazing.</li>
            <li>This soap bar is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having used the product for a couple of weeks, I can say that I will be ordering my own stock soon.</li>
            <li>If an item becomes at all popular, they jack up the price . . .</li>
            <li>I saw this soap had mostly all good reviews</li>
            <li>I bought this because I liked their mask.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone with a skin problem of any kind.</li>
            <li>I use Dove Senstive skin and honestly It think that this soap dries out my skin on my body compared to the dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something else that is quite nice about it</li>
            <li>I must also say, I use their sulfur soap too, both are good, but I like this one slightly more.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li>It felt good on my skin, but I think I need to get more to continue the affect.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena T-Gel is effective and so is a 2% tar shampoo that&#x27;s sold called Nizoral.</li>
            <li>Does the job nicely.  </li>
            <li>This soap has also been found effective at relieving acne</li>
            <li>I rubbed the bar of soap between my hands, and again got a a nice lather going.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to know they won&#x27;t have to put up with the years of frustration and embarrassment that I went through.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and very with the $13 price tag.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle but a nice soap</li>
            <li>great product, great price, fast ship.</li>
            <li>received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I bought one and liked it and then ordered 50 bars for 4 dollars each.</li>
            <li>I like it this kind of soap.</li>
            <li>With Summer just around the corner I wanted to make sure my skin is in good shape.</li>
            <li>This is nice but not as effective for me as the Jericho brand also sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own also.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s magically works great for my skin which is why I love it.</li>
            <li>All i can say is WOW!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice clean unscented soaps that lather well and provide great minerals for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to give a mud based soap a try because I had heard great results that it gives.</li>
            <li>This soap does however clean well and leave my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>Great clean smell.</li>
            <li>It is a great soap, I just can&#x27;t justify spending that kind of money on something that is used up so quickly.</li>
            <li>The size of it is very nice for the price very easy to clean off what some soaps have as like film this does not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my psoriasis, but it does feel nice, and leaves a good clean</li>
            <li>By far one of the best and cheapest products out there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful it has a soft smell</li>
            <li>but it is best product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>He liked it more after I read aloud the description of what is in it.</li>
            <li>smooth transaction, good product</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and I am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I thought that&#x27;d be great, right?</li>
            <li>So easy to rinse off of your face &amp; neck!  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>I am sure a lot of variables go into how a certain soap will affect any one person; this soap seems to work great for some, but it sure didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic, and works great; but, I don&#x27;t understand how it went from $5.99 per bar with free shipping to almost $30 with $11 in shipping.  </li>
            <li>Here are some more detailed notes on this soap and what it&#x27;s good for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She noticed a huge difference and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is a great soap that will leave your skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has very light sent.</li>
            <li>In any case the soap does not irritate my skin, smells nice, and rinses away easily.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and very smooth!</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>I do know I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.    </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s magic on my skin...</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>However, this soap is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I think you get better results that way.  </li>
            <li>and if you by more then 3 there is father discount applied.</li>

            <li>Nothing works better than mud soap bars for treating acne.</li>
            <li>it was ok</li>

            <li>I use it mostly for my face and it gives a very clean feel without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I only wish I bought more bars when it was $6.99, which has now gone up to $9.99!!!</li>
            <li>soap takes a bit to lather and when it does its a very rich lather.</li>
            <li>Just one use and got rid of my blackhead and gave me a nice clean glow.</li>
            <li>Well... it&#x27;s honestly nothing special, but still pretty good.</li>

            <li>it seems pretty good......</li>
            <li>i really excited for the results!</li>

            <li>Washes away clean!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results thus far.</li>

            <li>This product, in my own opinion and experience, is great for people with oily skin; use it in the morning and have not so dry skin during the resat of the day.</li>

            <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>nothing special do not buy</li>
            <li>First, this Dead Sea soap has one of the best exfoliating feelings out of any soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I like this because it isn&#x27;t full of oil and &#x27;moisturizers&#x27;, just minerals that fortify your skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good soap</li>
            <li>I have used it every day and it still looks like a full size bar.</li>
            <li>and I found them uplifting and full of hope.</li>
            <li>My skin used to be very oily at the end of the day, but after using this soap, my skin is more balanced and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t tell if it helps my acne or not, it is a good daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>Good solid product.</li>
            <li>Love this product and would highly recommend this for any skin type!</li>
            <li>Prescription treatments turned out to be both costly and ineffective, so I developed my own treatment strategy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely have fallen in love with this</li>
            <li>I love this soap so much I need to have it in the bathroom at all</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product.</li>
            <li>Soap makes your skin feel oil free and fresh, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in with acne and psoriasis</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>work in order to keep my hands moisturized (and for some reason is not painful like lotion).</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for Cleopatra</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I never realized the full extent as to which</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been only three weeks since I started using this product, but I would say it&#x27;s a good complement to your skin care products.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>The bar is not cracking after a month of use, and seems to be lasting a good amount of time even with 1-2 times a day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does clarify the skin, and it helps cell-turnover (which again, can be drying, but is not a bad thing).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>It also has no bad odor.</li>
            <li>I read the previous reviews on the product and it is all true; I was impressed by how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li>This dead sea mud soap has worked tremendously for my eczema, and it has been an incredible blessing.  </li>
            <li>and right now they are offering free shipping!lotion after using this soap</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, if dry skin is an issue for you, this soap works remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>I am very aware of the different types of soaps/ skin care products that are good for people who have eczema, but my skin is still irritated by a lot of them.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit citrusy, which is light and pleasant, and it does not leave a lasting scent on your skin, which I view as a positive.</li>
            <li>Face feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This soap, however,makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my face was so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>This is a nice soap - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;miracle skin cure&amp;#34;, but dead sea mud is amazing for your skin, and I like that the soap has a clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s mildly abrasive, maybe it&#x27;s the mud, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>If you have mild acne</li>
            <li>Since that time, I have seen tremendous relief of my symptoms (redness, flaking, size of area affected).  </li>
            <li>I see mild improvements in my eczema.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s reducing scaling super quickly.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and works like a dream.</li>
            <li>My child has a mild case, and this soap clears the Eczema in two (maybe three) treatments.</li>
            <li>Combine this with a good facial moisturizer, and you are golden.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels healthier and looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I want to first say that I did receive the soap for free (but was not paid for this review)</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, natural soap that may or may not help your skin.</li>
            <li>I originally bought mud soap on a visit to Israel years ago and loved it so much that I now only use mud soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the soap for about 2 years now, and I can proudly say that I&#x27;m a much less &amp;#34;pimply&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>making a good first impression has never been possible for me.    </li>
            <li>I love this soap, improved dry skin, helped my eczema to be much less irritated, and is great to use on my face as an acne cleanser!  </li>
            <li>She would recommend using a good moisturizer if you have dry skin though, as it can be drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>Therefore, my fair skin still needs to look hydrated and cared for better than I usually get to do.</li>
            <li>By the end of the first bar of soap (2 months)my spots had faded significantly.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff, but a little drying.</li>
            <li>I even tried home remedies (my little sister hooked me up lol).</li>
            <li>and all I could say is WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and the shave is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>Its a shame, i was hoping it would be a great way to even my skin out without using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>after one use, this soap has helped calm the irritation.</li>
            <li>great for all that dead skin build up</li>
            <li>Dead Sea mud soap is great to begin with.</li>
            <li>Their quality is amazing and this product is no different.</li>
            <li>I do not like harsh scents attacking my nose, and with this soap it was happy to breathe aroma-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly worth the price</li>
            <li>my 15 year old daughter has better skin than me</li>
            <li>the soap is abrasive but it&#x27;s a good thing for acne sufferes who need a daily, gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>worth a try</li>
            <li>worth a try</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, I rarely moisturize.    </li>
            <li>Wow -- I read so many glowing reviews about this soap</li>
            <li>You can feel the mud in the soap bar, so it&#x27;s kind of gritty and exfoliating</li>
            <li>fresh  glow  </li>
            <li>I would rate Adovia 5 stars for the product, but the price doesn&#x27;t even make it worth it.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t worth over $40 a bar.  </li>
            <li>Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap - Great for Eczema, Psoriasis or Acne!]]    </li>
            <li>I have had SOME success.</li>
            <li>it does have a mud smell but far better than sulfur.</li>
            <li>I returned to this soap recently after seeing it on here for a good price, as the whole kit is rather pricey.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I tried the soap for 5 days without the mask to see how it worked on its own, then I used the soap with the mask for the next two days.</li>
            <li>I tried the soap for 5 days without the mask to see how it worked on its own, then I used the soap with the mask for the next two days.</li>
            <li>Even if you are fortunate enought to obtain an appointment, you will wait 3 or more hours beyond you scheduled visit and then may only be seen by a physician&#x27;s assistant.  </li>
            <li>but early results are phenomenal and can&#x27;t wait to see after prolonged use.</li>
            <li>The mud soap was also fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that my back is clear of all the acne I had.</li>
            <li>very definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>oughta be worth a-meal-a-week-or-so out of my paycheck eh?&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>That oughta be worth a-meal-a-week-or-so out of my paycheck eh?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth a try</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most of you spent the 50$ for proactive...</li>
            <li>We have had fun testing them and it is something that I have always had an interest in.</li>
            <li>we only use it on the effective areas.</li>
            <li>: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>So that night I showered and slapped my face with the soap like it owed me money, I scrubbed for a good while and left it there till I was ready to get out the shower.</li>
            <li>I love how its all natural and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li>For this reason, the best antibacterial soaps are either one or the other when mixed with water.</li>
            <li>Too many postive reviews and the price went up (sure, other factors involved, but we all know that&#x27;s not all to it).</li>
            <li>My skin feels sooooo clean and looks so good that I&#x27;ve even started going a few places without makeup.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>i give it 5 stars, is not drying like other soap, feels good on the skin</li>
            <li>I wish I can post a picture of my skin right now</li>
            <li>you read right, one recurring blackhead) and I haven&#x27;t have a problem with it since using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save yourself the effort and money - order a couple bars right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>keep a bar right there by the kitchen sink and use it after every dishwashing and also for no reason at all.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice the benefits of this soap right away...</li>
            <li>I have a mild-moderate skin irritation and they claim that this soap would help it, right there in the title.</li>
            <li>Now, whenever it appears, I wash with this stuff for a day or two and it clears it right up.</li>
            <li>unless you have it right up to your nose you may not even notice it.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it and noticed the oilyness and acne come back in full force, I&#x27;m going to make sure and stock up on it.-</li>
            <li>I really like usiong this soap, makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>I assume that this is a combination of oil and sweat, and since like most people I wear shirts most of the day, it doesn&#x27;t really have the opportunity to breathe and dry out.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff its great&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin feeling so soft after first use</li>
            <li>I was able to get half of my body washed before having to re-lather some more soap on my loofah.  </li>
            <li>after leaving it on 3 to 4 mins i gently splash my face with luke warm water and pat dry with a clean towel.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice size bar that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for 11 years and this is the first soap that has worked right away.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s usually enough soap residue to lather up again and go against the grain for an extra close shave that makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>and it kind of feels dry afterward</li>
            <li>Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do, it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume, like the bar from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use this soap after my next workout as I think it will do a great job of cleansing the oily skin on my back and chest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I floated in the Dead Sea in Israel back in 2004 on a Birthright Israel trip and it was one of the best experiences of my life.</li>
            <li>However, the soap does make your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Something about using black soap is very cool too :)</li>
            <li>Great facial soap for daily use but can be a little drying need a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>She does like it very much for a body soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and didn&#x27;t feel drying.</li>
            <li>This soap was very gentle for my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my acne prone, combination skin.</li>
            <li>and it was left very smooth, and I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation what so</li>
            <li>I know it isn&#x27;t doing anything better (or more) than raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a soap to make your skin feel clean, comfortable, and moisturized I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly pay attention to my skin condition when I try a product</li>
            <li>: N**trogena, D*ve, L*v*r 2000 (talk about something that should be abrasive ;))</li>
            <li>maybe couple more months of regular use will help with some of my scars.      </li>
            <li>the first 2 days I noticed an immediate improvement....</li>
            <li>My skin is clear,  now balanced and smooth</li>
            <li>The shampoo I didn&#x27;t love - not muddy enough.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I was pretty nervous about using the soap.</li>
            <li>At first my skin had a glow to it after using the soap.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, clear skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely not one of my favorite face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first because I didn&#x27;t think anything would relieve my psoriasis and acne</li>
            <li>It has a really rich lather and my face feels really soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>Pretty non drying.</li>
            <li>First of all, a bit of a background.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I washed my face the first day and my complexion was better the next day.  </li>
            <li>My facial skin seems to be allergic to most things so this came as a shock to me.  </li>
            <li>Now, I have been using this for the 3 or 4 days that I&#x27;ve had it, and my face is most definitely allergic to it..</li>
            <li>It has not cleared up, but It&#x27;s definitely looking and feeling better than it was.  </li>
            <li>i always test a soap on a nailbrush first.</li>
            <li>maybe I going order more later if it improves for her.</li>
            <li>Thanks customer!</li>
            <li>Used it on my whole body!</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really not easy to find a nice thing to clean the oily face.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what using this product will lead to.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what using this product will lead to.</li>
            <li>After I was done, my skin just felt so soft, smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>I made a pic the first day for a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; , 3 months after the difference is evident</li>
            <li>It helped with my severe ezcema really well!</li>
            <li>I have read extensively about the many benefits:&lt;br /&gt;•Clears up</li>
            <li>My forehead, once bumpy from the ailment, was now beginning to clear up and smooth out.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really work for me!</li>
            <li>I do now! ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now back for my 3 more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brief, I&#x27;ll hope this time ;)</li>
            <li>first night however, I still applied my cort cream and bandages...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back for 6 more bottles of this stuff.... for home, for work, for travel, for backup.</li>
            <li>feel better, and the label ingredients have also talked me into taking Zinc daily (just in case that&#x27;ll help</li>

            <li>I feel better, and the label ingredients have also talked me into taking Zinc daily (just in case that&#x27;ll help too)    </li>
            <li>I am not a national, but I also am a fan of supporting Israel and that is where this soap is made.</li>
            <li>My friend uses a much more expensive soap &amp; has seen similar results, but for the money this is the best deal around.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found if I use the Cortizone at the first sign I don&#x27;t have the itching or pain</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care how much they raise the price on this product !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the soap brands really matter, but this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care if that proves my scientific analysis or not.  </li>
            <li>even an infected hangnail was all better same day.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to get past that and still try this product.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>reviewers offer additional details praising this soap that might address more specific concerns for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes simpler is better and in this case it definitely is!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m the type of guy that HATES to keep putting on all these creams and taking care of my skin as if I were Americas next top model</li>
            <li>but it really works!</li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin...not anymore!</li>
            <li>The soap didn&#x27;t dry out my skin in the areas that turn flaky with regular soaps and did a great job of cleansing my skin in the oily areas.</li>
            <li>it has been great for my dry skin and would definitely recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s pleasant, and I can recommend trying it, especially if you have oily skin/acne on your body</li>
            <li>it leaves my legs feeling very smooth and cleared my psoriasis to half of what they originally were.</li>
            <li>feel not much, but so far so good, used only two times.........8 more words required???</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised that, even though this product is all natural is made my whole body and especially my face break out even more!!</li>
            <li>anyway, I bought this soap 2 weeks ago as I constantly research new products in hopes of relief and SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud soap is a great product that I use on my face and body.</li>
            <li>Iv&#x27;e tried proactive, clean &amp; clear, all that bs.</li>
            <li>The Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap is a great moisturizing soap as well as a healing aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The clay or natural silt, is supposed to bind to the oils and clean the skin.</li>
            <li>What it seems to do is clean very well inside the pores of your skin and deep clean</li>
            <li>What it seems to do is clean very well inside the pores of your skin and deep clean</li>
            <li>OK so I&#x27;m 36 yrs old and have been battling adult acne for 11 years.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed that the soap lasted that long, as I usually use up a bar of soap in 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>ALSO, I&#x27;m very happy with how slowly this soap goes away under daily usage.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be clear, up front, candid, and personal, this means I am not rubbing or scratching like a chimp with no one around to help groom</li>
            <li>(Oils like coconut or olive oil) I was using Shea butter at first but realized the brand I had wasn&#x27;t pure.</li>
            <li>For this reason, the action of this soap is pretty mild.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin,so i wasn&#x27;t sure at first that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yep, at some time they&#x27;ll raise the price because of the positive benefits of this product shared here on amazon....</li>
            <li>It was strong during my first use, but died down significantly after that.</li>
            <li>(Depending on when you read this, this may show up as my first review, which should indicate how much I like it, not that I&#x27;m a shill</li>
            <li>I have to admit, though, that I didn&#x27;t like the product much at first, because I really felt that it was drying my skin out.  </li>
            <li>The soap lasted a remarkably long time even after its many uses.  </li>
            <li>After my first use so much scaling has come off</li>
            <li>Soaking my feet in that is &#x27;over the top&#x27; after a long day on my feet at work.</li>
            <li>I love that it has lasted me so long as opposed to my liquid soaps.</li>
            <li>Other great thing about the soup is after all this use, its seems to stay the same size!</li>
            <li>This Mud Soap works great as an all over body cleanser - I highly recommend it, especially for dry or acne-prone</li>
            <li>I have used a little over 25% of the soap already and my skin looks average, as in NOT SO MANY OR NOT SO NOTICEABLE PIMPLES!!!!</li>
            <li>I have used a little over 25% of the soap already and my skin looks average, as in NOT SO MANY OR NOT SO NOTICEABLE PIMPLES!!!!</li>
            <li>Helps my extremely dry skin feel, and look, better.</li>
            <li>If you overdo it, your skin will get dry and break out more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your face like most soaps do</li>
            <li>REALLY MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL CLEAN, gives skin a fresh look, and deep cleans.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, lasts a long time, and has minimal ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It lathers white and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have a mild form of psoriasis and after 2 or 3 weeks of using this soap, it has almost cleared up and is not as nearly bothersome as what it once was.  </li>
            <li>I had been buying the black soup dudu osun and using it on my face with Shea butter as a moisturizer and it was working nicely to help reduce redness and flakiness.</li>
            <li>but during my slacking the clogged pores started to create large under the skin bumps..</li>
            <li>found that saffron from Avila and vinegar from Portugal are cheaper and certainly easier to buy here.  </li>
            <li>I now use this on my face and it&#x27;s been the softest and purely cleansed</li>
            <li>It has certainly improved the quality of her life.  </li>
            <li>After reading previous reviews, we found it is best to lather up really well and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing off.</li>
            <li>If you want to use that stuff for extra moisturizing that is totally fine, I did some days, but I didn&#x27;t NEED to.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; but certainly works as a soap.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are still present (I didn&#x27;t really think they would go away),&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a month my face was smooth like a baby again, no more oily skin, and many of my post-marks were fading more quickly than usual.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel dry at all, but leaves you with a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>your skin is NOT left feeling dried out -- it feels nourished and happy --</li>
            <li>I have tried everything including a Accutane session that didn&#x27;t do much for me, oral/topical antiboitics, Proactiv, Murad and everything</li>
            <li>so much that I....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really seen results.  </li>
            <li>Also if you use discount code GLOW you will get extra 10% off (any size order)and all orders $25.00 and over ships free (only until March 9th)plus you will get free samples.</li>
            <li>After I rinse I gently rub the bar on my beard and lather up for a shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get a smell out of it.  </li>
            <li>I buy bars for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>All thanks to this bar of mudsoap.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and reasonably priced for this sort of thing.</li>
            <li>All in all, a great soap, and worth a try for at least moderate acne, or those who wish to clarify their complexions after having battled the teen-scourge longer than their time.</li>
            <li>but the product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip my skin and leave it very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really like this soap.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend was really sceptical about it, but after he tried it he uses it just as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t help or hurt the eczema.  </li>
            <li>It suds up really well.  </li>
            <li>It helps out so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a project to handle.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with ezcema for years, and this soap really soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleaded with this soap.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say whether or not I was infused</li>
            <li>thanks so much, will be putting up the review this week on my blog.</li>
            <li>This gentle soaps cleans my skin and face leaving it feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the difference with this soap.</li>
            <li>It really cleans.</li>
            <li>What I have noticed is that my feet are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you hear so much about?</li>
            <li>This soap has really helped his skin out.</li>
            <li>This soap did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You can really feel it cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>do have a whole skin regimen i start with this soap and then move on to my Mary Kay cleansers.</li>
            <li>so i cant really speak about that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin after using this soap and i wasnt a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>As others have posted it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent</li>
            <li>but since it is working I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>I think this soap is really helping her.</li>
            <li>It also does not have a flowery smell which I am very thankful for.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and not dry at all after use.</li>
            <li>It can be drying if you use it too often, so I switch off with a gentle soap-less cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like this soap, a lot.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my daughter&#x27;s psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever really enthusiastically enjoyed)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>absolutely refuse to pay $20 for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>, I guess in this day &amp; age that I can&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>For that, I guess in this day &amp; age that I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is unscented and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone seeing as it has helped my mother so much.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s no cure-all it has done so much to relieve the symptoms.</li>
            <li>and it goes away much quicker.</li>
            <li>it really clearing up any skin problems.</li>
            <li>I came across Adovia through a Groupon purchase and thought since the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>This is working really well.</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>Got this for a friend who had psoriasis, but we haven&#x27;t spoke about it&#x27;s efficiency much.  </li>
            <li>About five days after I started using this soap my eczema had somewhat improved which works for me since really its inflammatory</li>
            <li>This soap really helps.  </li>
            <li>I am very please</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soap but doesn&#x27;t do much for psoriasis</li>
            <li>(I think hormone is the real issue though).</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural soap with no artificial color or fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wondered if an all-natural bar of soap would work and if I would really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>This caused me intense, unbearable itching.</li>
            <li>However, it does advertise to be very helpful to people with psoriasis, eczema, and acne.</li>
            <li>I was actually very concerned</li>
            <li>I always prefer face wash kinda stuff for my face &amp; body wash/shower gel for the whole body.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acne on my face that much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap to anyone!</li>
            <li>I cleaned it off and did noticed that the pimples that were growing to be big mighty adults seemed to kind of dried up...</li>
            <li>It really has not help my skin.  </li>
            <li>Her pediatrician had prescribed an ointment that didn&#x27;t relieve her problem as much as I felt it should....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did very well to disappoint</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap with a wash cloth to ensure that I really got in there and opened up my pores to allow the soap to penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised that this worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I became so addicted to using this soap that I gradually used it more and more.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised that this worked the first time she used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most of everything for mild acne, from accutane to epiduo gel, and while those work, they do not compare to this little bar of soap!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a really good Dead sea mud soap and the search is over!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do remember how I feel about my natural products, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rubbing my forhead right now and they are completely almost gone..</li>
            <li>most soaps later up to a clean white bubbly lather and leave your nails soft enough to file and your hands squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>In fact, it makes them less dry, so I&#x27;m happy about that.  </li>
            <li>There are other face cleanses that I believe are better for oily to combination skin</li>
            <li>This can also be due to my lack of water consumption a day and not always eating foods that contribute to healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that in time it will regenerate back to what it used to look like because she has had some significant skin issues.</li>
            <li>love the fact that this is a natural product, full of nutrients from the Dead Sea that can absorb into my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure those suffering from extreme psoriasis have tried everything.  </li>
            <li>maybe it might work better then the other soap.</li>
            <li>, it sells, and better yet -- sells only to a few special folk in need!</li>
            <li>, it sells, and better yet -- sells only to a few special folk in need!</li>
            <li>My skin felt so clean and it finally wasn&#x27;t oily anymore at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face squeaky clean and hydrated at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from acne pretty much my whole adult life and have tried everything under the sun to control it.</li>
            <li>My skin was left feeling clean, moisturized but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have tried Dove bar soap  and recently fall in love with this amazing little soap bar from Adovia!!</li>
            <li>But most importantly, it leaves my skin as soft as my new Grandsons little cheeks!</li>
            <li>Just a note: it goes fast if left wet, so it&#x27;s great to keep it in a soap case to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>On my first day of use my oily skin became normal and glowing, the redness of my acne subsided a little, and my face felt generally healthy.</li>
            <li>soap IS STILL AND FOREVER SHALL BE MY GOOD FRIEND (I shall never be without it), but of recently, it has now brought only the smallest bit of relief and for a lesser amount of time.</li>
            <li>It makes me much more irritated and itchy and unless I bathe myself in lotion after using this soap it really is not worth it.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and my oily skin seemed to calm down.</li>
            <li>Great for those with perioral dermatitis and with less of a premium compared to other brands</li>
            <li>The more I use this soap, I am finding I need less moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using it on your whole body, I would worry that it might not last long and is therefore a bit pricey, but if you&#x27;re using it primarily to clean your face, it&#x27;ll probably last a good long while.</li>
            <li>as I get older, my skin gets oiler......</li>
            <li>The thing I love about the Dead Sea soaps is that it gives my skin a real \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; and \\&quot;nourished\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>I grew older, however, my face started to change.</li>
            <li>If you use it only on your face, the bar can last more than 3 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, just use a bit more water and it will eventually form enough lather to wash your face.</li>
            <li>I do have occasional eczema patches but during the time of trying the Mud Soap i was free and clear of them</li>
            <li>We lose so many nutrients on a daily basis, and this is another way to try and put some of those back</li>
            <li>Even a quick wash of my feet with this mud at the end of a day makes my feet feel 30 years younger and less used :)</li>
            <li>but I am older now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent sized bar.</li>
            <li>After using Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud soap my face felt soft and well hydrated, i was pretty sure it was a fluke</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a different and interesting scent - not overpowering or bad, just kind of interesting and new if you&#x27;ve never used non scented / natural produts before.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Dead Sea type of products, so trying this out was right up my alley.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this soap</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Sulfur soaps and Dudu-Osun are highly antibacterial.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a winner, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li>I used it as a facial and body soap; As a facial soap, it leaves the skin very clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>That may be due to me using a lot of products, such as moisturizers, sunscreen, or makeup on my face, but I still would have liked that acne to disappear as well.</li>
            <li>but I surly like it so far!!</li>
            <li>My face usually takes a few days to stop reacting to a new soap, but this stuff worked great right away.  </li>
            <li>Not too dry either, just clean.</li>
            <li>Very soothing for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was shocked and impressed.  </li>
            <li>While it has some cleansing action, it is neither very acidic (as with sulfur soap) or alkaline (as with Dudu-Odun, which uses wood ash as an ingredient).</li>
            <li>This soap has really helped to keep my acne prone skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Their products really do make my skin baby-smooth and have helped alleviate the problems I had been having with adult acne.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much on my skin and the lather is rather clear.</li>
            <li>Now the primary reason I bought it was for my daughter&#x27;s eczema, and though it didn&#x27;t cure her, it may have improved her condition and definitely hasn&#x27;t had the negative effect that most soaps do.  </li>
            <li>a tad expensive but a great product.</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not too dry either, just clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So three days have passed and the couple of pimples that were on my face since the product came are completely gone (after using the product for the three nights straight).</li>
            <li>I will purchase the brand I normally use.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m allergic to store brand soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend lathering up with this soap on the affected areas, and then using your normal soap to cover up the smell (it smells like salt).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like a normal bar of soap, except that it looks like the color of mud.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely worth it, it is the only thing that has worked for me!</li>
            <li>I still have a few pimples every now and then, but it handled most of the problem and my skin is healthier than ever.</li>
            <li>I then washed my body as normal.</li>
            <li>I would love to travel to the dead sea</li>
            <li>It is a normal soap.</li>
            <li>It does not foam up like “normal” soap</li>
            <li>This dead sea mud soap was not what I&#x27;m used to, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li>I love Thia dead sea.</li>
            <li>dead sea salt soaks are much more affective</li>
            <li>He has oily to normal skin.</li>
            <li>He has oily to normal skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally while not cheap, it lasts for an impressively long time--which makes it a surprisingly good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>It has helped my eczema tremendously and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has skin problems, or is simply looking for an all natural product to use.</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin felt so clean and tight and somewhat lighter in complexion.</li>
            <li>My eczema flared right back up.</li>
            <li>Although I can say Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap has been the best soap for my eczema so far, the price increase is utterly ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and used a facial brush to gently exfoliate my face, and also clean and remove any dirt or left over makeup.</li>
            <li>To finish this horrible review, I have honestly written this review with the deepest truth and a large effort because I know first hand how annoying pimples can be, especially when you&#x27;re beautiful like me lol!</li>
            <li>To finish this horrible review, I have honestly written this review with the deepest truth and a large effort because I know first hand how annoying pimples can be, especially when you&#x27;re beautiful like me lol!</li>
            <li>While it does leave my face really clean, and after about 2 hours of sitting and waiting a bit smoother, I&#x27;m not sure that the itchy factor is worth it.  </li>
            <li>After gentle washing the oily skin is smooth and a little tingly.</li>
            <li>Have not used long enough to describe skin benefits, but am pleased thus far.</li>
            <li>I have always had a little rash of some kind on the back of my arms, and this cleared it up.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to face wash.</li>
            <li>I break out not into new acne, but into allergy bumps WHILE IM IN THE SHOWER.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to my traditional black soap, its much cheaper and much better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect this product to work like black magic on my face, but I am pleased with the results after using all these other products for a long time.</li>
            <li>I love how this soap feels just barely exfoliating, but gentle enough to use every day, and leaves absolutely no residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 months now and have not seen any improvements in my acne, but my face is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have had eczema ever since I was very young.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will wet a facial mitten first and rub on the soap and use the mitten to clean my face so it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin.</li>
            <li>This is nothing special, I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now and notice absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is in the soap, it could be some common ingredient in hundreds of other products, but all I know is it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks to completely clear but it WORKS!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft, I just want to hold my hands all day!</li>
            <li>I have been going to expensive dermatologist for over 2yrs for eczema &amp; after hundreds of dollars spent this has had the best result by far.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with this soap every morning and then apply a small amount of the Egyptian Magic Cream.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why I apply a small amount of the Egyptian Magic Cream afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper to buy direct from Adovia!</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I saw a definite decrease in breakouts and they haven&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li>When I first started buying this soap, it only cost around $8 a bar.</li>
            <li>It comes in patches, not usually all over.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know what it is in it&#x27;s compound to do this, but it&#x27;s not going anywhere near my face!</li>
            <li>I am even seeing an improvement in my skin tone - 30 years&#x27; worth of acne scars are not nearly as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It has a dark gray-green color and feels smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>The scent is interesting and I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but it seemed a bit lemony to me.</li>
            <li>Cheers and green beer to all! :)  </li>
            <li>Same results for maybe 1/3 of the price, not to mention you get SO much more than the other supposed \\&quot;WONDER\\&quot; brand...</li>
            <li>I use this on my face every other day, the bar will last for more than a year.</li>
            <li>and you can only do so much, but my razor burn is gone, done, over with!</li>
            <li>my skin looks better, I feel like I&#x27;ve dropped a few years already!  </li>
            <li>and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>It is all natural!</li>
            <li>I am now in my early twenties and irritated to see that I still get seasonal and hormonal breakouts!</li>
            <li>This combined with vitamin D3 10,000IU cream has helped considerably!</li>
            <li>But this soap leaves my skin soft and glossy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just wonderful that we found a solution for her skin issues without having someone write a prescription..and then being disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I loved the concept of using Dead Sea mud as soap because I have read about how the Dead Sea mud is very healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried a few other dead sea mud soaps that are out there, and Adovia has been one of the best.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fabulous, I got the soap within less than a week</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I&#x27;m a 24 year old female.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While always a fear prior to writing a positive product review here</li>
            <li>, it appears that positive reviews &#x27;bellow up&#x27; those corporate minds who sell these products and hence they decide to greedily increase their prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I have been signing up and getting many new samples of fashion things and beauty items lately.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s nice to see that the price came back down (again, hopefully just a misprint prior).</li>
            <li>It does seem to relieve some dead skin, but to be honest it irritated my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive, fair skin and the harsh chemicals in the products really dried out and sometimes burned my skin.</li>
            <li>In the final analysis, the adovia soap did not help my eczema and it certainly harmed my compexion.</li>
            <li>It does clean, as any soap would, but i guess it just doesn&#x27;t do much for me :/</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and this soap has helped but there are others soaps with exactly the same ingredients for FAR less.</li>
            <li>I am almost clear.  </li>
            <li>I had hopes this product would clear my acne</li>
            <li>My skin is perfectly clear now after almost a year of continuous breakouts.</li>
            <li>So with my face really clean, I have noticed my poors  are less visible.  </li>
            <li>It also started to clear up my acne immediately.</li>
            <li>She also used the Adovia soap and thought it did help clear up her face.</li>
            <li>so well helps me clear my face</li>
            <li>If it helps clear my skin</li>
            <li>It clearly states part of the purpose is to get rid of the oils.  </li>
            <li>TerraBathe minerals is #1 choice for itching and clear skin.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at how this unusual soap makes my skin feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;I am not getting any younger and I have noticed changes in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>I am using this soap,along with cream to try and clear up a rash type thing on my arms.</li>
            <li>So far, no results.</li>
            <li>While the medium potency steroid helps control some of the itch and inflammation, it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate my symptoms.  </li>
            <li>but this surprised me.</li>
            <li>My wife however, does not use it on her face as her skin is still too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who doesn&#x27;t like creamy cleansers.  </li>
            <li>So as far as its eczema-healing properties, my research is inconclusive.     </li>
            <li>I was in the midst of a depression when I bought this bar of soap, because I had tried everything (prescription, natural remedies, etc.)</li>
            <li>I began talking to girls with confidence again, and I went out with my friends again after nearly 6 months of being a hermit.    </li>
            <li>whole back ,</li>
            <li>THIS SOAP WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN SO SOFT</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s not harsh on the face.</li>
            <li>if you rub the bar itself directly on your skin.</li>
            <li>and see if it heals my breakouts completely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about this soap that my skin responds so well to, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is a</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I never even felt it go near my eyes</li>
            <li>I have used it before going to bed and my skin feels soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It just seems like an all around natural mud soap.  </li>
            <li>am a 26 year old woman who never truly suffered from acne while in my teens.</li>
            <li>and I became increasingly sensitive to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Recently</li>
            <li>I bought it really for my acne problem which I tend to get on my back and sometimes my chest.</li>
            <li>I have had acne since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li>During the summer months I use Clearasil Daily Scrub, because it lifts the oils without drying me out too much, and somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>A bar of cetiphil is really the only thing that doesnt kill me.  </li>
            <li>This product is all natural.</li>
            <li>Antibacterial action.</li>
            <li>* 100% All Natural Moisturizing Soap&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how old the mud is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just have to trust Adovia on this one but however old</li>
            <li>I do suffer from sensitive skin, and some skin issues, and this soap did not irritate or bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this clear or soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like that a bar soap gives so much back</li>
            <li>The soap is 100% natural and keeps your skin feeling moisturized and soft after washing with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;•Is 100% natural</li>
            <li>It also has helped my wife clear up her adult acne.</li>
            <li>My face has always been soft</li>
            <li>so i cant say this product made my face soft</li>
            <li>And of course as mentioned about my skin felt soft and</li>
            <li>One on my neck completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>She says her  skin is so soft now</li>
            <li>It is not harsh at all on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done so much, that I&#x27;m back for more!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am a busy gal...</li>
            <li>STILL OFFERS</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;d died from &#x27;over-application&#x27;.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;d died from &#x27;over-application&#x27;.</li>
            <li>its so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I hope Groupon offers this item again.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 3 weeks, and the acne on my face has completely gone.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li>We covered ourselves in mud and the salt content was so intense that it made me notice every tiny cut or blemish on my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my face too and my face is red the whole day.</li>
            <li>I prefer for my skin to be soft and moisturized after washing.</li>
            <li>All Natural Moisturizing</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>I used this, and only this, for over a week straight</li>
            <li>The dullness seems to have been replaced with a soft glow.</li>
            <li>So far no eczema, psoriasis and acne.</li>
            <li>the way it makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and have healing and cleaning properties.</li>
            <li>Maybe using a natural oil afterwards would replenish my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My two year old granddaughter has Eczema and it broke my heart to see her scratching her skin until it bled.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not meant to - this is a natural product that has all kinds of benefits,</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap all over my body but especially on my hands.</li>
            <li>this soap has dried up most of it with 2 days I will come back to tell you how my skin is within 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>that the soap would when I applied to review it, however, I can safely say that it merely has a fresh soap smell.</li>
            <li>I have not used long enough yet to see full results</li>
            <li>It was broken and had lots of some kind of dust around it.</li>
            <li>I tried this because of the good reviews, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>and i find most of the bar soap that i find in the stores just makes the whole situation 10 times worse.</li>
            <li>I normally do not use bar soap since I personally do not like the \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean feeling of it.</li>
            <li>My problem is like I said, I&#x27;m constantly working out and my face is exposed outside with plenty of pollution in the air and large amounts of my sexy sweat dripping down on my beautiful face :(.</li>
            <li>My problem is like I said, I&#x27;m constantly working out and my face is exposed outside with plenty of pollution in the air and large amounts of my sexy sweat dripping down on my beautiful face :(.</li>
            <li>I would not classify it as an acne soap per-say, unless you have extremely oily skin, in which case the drying effect would help (it isn&#x27;t terrible, nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix), but seems like a great maintenance soap.</li>
            <li>Minerals with certain atomic structures latch onto oils and carry them off the surface of skin, while minerals with other atomic structures penetrate skin and hunt for oils and other atoms with free electrons to complete their outer valences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it a few months ago and liked it a lot but stopped due to the price and regretted it when I ran out.</li>
            <li>And, of course, many others have spent the last thousands of years using Dead Sea silt for exactly this</li>
            <li>I follow up with their raw yellow shea butter and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Every time I wash my face with Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap, my face feels clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so soft and clean, and after a few months of use (you have to be persistent)</li>
            <li>* Contains a unique combination of Dead Sea minerals derived from</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap to anyone who&#x27;s looking for their skin to feel smooth  and  soft and which has ingredients that come from the Dead sea!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the dead sea mud masque, applied to a wet scalp, for 30 minutes to an hour (put a shower cap on - very messy), is very effective in calming the scalp and gently exfoliating (no flakes).  </li>
            <li>The combination I describe above is my optimal approach, but the Adovia sulfur soap and similar products are also pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A decent enough soap, but if you are buying it hoping it will make a difference for your psoriasis, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why, maybe I&#x27;m just one of those lucky people who produce 10X the oil we need for our skin!</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin or irritate it at all, but instead leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>when i get up in the mornings i use a little bit of braggs organic apple cider in a cotton ball to remove some of the oil and surface dirt from my face, then pat my face with very little luke warm water, next i lather up the dead sea soap and cleanse my face very gently!!!  </li>
            <li>At first I used it before going to bed, and when I woke up in the morning, I was surprised to discover that most of the little red pimples had dried up.</li>
            <li>I went to a wholesale store and bought a 14 pack for a few dollars more than I paid for this single bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am on my second bar of this soap and now I have a lighter complexion, hardly any acne, very smooth and moisturize skin.</li>
            <li>In my depression there was suddenly a small glimmer of light.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this soap, it is light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>texture of the soap is pretty rough and sandy.</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m treating with topical steroids, but I&#x27;m adjusting down from an ultra high potency (clobetasol dipropionate) to a medium potency steroid (betamethasone valerate).  </li>
            <li>$8 a bar was already higher than most other dead sea mud soap brands, and one bar goes by so fast (mud soap doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular bar soaps).  </li>
            <li>When u wash this soap off it might feel a little drying but after about 10 minutes ur face feels fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>I first used this soap a few years back along with the whole clear skin kit I got from the Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice website.</li>
            <li>i hv had mild to moderate acne since my teens, in my 30&#x27;s now, there are times when nothing seems to help with my breakouts, i&#x27;ve tried extreme diets, cleanses, pills, lotions and of course proactiv over the years.  </li>
            <li>so I am always open to new options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you suffer pimples and blackheads make so you get a non-pore clogging facial moisturizer, your face will feel like new.  </li>
            <li>One characteristic of the soap that I really like is that it sticks to your skin when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I had a problem with dry skin AND acne, and this soap really took care of it.</li>
            <li>He has tried it twice and said it made his skin uncomfortably dry and he was very itchy.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me - as a matter of fact, it made my skin dry whenever I bathed with it and after that, nothing.</li>
            <li>This however feels just as soft as the dead sea mud mask upon application, it feels creamy with just enough abrasiveness while using to clean my body.</li>
            <li>Its nice soap, but does not last long at all... Seriously softer than any soap I&#x27;ve seen, to the point where it&#x27;s noticably smaller after the first use, and for the price you kindof want it to last.  </li>
            <li>I have  had a  major   problem  </li>
            <li>I have other soap products that work a little better on eczema.</li>
            <li>and it has nature ingredients which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li>Topical steroids are not working and insurance isn&#x27;t willing to pay for more expensive treatments.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently morning and night until the bar was completely gone which took about a month and a half.</li>
            <li>Drier and fine lines are my biggest complaint, I have used this soap for about a week</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used any bar soaps because it always leaves my face feeling dry but this product left my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all been using this soap for the past few weeks and we&#x27;re all pleasantly pleased!</li>
            <li>I have a few favorites but nothing that I am not willing to swap for something that works even better</li>
            <li>good soap especially in hard water.</li>
            <li>so scared I&#x27;d wake up with new lesions all over my clear but dry skin......</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the claim os helping some of the other isuses (excema etc) as I don&#x27;t have those, but I would imagine it can only improve / lessen any kind of skin issue along these</li>
            <li>However, if you have long been suffering from itchy and bumpy skin I highly suggest checking this out.</li>
            <li>I have moderate eczema on my genitals and eyes, and this product completely removes the skin cracks and itchiness that can make eczema a major detriment to one&#x27;s comfort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a winner, and I highly recommend it.nt the last thousands of years using Dead Sea silt for exactly this</li>
            <li>I have only been using this soap for a few days and already I see a huge difference in my face and back.</li>
            <li>Over the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the texture of my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>It also helps to clear your skin on your back as well.</li>
            <li>With 24-hours of the first use, the Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream alleviated the dryness, flakiness and itching.  </li>
            <li>(33 yr old male btw)    </li>
            <li>and it left my face really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 and have adult onset acne on face and back and have tried everything over the counter to treat it.</li>
            <li>apparently until people complain.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my wife as she has sensitive skin and occasional eczema, but now I may have to order again for myself!  </li>
            <li>It helps with acne a bit but not really that much.</li>
            <li>i am older and my skin is not oily but not itchy dry...</li>
            <li>My bruised &amp; bandaged hands almost constantly look like a 94 year old&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This mud soap left my skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but her old scars are fading, which we weren&#x27;t expecting.  </li>
            <li>main issue I had was dry skin, and after about 6 days of use I noticed improvement with this.</li>
            <li>Id highly recommend this soap to those with dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>FYI, when I first started using the soap, I did experience a slight burning sensation....</li>
            <li>have combination skin - oily on my forehead and nose but normal to dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this soap&#x27;s powers was worthy of letting others know.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this soap&#x27;s powers was worthy of letting others know.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are still active, but not as much.</li>
            <li>I was at the point of seeing a dermatologist for help, but I wanted to try this one last thing as it is a natural product and different than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>(a skin condition people are born with and has no real \\&quot;cure\\&quot;) without having to constantly pay so much money.</li>
            <li>face MG217 works alone, as for Adovia Natural Deep Sea Mud Soap, like another reviewer said \\&quot;It didn&#x27;t do anything for me\\&quot; either, I even left this soap on my psoriasis for like 5-10 before washing off</li>
            <li>For some unknown reason I&#x27;ve developed Eczema at the ripe old age of 64.  </li>
            <li>As faras my body goes, this does NOT dry out my legs.  </li>
            <li>I personally am keeping the secret safe this time around and allowing others to give it 5 stars elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not dry, not oily..</li>
            <li>Funny how soap from the same origin can vary in price, even if due to the Middle East situation at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, past soaps I&#x27;ve used (obscuring the brands on purpose)</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea.. you have heard about it before, but what exactly is</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth it because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on the previous reviews, and I have to say I am really amazed.</li>
            <li>My face was so soft and did not feel dry at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and extremely dry skin all over my body and face which is also oily.</li>
            <li>first time trying this soap and after i use it a few times i felt the different on the sking</li>
            <li>It seems almost fatty and gets gooey in the soap dish, but it&#x27;s worth this minor hassle.</li>
            <li>After giving the product a try for a few month, I don&#x27;t notice any positive effects from habitual usage</li>
            <li>I know it helps his skin, but it&#x27;s kind of expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Not too dry, but clear enough.</li>
            <li>a little though, not too much.</li>
            <li>Putting century old dead sea mud on your face and expecting extreme results sounds absurd to most, but it&#x27;s not unrealistic.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I have had many others comment and ask what I use for my flawless skin</li>
            <li> It exfoliates, cleanses, and leaves moisture which is awesome since every moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used has made my face more shiny than a disco ball.   </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap every morning and evening for three months, and now I can tell this is realy a good stuff for my skin which is of combination.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s on the cheaper side for good skin care.</li>
            <li> It felt good when I was soaping the affected areas, but there was no improvement.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t eat junk food that&#x27;s a good start.</li>
            <li> It lathers up good and does not stink.</li>

            <li> While I do not suffer from any of these things I still loved the soap.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my face feel so incredibly moisturized.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of products, but this one is really good, it treats my skin.</li>

            <li> It is not bad, but I don&#x27;t feel its the best for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Adovia Mud IS STILL EXCEPTIONALLY FAB, however not a longterm relief when an outbreak occurs.</li>

            <li> It does hurt a bit if you get it in your eyes, but just put a warm washcloth over them and it should be good.</li>
            <li> By the way this brand (Adovia)is very popular in Europe and cost there much more.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap with good lather, and very mild.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> soap has a light fragrance which I was happy about because some soaps are so overpowering with perfume.</li>
            <li> This soap is so amazing.</li>
            <li> This soap bar is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used the product for a couple of weeks, I can say that I will be ordering my own stock soon.</li>
            <li> If an item becomes at all popular, they jack up the price . . .</li>
            <li> I saw this soap had mostly all good reviews</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked their mask.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with a skin problem of any kind.</li>
            <li> I use Dove Senstive skin and honestly It think that this soap dries out my skin on my body compared to the dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something else that is quite nice about it</li>
            <li> I must also say, I use their sulfur soap too, both are good, but I like this one slightly more.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> It felt good on my skin, but I think I need to get more to continue the affect.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena T-Gel is effective and so is a 2% tar shampoo that&#x27;s sold called Nizoral.</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely.  </li>
            <li> This soap has also been found effective at relieving acne</li>
            <li> I rubbed the bar of soap between my hands, and again got a a nice lather going.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to know they won&#x27;t have to put up with the years of frustration and embarrassment that I went through.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and very with the $13 price tag.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle but a nice soap</li>
            <li> great product, great price, fast ship.</li>
            <li> received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I bought one and liked it and then ordered 50 bars for 4 dollars each.</li>
            <li> I like it this kind of soap.</li>
            <li> With Summer just around the corner I wanted to make sure my skin is in good shape.</li>
            <li> This is nice but not as effective for me as the Jericho brand also sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own also.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s magically works great for my skin which is why I love it.</li>
            <li> All i can say is WOW!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice clean unscented soaps that lather well and provide great minerals for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to give a mud based soap a try because I had heard great results that it gives.</li>
            <li> This soap does however clean well and leave my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Great clean smell.</li>
            <li> It is a great soap, I just can&#x27;t justify spending that kind of money on something that is used up so quickly.</li>
            <li> The size of it is very nice for the price very easy to clean off what some soaps have as like film this does not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my psoriasis, but it does feel nice, and leaves a good clean</li>
            <li> By far one of the best and cheapest products out there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful it has a soft smell</li>
            <li> but it is best product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> He liked it more after I read aloud the description of what is in it.</li>
            <li> smooth transaction, good product</li>
            <li> So far so good!!</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and I am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I thought that&#x27;d be great, right?</li>
            <li> So easy to rinse off of your face &amp; neck!  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> I am sure a lot of variables go into how a certain soap will affect any one person; this soap seems to work great for some, but it sure didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic, and works great; but, I don&#x27;t understand how it went from $5.99 per bar with free shipping to almost $30 with $11 in shipping.  </li>
            <li> Here are some more detailed notes on this soap and what it&#x27;s good for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She noticed a huge difference and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap that will leave your skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It has very light sent.</li>
            <li> In any case the soap does not irritate my skin, smells nice, and rinses away easily.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean and very smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> I do know I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.    </li>

            <li> I have had psoriasis for many years.</li>
            <li> It worked better than the prescription lotion that I had been prescribed by my doctor, and I have not touched the prescription since.  </li>
            <li> Nothing works better than mud soap bars for treating acne.</li>
            <li> it was ok</li>
            <li> I did some research and it turns out the seller has changed the price of this soap so many times.</li>
            <li> Well it doesn&#x27;t do magic and neither did I expect it to</li>
            <li> Try it you will not loss your money :)</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful, helped with itching and started to relive rash within a couple of days, I use it daily and rash is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Top soap choice.  </li>
            <li> and my skin significantly more oily, and</li>
            <li> It is better than the PD cleaser I paid 24 dollar or more.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this soap.</li>
            <li> It makes my face produce even more oil to make up for what was lost.</li>
            <li> I also made sure to wait a minute or two before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> It really does work brilliantly making your face feel so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> It really does work brilliantly making your face feel so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my face and it gives a very clean feel without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I only wish I bought more bars when it was $6.99, which has now gone up to $9.99!!!</li>
            <li> soap takes a bit to lather and when it does its a very rich lather.</li>
            <li> Just one use and got rid of my blackhead and gave me a nice clean glow.</li>
            <li> Well... it&#x27;s honestly nothing special, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Well... it&#x27;s honestly nothing special, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel very clean, and seems to balance moisture in my skin, which keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> It did however make my skin feel very clean after I used it.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my oily skin feeling very clean</li>
            <li> I rate it as a pretty good one.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the soap, I actually loved the color of the soap.</li>
            <li> it seems pretty good......</li>
            <li> i really excited for the results!</li>
            <li> but once you dry off you feel moisturized and great!</li>
            <li> Washes away clean!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> and nothing worked, not only did nothing work, but my skin was also incredibly oily and nothing could manage it.</li>
            <li> This product has been great so far.  </li>
            <li> This product is great at helping to clear up your complexion without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> and it is cheap compared to most face washes.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When using this soap I feel like more pores tighten up without feeling like they are sucked free of moisture.</li>
            <li> , it moisturizes, it kills bacteria, it quells the pain, and more importantly - quells my outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any issues with acne, but this soap still did a good job of keeping my skin looking even clearer than before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> It is better than Proactiv - a lot less hassle and excellent results.  </li>
            <li> This product, in my own opinion and experience, is great for people with oily skin; use it in the morning and have not so dry skin during the resat of the day.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d tried a variety of products but am most excited about this one.</li>
            <li> this product is very good for those with eczema and psoriasis problems and this product is ideal for daily bath, leaving your skin feel clean and hydrated as it is infused with essential minerals.  </li>
            <li> This product is very mild.</li>
            <li> got this product for free so that I can give Amazon members my honest opinion and let you know whether it works and if it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally have the answer to my 15 year search for great skin care.</li>
            <li> and I break out easily.</li>
            <li> Better off with a store brand moisture soap for sensitive skin type and spend your money on a good cream to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> my daughter 7yrs old told me that feel good skin look better</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> However, if you don’t like strong smelling soaps, that might be a plus for you.</li>
            <li> This soap is so good fro you face and clearing the impurities highly recommended to everyone for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m actually touching my check and it feels smooth, not stubbly (just out of the shower/shave)!    </li>
            <li> When I first got the soap, I loved the fresh and clean scent!</li>
            <li> Try not to use hot water use it warm.</li>
            <li> I also notice less oil after I apply my make-up and through out the day which is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Must read the fine print and keep the suds out of your eyes otherwise</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick in pretty box,  VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it on her feet they&#x27;re super soft lol.</li>
            <li> however i apply a little bit of my kid&#x27;s baby lotion and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> for this little bar of mud is the BEST mud</li>
            <li> Then I began to notice that my pores were huge</li>
            <li> &amp; I have already seen a huge change in my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap didn&#x27;t really do anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> The light was getting brighter.</li>
            <li> free  3  </li>
            <li> I think  why  not  try it such   great   </li>
            <li> &#x27;s the important thing to note--after I started using it, after I read the label, after I knew it said avoid eye area...</li>
            <li> My face is either smooth, or looks like the surface of the moon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my primary reason for using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my primary reason for using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can honestly say after using the soap I really did not need any lotion, body butter, cream, etc.</li>
            <li> really enjoy this soap, and reach for it every time I am in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a bar of this soap for Free when I purchased another product from Adovia.</li>
            <li> *Disclosure: I did receive a bar of this for free, but this doesn&#x27;t affect my opinion on it in any way</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I sound like you,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ignore the instructions and apply it as I SEE FIT.</li>

            <li> She said her skin stopped itching and her skin felt velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> Oh, yes and added bonus it makes my skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Just as my experience at the sea, this soap dried out my skin a bit, which would be perfect for those with oily skin...</li>
            <li> I feel it does really great especially under the arms and on ly elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely happy with my purchase and I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> so I can unfortunately (or fortunately?)</li>
            <li> It feels great especially after a sweaty workout or run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Soap did the best job!</li>

            <li> My skin was softer and felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> So far, really good results.  </li>

            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I loved that the soap was able to help me with my zits while moisturizing at the same time</li>
            <li> but seems good so far.</li>
            <li> all the oil and most of my makeup right off.</li>
            <li> and right now they are offering free shipping!</li>
            <li> First, they are quick to respond to all questions and very kind which is a nice bonus (not all sellers are like this, especially in this product</li>

            <li> It makes your skin so smooth and clean feeling</li>
            <li> and I can hear the squeaky clean sound as I am rinsing the soap from my face with water.</li>
            <li> but it leaves hands clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> have found no other soap that works as good as this one.</li>
            <li> it feels great for my psoriasis but is tiny and dissolves quickly in standing water.</li>
            <li> It is worth the asking price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times I used it, but I used up the entire bar of soap - so many, many times.</li>
            <li> After the first week I was no longer experiencing any more breakouts, and my existing acne was already gone.</li>
            <li> but I was surprisingly pleased when I saw the redness in my face dissipate after the first week.</li>
            <li> , I was absolutely excited when I added it to my shopping cart.</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This hyper-saline lake contains significant concentrations of mineral salts with saline levels that surpass ocean water.</li>
            <li> Want more!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll ask my sister for it for Christmas because I love it that much!</li>
            <li> Not drying at all and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> all I ask, is that you remember &#x27;that I am not as rich as you&#x27; and never will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all I ask, is that you remember &#x27;that I am not as rich as you&#x27; and never will be.      </li>

            <li> Great for my acne and dry skin!</li>
            <li> that we both agree that using this mud soap our skin feels really good better the other named brand stuff.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> nothing special do not buy</li>
            <li> First, this Dead Sea soap has one of the best exfoliating feelings out of any soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like this because it isn&#x27;t full of oil and &#x27;moisturizers&#x27;, just minerals that fortify your skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good soap</li>
            <li> I have used it every day and it still looks like a full size bar.</li>
            <li> and I found them uplifting and full of hope.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be very oily at the end of the day, but after using this soap, my skin is more balanced and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t tell if it helps my acne or not, it is a good daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> Good solid product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and would highly recommend this for any skin type!</li>
            <li> Prescription treatments turned out to be both costly and ineffective, so I developed my own treatment strategy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely have fallen in love with this</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much I need to have it in the bathroom at all</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product.</li>
            <li> Soap makes your skin feel oil free and fresh, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in with acne and psoriasis</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> work in order to keep my hands moisturized (and for some reason is not painful like lotion).</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s good enough for Cleopatra</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I never realized the full extent as to which</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only three weeks since I started using this product, but I would say it&#x27;s a good complement to your skin care products.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> The bar is not cracking after a month of use, and seems to be lasting a good amount of time even with 1-2 times a day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does clarify the skin, and it helps cell-turnover (which again, can be drying, but is not a bad thing).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> It also has no bad odor.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews on the product and it is all true; I was impressed by how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li> This dead sea mud soap has worked tremendously for my eczema, and it has been an incredible blessing.  </li>
            <li> and right now they are offering free shipping!lotion after using this soap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if dry skin is an issue for you, this soap works remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> I am very aware of the different types of soaps/ skin care products that are good for people who have eczema, but my skin is still irritated by a lot of them.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit citrusy, which is light and pleasant, and it does not leave a lasting scent on your skin, which I view as a positive.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This soap, however,makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my face was so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;miracle skin cure&amp;#34;, but dead sea mud is amazing for your skin, and I like that the soap has a clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s mildly abrasive, maybe it&#x27;s the mud, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> If you have mild acne</li>
            <li> Since that time, I have seen tremendous relief of my symptoms (redness, flaking, size of area affected).  </li>
            <li> I see mild improvements in my eczema.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s reducing scaling super quickly.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and works like a dream.</li>
            <li> My child has a mild case, and this soap clears the Eczema in two (maybe three) treatments.</li>
            <li> Combine this with a good facial moisturizer, and you are golden.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels healthier and looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I want to first say that I did receive the soap for free (but was not paid for this review)</li>
            <li> Very pleased overall!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, natural soap that may or may not help your skin.</li>
            <li> I originally bought mud soap on a visit to Israel years ago and loved it so much that I now only use mud soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the soap for about 2 years now, and I can proudly say that I&#x27;m a much less &amp;#34;pimply&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> making a good first impression has never been possible for me.    </li>
            <li> I love this soap, improved dry skin, helped my eczema to be much less irritated, and is great to use on my face as an acne cleanser!  </li>
            <li> She would recommend using a good moisturizer if you have dry skin though, as it can be drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Therefore, my fair skin still needs to look hydrated and cared for better than I usually get to do.</li>
            <li> By the end of the first bar of soap (2 months)my spots had faded significantly.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff, but a little drying.</li>
            <li> I even tried home remedies (my little sister hooked me up lol).</li>
            <li> and all I could say is WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and the shave is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> Its a shame, i was hoping it would be a great way to even my skin out without using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> after one use, this soap has helped calm the irritation.</li>
            <li> great for all that dead skin build up</li>
            <li> Dead Sea mud soap is great to begin with.</li>
            <li> Their quality is amazing and this product is no different.</li>
            <li> I do not like harsh scents attacking my nose, and with this soap it was happy to breathe aroma-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Defiantly worth the price</li>
            <li> my 15 year old daughter has better skin than me</li>
            <li> the soap is abrasive but it&#x27;s a good thing for acne sufferes who need a daily, gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> worth a try</li>
            <li> worth a try</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I rarely moisturize.    </li>
            <li> Wow -- I read so many glowing reviews about this soap</li>
            <li> You can feel the mud in the soap bar, so it&#x27;s kind of gritty and exfoliating</li>
            <li> fresh  glow  </li>
            <li> I would rate Adovia 5 stars for the product, but the price doesn&#x27;t even make it worth it.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t worth over $40 a bar.  </li>
            <li> Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap - Great for Eczema, Psoriasis or Acne!]]    </li>
            <li> I have had SOME success.</li>
            <li> it does have a mud smell but far better than sulfur.</li>
            <li> I returned to this soap recently after seeing it on here for a good price, as the whole kit is rather pricey.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I tried the soap for 5 days without the mask to see how it worked on its own, then I used the soap with the mask for the next two days.</li>

            <li> Even if you are fortunate enought to obtain an appointment, you will wait 3 or more hours beyond you scheduled visit and then may only be seen by a physician&#x27;s assistant.  </li>
            <li> but early results are phenomenal and can&#x27;t wait to see after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> The mud soap was also fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that my back is clear of all the acne I had.</li>
            <li> very definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> oughta be worth a-meal-a-week-or-so out of my paycheck eh?&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> That oughta be worth a-meal-a-week-or-so out of my paycheck eh?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth a try</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most of you spent the 50$ for proactive...</li>
            <li> We have had fun testing them and it is something that I have always had an interest in.</li>
            <li> we only use it on the effective areas.</li>
            <li> : I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> So that night I showered and slapped my face with the soap like it owed me money, I scrubbed for a good while and left it there till I was ready to get out the shower.</li>
            <li> I love how its all natural and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li> For this reason, the best antibacterial soaps are either one or the other when mixed with water.</li>
            <li> Too many postive reviews and the price went up (sure, other factors involved, but we all know that&#x27;s not all to it).</li>
            <li> My skin feels sooooo clean and looks so good that I&#x27;ve even started going a few places without makeup.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> i give it 5 stars, is not drying like other soap, feels good on the skin</li>
            <li> I wish I can post a picture of my skin right now</li>
            <li> you read right, one recurring blackhead) and I haven&#x27;t have a problem with it since using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save yourself the effort and money - order a couple bars right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> keep a bar right there by the kitchen sink and use it after every dishwashing and also for no reason at all.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice the benefits of this soap right away...</li>
            <li> I have a mild-moderate skin irritation and they claim that this soap would help it, right there in the title.</li>
            <li> Now, whenever it appears, I wash with this stuff for a day or two and it clears it right up.</li>
            <li> unless you have it right up to your nose you may not even notice it.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it and noticed the oilyness and acne come back in full force, I&#x27;m going to make sure and stock up on it.-</li>
            <li> I really like usiong this soap, makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> I assume that this is a combination of oil and sweat, and since like most people I wear shirts most of the day, it doesn&#x27;t really have the opportunity to breathe and dry out.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff its great&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin feeling so soft after first use</li>
            <li> I was able to get half of my body washed before having to re-lather some more soap on my loofah.  </li>
            <li> after leaving it on 3 to 4 mins i gently splash my face with luke warm water and pat dry with a clean towel.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice size bar that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for 11 years and this is the first soap that has worked right away.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s usually enough soap residue to lather up again and go against the grain for an extra close shave that makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> and it kind of feels dry afterward</li>
            <li> Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do, it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume, like the bar from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use this soap after my next workout as I think it will do a great job of cleansing the oily skin on my back and chest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I floated in the Dead Sea in Israel back in 2004 on a Birthright Israel trip and it was one of the best experiences of my life.</li>
            <li> However, the soap does make your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Something about using black soap is very cool too :)</li>
            <li> Great facial soap for daily use but can be a little drying need a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> She does like it very much for a body soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and didn&#x27;t feel drying.</li>
            <li> This soap was very gentle for my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my acne prone, combination skin.</li>
            <li> and it was left very smooth, and I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation what so</li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t doing anything better (or more) than raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a soap to make your skin feel clean, comfortable, and moisturized I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly pay attention to my skin condition when I try a product</li>
            <li> : N**trogena, D*ve, L*v*r 2000 (talk about something that should be abrasive ;))</li>
            <li> maybe couple more months of regular use will help with some of my scars.      </li>
            <li> the first 2 days I noticed an immediate improvement....</li>
            <li> My skin is clear,  now balanced and smooth</li>
            <li> The shampoo I didn&#x27;t love - not muddy enough.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pretty nervous about using the soap.</li>
            <li> At first my skin had a glow to it after using the soap.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, clear skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely not one of my favorite face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first because I didn&#x27;t think anything would relieve my psoriasis and acne</li>
            <li> It has a really rich lather and my face feels really soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> Pretty non drying.</li>
            <li> First of all, a bit of a background.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I washed my face the first day and my complexion was better the next day.  </li>
            <li> My facial skin seems to be allergic to most things so this came as a shock to me.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have been using this for the 3 or 4 days that I&#x27;ve had it, and my face is most definitely allergic to it..</li>
            <li> It has not cleared up, but It&#x27;s definitely looking and feeling better than it was.  </li>
            <li> i always test a soap on a nailbrush first.</li>
            <li> maybe I going order more later if it improves for her.</li>
            <li> Thanks customer!</li>
            <li> Used it on my whole body!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really not easy to find a nice thing to clean the oily face.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what using this product will lead to.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what using this product will lead to.</li>
            <li> After I was done, my skin just felt so soft, smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I made a pic the first day for a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; , 3 months after the difference is evident</li>
            <li> It helped with my severe ezcema really well!</li>
            <li> I have read extensively about the many benefits:&lt;br /&gt;•Clears up</li>
            <li> My forehead, once bumpy from the ailment, was now beginning to clear up and smooth out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really work for me!</li>
            <li> I do now! ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now back for my 3 more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brief, I&#x27;ll hope this time ;)</li>
            <li> first night however, I still applied my cort cream and bandages...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back for 6 more bottles of this stuff.... for home, for work, for travel, for backup.</li>
            <li> feel better, and the label ingredients have also talked me into taking Zinc daily (just in case that&#x27;ll help</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back for 6 more bottles of this stuff....</li>
            <li> I feel better, and the label ingredients have also talked me into taking Zinc daily (just in case that&#x27;ll help too)    </li>
            <li> I am not a national, but I also am a fan of supporting Israel and that is where this soap is made.</li>
            <li> My friend uses a much more expensive soap &amp; has seen similar results, but for the money this is the best deal around.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found if I use the Cortizone at the first sign I don&#x27;t have the itching or pain</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care how much they raise the price on this product !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the soap brands really matter, but this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care if that proves my scientific analysis or not.  </li>
            <li> even an infected hangnail was all better same day.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to get past that and still try this product.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> reviewers offer additional details praising this soap that might address more specific concerns for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes simpler is better and in this case it definitely is!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m the type of guy that HATES to keep putting on all these creams and taking care of my skin as if I were Americas next top model</li>
            <li> but it really works!</li>
            <li> I also have very oily skin...not anymore!</li>
            <li> The soap didn&#x27;t dry out my skin in the areas that turn flaky with regular soaps and did a great job of cleansing my skin in the oily areas.</li>
            <li> it has been great for my dry skin and would definitely recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s pleasant, and I can recommend trying it, especially if you have oily skin/acne on your body</li>
            <li> it leaves my legs feeling very smooth and cleared my psoriasis to half of what they originally were.</li>
            <li> feel not much, but so far so good, used only two times.........8 more words required???</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised that, even though this product is all natural is made my whole body and especially my face break out even more!!</li>
            <li> anyway, I bought this soap 2 weeks ago as I constantly research new products in hopes of relief and SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud soap is a great product that I use on my face and body.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e tried proactive, clean &amp; clear, all that bs.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap is a great moisturizing soap as well as a healing aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The clay or natural silt, is supposed to bind to the oils and clean the skin.</li>
            <li> What it seems to do is clean very well inside the pores of your skin and deep clean</li>
            <li> What it seems to do is clean very well inside the pores of your skin and deep clean</li>
            <li> OK so I&#x27;m 36 yrs old and have been battling adult acne for 11 years.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed that the soap lasted that long, as I usually use up a bar of soap in 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> ALSO, I&#x27;m very happy with how slowly this soap goes away under daily usage.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be clear, up front, candid, and personal, this means I am not rubbing or scratching like a chimp with no one around to help groom</li>
            <li> (Oils like coconut or olive oil) I was using Shea butter at first but realized the brand I had wasn&#x27;t pure.</li>
            <li> For this reason, the action of this soap is pretty mild.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin,so i wasn&#x27;t sure at first that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yep, at some time they&#x27;ll raise the price because of the positive benefits of this product shared here on amazon....</li>
            <li> It was strong during my first use, but died down significantly after that.</li>
            <li> (Depending on when you read this, this may show up as my first review, which should indicate how much I like it, not that I&#x27;m a shill</li>
            <li> I have to admit, though, that I didn&#x27;t like the product much at first, because I really felt that it was drying my skin out.  </li>
            <li> The soap lasted a remarkably long time even after its many uses.  </li>
            <li> After my first use so much scaling has come off</li>
            <li> Soaking my feet in that is &#x27;over the top&#x27; after a long day on my feet at work.</li>
            <li> I love that it has lasted me so long as opposed to my liquid soaps.</li>
            <li> Other great thing about the soup is after all this use, its seems to stay the same size!</li>
            <li> This Mud Soap works great as an all over body cleanser - I highly recommend it, especially for dry or acne-prone</li>
            <li> I have used a little over 25% of the soap already and my skin looks average, as in NOT SO MANY OR NOT SO NOTICEABLE PIMPLES!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used a little over 25% of the soap already and my skin looks average, as in NOT SO MANY OR NOT SO NOTICEABLE PIMPLES!!!!</li>
            <li> Helps my extremely dry skin feel, and look, better.</li>
            <li> If you overdo it, your skin will get dry and break out more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your face like most soaps do</li>
            <li> REALLY MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL CLEAN, gives skin a fresh look, and deep cleans.  </li>
            <li> It feels great, lasts a long time, and has minimal ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It lathers white and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have a mild form of psoriasis and after 2 or 3 weeks of using this soap, it has almost cleared up and is not as nearly bothersome as what it once was.  </li>
            <li> I had been buying the black soup dudu osun and using it on my face with Shea butter as a moisturizer and it was working nicely to help reduce redness and flakiness.</li>
            <li> but during my slacking the clogged pores started to create large under the skin bumps..</li>
            <li> found that saffron from Avila and vinegar from Portugal are cheaper and certainly easier to buy here.  </li>
            <li> I now use this on my face and it&#x27;s been the softest and purely cleansed</li>
            <li> It has certainly improved the quality of her life.  </li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews, we found it is best to lather up really well and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> If you want to use that stuff for extra moisturizing that is totally fine, I did some days, but I didn&#x27;t NEED to.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; but certainly works as a soap.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are still present (I didn&#x27;t really think they would go away),&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a month my face was smooth like a baby again, no more oily skin, and many of my post-marks were fading more quickly than usual.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel dry at all, but leaves you with a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> your skin is NOT left feeling dried out -- it feels nourished and happy --</li>
            <li> I have tried everything including a Accutane session that didn&#x27;t do much for me, oral/topical antiboitics, Proactiv, Murad and everything</li>
            <li> so much that I....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really seen results.  </li>
            <li> Also if you use discount code GLOW you will get extra 10% off (any size order)and all orders $25.00 and over ships free (only until March 9th)plus you will get free samples.</li>
            <li> After I rinse I gently rub the bar on my beard and lather up for a shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get a smell out of it.  </li>
            <li> I buy bars for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> All thanks to this bar of mudsoap.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and reasonably priced for this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> All in all, a great soap, and worth a try for at least moderate acne, or those who wish to clarify their complexions after having battled the teen-scourge longer than their time.</li>
            <li> but the product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t strip my skin and leave it very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really like this soap.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was really sceptical about it, but after he tried it he uses it just as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t help or hurt the eczema.  </li>
            <li> It suds up really well.  </li>
            <li> It helps out so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a project to handle.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with ezcema for years, and this soap really soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleaded with this soap.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say whether or not I was infused</li>
            <li> thanks so much, will be putting up the review this week on my blog.</li>

            <li> so i cant really speak about that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin after using this soap and i wasnt a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> As others have posted it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent</li>
            <li> but since it is working I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I think this soap is really helping her.</li>
            <li> It also does not have a flowery smell which I am very thankful for.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and not dry at all after use.</li>
            <li> It can be drying if you use it too often, so I switch off with a gentle soap-less cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like this soap, a lot.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my daughter&#x27;s psoriasis.  </li>

            <li> absolutely refuse to pay $20 for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> , I guess in this day &amp; age that I can&#x27;t really</li>
            <li> For that, I guess in this day &amp; age that I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is unscented and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone seeing as it has helped my mother so much.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s no cure-all it has done so much to relieve the symptoms.</li>
            <li> and it goes away much quicker.</li>
            <li> it really clearing up any skin problems.</li>
            <li> I came across Adovia through a Groupon purchase and thought since the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> This is working really well.</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who had psoriasis, but we haven&#x27;t spoke about it&#x27;s efficiency much.  </li>
            <li> About five days after I started using this soap my eczema had somewhat improved which works for me since really its inflammatory</li>
            <li> This soap really helps.  </li>
            <li> I am very please</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soap but doesn&#x27;t do much for psoriasis</li>
            <li> (I think hormone is the real issue though).</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural soap with no artificial color or fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wondered if an all-natural bar of soap would work and if I would really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> This caused me intense, unbearable itching.</li>
            <li> However, it does advertise to be very helpful to people with psoriasis, eczema, and acne.</li>
            <li> I was actually very concerned</li>
            <li> I always prefer face wash kinda stuff for my face &amp; body wash/shower gel for the whole body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne on my face that much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap to anyone!</li>
            <li> I cleaned it off and did noticed that the pimples that were growing to be big mighty adults seemed to kind of dried up...</li>
            <li> It really has not help my skin.  </li>
            <li> Her pediatrician had prescribed an ointment that didn&#x27;t relieve her problem as much as I felt it should....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did very well to disappoint</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap with a wash cloth to ensure that I really got in there and opened up my pores to allow the soap to penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised that this worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I became so addicted to using this soap that I gradually used it more and more.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised that this worked the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most of everything for mild acne, from accutane to epiduo gel, and while those work, they do not compare to this little bar of soap!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a really good Dead sea mud soap and the search is over!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do remember how I feel about my natural products, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rubbing my forhead right now and they are completely almost gone..</li>
            <li> most soaps later up to a clean white bubbly lather and leave your nails soft enough to file and your hands squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> In fact, it makes them less dry, so I&#x27;m happy about that.  </li>
            <li> There are other face cleanses that I believe are better for oily to combination skin</li>
            <li> This can also be due to my lack of water consumption a day and not always eating foods that contribute to healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that in time it will regenerate back to what it used to look like because she has had some significant skin issues.</li>
            <li> love the fact that this is a natural product, full of nutrients from the Dead Sea that can absorb into my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure those suffering from extreme psoriasis have tried everything.  </li>
            <li> maybe it might work better then the other soap.</li>
            <li> , it sells, and better yet -- sells only to a few special folk in need!</li>
            <li> , it sells, and better yet -- sells only to a few special folk in need!</li>
            <li> My skin felt so clean and it finally wasn&#x27;t oily anymore at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face squeaky clean and hydrated at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne pretty much my whole adult life and have tried everything under the sun to control it.</li>
            <li> My skin was left feeling clean, moisturized but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have tried Dove bar soap  and recently fall in love with this amazing little soap bar from Adovia!!</li>
            <li> But most importantly, it leaves my skin as soft as my new Grandsons little cheeks!</li>
            <li> Just a note: it goes fast if left wet, so it&#x27;s great to keep it in a soap case to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> On my first day of use my oily skin became normal and glowing, the redness of my acne subsided a little, and my face felt generally healthy.</li>
            <li> soap IS STILL AND FOREVER SHALL BE MY GOOD FRIEND (I shall never be without it), but of recently, it has now brought only the smallest bit of relief and for a lesser amount of time.</li>
            <li> It makes me much more irritated and itchy and unless I bathe myself in lotion after using this soap it really is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and my oily skin seemed to calm down.</li>
            <li> Great for those with perioral dermatitis and with less of a premium compared to other brands</li>
            <li> The more I use this soap, I am finding I need less moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using it on your whole body, I would worry that it might not last long and is therefore a bit pricey, but if you&#x27;re using it primarily to clean your face, it&#x27;ll probably last a good long while.</li>
            <li> as I get older, my skin gets oiler......</li>
            <li> The thing I love about the Dead Sea soaps is that it gives my skin a real \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; and \\&quot;nourished\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> I grew older, however, my face started to change.</li>
            <li> If you use it only on your face, the bar can last more than 3 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, just use a bit more water and it will eventually form enough lather to wash your face.</li>
            <li> I do have occasional eczema patches but during the time of trying the Mud Soap i was free and clear of them</li>
            <li> We lose so many nutrients on a daily basis, and this is another way to try and put some of those back</li>
            <li> Even a quick wash of my feet with this mud at the end of a day makes my feet feel 30 years younger and less used :)</li>
            <li> but I am older now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent sized bar.</li>
            <li> After using Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud soap my face felt soft and well hydrated, i was pretty sure it was a fluke</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a different and interesting scent - not overpowering or bad, just kind of interesting and new if you&#x27;ve never used non scented / natural produts before.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Dead Sea type of products, so trying this out was right up my alley.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this soap</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sulfur soaps and Dudu-Osun are highly antibacterial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a winner, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li> I used it as a facial and body soap; As a facial soap, it leaves the skin very clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> That may be due to me using a lot of products, such as moisturizers, sunscreen, or makeup on my face, but I still would have liked that acne to disappear as well.</li>
            <li> but I surly like it so far!!</li>
            <li> My face usually takes a few days to stop reacting to a new soap, but this stuff worked great right away.  </li>
            <li> Not too dry either, just clean.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked and impressed.  </li>
            <li> While it has some cleansing action, it is neither very acidic (as with sulfur soap) or alkaline (as with Dudu-Odun, which uses wood ash as an ingredient).</li>
            <li> This soap has really helped to keep my acne prone skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Their products really do make my skin baby-smooth and have helped alleviate the problems I had been having with adult acne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather much on my skin and the lather is rather clear.</li>
            <li> Now the primary reason I bought it was for my daughter&#x27;s eczema, and though it didn&#x27;t cure her, it may have improved her condition and definitely hasn&#x27;t had the negative effect that most soaps do.  </li>
            <li> a tad expensive but a great product.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not too dry either, just clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So three days have passed and the couple of pimples that were on my face since the product came are completely gone (after using the product for the three nights straight).</li>
            <li> I will purchase the brand I normally use.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m allergic to store brand soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend lathering up with this soap on the affected areas, and then using your normal soap to cover up the smell (it smells like salt).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like a normal bar of soap, except that it looks like the color of mud.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely worth it, it is the only thing that has worked for me!</li>
            <li> I still have a few pimples every now and then, but it handled most of the problem and my skin is healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> I then washed my body as normal.</li>
            <li> I would love to travel to the dead sea</li>
            <li> It is a normal soap.</li>
            <li> It does not foam up like “normal” soap</li>
            <li> This dead sea mud soap was not what I&#x27;m used to, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I love Thia dead sea.</li>
            <li> dead sea salt soaks are much more affective</li>
            <li> He has oily to normal skin.</li>
            <li> He has oily to normal skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally while not cheap, it lasts for an impressively long time--which makes it a surprisingly good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> It has helped my eczema tremendously and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has skin problems, or is simply looking for an all natural product to use.</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin felt so clean and tight and somewhat lighter in complexion.</li>
            <li> My eczema flared right back up.</li>
            <li> Although I can say Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap has been the best soap for my eczema so far, the price increase is utterly ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and used a facial brush to gently exfoliate my face, and also clean and remove any dirt or left over makeup.</li>
            <li> To finish this horrible review, I have honestly written this review with the deepest truth and a large effort because I know first hand how annoying pimples can be, especially when you&#x27;re beautiful like me lol!</li>
            <li> To finish this horrible review, I have honestly written this review with the deepest truth and a large effort because I know first hand how annoying pimples can be, especially when you&#x27;re beautiful like me lol!</li>
            <li> While it does leave my face really clean, and after about 2 hours of sitting and waiting a bit smoother, I&#x27;m not sure that the itchy factor is worth it.  </li>
            <li> After gentle washing the oily skin is smooth and a little tingly.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to describe skin benefits, but am pleased thus far.</li>
            <li> I have always had a little rash of some kind on the back of my arms, and this cleared it up.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to face wash.</li>
            <li> I break out not into new acne, but into allergy bumps WHILE IM IN THE SHOWER.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to my traditional black soap, its much cheaper and much better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this product to work like black magic on my face, but I am pleased with the results after using all these other products for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love how this soap feels just barely exfoliating, but gentle enough to use every day, and leaves absolutely no residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months now and have not seen any improvements in my acne, but my face is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema ever since I was very young.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will wet a facial mitten first and rub on the soap and use the mitten to clean my face so it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin.</li>
            <li> This is nothing special, I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now and notice absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is in the soap, it could be some common ingredient in hundreds of other products, but all I know is it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks to completely clear but it WORKS!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft, I just want to hold my hands all day!</li>
            <li> I have been going to expensive dermatologist for over 2yrs for eczema &amp; after hundreds of dollars spent this has had the best result by far.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with this soap every morning and then apply a small amount of the Egyptian Magic Cream.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I apply a small amount of the Egyptian Magic Cream afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to buy direct from Adovia!</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I saw a definite decrease in breakouts and they haven&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li> When I first started buying this soap, it only cost around $8 a bar.</li>
            <li> It comes in patches, not usually all over.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what it is in it&#x27;s compound to do this, but it&#x27;s not going anywhere near my face!</li>
            <li> I am even seeing an improvement in my skin tone - 30 years&#x27; worth of acne scars are not nearly as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It has a dark gray-green color and feels smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> The scent is interesting and I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but it seemed a bit lemony to me.</li>
            <li> Cheers and green beer to all! :)  </li>
            <li> Same results for maybe 1/3 of the price, not to mention you get SO much more than the other supposed \\&quot;WONDER\\&quot; brand...</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every other day, the bar will last for more than a year.</li>
            <li> and you can only do so much, but my razor burn is gone, done, over with!</li>
            <li> my skin looks better, I feel like I&#x27;ve dropped a few years already!  </li>
            <li> and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> It is all natural!</li>
            <li> I am now in my early twenties and irritated to see that I still get seasonal and hormonal breakouts!</li>
            <li> This combined with vitamin D3 10,000IU cream has helped considerably!</li>
            <li> But this soap leaves my skin soft and glossy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just wonderful that we found a solution for her skin issues without having someone write a prescription..and then being disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I loved the concept of using Dead Sea mud as soap because I have read about how the Dead Sea mud is very healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried a few other dead sea mud soaps that are out there, and Adovia has been one of the best.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fabulous, I got the soap within less than a week</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;m a 24 year old female.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While always a fear prior to writing a positive product review here</li>
            <li> , it appears that positive reviews &#x27;bellow up&#x27; those corporate minds who sell these products and hence they decide to greedily increase their prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I have been signing up and getting many new samples of fashion things and beauty items lately.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s nice to see that the price came back down (again, hopefully just a misprint prior).</li>
            <li> It does seem to relieve some dead skin, but to be honest it irritated my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive, fair skin and the harsh chemicals in the products really dried out and sometimes burned my skin.</li>
            <li> In the final analysis, the adovia soap did not help my eczema and it certainly harmed my compexion.</li>
            <li> It does clean, as any soap would, but i guess it just doesn&#x27;t do much for me :/</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and this soap has helped but there are others soaps with exactly the same ingredients for FAR less.</li>
            <li> I am almost clear.  </li>
            <li> I had hopes this product would clear my acne</li>
            <li> My skin is perfectly clear now after almost a year of continuous breakouts.</li>
            <li> So with my face really clean, I have noticed my poors  are less visible.  </li>
            <li> It also started to clear up my acne immediately.</li>
            <li> She also used the Adovia soap and thought it did help clear up her face.</li>
            <li> so well helps me clear my face</li>
            <li> If it helps clear my skin</li>
            <li> It clearly states part of the purpose is to get rid of the oils.  </li>
            <li> TerraBathe minerals is #1 choice for itching and clear skin.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how this unusual soap makes my skin feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;I am not getting any younger and I have noticed changes in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I am using this soap,along with cream to try and clear up a rash type thing on my arms.</li>
            <li> So far, no results.</li>
            <li> While the medium potency steroid helps control some of the itch and inflammation, it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate my symptoms.  </li>
            <li> but this surprised me.</li>
            <li> My wife however, does not use it on her face as her skin is still too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who doesn&#x27;t like creamy cleansers.  </li>
            <li> So as far as its eczema-healing properties, my research is inconclusive.     </li>
            <li> I was in the midst of a depression when I bought this bar of soap, because I had tried everything (prescription, natural remedies, etc.)</li>
            <li> I began talking to girls with confidence again, and I went out with my friends again after nearly 6 months of being a hermit.    </li>
            <li> whole back ,</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN SO SOFT</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s not harsh on the face.</li>
            <li> if you rub the bar itself directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> and see if it heals my breakouts completely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this soap that my skin responds so well to, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is a</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I never even felt it go near my eyes</li>
            <li> I have used it before going to bed and my skin feels soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It just seems like an all around natural mud soap.  </li>
            <li> am a 26 year old woman who never truly suffered from acne while in my teens.</li>
            <li> and I became increasingly sensitive to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Recently</li>
            <li> I bought it really for my acne problem which I tend to get on my back and sometimes my chest.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li> During the summer months I use Clearasil Daily Scrub, because it lifts the oils without drying me out too much, and somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> A bar of cetiphil is really the only thing that doesnt kill me.  </li>
            <li> This product is all natural.</li>
            <li> Antibacterial action.</li>
            <li> * 100% All Natural Moisturizing Soap&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how old the mud is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just have to trust Adovia on this one but however old</li>
            <li> I do suffer from sensitive skin, and some skin issues, and this soap did not irritate or bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this clear or soft.  </li>
            <li> I really like that a bar soap gives so much back</li>
            <li> The soap is 100% natural and keeps your skin feeling moisturized and soft after washing with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;•Is 100% natural</li>
            <li> It also has helped my wife clear up her adult acne.</li>
            <li> My face has always been soft</li>
            <li> so i cant say this product made my face soft</li>
            <li> And of course as mentioned about my skin felt soft and</li>
            <li> One on my neck completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> She says her  skin is so soft now</li>
            <li> It is not harsh at all on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done so much, that I&#x27;m back for more!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am a busy gal...</li>
            <li> STILL OFFERS</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;d died from &#x27;over-application&#x27;.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;d died from &#x27;over-application&#x27;.</li>
            <li> its so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I hope Groupon offers this item again.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 3 weeks, and the acne on my face has completely gone.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> We covered ourselves in mud and the salt content was so intense that it made me notice every tiny cut or blemish on my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face too and my face is red the whole day.</li>
            <li> I prefer for my skin to be soft and moisturized after washing.</li>
            <li> All Natural Moisturizing</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> I used this, and only this, for over a week straight</li>
            <li> The dullness seems to have been replaced with a soft glow.</li>
            <li> So far no eczema, psoriasis and acne.</li>
            <li> the way it makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and have healing and cleaning properties.</li>
            <li> Maybe using a natural oil afterwards would replenish my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My two year old granddaughter has Eczema and it broke my heart to see her scratching her skin until it bled.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not meant to - this is a natural product that has all kinds of benefits,</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap all over my body but especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> this soap has dried up most of it with 2 days I will come back to tell you how my skin is within 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> that the soap would when I applied to review it, however, I can safely say that it merely has a fresh soap smell.</li>
            <li> I have not used long enough yet to see full results</li>
            <li> It was broken and had lots of some kind of dust around it.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the good reviews, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and i find most of the bar soap that i find in the stores just makes the whole situation 10 times worse.</li>
            <li> I normally do not use bar soap since I personally do not like the \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean feeling of it.</li>
            <li> My problem is like I said, I&#x27;m constantly working out and my face is exposed outside with plenty of pollution in the air and large amounts of my sexy sweat dripping down on my beautiful face :(.</li>
            <li> My problem is like I said, I&#x27;m constantly working out and my face is exposed outside with plenty of pollution in the air and large amounts of my sexy sweat dripping down on my beautiful face :(.</li>
            <li> I would not classify it as an acne soap per-say, unless you have extremely oily skin, in which case the drying effect would help (it isn&#x27;t terrible, nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix), but seems like a great maintenance soap.</li>
            <li> Minerals with certain atomic structures latch onto oils and carry them off the surface of skin, while minerals with other atomic structures penetrate skin and hunt for oils and other atoms with free electrons to complete their outer valences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it a few months ago and liked it a lot but stopped due to the price and regretted it when I ran out.</li>
            <li> And, of course, many others have spent the last thousands of years using Dead Sea silt for exactly this</li>
            <li> I follow up with their raw yellow shea butter and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Every time I wash my face with Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap, my face feels clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so soft and clean, and after a few months of use (you have to be persistent)</li>
            <li> * Contains a unique combination of Dead Sea minerals derived from</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soap to anyone who&#x27;s looking for their skin to feel smooth  and  soft and which has ingredients that come from the Dead sea!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the dead sea mud masque, applied to a wet scalp, for 30 minutes to an hour (put a shower cap on - very messy), is very effective in calming the scalp and gently exfoliating (no flakes).  </li>
            <li> The combination I describe above is my optimal approach, but the Adovia sulfur soap and similar products are also pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A decent enough soap, but if you are buying it hoping it will make a difference for your psoriasis, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, maybe I&#x27;m just one of those lucky people who produce 10X the oil we need for our skin!</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin or irritate it at all, but instead leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> when i get up in the mornings i use a little bit of braggs organic apple cider in a cotton ball to remove some of the oil and surface dirt from my face, then pat my face with very little luke warm water, next i lather up the dead sea soap and cleanse my face very gently!!!  </li>
            <li> At first I used it before going to bed, and when I woke up in the morning, I was surprised to discover that most of the little red pimples had dried up.</li>
            <li> I went to a wholesale store and bought a 14 pack for a few dollars more than I paid for this single bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am on my second bar of this soap and now I have a lighter complexion, hardly any acne, very smooth and moisturize skin.</li>
            <li> In my depression there was suddenly a small glimmer of light.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this soap, it is light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> texture of the soap is pretty rough and sandy.</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m treating with topical steroids, but I&#x27;m adjusting down from an ultra high potency (clobetasol dipropionate) to a medium potency steroid (betamethasone valerate).  </li>
            <li> $8 a bar was already higher than most other dead sea mud soap brands, and one bar goes by so fast (mud soap doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular bar soaps).  </li>
            <li> When u wash this soap off it might feel a little drying but after about 10 minutes ur face feels fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I first used this soap a few years back along with the whole clear skin kit I got from the Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice website.</li>
            <li> i hv had mild to moderate acne since my teens, in my 30&#x27;s now, there are times when nothing seems to help with my breakouts, i&#x27;ve tried extreme diets, cleanses, pills, lotions and of course proactiv over the years.  </li>
            <li> so I am always open to new options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you suffer pimples and blackheads make so you get a non-pore clogging facial moisturizer, your face will feel like new.  </li>
            <li> One characteristic of the soap that I really like is that it sticks to your skin when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with dry skin AND acne, and this soap really took care of it.</li>
            <li> He has tried it twice and said it made his skin uncomfortably dry and he was very itchy.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me - as a matter of fact, it made my skin dry whenever I bathed with it and after that, nothing.</li>
            <li> This however feels just as soft as the dead sea mud mask upon application, it feels creamy with just enough abrasiveness while using to clean my body.</li>
            <li> Its nice soap, but does not last long at all... Seriously softer than any soap I&#x27;ve seen, to the point where it&#x27;s noticably smaller after the first use, and for the price you kindof want it to last.  </li>
            <li> I have  had a  major   problem  </li>
            <li> I have other soap products that work a little better on eczema.</li>
            <li> and it has nature ingredients which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> Topical steroids are not working and insurance isn&#x27;t willing to pay for more expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently morning and night until the bar was completely gone which took about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> Drier and fine lines are my biggest complaint, I have used this soap for about a week</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used any bar soaps because it always leaves my face feeling dry but this product left my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all been using this soap for the past few weeks and we&#x27;re all pleasantly pleased!</li>
            <li> I have a few favorites but nothing that I am not willing to swap for something that works even better</li>
            <li> good soap especially in hard water.</li>
            <li> so scared I&#x27;d wake up with new lesions all over my clear but dry skin......</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the claim os helping some of the other isuses (excema etc) as I don&#x27;t have those, but I would imagine it can only improve / lessen any kind of skin issue along these</li>
            <li> However, if you have long been suffering from itchy and bumpy skin I highly suggest checking this out.</li>
            <li> I have moderate eczema on my genitals and eyes, and this product completely removes the skin cracks and itchiness that can make eczema a major detriment to one&#x27;s comfort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a winner, and I highly recommend it.nt the last thousands of years using Dead Sea silt for exactly this</li>
            <li> I have only been using this soap for a few days and already I see a huge difference in my face and back.</li>
            <li> Over the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the texture of my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> It also helps to clear your skin on your back as well.</li>
            <li> With 24-hours of the first use, the Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream alleviated the dryness, flakiness and itching.  </li>
            <li> (33 yr old male btw)    </li>
            <li> and it left my face really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and have adult onset acne on face and back and have tried everything over the counter to treat it.</li>
            <li> apparently until people complain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife as she has sensitive skin and occasional eczema, but now I may have to order again for myself!  </li>
            <li> It helps with acne a bit but not really that much.</li>
            <li> i am older and my skin is not oily but not itchy dry...</li>
            <li> My bruised &amp; bandaged hands almost constantly look like a 94 year old&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This mud soap left my skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but her old scars are fading, which we weren&#x27;t expecting.  </li>
            <li> main issue I had was dry skin, and after about 6 days of use I noticed improvement with this.</li>
            <li> Id highly recommend this soap to those with dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> FYI, when I first started using the soap, I did experience a slight burning sensation....</li>
            <li> have combination skin - oily on my forehead and nose but normal to dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this soap&#x27;s powers was worthy of letting others know.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this soap&#x27;s powers was worthy of letting others know.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are still active, but not as much.</li>
            <li> I was at the point of seeing a dermatologist for help, but I wanted to try this one last thing as it is a natural product and different than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> (a skin condition people are born with and has no real \\&quot;cure\\&quot;) without having to constantly pay so much money.</li>
            <li> face MG217 works alone, as for Adovia Natural Deep Sea Mud Soap, like another reviewer said \\&quot;It didn&#x27;t do anything for me\\&quot; either, I even left this soap on my psoriasis for like 5-10 before washing off</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason I&#x27;ve developed Eczema at the ripe old age of 64.  </li>
            <li> As faras my body goes, this does NOT dry out my legs.  </li>
            <li> I personally am keeping the secret safe this time around and allowing others to give it 5 stars elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not dry, not oily..</li>
            <li> Funny how soap from the same origin can vary in price, even if due to the Middle East situation at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, past soaps I&#x27;ve used (obscuring the brands on purpose)</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea.. you have heard about it before, but what exactly is</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth it because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the previous reviews, and I have to say I am really amazed.</li>
            <li> My face was so soft and did not feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and extremely dry skin all over my body and face which is also oily.</li>
            <li> first time trying this soap and after i use it a few times i felt the different on the sking</li>
            <li> It seems almost fatty and gets gooey in the soap dish, but it&#x27;s worth this minor hassle.</li>
            <li> After giving the product a try for a few month, I don&#x27;t notice any positive effects from habitual usage</li>
            <li> I know it helps his skin, but it&#x27;s kind of expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Not too dry, but clear enough.</li>
            <li> a little though, not too much.</li>
            <li> Putting century old dead sea mud on your face and expecting extreme results sounds absurd to most, but it&#x27;s not unrealistic.</li>
            <li> It contains a unique combination of Dead Sea minerals derived from Dead Sea Mud 100%</li>
            <li> I used it one night before retiring and the next day, it appeared that the redness had subsided and was less &amp;#34;angry.&amp;#34;  It also made my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> My jawline, on the other hand, is still not 100% clear.</li>
            <li> but this outcome FAR OUTDOES any other I&#x27;ve found to</li>
            <li> but this outcome FAR OUTDOES any other I&#x27;ve found to date.   </li>
            <li> I have used this twice so far, seems to really kill black heads and loosen dead skin, I like it already..</li>
            <li> At 3 weeks it was a bigger improvement and I expect it will continue - even with skipping a day, my skin definitely has not gone back to as dry as it was</li>
            <li> /&gt;Priced well, especially if it lasts as long as it seems to be lasting.</li>
            <li> particular product is primarily Dead Sea mud, which comprises silt as well as magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts.</li>
            <li> In a week and a half, it was completely gone!</li>
            <li> After using this soaps my current two pimples have dried up and nothing new has come up which it would have done by now without it.</li>
            <li> Use Dove soap... less expensive, nice smell, and no shipping or handling needed in purchasing it.</li>
            <li> So much smoother and softer already, and the pimples I have are already getting cleared and no more have appeared.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that Amazon has been toying with the prices on a lot of items lately.</li>
            <li> During the winter months I usually mix Cetiphil Gentle Skin Cleanser with St Ives (or store brand)</li>
            <li> And my bar has lasted me a long time, even with regular use.    </li>
            <li> I work out a lot and my face is constantly sweating, plus I have long hair so that gets on my face too</li>
            <li> I actually like that because when I use it directly on my legs just for washing it fells like I am exfoliating a little too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> abnormally dry since I have such oily skin.....</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun including: proactive, clearasil, acne free, cetaphil, neutrogena, dermalogica(very expensive), antibiotics, changing birth controls and everything else you could possible think of.</li>
            <li> My body feels a lot smoother, especially my legs which are always dry.</li>
            <li> get a few blemishes here and there, and noticed that I was imperfection free after applying this soap to the delicate skin on my face and body for a week.</li>
            <li> I never use soap on my face, because it can clog pores and dry skin at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The salts in Dead Sea mud, especially magnesium salt, have an anti-inflammatory action.</li>
            <li> The salts in Dead Sea mud, especially magnesium salt, have an anti-inflammatory action.</li>
            <li> could not wait to try Adovia&#x27;s Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap just to see how well it actually could benefit my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WORKS.moisturizer which tells me that the soap leaves a layer of it&#x27;s magic behind to do round</li>
            <li> Other then the effect of my skin being tight and dry after use, that was the only real difference I saw.</li>
            <li> smell of the soap is very natural and earthy, which if you have used any type of Dead Sea products before, you know what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> This soap goes on with very little lather (i even go over my mouth with it) and it leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth and takes away all unnecessary oils.</li>
            <li> I am usually purchasing multiple soaps for each person and their specific issue or having to change frequently.</li>
            <li> I usually have a really oily skin in the T zone and almost dry in the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> However, the past several months my eczema has become very severe, and I actually had to get a shot from the dermatologist to help keep my outbreaks and inflammation down.</li>
            <li> You can find similar soaps, with the same ingredients, that work just the same for a lot less (One with Nature and Sea of Spa brand.)</li>
            <li> I have very dry mixed skin</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it is surely not needed as much as I used to have to do with my other facial products.</li>
            <li> I had 3 pimples and they immediatly dried up and got very small.......3-5 days, no new breakouts (YA!!!)</li>
            <li> After a few days all the little bumps had gone away, so i started washing my whole face!</li>
            <li> The eczema comes and goes, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if the soap is really working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The $12 price tag is quite expensive for soap so while I did enjoy using it</li>
            <li> My face has a tendency to clear up for a few weeks and then breakout, out of seemingly nowhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be clear about my range of experience, I have also used Adovia sulfur soap with Dead Sea mud and Dudu-Osun soap.</li>
            <li> Also, since this works so well, I have purchased a dead sea mud masque, which I apply directly to my scalp with a paint brush, to help treat my scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> If you have an oily face, this will help it even in the long run.</li>
            <li> I supplement this with 2-4 grams of vitaminB-5 each day and with either Retinol creme or Tri-Derma Facial Redness Repair for really rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Enriched with century old Dead Sea mud, leaving your skin cleansed and nourished&lt;br</li>
            <li> know the Dead Sea Mud Soap has passed the test for my sensitive skin because it does not irritate my skin when I use it for shaving.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> My husband and I started using a bar of Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap in December 2010.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really no words for this stuff and am still thanking &#x27;that above&#x27; for it.</li>
            <li> sip &amp; toast to all of us suffering with this dreaded condition who may have perhaps finally found a possible &#x27;help&#x27; to alleviate the pain accompanying our sorry state!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and green beer to all! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really no words for this stuff and am still thanking &#x27;that above&#x27; for it.</li>
            <li> but when I compared the cost of the ER (with no real feasible relief offered in thelong run) to perhaps another 2 weeks or so of trying whatever I could get my hands onto and hope for relief along the way (based only on reviews via the internet)....</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I have minor acne at both sides of my face.</li>
            <li> If you have an oily face, this will help it even in the long run.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap  </li>
            <li> It is enriched with century old Dead Sea Mud leaving your skin cleansed and nourished.</li>

            <li> At first I was skeptical to buy this soap due to the fact I have very very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My back has been less red and irritated, and the size of the acne seems to be decreasing.  </li>
            <li> When I have gotten a few new pimples they have been way smaller than previously.</li>
            <li> Even after using this soap in a hot shower, my skin was less dry than usual.  </li>
            <li> So, I like to lather up as soon as I get in the shower, then do my other stuff, then rinse the soap off last.  </li>
            <li> I have tossed ALL my other facial scrubs &amp; washes to use this EXCLUSIVLY!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend only washing once every other day to start and then working up to once a day if needed.</li>
            <li> price is a little steep, though for me, it is so much better than throwing my money away on expensive skin care systems that over-promise and do not deliver.</li>
            <li> little bar is a MIRACLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Albeit, not a fix.... but miracle enough to give me much further times between outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Perhaps due to the Middle East uprising at the moment?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews where some smelled like lemons from lemongrass, but I&#x27;m assuming they received a different bar than myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I though this was odd due to the natural composition.</li>
            <li> a very long while.</li>
            <li> but when utter pain becomes relief, who the heck cares when it can help the poor human who possibly can&#x27;t live without it!?!&lt;br /&gt;Nope</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face</li>
            <li> /I have dry skin type and this works wonders</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m frustrated and depressed, acne has changed my life in many ways, only if u hv acne can u understand the pain that it causes.  </li>
            <li> but my skin got dry....</li>
            <li> This is just what my dry itchy skin needed.</li>
            <li> I would say that I have extremly acne prone but DRY skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels bumpy and dry all over now</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but does get rid of the oil and makeup.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t walking around with dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great cleansing bar that doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you might have to use a moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves you feeling dry in the shower</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> Sad to say, it dried out my skin even more</li>
            <li> its like an exfoliater for your face and dusnt dry out your skin</li>
            <li> Dry and not work.</li>
            <li> and my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> The minerals in the mud will help anyone&#x27;s skin, but if you have dry skin, I recommend using a moisturizer to go along with this soap.</li>
            <li> Still using it as a body soap and feeling as dry as ever.</li>
            <li> I think if you have dry skin this would be too drying.</li>
            <li> I also have some dry patches on my ear in addition to somewhat oily skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I battle with dry and cracked skin and this soap helped soften those spots.</li>
            <li> The soap did not irritate or dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Hope this review helped you out, if you have any questions that have been unanswered, don&#x27;t be shy and feel free to comment on my post</li>

            <li> I think leaving the cleanser on as a mask would help dry up pimples and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I also have scars on my upper lip and I currently have a few pimples on my chin.</li>
            <li> I knew my face looked different but after slacking in my routine of cleaning my face before bed for a few weeks my blackheads had come back...</li>
            <li> It seldom ever falls victim to white heads, but it causes people to wonder if I have Lupus or some other issue like alcoholism.</li>
            <li> Such as their regular soap, and the dead sea mud.</li>
            <li> This is another product that did not live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out skin and is pH balanced so it doesn&#x27;t mess up protective outer layer and irritate skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin, yet I also have mild acne which is a horrible combination to try to find the right product for.</li>
            <li> It gets my skin squeaky clean, but I didn&#x27;t notice any extra moisturizing qualities than less expensive soaps.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say not really worth it...</li>
            <li> after I have rinsed, dried and applied moisturizer which tells me that the soap leaves a layer of it&#x27;s magic behind to do round the clock work to keep breakouts at bay.</li>
            <li> The finest Dead Sea cosmetics and beauty products based on natural ingredients found only in the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy anything other than Ahava brand products because I have relied on them for decades, but we desperately needed the mud for my child&#x27;s Eczema, and the competitors&#x27; was not available, so we gave this a try, and we are glad we did!</li>
            <li> When I bought this little bar of soap my life was in social ruin.</li>
            <li> This is a very big plus compared to soaps that make my skin feel dry or tight, or itchy from fragrances.</li>
            <li> In our household we have varying skin issues - extremely dry skin, psoriasis, eczema AND acne!</li>
            <li> Thought it might break me out, so I only used it on half my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also half Asian</li>
            <li> I will continue using this until the bar is done to see what happens, but I&#x27;m not confident that this is much better than my bar of cetiphil was and its twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> It definitely seems to help me get rid of them a lot quicker and helps my skin feel less oily during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> again only a short-term relief (less than 1 hour).</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know what to do now and have finally relinquished yourself to spending half of your life&#x27;s savings in hypafix tape, gauze/telfa, and cortisone cream....</li>
            <li> #2 was less than 30 minutes following app #1.... anything to help the pain</li>
            <li> , I still bandage at night - but not to the same extent as before.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps 2 fingers each hand (or less?</li>
            <li> I occasionally have acne problem, but it seems I have them much less when I am using this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 with adult acne, uneven tone, and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that using an actual bar of soap on your face could help.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry and itchy after I used it.</li>
            <li> Natural black mud is a substance that shares the mineral content of the dead sea-found and extracted from the earth&#x27;s lowest places.</li>
            <li> and i havent got a single acne since then!</li>
            <li> Then this little bar of soap came in the mail, and little did I know at the time, that it would be the foundation for a complete 360 in my life.</li>
            <li> The color of the bar is a little different, but don&#x27;t let that scare you.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little smaller than the size of a credit card...</li>
            <li> I used to get little non irritated pimples on my forehead, I would feel them but they would not be obvious to others...</li>
            <li> Your face will get dry as a result of overusage but for me that works in my favor because I tend to have acne due to an oily complexion.  </li>
            <li> little bar of mud has spoken so loudly to me that I&#x27;ve gone over to saltworksusa and picked up a 5lb bag of course grain Dead Sea bath salt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, it appears that those of us who take time to share a great product with the rest of the world has a nasty implication otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a while of using it, the soap became rough; but maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be like that.</li>
            <li> but after a few days the difference is so obvious that even I noticed it.</li>
            <li> I can not give an opinion just yet because I have only used the soap for a few days.</li>
            <li> i ordered this product only because i hv faith in sea salt&#x27;s healing properties, i&#x27;ve used this dead sea mud soap for about a month now and here is what i hv to say -</li>
            <li> while i brush my teeth, it does sting your eyes so be careful if that bothers</li>
            <li> but there minimal.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product, Adovia Dead Sea mud soap, in conjunction with Grisi sulfur soap with lanolin.</li>
            <li> the verdict on the Dead Sea Mud Soap is in: a definite must have!</li>
            <li> use Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, so when I was asked to review their Mud Soap</li>
            <li> I have tried several Adovia dead sea products.</li>
            <li> Do be careful on storing your Adovia though</li>
            <li> Especially long ago when she did a lot of scratching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not much time for &#x27;review writing&#x27;, even moreso for &#x27;updates&#x27;...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a family to feed and not much to feed them with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a family to feed and not much to feed them with.    </li>
            <li> and i have to be really careful with what goes on my face.</li>
            <li> For those who never experienced this ailment it varies from from intense itching, pain and infections from scratching, etc.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> So after trying all these products and stuff it did show some improvements by clearing up what was already there, then a few weeks later BAM!</li>
            <li> I get the occasional breakout which is frustrating as an adult</li>
            <li> I have never experienced such an improvement using any other product especially in the short period of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The initial application was a slight and somewhat &#x27;sting&#x27;, but settled down almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says and if you have the luxury of owning both the mask and the soap your face is in for some serious pampering and softness!</li>
            <li> It really does what it says and if you have the luxury of owning both the mask and the soap your face is in for some serious pampering and softness!</li>
            <li> Even just using the soap itself without the other products (Dead Sea toner &amp; Dead Sea Exfoliating Salt) has made a major difference!</li>
            <li> I had been slathering the 10% acne peroxide all over in weeks past with no results, but now the little bumps and irritants i had on my pate and nape of my neck have completely disappeared.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gave me the absolute nastiest headaches, dry eyes, light sensitivity, etc...not like mildly annoying either--like dehabilitating pain!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect from the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap.</li>
            <li> not serious but irritating.</li>
            <li> I was only just a little less itchy but for that price I won&#x27;t be getting it again, I will have to look for something else.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> As far as body wash goes, every acne clearing body wash/scrub either makes me worse, or makes my already dry legs feel like alligator skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin would be so tight and dry it would hurt.</li>
            <li> ) Post other comments/questions</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> (see my other reviews on face cleansers)</li>
            <li> It prevents breakouts due to clogging and I get this tightening feeling around my face after using.</li>
            <li> as I  think  this  is  due  to  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have any acne problems, but this soap made me break out all over my face and back.</li>
            <li> It goes usually from my shoulders to the small of my back, occasionally on my sides.  </li>
            <li> didnt like the sulfur smell and extreme dryness.</li>
            <li> They help to reduce the swelling from acne and other sores.</li>
            <li> They help to reduce the swelling from acne and other sores.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other products from this company that I do like.</li>
            <li> I did see a small improvement, but my acne is definitely still there.</li>
            <li> They seem to play well with each other.</li>
            <li> I now use it about every other day.  </li>
            <li> The soap is not drying as other soaps are and that would have to be because of the minerals in the soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want him to stop using the other product to see if this is helping at all.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day in the shower to scrub my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the healing properties may not last (they have so far with me; the lotion is medicated), this stuff DOES work, at least for me, and at least for today.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> other then</li>
            <li> when I tried mixing it with my other skin care products, it didn&#x27;t affect anything and didn&#x27;t improve anything; face OR body.</li>
            <li> This product is not packed full of crazy ingredients and chemicals.</li>
            <li> I recommend for psoriasis and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> However, you should try other products while using this one.</li>
            <li> However, you should try other products while using this one.</li>
            <li> Yes, I did have the occasional break out and a not so subtle dime sized pimple here and there, but I never suffered these blemishes for long and they always went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way for this to be in a cleanser form, because I find bar soaps to be a little messy and possibly unhygienic.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months, and not only did it not help with my acne or excema, it actually made these problems worse.</li>
            <li> This 2nd time, my poor little fingers seemed to respond to the &#x27;daily stress of enduring life while sick&#x27; more than ever before.</li>
            <li> the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap is doing its job washing and not leaving me too dry!</li>
            <li> Something is not right with that.</li>
            <li> bar itself is a little rough because I take it out of the shower</li>
            <li> Only negative</li>
            <li> It was not worth my investment or money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so afraid that they&#x27;ll quit making the soap I&#x27;ve stocked up enough to last me for the next 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Those of you contemplating buying this - It is definitely not worth the 10.99.</li>
            <li> Only negative</li>
            <li> it really is not worth it.</li>
            <li> it was not worth it</li>
            <li> and it really soothes troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> It can get very inflamed and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly switched back to Bar Soap every shower and laid it on thick, letting it sit awhile.</li>
            <li> And I loved how the soap didn&#x27;t leave any grim or film on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me break this down.  </li>
            <li> My biggest thrill in life is that 1-2 week period when &#x27;all has calmed down&#x27; and I&#x27;m bandage-less.</li>
            <li> This has been helpful in calming down my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This product can be a little drying but nothing compared to other acne treatments that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now, every other day bc its too drying, and</li>
            <li> arms, upper legs have broken out in small red acne like sores  </li>
            <li> My cheeks are so much smoother, haven&#x27;t been itchy, and only during bad flare-ups have there been redness &amp; irritation.</li>
            <li> I also experience a slight tingling sensation (which I like)</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight film.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and a half and my acne looks as tho it is clearing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen less acne since I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> The 4 stars are because of the slightly drying/tight feeling for me after washing my face with the soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for less than $8 and now one stinkin bar of soap is almost $30?</li>
            <li> It makes pores look less visible.</li>
            <li> Well my  skin is less oily when I have makeup on, and  </li>
            <li> Thought it was odd that when I opened it, it looked like someone took a bite from it.</li>
            <li> The color of the bar is black as pictured and it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> also please be noted although it contains sort of olive oil for moisture but still causes slight dryness.</li>
            <li> or it will leave black at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This soap started clearing my skin less than 1 week.</li>
            <li> And even with those 3 bars, I am still paying less than today&#x27;s one bar price from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I had applied this stuff probably 4-5 times in less than 2 hours....</li>
            <li> Perhaps 2 fingers each hand (or less?</li>
            <li> See previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive $11 for one bar which last only a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen less acne since I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this soap for a month and a half now</li>
            <li> Little by little I should expect for the product to continue to healing my face which has been suffering from acne for years and have battle scars with all the other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The scars from previous pimples have not gone, but have faded.</li>
            <li> The scars from previous pimples have not gone, but have faded.</li>
            <li> I used to have on average 10 of those little pimples on my face at a time, now it&#x27;s maybe 1 or 2 a month.</li>
            <li> After a long hard winter, I am thankful for spring.</li>
            <li> (Float in the Dead Sea, walk out crunchy and crusty as Lot&#x27;s wife, and then wash off with a black soap that makes dark gray foam...</li>
            <li> this soap, when brushed along a nailbrush, turns your nail brush dark grey ( and it is difficult to come off), no lather, it just keeps getting thicker and thicker like oil and doesn&#x27;t even rinse off.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this over the past month while DH tries another type of soap from this company (Adovia.)</li>
            <li> just thought, that along the way --- I&#x27;d update my review here in order to include this info to other poor suffering fools like me and perhaps offer even the &#x27;painfully-almost-in-tears&#x27; folks out there a second hope.</li>

            <li> If you have any little pigmentation some how it makes it less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we&#x27;re coming up on winter again, which is so harsh on skin anyway, but particularly those of us with skin ailments.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling really tight also</li>
            <li> The highly alkaline Dudu-Osun soap can be very caustic, leading to skin irritation.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still a FAR HAPPIER INDIVIDUAL and less painful soul than I was less than 5 days</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still a FAR HAPPIER INDIVIDUAL and less painful soul than I was less than 5 days ago.    </li>
            <li> It is a little bit drying but nothing a moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> 5 stars if the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li> She said it did help the acne a little bit.  </li>
            <li> This soap was a little bit cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey to order, but I&#x27;ll find a cheaper source.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inless than 1.5 months, the cost of this little bar of soap has gone up almost threefold.</li>
            <li> This little bottle has changed my life in just 4 days....</li>
            <li> If I can benefit from this little bottle of lotion....</li>
            <li> This little bottle has changed my life in just 4 days....</li>
            <li> If I can benefit from this little bottle of lotion....</li>
            <li> I feel a little misled on the size of this product.</li>
            <li> feeling a little change or not.....</li>
            <li> have a little rosacea on my nose, it hasn&#x27;t helped with that, but, it isn&#x27;t advertised to help with that, so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps a little bit with my acne</li>
            <li> After using the soap for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; my acne, and unlike other reviews, it just didn&#x27;t work for me :/</li>
            <li> There is a place on the web called cleopatraschoice.com that sells this soap a little cheaper than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This soap is very hard, and I have gotten 7 months of use from one bar, on a daily basis, and haven&#x27;t made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> I personally think it works just very slow.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had to put any acne meds on my skin since using it as it dried and healed the 3 pimples I had.</li>
            <li> I read that dead sea mud could help alleviate psoriasis symptoms, so I bought this soap, as well as a dead sea mud shampoo.  </li>
            <li> but then again it is made from mud from the dead sea.</li>
            <li> MAY HAVE.WE USE THIS SOAP EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Finally a Dead Sea Mud Soap that works.</li>
            <li> Nothing helped, in fact, it only got worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap and this Dead Sea Mud Soap</li>
            <li> Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, clearing pores and letting the skin breathe.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I reviewed the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask and I</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I would hope the minerals came from Dead Sea Mud considering the name so again, I&#x27;ll just trust Adovia on this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap in the shower for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea [also known as the Salt Sea] is a salt lake that borders Jordan.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea is one of the world&#x27;s saltiest bodies of water &amp; has become the epicenter of health research around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what about this Dead Sea Mud</li>
            <li> This therapeutic silt/mud stimulates circulation, and refines Dead Sea Mud Soap-</li>
            <li> My protective coverings all felt stimulated and resuscitated after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I just bought a bar of Adovia&#x27;s dead sea mud soap to try out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Soap felt like a Spa Day.</li>
            <li> I bought this bar of soap because of all the information I&#x27;ve read about how dead sea mud (anything) helps with skin ailments.  </li>
            <li> also it dried it out and brought no moisture to my hands.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because it was quite messy.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t broken out since I stated it and was clearer by the next morning.</li>
            <li> warning, you should not use this soap everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t get to the Dead Sea, I&#x27;ve now brought the Dead Sea to me....</li>
            <li> Dead</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose but a few dollars if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I combine dead sea soap with 10%benzyl peroxide and vitamin c serum those three work together</li>
            <li> Do waste your money and it is not a cheap staff</li>
            <li> used it everyday</li>
            <li> I had oily skin at the time, and it properly dried out my acne.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have wanted to try just about every dead sea mud product I can find.</li>
            <li> but then again it is made from mud from the dead sea.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been trying out the Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> and it only made my acne worse</li>
            <li> I received Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap a couple of weeks ago and have been showering with it everyday since.</li>
            <li> He has it on his elbows and knees and a few spots in between.</li>
            <li> I had been told before about the healing properties of products from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I still will keep this and use it as a weekly cleanser but everyday use isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> As for the Acne, I have seen a slight reduction but nothing to be wowed about!</li>
            <li> no more acne, black spots, etc</li>
            <li> I sip &amp; toast to all of us suffering with this dreaded condition who may have perhaps finally found a possible &#x27;help&#x27; to alleviate the pain accompanying our sorry state!  </li>
            <li> The spots on my arm and face are fading to almost pale.  </li>
            <li> She has a little trouble with small patches of eczema on her face so we are always looking for something that will work for her.&lt;br /&gt;After using the mask and the soap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly a heavy reviewer, especially of soaps, but I&#x27;ve had cruddy skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to do well with just plain Dove</li>
            <li> No strong scent</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin squeaky clean as I hate moisturizer soap that leaves me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> if your like me who has suffered from having this awful skin disease that really affects one emotionally, mentally and physically and has tried EVERYTHING AND NOTHING EVER</li>
            <li> if your like me who has suffered from having this awful skin disease that really affects one emotionally, mentally and physically and has tried EVERYTHING AND NOTHING EVER WORKS.</li>
            <li> I got it for my keratosis pilaris, but it just made my unaffected skin worse.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this product, in the past I have always used Seacret Minerals From the Dead Sea Mud Soap, for my acne.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e used this product everyday and it has reduced the amount and size of pimples I usually had before I bought the product.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e used this product everyday and it has reduced the amount and size of pimples I usually had before I bought the product.</li>
            <li> now offer this update only in the attempt to help others out there who are painfully living a life that 21st century medicine should have already helped us with otherwise......</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re holding back the tears over excruciating painful eczema moments as I have these last 2 weeks,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead my skin got worse and was often very dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> least that&#x27;s what I thought I knew when I bought this little miracle bar.  </li>
            <li> Even with every day use, I noticed very little change in the amount of body acne I had.</li>
            <li> There is very little marks of where the pimples used to be</li>
            <li> If you think about the price in terms of replacing a bottle of cleanser, it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> My mother used to have very itchy skin and bad Eczema/Psoriasis on her body and face.</li>
            <li> I had to dump all of the small pieces and dust out of the soap box.</li>
            <li> (I usually give up or forget to track it),</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past that to see if it helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sad for me, because I thought I had finally found something to help my severe eczema</li>
            <li> I have small, yet redish-pink, rash-like skin across the bridge of my nose which extends midway through both sides of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has helped my skin issues</li>
            <li> A trip to the dermatologist is pointless in my geographic area.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not really sure if he likes it after using it for a month.  </li>
            <li> I gave him the majority of the soap but kept a small chunk for myself for when I get any pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a relatively small bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this soap is working or not.</li>
            <li> just not sure what its benefits were.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i don&#x27;t notice anything different about my skin.  </li>
            <li> Soaps usually just dries up your skin</li>
            <li> AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to conclude that this is simply an ordinary bar of soap that smells like mud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products that were terrible / unbearable and this is defintely not like that -</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of acne medicines and cleansers, this actually doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am branching out in my blog and have decided that since this stay at home mom is not very good at crafts or gardening I am going to give you some beauty and fashion tips for moms.</li>
            <li> Having had it my whole life, I am disappointed I let myself fall for the &amp;#34;miracle psoriasis cure&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s VERY drying :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this miracle bar did it, but it did the impossible and completely changed my life.</li>
            <li> Plus, it takes care of those little bumps some kids get on their cheeks in cold, dry weather!  </li>
            <li> &#x27;adult-onset eczema&#x27; on my poor little fingers.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16 year old, and you know how bad acne can be that age.  </li>
            <li> I wash my skin with this product at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> has completely healed, I&#x27;ve still painful areas...</li>
            <li> Nothing has completely healed, I&#x27;ve still painful areas...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute</li>
            <li> and I was a sucker for thinking</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s common sense.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked and quite a few made it worse.</li>
            <li> However the shea butter softens his skin and slowly gets rid of the spots and soars.</li>
            <li> relief slowly came....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> and I mean everything in the store.</li>
            <li> We will also be trying out the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo that we just received so a review will follow on that too!!</li>
            <li> This bad rash ii had on my neck for years and the, acne marks or blackheads are barely there now!</li>
            <li> This little black soap actually removes/cleanse those nasty  bacne and reduce the itchiness!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it&#x27;d work since other dead sea mud items have helped at least some, but this didn&#x27;t do anything. :(</li>
            <li> I think at this point my skin is too bad to be healed by anything short of perhaps biologicals, but I won&#x27;t use them - too</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve taken 3 steps back in my fight against bad skin.</li>
            <li> still have to file but keeps it from comming back as bad.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for several weeks, and I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions.</li>
            <li> My hands get all chapped up from the bitter cold</li>
            <li> The tiny cracks &amp; slivers of papercut-like skin lesions are painful....</li>
            <li> Have had nightmare reactions from expensive green clay products that also contained harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my skin, and for $10, I am not a happy user!</li>
            <li> Cleans and Sooths my face especially during this long dreadful winter!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the usual remedies haven&#x27;t worked this time - not sunshine, corticosteroid products, etc...</li>
            <li> sucks!</li>
            <li> The fact is, this soap is doing for me the exact thing I bought it for - drawing whiteheads out of my skin and clearing them before they turn into disgusting acne cysts.  </li>
            <li> waste of money seriouslt:-( please dont waste ur money ont hg e foolishness</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about some of the other reviews....</li>
            <li> Decided to use this product for about a week and a half before writing this review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a history of bad bacne and wanted to find a product I could use in the shower to help me remove or at least reduce it all.</li>
            <li> It was too tough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from large pores, blackheads and terrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product cleanses my skin without irritating it.  </li>
            <li> but it has not made them worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s approximately the size of your palm, probably.</li>
            <li> I think that it even made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I think it made my face get worse</li>
            <li> I thought it would leave residue behind and worsen the acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking into buying Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay (search on amazon)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking into buying Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay (search on amazon)</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap for my boyfriend because his eczema was progressively getting worse and he didn&#x27;t want to use any steroid creams.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it because my acne got worse.</li>
            <li> A part of me wanted this to work well for me, while the other sort of wanted to prove my skin really is as bad as i think it is.</li>
            <li> This price is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I must comment on is that now I can never use another soap!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really sick and tired of products that don&#x27;t help or dry my skin out like crazy.</li>
            <li> and they all hated it, since it makes your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face since I&#x27;ve had bad allergies lately (instead of make-up remover wipes).</li>
            <li> When it came in i was skeptical about washing my face with soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird too cause</li>
            <li> This product helped me where expensive stuff like Neutrogena could not.</li>
            <li> and I have tried lots of cleansers (expensive and inexpensive)</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon but your loss.</li>
            <li> I am 23, and am gradually growing out of horrible teen acne.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try on Psoriasis and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Just try it,  you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> It was $7.99, sadly it is now $19.99.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is exceptionally sad to see how my fears have seemingly proven correct.</li>
            <li> I have olive toned skin which is combination/oily &amp; have issues with breakouts in random spots.</li>
            <li> i think it left an awful film too.</li>
            <li> so lame</li>
            <li> i dont like it at all useless</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the store wouldn&#x27;t accept a used bar of soap for a refund.</li>
            <li> At its worst, the skin is fissured, flaking and extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> well, here I am, back again and babbling again, and hopefully offering a bit of hope otherwise to those of us &#x27;infected&#x27; with this nasty and ugly condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, here I am, back again and babbling again, and hopefully offering a bit of hope otherwise to those of us &#x27;infected&#x27; with this nasty and ugly condition.    </li>
            <li> I would shower at night, moisturize like crazy, then sleep with the moisturizer on overnight.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any crazy changes.</li>
            <li> In desperation, I turned to Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream, a product that had always been off limits because of my oily complexion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ve changed my day-to-day life.&lt;br /&gt;While not perfect, and I&#x27;ve still somewhat painful lesions...</li>
            <li> While not perfect, and I&#x27;ve still somewhat painful lesions...</li>
            <li> and I felt desperate</li>
            <li> I tried it out and it dried my skin horribly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate in my search for something to help with the symptoms</li>
            <li> those dirty mother- at the source.</li>
            <li> those dirty mother- at the source.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use my expensive Pevonia products anymore!</li>
            <li> My biggest fear is that (usually, at the worst opportune time)</li>
            <li> It has a very faint earthy smell.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product, very sad.</li>
            <li> It seems like it worked for alot of people, but for someone with bad psoriasis, it doesn&#x27;t seem that it will work.</li>
            <li> My acne was bad</li>
            <li> i  broke out in  acne  really bad, and  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 10 years now and it&#x27;s gotten so bad that I&#x27;ve got 80% of my body is covered.</li>
            <li> The soap was so bad I could not even use it on my face without it being red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap was so bad I could not even use it on my face without it being red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I have made some bad calls</li>
            <li> This product irritated my skin so badly.</li>
            <li> This broke my skin out incredibly bad.</li>
            <li> , at the tender age of 22-in February of 2009-I began experiencing painful and debilitating under arm acne break outs.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had painful break outs in weeks</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the idea of using bar soap for my face.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful, ugly, and costly.</li>
            <li> helps - thus is painful when used.</li>
            <li> PAINFUL sliver-like papercut-like wounds brought me almost to tears at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something &#x27;sick&#x27; has been going around @</li>
            <li> Try not to touch your face when your hands are dirty and never to squeeze a pimple never!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/ wish I could get a refund.</li>
            <li> a try you will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> To my dismay, I was absolutely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> now I have to say that I am very disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> Felt awful about myself and went to a Dermatologist and tried everything.</li>
            <li> very bad!!</li>
            <li> and they are shocked that I don&#x27;t say its a foundation but a face wash!!</li>
            <li> awful, just awful.</li>
            <li> I did see that the company (Adovia) has terrible environmental ratings.</li>
            <li> my face became worst then before,</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has horrible eczema and this helped soothe his skin when it flares up.</li>
            <li> I had horrible psoriasis all over my face and a lot on parts of my body.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin even worst, my acne break out SO BADLY!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it once a day (at night before bed) and I dont wake up with this horrible greasy face in the morning and the effect lasts all day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap has not helped my acne.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and no change.  Oh well.  Back to Clinique.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t well packed. It was broken and had lots of some kind of dust around it. I had to dump all of the small pieces and dust out of the soap box. After a while of using it, the soap became rough; but maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be like that.</li>
            <li> this soap is amazing&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face /I have dry skin type and this works wonders&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my body also and it leaves my body feeling clean and hydrated&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly worth the price</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do. I was hoping that it would be the same as a well-known sea mud soap brand that I am accustomed to. This is not the case. You get what you pay for. I will purchase the brand I normally use. Probably if I didn&#x27;t have another sea mud brand to compare it to I would like it.</li>
            <li> Even with a good soap, you MUST use moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Can be a little drying for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This soap does NOT work! Don&#x27;t waste your money!! Use Dove soap... less expensive, nice smell, and no shipping or handling needed in purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly a heavy reviewer, especially of soaps, but I&#x27;ve had cruddy skin for a long time. Every afternoon my face feels oily, like I need another face wash. My shaves look like 5 oclock shadows as soon as I finish. I shave my head, so the problem is just compounded.  (33 yr old male btw)    I ordered this based on the previous reviews, and I have to say I am really amazed. I don&#x27;t exactly pay attention to my skin condition when I try a product (I usually give up or forget to track it), but after a few days the difference is so obvious that even I noticed it. Right now I&#x27;m actually touching my check and it feels smooth, not stubbly (just out of the shower/shave)!    I had been slathering the 10% acne peroxide all over in weeks past with no results, but now the little bumps and irritants i had on my pate and nape of my neck have completely disappeared.     I don&#x27;t know what it is in the soap, it could be some common ingredient in hundreds of other products, but all I know is it has worked great for me. Maybe it&#x27;s mildly abrasive, maybe it&#x27;s the mud, I don&#x27;t know. I do know I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.    (Depending on when you read this, this may show up as my first review, which should indicate how much I like it, not that I&#x27;m a shill :) ) Post other comments/questions and I&#x27;ll try to answer. For what it&#x27;s worth, past soaps I&#x27;ve used (obscuring the brands on purpose): N**trogena, D*ve, L*v*r 2000 (talk about something that should be abrasive ;))</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m allergic to store brand soaps. My skin starts to itch. Not with this one. Finally, I can use soap again instead of body wash every time.</li>
            <li> I can not give an opinion just yet because I have only used the soap for a few days. I might amplify my opinion after some more use. So far, no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin product junkie.  I&#x27;ve used most of everything for mild acne, from accutane to epiduo gel, and while those work, they do not compare to this little bar of soap! I was using Pevonia skin care for problematic skin, and that works well.  I stumbled upon this soap by accident, and read all of the reviews on it.  So I ordered it.  When it came in i was skeptical about washing my face with soap.  I decided i would just wash my forehead with it.  After a few days all the little bumps had gone away, so i started washing my whole face! All i can say is WOW!!!!!!!! My skin felt so clean and it finally wasn&#x27;t oily anymore at the end of the day.  Everybody at work said how my skin was glowing and how good it looked.  That was only after using it for 2 days!  If you have mild acne like i do, you must try this soap!!!!!!!!!! I don&#x27;t know how good it works on severe acne, but i say give it a go!!!!!!!!!! By far one of the best and cheapest products out there.  I don&#x27;t even use my expensive Pevonia products anymore! Love it</li>
            <li> i hv had mild to moderate acne since my teens, in my 30&#x27;s now, there are times when nothing seems to help with my breakouts, i&#x27;ve tried extreme diets, cleanses, pills, lotions and of course proactiv over the years.  i&#x27;m frustrated and depressed, acne has changed my life in many ways, only if u hv acne can u understand the pain that it causes.  making a good first impression has never been possible for me.    i ordered this product only because i hv faith in sea salt&#x27;s healing properties, i&#x27;ve used this dead sea mud soap for about a month now and here is what i hv to say - it is not a cure but will greatly help heal your skin...i did get good results but dont expect overnight miracles. maybe couple more months of regular use will help with some of my scars.      here is my routine, so when i get up in the mornings i use a little bit of braggs organic apple cider in a cotton ball to remove some of the oil and surface dirt from my face, then pat my face with very little luke warm water, next i lather up the dead sea soap and cleanse my face very gently!!!  i leave it on 3 to 4 min while i brush my teeth, it does sting your eyes so be careful if that bothers u.  after leaving it on 3 to 4 mins i gently splash my face with luke warm water and pat dry with a clean towel.  i repeat this routine at night as well.  during the day i freshen up my face with \\&quot;wet ones sensitive skin\\&quot; wipes.    i recommend anyone with acne try this soap, i will use it for a couple more months to see if can improve my skin some more</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical to buy this soap due to the fact I have very very sensitive skin! So I received my order yesterday and I immediately washed my face and all I could say is WOW!!!!! My face was so soft and did not feel dry at all. I also have scars on my upper lip and I currently have a few pimples on my chin. Today I woke up and it seemed like my pimples are drying out and they also got smaller. My face feels so clean and my oily skin seemed to calm down. Also, another detail I did notice is that my pores are closing which is phenomenal! I wish I can post a picture of my skin right now but, it doesn&#x27;t give me an option to attach a photo. I will update my review in a week or so and let you all know what my current status is. Best of luck to all of you!</li>
            <li> OK so I&#x27;m 36 yrs old and have been battling adult acne for 11 years. I went from having flawless, perfectly balanced skin to oily, blackhead/whitehead sometimes cystic acne. I have tried everything including a Accutane session that didn&#x27;t do much for me, oral/topical antiboitics, Proactiv, Murad and everything and I mean everything in the store. It&#x27;s weird too cause as I get older, my skin gets oiler......my 15 year old daughter has better skin than me and she&#x27;s the dang teenager......anyway, I bought this soap 2 weeks ago as I constantly research new products in hopes of relief and SO FAR SO GOOD. It&#x27;s been two weeks and this is what I experienced.......the first 2 days I noticed an immediate improvement....I had 3 pimples and they immediatly dried up and got very small.......3-5 days, no new breakouts (YA!!!) but my skin got dry....abnormally dry since I have such oily skin.....so much that I....dare say it.....I had to buy moisturizer?!!!!! I never use the stuff except when I was on Accutane so again I did research on the best light one to use and I bought Neutrogena Oil-Free with SPF 15......so scared I&#x27;d wake up with new lesions all over my clear but dry skin......it&#x27;s been almost another week since introducing moisturizor in conjunction with the mud soap and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results thus far. I have never experienced such an improvement using any other product especially in the short period of time. My skin is clear,  now balanced and smooth and I haven&#x27;t had to put any acne meds on my skin since using it as it dried and healed the 3 pimples I had. I also notice less oil after I apply my make-up and through out the day which is AWESOME. FYI, when I first started using the soap, I did experience a slight burning sensation....nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.....the soap is abrasive but it&#x27;s a good thing for acne sufferes who need a daily, gentle exfoliation. I also experience a slight tingling sensation (which I like) after I have rinsed, dried and applied moisturizer which tells me that the soap leaves a layer of it&#x27;s magic behind to do round the clock work to keep breakouts at bay. I will continue to use this soap and hope it continues it&#x27;s magic on my skin...worth a try if your like me who has suffered from having this awful skin disease that really affects one emotionally, mentally and physically and has tried EVERYTHING AND NOTHING EVER WORKS.moisturizer which tells me that the soap leaves a layer of it&#x27;s magic behind to do round the clock work to keep breakouts at bay. I will continue to use this soap and hope it continues it&#x27;s magic on my skin...worth a try if your like me who has suffered from having this awful skin disease that really affects one emotionally, mentally and physically and has tried EVERYTHING AND NOTHING EVER WORKS.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised that this worked the first time I used it. I have eczema and have tried just about everything to get rid of it. I use this soap and then I follow it up with Aveeno&#x27;s Daily Moisturizing Lotion with Natual Colloidal Oatmeal and I don&#x27;t have anymore episodes! I&#x27;m hoping that in time my skin will regenerate back to what it used to look like. Especially now since I don&#x27;t scratch anymore. My skin is so soft, I just want to hold my hands all day!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for people who suffer from eczema. I have moderate eczema on my genitals and eyes, and this product completely removes the skin cracks and itchiness that can make eczema a major detriment to one&#x27;s comfort. I&#x27;d recommend lathering up with this soap on the affected areas, and then using your normal soap to cover up the smell (it smells like salt). I&#x27;d recommend using Aveeno body wash in conjunction with this, as the combination both moisturizes and heals eczema.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have guttate psoriasis on various portions of my body.  I read that dead sea mud could help alleviate psoriasis symptoms, so I bought this soap, as well as a dead sea mud shampoo.  The shampoo I didn&#x27;t love - not muddy enough.  However, this soap is phenomenal.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks.  Since that time, I have seen tremendous relief of my symptoms (redness, flaking, size of area affected).  I am almost clear.  I have to admit, though, that I didn&#x27;t like the product much at first, because I really felt that it was drying my skin out.  I would shower at night, moisturize like crazy, then sleep with the moisturizer on overnight.  After a week or so, I noticed that my skin seemed to have adjusted, and I no longer needed to slather on moisturizer.  After 3 weeks, I rarely moisturize.    One characteristic of the soap that I really like is that it sticks to your skin when you put it on.  It leaves a slight film.  So, I like to lather up as soon as I get in the shower, then do my other stuff, then rinse the soap off last.  I think you get better results that way.  I really love it!!  I&#x27;ve really seen results.  Also, since this works so well, I have purchased a dead sea mud masque, which I apply directly to my scalp with a paint brush, to help treat my scalp psoriasis.  So far, really good results.  Right now, I&#x27;m treating with topical steroids, but I&#x27;m adjusting down from an ultra high potency (clobetasol dipropionate) to a medium potency steroid (betamethasone valerate).  While the medium potency steroid helps control some of the itch and inflammation, it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate my symptoms.  I&#x27;ve found that the dead sea mud masque, applied to a wet scalp, for 30 minutes to an hour (put a shower cap on - very messy), is very effective in calming the scalp and gently exfoliating (no flakes).  Don&#x27;t scrub or use your nails.  I wash out with Hair One tea tree conditioning cleanser (can buy at Sallys, or use Wen if youcan afford it).  Great results.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pretty nervous about using the soap. Thought it might break me out, so I only used it on half my face. No break outs and it left my face really soft. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a week and I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> At first my skin had a glow to it after using the soap.  Then I began to notice that my pores were huge and I started to break out.  It also left a film on my skin.  I&#x27;m going to stick to my traditional black soap, its much cheaper and much better.</li>
            <li> Helps control psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; but certainly works as a soap. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap about 2 month ago from Amazon website. It was then for $6.99. Now I went back to buy again, but price went up.  I \\&quot;google\\&quot; around and find another website that sells this product for $6.99 and if you by more then 3 there is father discount applied. Also if you use discount code GLOW you will get extra 10% off (any size order)and all orders $25.00 and over ships free (only until March 9th)plus you will get free samples. So for this time I purchased this soap from cleopatraschoice website.    Back to soap. I love it. It has very light sent. One bar lasted for about 4 weeks and I use it also for my body. It also helps to clear your skin on your back as well. Also I noticed that it lightens your skin. If you have any little pigmentation some how it makes it less noticeable. It takes about a week to see results.     I highly recommend this product. By the way this brand (Adovia)is very popular in Europe and cost there much more.</li>
            <li> This soap didn&#x27;t really do anything spectacular. It&#x27;s just like a normal bar of soap, except that it looks like the color of mud.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin &amp; this soap dried me out so that I was flaking. I couldn&#x27;t get past that to see if it helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap not realizing this company sells a bar specifically for acne, but this one works great for me! I&#x27;m 24 and have adult onset acne on face and back and have tried everything over the counter to treat it. I have VERY sensitive, fair skin and the harsh chemicals in the products really dried out and sometimes burned my skin. I was at the point of seeing a dermatologist for help, but I wanted to try this one last thing as it is a natural product and different than anything else I have tried.I have only been using this soap for a few days and already I see a huge difference in my face and back. So much smoother and softer already, and the pimples I have are already getting cleared and no more have appeared. I try to use it every day in the morning, and a couple times at night as well. I haven&#x27;t been completely religious with it and it is still working better than anything else I have tried. The price is definitely worth it, it is the only thing that has worked for me! It is a little bit drying but nothing a moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I bought the soap, because the reviews praised it as a miracle soap for all skin types. My skin does feel very clean, and seems to balance moisture in my skin, which keeps my skin from drying out. This is a very big plus compared to soaps that make my skin feel dry or tight, or itchy from fragrances. I see mild improvements in my eczema. If you&#x27;re looking for a soap to make your skin feel clean, comfortable, and moisturized I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love this soap for my face. It makes your skin so smooth and clean feeling</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try anyway. It leaves my face squeaky clean and hydrated at the same time. After I rinse I gently rub the bar on my beard and lather up for a shave. It doesn&#x27;t take much and the shave is extremely smooth. There&#x27;s usually enough soap residue to lather up again and go against the grain for an extra close shave that makes my skin feel great. Ladies can use it to shave their legs. Great product and I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> This is just what my dry itchy skin needed. I received this along with the mud mask and have to say that I love both of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly the soap smells like.. soap! I know.. but this surprised me. I was expecting a medicinal sort of scent and am happy that it doesn&#x27;t have one. It lathers and works great without drying out my already dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used the product for a couple of weeks, I can say that I will be ordering my own stock soon. It is worth the asking price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap every morning and evening for three months, and now I can tell this is realy a good stuff for my skin which is of combination. It cleans thoroughly without drying the skin. Although I get a row of cleansers in the bathroom, this bar is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love how this soap feels just barely exfoliating, but gentle enough to use every day, and leaves absolutely no residue on my skin. My skin feels sooooo clean and looks so good that I&#x27;ve even started going a few places without makeup. And it&#x27;s on the cheaper side for good skin care. Definitely recommend.    UPDATE 10/28/10: What the heck?! This soap used to cost $6.99 and now it&#x27;s $25!!! I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ll go back to Cetaphil.  UPDATE 11/9/10: Now it&#x27;s back to $7.99. That&#x27;s more like it. Just be aware that Amazon has been toying with the prices on a lot of items lately. If an item becomes at all popular, they jack up the price . . . apparently until people complain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife as she has sensitive skin and occasional eczema, but now I may have to order again for myself!  I use this soap to wash my face and it feels great on my skin, without over drying. My wife however, does not use it on her face as her skin is still too sensitive.  She does like it very much for a body soap.  Highly recommended.  5 stars if the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with dry skin AND acne, and this soap really took care of it. I just rub a bit onto a rag and exfoliate the entire face, and wa-la! Smooth, clear skin. I like this because it isn&#x27;t full of oil and &#x27;moisturizers&#x27;, just minerals that fortify your skin. This product helped me where expensive stuff like Neutrogena could not. I still have a few pimples every now and then, but it handled most of the problem and my skin is healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap with good lather, and very mild.  Have not used long enough to describe skin benefits, but am pleased thus far.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Takes all oils and impurities out of your skin while making it glow.  I didn&#x27;t really get a smell out of it.  Just soap smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now, every other day bc its too drying, and i don&#x27;t see any change with my skin. Its a shame, i was hoping it would be a great way to even my skin out without using harsh chemicals. It does clean, as any soap would, but i guess it just doesn&#x27;t do much for me :/</li>
            <li> This cleared up back breakouts that I was having. It took a couple weeks to completely clear but it WORKS! It&#x27;s very gentle and didn&#x27;t feel drying.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have tried lots of cleansers (expensive and inexpensive) but they always left my skin irritated, which lead to breakouts. This product cleanses my skin without irritating it.  I buy bars for the whole family.  I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who doesn&#x27;t like creamy cleansers.  I actually feel my skin is getting a cleansing.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap that will leave your skin clean and smooth. I use it in the shower, especially on my face. You can definitely tell a difference when you look in the mirror. It takes good care of your skin!</li>
            <li> I have tried every acne product there is. Nothing worked and quite a few made it worse. I&#x27;m an adult and have been fighting acne for too many years! Felt awful about myself and went to a Dermatologist and tried everything. Even used Accutane once. very bad!! So, I gave up until I saw a review for this soap. Thought I would give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it over a year now and can say its the best soap there is! My acne has cleared and I have my face back. I&#x27;ve recommend this soap many times to friends. I would recommend it to anyone! It works!!</li>
            <li> For every product that I try, I read every review on it. This product has relatively great reviews with a practical price so I decided to give it a try. I have been using it for about a week and a half and my acne looks as tho it is clearing up. When I have gotten a few new pimples they have been way smaller than previously. I would say that I have extremly acne prone but DRY skin. I have tried everything under the sun including: proactive, clearasil, acne free, cetaphil, neutrogena, dermalogica(very expensive), antibiotics, changing birth controls and everything else you could possible think of. This product can be a little drying but nothing compared to other acne treatments that I have tried. I will update my review in a few weeeks once I have given it time to really do its thing.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on parts of my body that never go away. I saw this soap had mostly all good reviews so I bought it. Well, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I was only just a little less itchy but for that price I won&#x27;t be getting it again, I will have to look for something else. It did however make my skin feel very clean after I used it. It seems like it worked for alot of people, but for someone with bad psoriasis, it doesn&#x27;t seem that it will work.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE them. Great Soap!</li>
            <li> This soap worked great on my body acne but it didn&#x27;t do anything for the acne on my face.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great! I love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the good reviews, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. It felt good when I was soaping the affected areas, but there was no improvement. I think at this point my skin is too bad to be healed by anything short of perhaps biologicals, but I won&#x27;t use them - too risky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone commented, requesting the number of times I used this product before throwing in the towel. I don&#x27;t know how many times I used it, but I used up the entire bar of soap - so many, many times. Every time I showered I used this soap til it was gone. Unfortunately, the usual remedies haven&#x27;t worked this time - not sunshine, corticosteroid products, etc... Unfortunately we&#x27;re coming up on winter again, which is so harsh on skin anyway, but particularly those of us with skin ailments. Brrrrr......</li>
            <li> Great soap. Gentle on my skin. I use it to wash my face since I&#x27;ve had bad allergies lately (instead of make-up remover wipes).</li>
            <li> This soap was very gentle for my skin. Just one use and got rid of my blackhead and gave me a nice clean glow. Even calmed the redness of my skin and acne. I really enjoyed the feel of my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is too drying for my skin.  But I bet it will work great for people with oily skin or acne.</li>
            <li> My wife got me this soap in hopes that it would help my eczema flair ups on my face. The eczema comes and goes, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if the soap is really working. Since starting using it about a year ago, I&#x27;ve been through ups and downs in the skin department. So as far as its eczema-healing properties, my research is inconclusive.     This soap does however clean well and leave my skin feeling great. And my bar has lasted me a long time, even with regular use.    I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, natural soap that may or may not help your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything when it comes to acne remedies. This is nothing special, I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now and notice absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about four weeks and notice no difference in my skin, I still have problems with my break outs/acne.  This is another product that did not live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> I have been going to expensive dermatologist for over 2yrs for eczema &amp; after hundreds of dollars spent this has had the best result by far. Amazed!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this soap&#x27;s powers was worthy of letting others know. It really does work brilliantly making your face feel so clean afterwards. Not too dry either, just clean. If you have an oily face, this will help it even in the long run. I&#x27;ve seen less acne since I&#x27;ve been using it and I think my face is looking brighter. Only negative I can think of is that it smells like mud but then again it is made from mud from the dead sea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Johnson Johnson for adults! It&#x27;s wonderful it has a soft smell and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my nephew for his teenage acne - said it seemed to help him</li>
            <li> Definitely not one of my favorite face cleanser.  I bought this because I liked their mask.  It is not bad, but I don&#x27;t feel its the best for oily skin.  With that said, its just not for me but I am not slamming this product.  Others it may work wonders for.  Skin care is such an individual case-by-case situation.  There are other face cleanses that I believe are better for oily to combination skin and that would do a better job.  (see my other reviews on face cleansers)</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I can definitely say that it cleans my skin. I use this in combination with the Egyptian Magic Cream. I wash my face with this soap every morning and then apply a small amount of the Egyptian Magic Cream. I can say that this product makes my face feel squeaky clean and I can hear the squeaky clean sound as I am rinsing the soap from my face with water. It leaves my face feeling really tight also and it kind of feels dry afterward so that&#x27;s why I apply a small amount of the Egyptian Magic Cream afterwards. As for the Acne, I have seen a slight reduction but nothing to be wowed about! This can also be due to my lack of water consumption a day and not always eating foods that contribute to healthy skin. Overall it&#x27;s a good soap and I will continue to use it until it is gone. It is a nice size bar that lasts a long time. I have used it every day and it still looks like a full size bar. For the price, it is worth it because a little goes a long way and I use my hands to wash my face instead of a wash cloth or sponge. The 4 stars are because of the slightly drying/tight feeling for me after washing my face with the soap.</li>
            <li> This clean your face if you use it correctly. Try not to use hot water use it warm. Try not to touch your face when your hands are dirty and never to squeeze a pimple never! And don&#x27;t eat junk food that&#x27;s a good start.</li>
            <li> When I bought this little bar of soap my life was in social ruin. My acne was bad (I&#x27;m talking 5-13 breakouts at any one time)! I&#x27;m 21 and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 14. I&#x27;m also half Asian so the acne would leave temporary post-marks on my ethnic skin that could last for up to a year! I was in the midst of a depression when I bought this bar of soap, because I had tried everything (prescription, natural remedies, etc.) and nothing worked, not only did nothing work, but my skin was also incredibly oily and nothing could manage it. My face was wrecked, I dropped out of school, and I rarely left the house.    Then this little bar of soap came in the mail, and little did I know at the time, that it would be the foundation for a complete 360 in my life. The soap what can I say about it? On my first day of use my oily skin became normal and glowing, the redness of my acne subsided a little, and my face felt generally healthy. In my depression there was suddenly a small glimmer of light. After the first week I was no longer experiencing any more breakouts, and my existing acne was already gone. The light was getting brighter. After a month my face was smooth like a baby again, no more oily skin, and many of my post-marks were fading more quickly than usual. I began talking to girls with confidence again, and I went out with my friends again after nearly 6 months of being a hermit.    It has been three months since I started using this, and my face, after 7 aggravating years with unmanageable skin, was finally under control. All thanks to this bar of mudsoap. I don&#x27;t know how this miracle bar did it, but it did the impossible and completely changed my life. Thank you Adovia, thank you, thank you, thank you.    I recommend this to anyone with a skin problem of any kind. This baby seems to be a panacea of sorts.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for my daughter as a cleansing bar. While it does not appear to be actually getting rid of acne, it is working well in overall prevention of breakouts. I would recommend this product to be used along with a topical acne preparation. It is gentle on the skin and reasonably priced for this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> This soap worked amazingly well.  I was a skeptic at first because I didn&#x27;t think anything would relieve my psoriasis and acne but I was surprisingly pleased when I saw the redness in my face dissipate after the first week. I became so addicted to using this soap that I gradually used it more and more. I wake up and wash  my face, mid day wash, and again before I sleep.  Your face will get dry as a result of overusage but for me that works in my favor because I tend to have acne due to an oily complexion.  The soap lasted a remarkably long time even after its many uses.  I actually went without the soap for about 2 weeks after it ran out and instantly my acne returned.  The only bad thing I must comment on is that now I can never use another soap! Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it and noticed the oilyness and acne come back in full force, I&#x27;m going to make sure and stock up on it.- This was rated 5 stars at the time of purchase in July 2010.  ****** UPDATE. This price is ridiculous! I bought this for less than $8 and now one stinkin bar of soap is almost $30? HELL NO I will never buy it again for this price. Sorry Amazon but your loss. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy direct from Adovia!</li>
            <li> So I recived this soap used it on my face and it feels great. The problem I&#x27;m having is that I used it on my body for the next couple days and have noticed Red spots on my legs and arms dunno if its from the soap or somthing else will update after more use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I use Dove Senstive skin and honestly It think that this soap dries out my skin on my body compared to the dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 5/1/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole back ,arms, upper legs have broken out in small red acne like sores  &#x3D;/ wish I could get a refund.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN SO SOFT I NOW HAVE MY FAMILY USING IT.MY KIDS LOVE THIS SOAP AND THE MUD TO.IT MAKES YOUR CUTS HEAL FASTER AND CLEARS YOUR FACE UP AND ANY BODY ACNE YOU MAY HAVE.WE USE THIS SOAP EVERYDAY AND WE HAVE 6 PEOPLE IN ARE FAMILY.SHALOM</li>
            <li> Wow -- I read so many glowing reviews about this soap, I was absolutely excited when I added it to my shopping cart. I used it for 2 months, and not only did it not help with my acne or excema, it actually made these problems worse. My skin feels bumpy and dry all over now -- it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve taken 3 steps back in my fight against bad skin. I am sure a lot of variables go into how a certain soap will affect any one person; this soap seems to work great for some, but it sure didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, but a little drying. I am 23, and am gradually growing out of horrible teen acne. This has helped finish off those last stubborn blemishes. I would not classify it as an acne soap per-say, unless you have extremely oily skin, in which case the drying effect would help (it isn&#x27;t terrible, nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix), but seems like a great maintenance soap. It does clarify the skin, and it helps cell-turnover (which again, can be drying, but is not a bad thing). I don&#x27;t notice a smell at all, and it is exfoliating. Something else that is quite nice about it is it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;melt\\&quot; in the shower like a glycerin soap would. All in all, a great soap, and worth a try for at least moderate acne, or those who wish to clarify their complexions after having battled the teen-scourge longer than their time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any issues with acne, but this soap still did a good job of keeping my skin looking even clearer than before. It prevents breakouts due to clogging and I get this tightening feeling around my face after using. It makes pores look less visible. Plus it&#x27;s not harsh on the face. I also use it on my pubic area and bütt cheeks to prevent clogging after a shave.  I must also say, I use their sulfur soap too, both are good, but I like this one slightly more.</li>
            <li> As a psoriasis suffer with sensitive skin, I find this product to be good one. It lathers up good and does not stink. Must read the fine print and keep the suds out of your eyes otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this soap so I could move away from using Proactiv. Instead my skin got worse and was often very dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my arms and back...after one use, this soap has helped calm the irritation. Another great aspect is that there&#x27;s no odor whatsoever! HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months now and have not seen any improvements in my acne, but my face is very soft. I have hormonal cystic acne and clogged pores. It didn&#x27;t work for me, so i would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had hopes this product would clear my acne but the product did absolutely nothing. I am very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this soap as a moisturizing bar, as it was described. It gets my skin squeaky clean, but I didn&#x27;t notice any extra moisturizing qualities than less expensive soaps. Still, good quality ingredients and a nice fresh light scent. You can feel the mud in the soap bar, so it&#x27;s kind of gritty and exfoliating if you rub the bar itself directly on your skin. No noticeable grit in the lather itself, though. I don&#x27;t think I will reorder for myself. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> I have  just began using this  five  days  ago. I have  had a  major   problem  with  acne  oil and stuff. I have  tried  many products,  for  acne  and  they  don&#x27;t  work. such as   acne  free  3  step  sysetm,  and  proactive. I have  had using been skindaniva  for my extremelly  oily  skin, it  worked somewhat,  but i think i had a   alergic  reaction  to it, cause  i  broke out in  acne  really bad, and  skindaniva  was  $25 gone  done  the  drain. This  bar is only i  think  $9.00 so  I think  why  not  try it such   great   reviews/ Well my  skin is less oily when I have makeup on, and  my  skin  has  this  fresh  glow  under   my makeup  as I  think  this  is  due  to  this  bar. my  acne  is also  suddenly  going  away. I will  update  later  who  knows this  could be my  miracle  bar. I will see  what will  happen   in  three  weeks.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. So, may be it will work for you. It was not worth my investment or money.</li>
            <li> I got this item in a timely manner. It felt good on my skin, but I think I need to get more to continue the affect. My breakouts are still active, but not as much. I think the soap did help. I am going to get some more! and see if it heals my breakouts completely.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband&#x27;s psoriasis. He has used it every day for a week and it is helping quite a bit.  We will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tossed ALL my other facial scrubs &amp; washes to use this EXCLUSIVLY!  So easy to rinse off of your face &amp; neck!  But most importantly, it leaves my skin as soft as my new Grandsons little cheeks!</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  i went online to buy it and the price jumped $20.  No way I am paying that.  A total ripoff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years. Very gentle on my acne prone, combination skin. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but does get rid of the oil and makeup. When I first started using it, I saw a definite decrease in breakouts and they haven&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li> This soap really is good for people who have eczema. I have had eczema ever since I was very young. However, the past several months my eczema has become very severe, and I actually had to get a shot from the dermatologist to help keep my outbreaks and inflammation down. I am very aware of the different types of soaps/ skin care products that are good for people who have eczema, but my skin is still irritated by a lot of them. This dead sea mud soap has worked tremendously for my eczema, and it has been an incredible blessing.  I have to say, I&#x27;ve tried a few other dead sea mud soaps that are out there, and Adovia has been one of the best. Although I can say Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap has been the best soap for my eczema so far, the price increase is utterly ridiculous. When I first started buying this soap, it only cost around $8 a bar. Now that it&#x27;s $18.99 + $3.10 shipping, I have to say I can no longer buy Adovia. $8 a bar was already higher than most other dead sea mud soap brands, and one bar goes by so fast (mud soap doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular bar soaps).  I would rate Adovia 5 stars for the product, but the price doesn&#x27;t even make it worth it. It&#x27;s really sad for me, because I thought I had finally found something to help my severe eczema (a skin condition people are born with and has no real \\&quot;cure\\&quot;) without having to constantly pay so much money.</li>
            <li> Finally a Dead Sea Mud Soap that works. First, this Dead Sea soap has one of the best exfoliating feelings out of any soap I&#x27;ve tried. Its refreshing. The thing I love about the Dead Sea soaps is that it gives my skin a real \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; and \\&quot;nourished\\&quot; feeling. As a side added bonus, this soap also helps with Eczema, Psoriasis or Acne. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I really like usiong this soap, makes you feel clean. Thought it was odd that when I opened it, it looked like someone took a bite from it. It looked like teeth marks..... But it didnt decourage me from using it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I use in the shower.  Very soothing for sensitive skin.  Helps my extremely dry skin feel, and look, better.</li>
            <li> I used this soap on my face and body. I don&#x27;t usually have any acne problems, but this soap made me break out all over my face and back. I got it for my keratosis pilaris, but it just made my unaffected skin worse.</li>
            <li> Dionysia&#x27;s daughter-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes all the oil and most of my makeup right off. Doesn&#x27;t strip my skin and leave it very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this soap. I would totally recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and I&#x27;ve had acne since I turned 18. I suffer from large pores, blackheads and terrible breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of soaps from bars to liquids and nothing has worked as well as Adovia. I follow up with their raw yellow shea butter and my skin has never looked better. It has a really rich lather and my face feels really soft afterwards! I would recommend only washing once every other day to start and then working up to once a day if needed. If you overdo it, your skin will get dry and break out more. I don&#x27;t know what it is about this soap that my skin responds so well to, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little steep, though for me, it is so much better than throwing my money away on expensive skin care systems that over-promise and do not deliver.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try on Psoriasis and was not impressed. Better off with a store brand moisture soap for sensitive skin type and spend your money on a good cream to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to face wash. It  makes my skin glow and feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, improved dry skin, helped my eczema to be much less irritated, and is great to use on my face as an acne cleanser!  I&#x27;ve already ordered more:-)</li>
            <li> So far so good. Not too dry, but clear enough. No smell at all.</li>
            <li> combined with sea salt soap gives an excellent result!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried for my eczema. I tried it a few months ago and liked it a lot but stopped due to the price and regretted it when I ran out. My eczema flared right back up. It&#x27;s not a cure but it is best product I&#x27;ve tried so far. I recommend for anyone suffering from eczema to try.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic, and works great; but, I don&#x27;t understand how it went from $5.99 per bar with free shipping to almost $30 with $11 in shipping.  I don&#x27;t care how great it is, it isn&#x27;t worth over $40 a bar.  There have to be cheaper alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my arms/face MG217 works alone, as for Adovia Natural Deep Sea Mud Soap, like another reviewer said \\&quot;It didn&#x27;t do anything for me\\&quot; either, I even left this soap on my psoriasis for like 5-10 before washing off Neutrogena T-Gel is effective and so is a 2% tar shampoo that&#x27;s sold called Nizoral.</li>
            <li> [...]  The finest Dead Sea cosmetics and beauty products based on natural ingredients found only in the Dead Sea.  The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome!  It made my skin so soft.  My face usually takes a few days to stop reacting to a new soap, but this stuff worked great right away.  My boyfriend was really sceptical about it, but after he tried it he uses it just as much as I do.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Overall the soap is as advertised. It works okay, not a miracle cure though by any means.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the important thing to note--after I started using it, after I read the label, after I knew it said avoid eye area...&lt;br /&gt;It still must have managed to seep in there despite my best efforts.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use it around my eye area. I never even felt it go near my eyes but it must have managed to sneak in.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me the absolute nastiest headaches, dry eyes, light sensitivity, etc...not like mildly annoying either--like dehabilitating pain! After about 10 days of misery it occured to me that the soap was the likely culprit. It was.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all of the reviews and I must say that I am glad i did! I initially was looking for a sulfur bar soap but came across this. I wanted to wait a while before posting my review and after almost two months I am happy with the product. I knew my face looked different but after slacking in my routine of cleaning my face before bed for a few weeks my blackheads had come back...all my blemishes had disappeared while using this but during my slacking the clogged pores started to create large under the skin bumps.. but now after a week of continued use once again they are gone!! I have recommended this product over and over and I will continue to use it. I see the difference in my skin and I have had many others comment and ask what I use for my flawless skin and they are shocked that I don&#x27;t say its a foundation but a face wash!! Thank you Adovia for an awesome product!!</li>
            <li> This product has been great so far.  I have used it before going to bed and my skin feels soft afterwards.  I haven&#x27;t really used any bar soaps because it always leaves my face feeling dry but this product left my skin feeling soft.  The color of the bar is black as pictured and it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.  It just seems like an all around natural mud soap.  I like it.  Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Pretty non drying. Didn&#x27;t see any crazy changes. Wouldn&#x27;t mind using it again.</li>
            <li> For me, this soap has done wonders for the psoriasis I have suffered on my face. My cheeks are so much smoother, haven&#x27;t been itchy, and only during bad flare-ups have there been redness &amp; irritation. Just a note: it goes fast if left wet, so it&#x27;s great to keep it in a soap case to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely.  Feels good</li>
            <li> First of all, a bit of a background.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 26 year old woman who never truly suffered from acne while in my teens. Yes, I did have the occasional break out and a not so subtle dime sized pimple here and there, but I never suffered these blemishes for long and they always went away.&lt;br /&gt;As I grew older, however, my face started to change. I have small, yet redish-pink, rash-like skin across the bridge of my nose which extends midway through both sides of my cheeks. It seldom ever falls victim to white heads, but it causes people to wonder if I have Lupus or some other issue like alcoholism. I try assuring them I do not, but they still know what&#x27;s up anyway right?&lt;br /&gt;Then, at the tender age of 22-in February of 2009-I began experiencing painful and debilitating under arm acne break outs. I changed my soap, my detergent, fabric softener, deodorant/antiperspirant, bras, shirts-you name it I changed it. After 6 months with no change, I went to my Doctor who gave me birth control, anti-biotics and medicated body wash. Nothing helped, in fact, it only got worse. I stopped shaving, I tried every type of body wash, soap, toner and cleanser the drug stores had to offer. I found one thing that worked for a while, but it kept bleaching out my skin and I became increasingly sensitive to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Recently though, I came across reviews of Adovia and I found them uplifting and full of hope. I purchased the bar of soap which now has a place of honor in my shower stall and I have to say that I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I use it daily and my acne has dimished-I haven&#x27;t had painful break outs in weeks and I didn&#x27;t receive any close to my ladie&#x27;s time. I don&#x27;t know if this will be permanent, but I can say that it&#x27;s a miracle for me and perhaps it can be for you as well.</li>
            <li> This was a bit costly with shipping and handling.  I&#x27;m not sure if it has helped my skin issues but it has not made them worse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for eczema.  It&#x27;s not bad.  It really didn&#x27;t help or hurt the eczema.  My daughter used it for a touch of acne, on her face.  She said it did help the acne a little bit.  It suds up really well.  Basically has no smell.  Since it didn&#x27;t make an earth shattering difference, I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.  I have other soap products that work a little better on eczema.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this product, in the past I have always used Seacret Minerals From the Dead Sea Mud Soap, for my acne. This soap was a little bit cheaper so I decided to try it out instead. I used it consistently morning and night until the bar was completely gone which took about a month and a half. After a week of using it day/night, I had to be sure to use a moisturizer after use b/c my skin would be so tight and dry it would hurt. Other then the effect of my skin being tight and dry after use, that was the only real difference I saw. My acne did not get any better with the use of this bar, or minimize. I will not reorder this bar even if it is cheaper than Seacret.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped my skin a lot. I wash my face every morning and night with this and my pimples have all disappeared. When u wash this soap off it might feel a little drying but after about 10 minutes ur face feels fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought it really for my acne problem which I tend to get on my back and sometimes my chest. I love it! It helps out so much. I still do get an pimple here or there but there minimal. My body feels a lot smoother, especially my legs which are always dry.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000F6RFX4 Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap - Great for Eczema, Psoriasis or Acne!]]    This is a great product.  I read the previous reviews on the product and it is all true; I was impressed by how fast it worked.  I washed my face the first day and my complexion was better the next day.  I was shocked and impressed.  It is better than Proactiv - a lot less hassle and excellent results.  Do not look any further for a high-producing soap.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;m a 24 year old female.  I have had acne since I was 10 years old. I have legit tried every product out there with the exception of prescribed medications. I have had SOME success. Let me break this down.  FACE:  My face has a tendency to clear up for a few weeks and then breakout, out of seemingly nowhere. Doesn&#x27;t matter what I eat, whether I take vitamins or not.  My face is either smooth, or looks like the surface of the moon.  During the summer months I use Clearasil Daily Scrub, because it lifts the oils without drying me out too much, and somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  My facial skin seems to be allergic to most things so this came as a shock to me.  During the winter months I usually mix Cetiphil Gentle Skin Cleanser with St Ives (or store brand) Apricot Scrub for all skin types.  It exfoliates, cleanses, and leaves moisture which is awesome since every moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used has made my face more shiny than a disco ball.   BODY:  My bacne is stubborn as hell.  It comes in patches, not usually all over.  It goes usually from my shoulders to the small of my back, occasionally on my sides.  I assume that this is a combination of oil and sweat, and since like most people I wear shirts most of the day, it doesn&#x27;t really have the opportunity to breathe and dry out.  As far as body wash goes, every acne clearing body wash/scrub either makes me worse, or makes my already dry legs feel like alligator skin.  I get so itchy, especially over the winter that I develop welts and so forth.. It&#x27;s really a project to handle. A bar of cetiphil is really the only thing that doesnt kill me.  REVIEW:  Now, I have been using this for the 3 or 4 days that I&#x27;ve had it, and my face is most definitely allergic to it.. I break out not into new acne, but into allergy bumps WHILE IM IN THE SHOWER.  While it does leave my face really clean, and after about 2 hours of sitting and waiting a bit smoother, I&#x27;m not sure that the itchy factor is worth it.  As faras my body goes, this does NOT dry out my legs.  In fact, it makes them less dry, so I&#x27;m happy about that.  My back has been less red and irritated, and the size of the acne seems to be decreasing.  It has not cleared up, but It&#x27;s definitely looking and feeling better than it was.  I will continue using this until the bar is done to see what happens, but I&#x27;m not confident that this is much better than my bar of cetiphil was and its twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> This mud soap works great!!! I used it as a facial and body soap; As a facial soap, it leaves the skin very clean and moisturized. This product is all natural. There are no fragrance, and it&#x27;s good for the skin. I love this product!! My skin used to be very oily at the end of the day, but after using this soap, my skin is more balanced and moisturized. My mom, who also has oily skin, used this soap. She claimed that her skin remained non-oily for the entire day. I would recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> he loves it takes the psoriaisa away</li>
            <li> i used to get acne on my face once per week. not serious but irritating. tried sulfur soap but felt like applying medicine. didnt like the sulfur smell and extreme dryness. so i gave this mud soap a try. result? i use it to wash my face twice in morning and evening and i havent got a single acne since then! it does have a mud smell but far better than sulfur. also please be noted although it contains sort of olive oil for moisture but still causes slight dryness. however i apply a little bit of my kid&#x27;s baby lotion and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Lathers good. good soap especially in hard water.</li>
            <li> this soap is for the face and problems skin, but i have been using it just for the feet. great for all that dead skin build up we all get. still have to file but keeps it from comming back as bad. use it every day.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t tell if it helps my acne or not, it is a good daily cleanser. Face feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne pretty much my whole adult life and have tried everything under the sun to control it. I first used this soap a few years back along with the whole clear skin kit I got from the Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice website. I returned to this soap recently after seeing it on here for a good price, as the whole kit is rather pricey. Even just using the soap itself without the other products (Dead Sea toner &amp; Dead Sea Exfoliating Salt) has made a major difference! My skin is perfectly clear now after almost a year of continuous breakouts. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and it lasts several months. It can be a tiny bit drying, but a simple moisturizer works to fix that.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I have suffered with ezcema for years, and this soap really soothes my skin.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1 month in hopes that is could treat my shoulder acne. Even with every day use, I noticed very little change in the amount of body acne I had. That said, I would not purchase this product as an acne treatment.  However, the soap does make your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap. Great for those with perioral dermatitis and with less of a premium compared to other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap and this Dead Sea Mud Soap and I love them both.  Nice clean unscented soaps that lather well and provide great minerals for my skin.  No bothersome scent.  Just clean and unscented.  Good solid product.</li>
            <li> i always test a soap on a nailbrush first. most soaps later up to a clean white bubbly lather and leave your nails soft enough to file and your hands squeaky clean. this soap, when brushed along a nailbrush, turns your nail brush dark grey ( and it is difficult to come off), no lather, it just keeps getting thicker and thicker like oil and doesn&#x27;t even rinse off. i had to use another soap... (dove, eurecrin, clarins) to remove this stuff. i don&#x27;t know what it is in it&#x27;s compound to do this, but it&#x27;s not going anywhere near my face! i couldn&#x27;t even give you an alternative use for it (so you don&#x27;t end up throwing your money out). i happen to have thrown it out. not a buy at all.......awful, just awful.</li>
            <li> my daughter 7yrs old told me that feel good skin look better she has eczema so I think it good just start maybe I going order more later if it improves for her. Thanks customer!</li>
            <li> Love this product and would highly recommend this for any skin type!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a really good Dead sea mud soap and the search is over!! I am really pleaded with this soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry your face like most soaps do and it has nature ingredients which is a major plus for me. I would highly recommend this soap to anyone who&#x27;s looking for their skin to feel smooth  and  soft and which has ingredients that come from the Dead sea!!</li>
            <li> Used it on my whole body! Great for my acne and dry skin! I feel so fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and smooth. I have always had a little rash of some kind on the back of my arms, and this cleared it up. I really like it. It&#x27;s a little pricey to order, but I&#x27;ll find a cheaper source. I did see that the company (Adovia) has terrible environmental ratings.</li>
            <li> This product is great at helping to clear up your complexion without drying out your skin. MY son uses it and I have seen an improvement in his acne.</li>
            <li> Really good soap, saw results within days.</li>
            <li> I have acnes from time to time.And it&#x27;s really not easy to find a nice thing to clean the oily face. This soap, however,makes me feel clean and fresh. I will choose the soap next time.</li>
            <li> After passing the age of 60, I started having breakouts on my scalp which could not be explained by either me or my doctors. Prescription treatments turned out to be both costly and ineffective, so I developed my own treatment strategy. I am currently using this product, Adovia Dead Sea mud soap, in conjunction with Grisi sulfur soap with lanolin. I supplement this with 2-4 grams of vitaminB-5 each day and with either Retinol creme or Tri-Derma Facial Redness Repair for really rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear about my range of experience, I have also used Adovia sulfur soap with Dead Sea mud and Dudu-Osun soap. The combination I describe above is my optimal approach, but the Adovia sulfur soap and similar products are also pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is primarily Dead Sea mud, which comprises silt as well as magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. While it has some cleansing action, it is neither very acidic (as with sulfur soap) or alkaline (as with Dudu-Odun, which uses wood ash as an ingredient). For this reason, the action of this soap is pretty mild. Here are some more detailed notes on this soap and what it&#x27;s good for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Antibacterial action. Bacteria don&#x27;t thrive in either acidic or alkaline renvironments. For this reason, the best antibacterial soaps are either one or the other when mixed with water. Sulfur soaps and Dudu-Osun are highly antibacterial. Dead Sea mud does not appear to be very antibacterial, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Skin irritation. The highly alkaline Dudu-Osun soap can be very caustic, leading to skin irritation. This product is very mild. I can leave it on for 10-20 minutes with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Exfoliation. Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, clearing pores and letting the skin breathe. They can be either mechanical (from scrubbing) or chemical (as with alpha hydroxy acid). This product, with its silt, is a mechanical exfoliant. I rate it as a pretty good one. And, of course, many others have spent the last thousands of years using Dead Sea silt for exactly this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Anti-inflammatory. The salts in Dead Sea mud, especially magnesium salt, have an anti-inflammatory action. They help to reduce the swelling from acne and other sores. I rate this product as very good on this measure. It&#x27;s my primary reason for using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you might like using this soap just because your skin will feel softer and more refreshed afterward. And that&#x27;s exactly what using this product will lead to. It&#x27;s a winner, and I highly recommend it.nt the last thousands of years using Dead Sea silt for exactly this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Anti-inflammatory.

            <li> It was too tough on my skin. Might be better for hands or for mechanic&#x27;s with greasy hands. I have purchased other products from this company that I do like. Such as their regular soap, and the dead sea mud. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I reviewed the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask and I absolutely LOVED it so when I was presented with the opportunity to try out the soap of course I said YES! I received the soap about a week ago and have been using it every day since then for my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description states the following:&lt;br /&gt;* Removes dirt and cleanses your skin, while simultaneously infusing it with minerals essential to keeping your skin hydrated and moisturized&lt;br /&gt;* Enriched with century old Dead Sea mud, leaving your skin cleansed and nourished&lt;br /&gt;* Contains a unique combination of Dead Sea minerals derived from Dead Sea Mud&lt;br /&gt;* 100% All Natural Moisturizing Soap&lt;br /&gt;* This soap has also been found effective at relieving acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I will examine each point bullet by bullet.&lt;br /&gt;* Definitely removes dirt and cleanses skin. I felt totally clean after using it. I can&#x27;t really say whether or not I was infused but I can definitely say that I felt some gritty stuff when I was lathering my washcloth. It wasn&#x27;t gross gritty, so no worries. As for keeping hydrated I felt totally smooth.&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t know how old the mud is. I wasn&#x27;t there, obviously. I&#x27;ll just have to trust Adovia on this one but however old it is it works wonders in the cleansed and nourished department. Again, I felt really clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;* I would hope the minerals came from Dead Sea Mud considering the name so again, I&#x27;ll just trust Adovia on this.&lt;br /&gt;* I can honestly say after using the soap I really did not need any lotion, body butter, cream, etc. If you want to use that stuff for extra moisturizing that is totally fine, I did some days, but I didn&#x27;t NEED to. That&#x27;s the point.&lt;br /&gt;* I am not prone to acne so I can&#x27;t say if it relieves it. However, I do have an issue with one recurring blackhead (yeah, you read right, one recurring blackhead) and I haven&#x27;t have a problem with it since using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the verdict on the Dead Sea Mud Soap is in: a definite must have! It really does what it says and if you have the luxury of owning both the mask and the soap your face is in for some serious pampering and softness! I tried the soap for 5 days without the mask to see how it worked on its own, then I used the soap with the mask for the next two days. All I can say is I am hooked! I love Adovia!must have!

            <li> I really enjoy Dead Sea type of products, so trying this out was right up my alley. I absolutely have fallen in love with this soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the soap is very natural and earthy, which if you have used any type of Dead Sea products before, you know what I am talking about. To use, I got into the shower, and rubbed the bar vigorously over my loofah creating a very nice lather. I then washed my body as normal. It felt so refreshing on my skin, almost rejuvenating. I literally had that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling. I was able to get half of my body washed before having to re-lather some more soap on my loofah.  After I was done, my skin just felt so soft, smooth and supple. I do suffer from sensitive skin, and some skin issues, and this soap did not irritate or bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next use I used the soap as apart of my facial routine. I rubbed the bar of soap between my hands, and again got a a nice lather going. I put it on my face and used a facial brush to gently exfoliate my face, and also clean and remove any dirt or left over makeup. After rinsing, my face was so clean and fresh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this soap, and reach for it every time I am in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This Winter I got Eczema around my Ankles where socks would touch, in addition to my Wrists where I wore elastic Arm Warmers. I&#x27;d tried a variety of products but am most excited about this one. I reluctantly switched back to Bar Soap every shower and laid it on thick, letting it sit awhile. It seems almost fatty and gets gooey in the soap dish, but it&#x27;s worth this minor hassle.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the idea of using bar soap for my face. However, once I started using it, my skin totally changed. It no longer felt oily all the time and my acne totally cleared up. I loved that the soap was able to help me with my zits while moisturizing at the same time so I wasn&#x27;t walking around with dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product along with the mask for almost a week now and i am very very pleased with the results of it. it leaves my legs feeling very smooth and cleared my psoriasis to half of what they originally were. thanks so much, will be putting up the review this week on my blog. the only thing i would perfer about it would be that it be a liquid soap instead of a bar.</li>
            <li> REALLY MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL CLEAN, gives skin a fresh look, and deep cleans.  Also seems to be healing damages areas from roughness of shaving.</li>
            <li> I am afflicted with severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) on the palmer and dorsal sides of my hands.  At its worst, the skin is fissured, flaking and extremely dry.  Based upon glowing reviews, I ordered this soap.  Although the soap does not&lt;br /&gt;irritate my hands, it dried and irritated my face, which is unusual because my complexion is oily.  I now limit my use of this soap to my hands.  It is too soon to ascertain whether the soap is beneficial for my hands, as such I cannot state with certainty whether I will purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  September 7, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Having used the product, I would now give it a 1 star rating.  I had only used the Adovia as a facial soap 2 or 3 thimes.  However, it stripped my skin and left me with what appeared to be a severe chemical burn.  Nothing seemed to relieve the dryness, flakiness and itching that lasted for weeks.  A trip to the dermatologist is pointless in my geographic area. Even if you are fortunate enought to obtain an appointment, you will wait 3 or more hours beyond you scheduled visit and then may only be seen by a physician&#x27;s assistant.  In desperation, I turned to Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream, a product that had always been off limits because of my oily complexion.  With 24-hours of the first use, the Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream alleviated the dryness, flakiness and itching.  In the final analysis, the adovia soap did not help my eczema and it certainly harmed my compexion.</li>
            <li> I got this soap for my husband, who has an oily back.  He&#x27;s not really sure if he likes it after using it for a month.  He liked it more after I read aloud the description of what is in it.</li>
            <li> I consider this soap pricey and didn&#x27;t work on my skin at all. My skin was very dry and itchy after I used it. I used the 2 bars I bought to see if works but... nope, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! This is my second order. I brought it to try (since i&#x27;ve brought the supreme premier one at the mall, it was good at the beginning after a month my face became worst then before, did&#x27;nt what happened) and it completly meet my expectation. I made a pic the first day for a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; , 3 months after the difference is evident no more acne, black spots, etc... My face is soft and clean. Don&#x27;t even need to use cleanser or makeup remover. If you use it only on your face, the bar can last more than 3 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product. USE IT WITH THE ADOVIA AT HOME DERMABRASION, you might have more excellent result.</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much I need to have it in the bathroom at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found no other soap that works as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap in the shower for a couple weeks. I&#x27;ve used it all over for washing as well as for my face. I like how it fells on my face, washing away just enough oil but not leaving my skin too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the Dead Sea Mud Soap has passed the test for my sensitive skin because it does not irritate my skin when I use it for shaving. I am allergic to most shaving creams, so I use bar soap to shave my legs. Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do, it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume, like the bar from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar itself is a little rough because I take it out of the shower so it dries put in between use. I actually like that because when I use it directly on my legs just for washing it fells like I am exfoliating a little too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap is doing its job washing and not leaving me too dry! It&#x27;s a good bar of soap for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 10 years now and it&#x27;s gotten so bad that I&#x27;ve got 80% of my body is covered. Topical steroids are not working and insurance isn&#x27;t willing to pay for more expensive treatments. After my first use so much scaling has come off I was shocked. I haven&#x27;t had it long but early results are phenomenal and can&#x27;t wait to see after prolonged use. I&#x27;m no doctor and I&#x27;m not saying this is a cure but it&#x27;s reducing scaling super quickly.</li>
            <li> I received a bar of this soap for Free when I purchased another product from Adovia. This soap smells yummy. This gentle soaps cleans my skin and face leaving it feeling hydrated. Perfect for washing my prone to break out skin.</li>
            <li> I have been battling oily, problem skin for 30 years and have tried almost every product imaginable.  Finding this soap has been a miracle.  My skin has never been this clear or soft.  I am even seeing an improvement in my skin tone - 30 years&#x27; worth of acne scars are not nearly as noticeable.  Both of my teens use this soap now and love it.... they inherited my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to know they won&#x27;t have to put up with the years of frustration and embarrassment that I went through.</li>
            <li> Does a Good Job, Switching from my Sephora face wash, to this, was a good thing.  Have combination skin and this soap is drying, so it works good for my oily areas.  I always use a makeup remover wipe to remove makeup before i wash it.  So with my face really clean, I have noticed my poors  are less visible.  I really like that a bar soap gives so much back and it is cheap compared to most face washes.  Shipped quick in pretty box,  VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> This soap has really helped to keep my acne prone skin clear.  I use it with &amp;#34;the regimen&amp;#34; from acne dot org, but instead of washing my face with their soap 2x a day, I use this in the morning.  It feels great, lasts a long time, and has minimal ingredients.  It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> You can really tell the difference with this soap. It really cleans. The size of it is very nice for the price very easy to clean off what some soaps have as like film this does not. This has good ingredients and very good results</li>
            <li> Best for ezcema! It leaves skin hydrated and there isn&#x27;t a smell. It lathers white and is easy to use. It helped with my severe ezcema really well!</li>
            <li> This soap works great! My boyfriend has horrible eczema and this helped soothe his skin when it flares up. I gave him the majority of the soap but kept a small chunk for myself for when I get any pimples on my face. It definitely seems to help me get rid of them a lot quicker and helps my skin feel less oily during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It helps keep the seborrheic dermatitis at bay.</li>
            <li> I want to first say that I did receive the soap for free (but was not paid for this review) however I did have to purchase it with a coupon code on Amazon. The shipping was fabulous, I got the soap within less than a week and it was packaged perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is great for people with Eczema, Acne, and Psoriasis. While I do not suffer from any of these things I still loved the soap. The soap is 100% natural and keeps your skin feeling moisturized and soft after washing with it. What I have noticed is that my feet are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $12 price tag is quite expensive for soap so while I did enjoy using it I will probably not be a customer since that breaks my bank and I do not have any skin conditions. However, if you have long been suffering from itchy and bumpy skin I highly suggest checking this out.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea.. you have heard about it before, but what exactly is it?&lt;br /&gt; Let me explain..&lt;br /&gt; The Dead Sea [also known as the Salt Sea] is a salt lake that borders Jordan. This hyper-saline lake contains significant concentrations of mineral salts with saline levels that surpass ocean water. The Dead Sea is one of the world&#x27;s saltiest bodies of water &amp; has become the epicenter of health research around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what about this Dead Sea Mud you hear so much about? Natural black mud is a substance that shares the mineral content of the dead sea-found and extracted from the earth&#x27;s lowest places. This therapeutic silt/mud stimulates circulation, and refines Dead Sea Mud Soap- I have read extensively about the many benefits:&lt;br /&gt;•Clears up acne&lt;br /&gt;•Removes dirt/bacteria&lt;br /&gt;•Detoxes skin&lt;br /&gt;•Cleanses skin&lt;br /&gt;•Hydrates skin&lt;br /&gt;•Moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;•Is 100% natural&lt;br /&gt;•Infuses skin w/minerals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do remember how I feel about my natural products, right? I&#x27;m in LOVE with them, in case you forgot! I felt this essential beauty bar had such purpose, containing antimicrobial properties which aid in skin concerns such as:&lt;br /&gt;•acne&lt;br /&gt;•eczema&lt;br /&gt;•psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;I could not wait to try Adovia&#x27;s Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap just to see how well it actually could benefit my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I get a few blemishes here and there, and noticed that I was imperfection free after applying this soap to the delicate skin on my face and body for a week. I also noticed how immaculate my face felt, after a substantial lather and rinse, I felt like I was finally obtaining the deep cleanse my skin desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Putting century old dead sea mud on your face and expecting extreme results sounds absurd to most, but it&#x27;s not unrealistic. My protective coverings all felt stimulated and resuscitated after a few days of use. My skin felt and appeared flawless, with no drying or skin irritation to note. My skin texture and tone transformed delightfully to my satisfaction.

            <li> Love it for my skin!!! Want more!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll ask my sister for it for Christmas because I love it that much!</li>
            <li> I just bought a bar of Adovia&#x27;s dead sea mud soap to try out. I&#x27;ve used their Dead Sea Mud Mask so I had high hopes for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin - oily on my forehead and nose but normal to dry everywhere else. The soap didn&#x27;t dry out my skin in the areas that turn flaky with regular soaps and did a great job of cleansing my skin in the oily areas. I&#x27;m going to use this soap after my next workout as I think it will do a great job of cleansing the oily skin on my back and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t overly fragrant. I don&#x27;t like soaps or cleansing creams that smell like a bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great cleansing bar that doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;This soap doesn&#x27;t lather up like most soaps. But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, just use a bit more water and it will eventually form enough lather to wash your face.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son. He had cronic acne. This soap has really helped his skin out. I think you have to get the bar and try it out. We have bought this ite for three years now.</li>
            <li> The mud soap was also fun to use.  I again felt like I was in a spa at home.  Removes dirt and cleanses your skin.  I would love to travel to the dead sea but this is what I am getting now.  And I love it! Dead Sea Mud Soap felt like a Spa Day.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my oily skin feeling very clean</li>
            <li> A decent enough soap, but if you are buying it hoping it will make a difference for your psoriasis, don&#x27;t bother. Having had it my whole life, I am disappointed I let myself fall for the &amp;#34;miracle psoriasis cure&amp;#34; reviews. This soap did absolutely nothing. I should have known better.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea mud soap is great to begin with. This soap is very hard, and I have gotten 7 months of use from one bar, on a daily basis, and haven&#x27;t made a dent in it. Excellent quality and very with the $13 price tag.</li>
            <li> When I first got the soap, I loved the fresh and clean scent! It was strong during my first use, but died down significantly after that. I was so disappointed! However, if you don’t like strong smelling soaps, that might be a plus for you. I’ve used this bar of soap all up in the shower over a course of three weeks. I was really impressed that the soap lasted that long, as I usually use up a bar of soap in 1-2 weeks. I am happy to report that my back is clear of all the acne I had. My jawline, on the other hand, is still not 100% clear. I did see a small improvement, but my acne is definitely still there. That may be due to me using a lot of products, such as moisturizers, sunscreen, or makeup on my face, but I still would have liked that acne to disappear as well.</li>
            <li> Every time I wash my face with Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap, my face feels clean and hydrated. It also has helped my wife clear up her adult acne. It even smells clean. I love how it makes my face feel so incredibly moisturized. My face even looks clearer after I wash with it. I have been telling all my friends and family about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free so that I can give Amazon members my honest opinion and let you know whether it works and if it is worth buying. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive skin. You can really feel it cleaning your skin. It helps with acne a bit but not really that much. If you have dry skin, you might have to use a moisturizer after use. Great clean smell. Overall its a good product. I like it!</li>
            <li> i have psoriasis, and this soap was beyond soothing. the scent is earthy and pleasant. very definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I love Adovia&#x27;s sulphur soap and thought I&#x27;d switch it up a bit. Product made my face break out within two days.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves you feeling dry in the shower but once you dry off you feel moisturized and great! You don&#x27;t feel dry at all, but leaves you with a very clean feeling. I only wish I bought more bars when it was $6.99, which has now gone up to $9.99!!! Yikes, amazon..lower your price!</li>
            <li> I started using this soap on July 23. I use it two a day, when i shower and before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne: oily in the T-Zone area with about 1-4 breakout a week. sucks! After using this soaps my current two pimples have dried up and nothing new has come up which it would have done by now without it. And it&#x27;s VERY drying :( But afer a couple of weeks my face got use to it so its not as drying anymore. My face has always been soft so i cant say this product made my face soft but i still have some of my acne scars which I was hoping it was treat but eh. When i broke out around my period, the soap didnt resolve the issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin: I have a bit of my skin issue on my shoulders and hip. It did help b/c it started going away however it didnt \\&quot;fix\\&quot; it like I had hoped but it did help with my body acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 19.  Soap for my acne? No. For my eczema? yes. Body acne? Yes</li>
            <li> When using this soap I feel like more pores tighten up without feeling like they are sucked free of moisture. Even after using this soap in a hot shower, my skin was less dry than usual.  The more I use this soap, I am finding I need less moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16 year old, and you know how bad acne can be that age.  It worked wonders for her.  I will be buying this product often!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  For anyone who is sensitve to dyes or perfumes, this is for you.  Not drying at all and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been living in fear of bar soap for years. I have extremely dry skin and i find most of the bar soap that i find in the stores just makes the whole situation 10 times worse. A part of me wanted this to work well for me, while the other sort of wanted to prove my skin really is as bad as i think it is. Well part of me was triumphant. After using Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud soap my face felt soft and well hydrated, i was pretty sure it was a fluke so I&#x27;ve continued to wash with the soap and still no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap takes a bit to lather and when it does its a very rich lather. It has a very faint earthy smell. And of course as mentioned about my skin felt soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a whole skin regimen i start with this soap and then move on to my Mary Kay cleansers. They seem to play well with each other. Id highly recommend this soap to those with dry skin issues. I do have occasional eczema patches but during the time of trying the Mud Soap i was free and clear of them so i cant really speak about that.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial, but all opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, so when I was asked to review their Mud Soap I jumped at the opportunity! I just love their skincare line. Their products really do make my skin baby-smooth and have helped alleviate the problems I had been having with adult acne. I perform frequently, so it is really important for me to have beautiful skin. This Mud Soap works great as an all over body cleanser - I highly recommend it, especially for dry or acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and Shipping: this product was shipped in a timely manner and received no damage during transit. As always, Adovia has beautiful packaging that you might see in an high-end spa.</li>
            <li> **Disclosure: I did receive a bar of this for free, but this doesn&#x27;t affect my opinion on it in any way whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a relatively small bar. It&#x27;s approximately the size of your palm, probably. It has a dark gray-green color and feels smooth to the touch. The scent is interesting and I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but it seemed a bit lemony to me. It doesn&#x27;t lather much on my skin and the lather is rather clear. It feels like it cleans well and my skin felt smoother and softer after use. It didn&#x27;t react to my skin or anything, so I was happy about that. Overall, I liked it.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Cleared up my son&#x27;s break out face.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this soap on his face, ears, and neck.  Leaves his skin so clean.....it squeaks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this bar of soap because of all the information I&#x27;ve read about how dead sea mud (anything) helps with skin ailments.  I have excema (maybe rosacea) on my cheeks so I decided to take the chance.  I used it one night before retiring and the next day, it appeared that the redness had subsided and was less &amp;#34;angry.&amp;#34;  It also made my skin very soft.  Over the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the texture of my facial skin.  My forehead, once bumpy from the ailment, was now beginning to clear up and smooth out.  I now use it about every other day.  I&#x27;m a believer</li>
            <li> i wasnt expecting a miracle, but it burned my skin rather than healing it . also it dried it out and brought no moisture to my hands.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin after using this soap and i wasnt a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and figured I would give this a try. Sad to say, it dried out my skin even more and I started to break out. Maybe it will work for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.soap.  I personally think it works just very slow. My face felt great when I touch it after I have lathered my face and rinse. I&#x27;m still using it after 3 week I&#x27;m seeing tiny changes on my face. I have discoloration.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really work for me! I tried a lot of products, but this one is really good, it treats my skin.</li>
            <li> if there was 10 stars it would be a 10+&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li> works great. i recomend it. it is as described</li>
            <li> Acceptable. It doesn&#x27;t have any magic. It is a normal soap.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because it was quite messy. It made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Adovia dead sea products. Their quality is amazing and this product is no different. I use this soap in the shower daily. It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin. The color of the bar is a little different, but don&#x27;t let that scare you. It is an amazing product that I will for sure purchase again!</li>
            <li> Soap makes your skin feel oil free and fresh, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in with acne and psoriasis</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent definitely worth it. I noticed the difference in my skin two weeks later. I wash my skin with this product at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I never use soap on my face, because it can clog pores and dry skin at the same time.  I have combination skin and mild/moderate acne (I&#x27;m 35).  This soap is fantastic!  If you think about the price in terms of replacing a bottle of cleanser, it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  A little goes a long way.  Now the primary reason I bought it was for my daughter&#x27;s eczema, and though it didn&#x27;t cure her, it may have improved her condition and definitely hasn&#x27;t had the negative effect that most soaps do.  Save yourself the effort and money - order a couple bars right off the bat.  Plus, it takes care of those little bumps some kids get on their cheeks in cold, dry weather!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Do be careful on storing your Adovia though - don&#x27;t leave it in the shower to melt.</li>
            <li> a tad expensive but a great product.</li>
            <li> This soap is pretty awesome. I got it in only three days which I appreciate. It also started to clear up my acne immediately. As others have posted it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent but since it is working I really don&#x27;t care. I will definitely order this again. I have had acne for 11 years and this is the first soap that has worked right away. My skin hasn&#x27;t broken out since I stated it and was clearer by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have age spots on my face, arms and legs.  My husband and I started using a bar of Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap in December 2010.  By the end of the first bar of soap (2 months)my spots had faded significantly.  One on my neck completely disappeared.  We are halfway through the second bar (March 2011). The spots on my arm and face are fading to almost pale.  I am taking the soap to my skin doctor appointment.  Very very impressed and convinced.</li>
            <li> I recently heard of this product from a youtube guru. I decided to try it, and for 1 week already I can see the improvement in my skin. Hopefully it will continue to improve! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister.  I&#x27;m hoping that in time it will regenerate back to what it used to look like because she has had some significant skin issues. Especially long ago when she did a lot of scratching. She says her  skin is so soft now, I just want her to be happy! I was pretty surprised that this worked the first time she used it. She has eczema and have tried just about everything to get rid of it. I think this soap is really helping her.</li>
            <li> This soap is so good fro you face and clearing the impurities highly recommended to everyone for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> After a long hard winter, I am thankful for spring. My hands get all chapped up from the bitter cold and I do experience eczema on my fingers. I enjoyed using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap all over my body but especially on my hands. It does not foam up like “normal” soap does but it leaves hands clean and smooth. It also does not have a flowery smell which I am very thankful for. I do not like harsh scents attacking my nose, and with this soap it was happy to breathe aroma-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is 13 and at the age when acne begins to be a problem for many teens. She also used the Adovia soap and thought it did help clear up her face. It seems to be a dense bar of soap because even with the two of us using it, there is still plenty to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this is a natural product, full of nutrients from the Dead Sea that can absorb into my body. We lose so many nutrients on a daily basis, and this is another way to try and put some of those back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I received this for testing and to reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with this twice a day. The soap is not drying as other soaps are and that would have to be because of the minerals in the soap. It is not harsh at all on the skin. My face felt clean and not dry at all after use. I toned and moisturized but it is surely not needed as much as I used to have to do with my other facial products. I would surely continue this. I also have their face mask and it has been a great combination addition to my regimen</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this soap ..it has been great for my dry skin and would definitely recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> This dead sea mud soap was not what I&#x27;m used to, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it out. It has helped my eczema tremendously and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has skin problems, or is simply looking for an all natural product to use.</li>
            <li> Just try it,  you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my uncle who has psoriasis. He has tried it twice and said it made his skin uncomfortably dry and he was very itchy. Itchy is the one thing you want to avoid when you have psoriasis. I will not be buying another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this soap is working or not. I know it isn&#x27;t doing anything better (or more) than raw shea butter. I bought this for my husband. He uses it, but he also uses organic shea butter for his skin. We can NOT see any difference when using this soap. However the shea butter softens his skin and slowly gets rid of the spots and soars. I don&#x27;t want him to stop using the other product to see if this is helping at all.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this soap, it is light and not overwhelming. It reminds me of going to the spa. Doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin. Just have to remember to rinse the shower well or it will leave black at the bottom. It does clean up well though.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 11. I&#x27;m not sure why, maybe I&#x27;m just one of those lucky people who produce 10X the oil we need for our skin! Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried MANY products for acne, as you can imagine... and then I found this gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning, you should not use this soap everyday. I use it every other day in the shower to scrub my face. It leaves my face so soft and clean, and after a few months of use (you have to be persistent) I&#x27;ve noticed a definite reduction of my blackheads. It can be drying if you use it too often, so I switch off with a gentle soap-less cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the soap for about 2 years now, and I can proudly say that I&#x27;m a much less &amp;#34;pimply&amp;#34; person now. I used to have on average 10 of those little pimples on my face at a time, now it&#x27;s maybe 1 or 2 a month.</li>
            <li> Really like this soap, a lot. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> it is good for any skin type  i am older and my skin is not oily but not itchy dry...i like the soap and i think it is good for teens going through breakouts...</li>
            <li> Love this soap! This soap started clearing my skin less than 1 week. I have sensitive skin and extremely dry skin all over my body and face which is also oily. I have also been suffering from acne.I am on my second bar of this soap and now I have a lighter complexion, hardly any acne, very smooth and moisturize skin. This bad rash ii had on my neck for years and the, acne marks or blackheads are barely there now!</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised that, even though this product is all natural is made my whole body and especially my face break out even more!! I couldn&#x27;t use this product, very sad.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my daughter&#x27;s psoriasis.  Seems to reduce the red and itchy.  Plus, there aren&#x27;t many soaps out there you can use with psoriasis.  It also has no bad odor.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the heartwrenching review by poor-hermit-who-rarely-left-the-house//dropped-out-from-school//life-was-a-wreck-for-years//finally-found-happiness-via-this-little-bar-of-soap: K.Uyehara&#x27;s review.... I possibly might have thought twice about purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those \\&quot;miracle-drug-soap-cure-etc&#x27;s\\&quot; just don&#x27;t exist...&lt;br /&gt;...... or do they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, as we age, life tosses you crap.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, I&#x27;ve now &#x27;adult-onset eczema&#x27; on my poor little fingers. It&#x27;s painful, ugly, and costly. The so-called remedy cortisone cream thins your skin to the point that anything you touch leaves bruises. The tiny cracks &amp; slivers of papercut-like skin lesions are painful.... lotion doesn&#x27;t help and actually stings rather than helps - thus is painful when used. The 3-6 bandaged fingers daily are time-consuming, costly, and &#x27;oh-so-lovely&#x27; to look at. The only help I&#x27;ve found is generic Vit E cream (not lotion) applied constantly all day @ work in order to keep my hands moisturized (and for some reason is not painful like lotion). While the Vit E cream helps some, it is in no way a miracle. My bruised &amp; bandaged hands almost constantly look like a 94 year old&#x27;s. My biggest thrill in life is that 1-2 week period when &#x27;all has calmed down&#x27; and I&#x27;m bandage-less. My biggest fear is that (usually, at the worst opportune time) the outbreaks shall return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K. Uyehara talked me into trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;K. Uyehara gave me hope.&lt;br /&gt;K. Uyehara was right!&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF ROCKS my world!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It nourishes, it moisturizes, it kills bacteria, it quells the pain, and more importantly - quells my outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bar right there by the kitchen sink and use it after every dishwashing and also for no reason at all. I probably wash my hands with this stuff 12+ times a day!!&lt;br /&gt;This little bar is a MIRACLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Albeit, not a fix.... but miracle enough to give me much further times between outbreaks. And not only that... some outbreaks don&#x27;t require bandaging with cort cream and Aquaphor.... they sort of heal themselves. You&#x27;ll notice the benefits of this soap right away...your skin is NOT left feeling dried out -- it feels nourished and happy -- you won&#x27;t even need lotion afterwards. I&#x27;m 1 month into using this product and can&#x27;t even believe what this mud has done for me. It&#x27;s done so much, that I&#x27;m back for more!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t get to the Dead Sea, I&#x27;ve now brought the Dead Sea to me....&lt;br /&gt;...for this little bar of mud is the BEST mud I&#x27;ve ever experienced!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(and perhaps the only mud I&#x27;ve ever really enthusiastically enjoyed)&lt;br /&gt;This little bar of mud has spoken so loudly to me that I&#x27;ve gone over to saltworksusa and picked up a 5lb bag of course grain Dead Sea bath salt. Soaking my feet in that is &#x27;over the top&#x27; after a long day on my feet at work. And while the salt is fab.... this mud rates 10 stars above and beyond even it. Even a quick wash of my feet with this mud at the end of a day makes my feet feel 30 years younger and less used :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve told friends about it - they&#x27;ve bought it and they absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to family... they can&#x27;t thank me enough!&lt;br /&gt;  (who gives soap as a gift? I do now! ;)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now back for my 3 more bars!&lt;br /&gt;I shall NEVER be without my Adovia mud soap!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now in travel kits, work locker, and 2 locales @ home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you K. Uyehara!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Adovia!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Dead Sea!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;02/20/2011 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it appears that those of us who take time to share a great product with the rest of the world has a nasty implication otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;While always a fear prior to writing a positive product review here, it appears that positive reviews &#x27;bellow up&#x27; those corporate minds who sell these products and hence they decide to greedily increase their prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inless than 1.5 months, the cost of this little bar of soap has gone up almost threefold. It was $7.99, sadly it is now $19.99.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it is a misprint? Perhaps due to the Middle East uprising at the moment?&lt;br /&gt;I could only hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misprint or not.... I refuse to pay my hard-earned money to such greed. I&#x27;ve found another brand and am ordering 3 bars from them. And even with those 3 bars, I am still paying less than today&#x27;s one bar price from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the Jericho brand folks!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t rec&#x27;d it yet, but if it is as this soap was - what&#x27;s the difference in a name?&lt;br /&gt;I will update after receipt both here and @ Jericho&#x27;s page.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely refuse to pay $20 for a bar of soap. Funny how soap from the same origin can vary in price, even if due to the Middle East situation at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADOVIA//resellers ------- I sure hope you are listening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ***********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03/17/2011 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I am a busy gal... I&#x27;ve not much time for &#x27;review writing&#x27;, even moreso for &#x27;updates&#x27;... but here I am yet again.&lt;br /&gt;Brief, I&#x27;ll hope this time ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st off: It&#x27;s nice to see that the price came back down (again, hopefully just a misprint prior). But it is exceptionally sad to see how my fears have seemingly proven correct. Too many postive reviews and the price went up (sure, other factors involved, but we all know that&#x27;s not all to it). Twas $7.99 approx 1.5 months ago, tis now $9 something as I write this update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something &#x27;sick&#x27; has been going around @ work... caught it twice. This 2nd time, my poor little fingers seemed to respond to the &#x27;daily stress of enduring life while sick&#x27; more than ever before. PAINFUL sliver-like papercut-like wounds brought me almost to tears at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap IS STILL AND FOREVER SHALL BE MY GOOD FRIEND (I shall never be without it), but of recently, it has now brought only the smallest bit of relief and for a lesser amount of time. Soaking my hands in the &#x27;also-above-mentioned&#x27; salt prev purchased has also been of help --but again only a short-term relief (less than 1 hour). Neither helped as it has before but thIS mud HAS AND STILL OFFERS A CALMING RELIEF (albeit only temporarily during outbreaks). The night I bandaged 8 out of 10 fingers before bed..... I&#x27;d HAD ENOUGH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now offer this update only in the attempt to help others out there who are painfully living a life that 21st century medicine should have already helped us with otherwise......&lt;br /&gt;If I sound like you,&lt;br /&gt;if you are at your wit&#x27;s end,&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re holding back the tears over excruciating painful eczema moments as I have these last 2 weeks,&lt;br /&gt;if you don&#x27;t know what to do now and have finally relinquished yourself to spending half of your life&#x27;s savings in hypafix tape, gauze/telfa, and cortisone cream....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LISTEN ALL &amp; LISTEN NOW...&lt;br /&gt;... again ---no miracle, but...&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try:&lt;br /&gt;DERMAREST Eczema Medicated Lotion&lt;br /&gt;(you&#x27;ll find some of the best prices here on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, at some time they&#x27;ll raise the price because of the positive benefits of this product shared here on amazon.... but when utter pain becomes relief, who the heck cares when it can help the poor human who possibly can&#x27;t live without it!?!&lt;br /&gt;Nope, you&#x27;ll find no review written about it on amazon&#x27;s product page by me this time around.... but if you found this, then you&#x27;ll find that hopefully. I personally am keeping the secret safe this time around and allowing others to give it 5 stars elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above-mentioned product is A GIFT FROM GOD.&lt;br /&gt;The initial application was a slight and somewhat &#x27;sting&#x27;, but settled down almost immediately. The &#x27;sting&#x27; never returned and application #2 was less than 30 minutes following app #1.... anything to help the pain and THIS WAS HELPING THE PAIN! I had applied this stuff probably 4-5 times in less than 2 hours.... just hoping for (and needing) &#x27;actual&#x27;relief (no itching, just PAIN).&lt;br /&gt;The relief slowly came.... I just kept re-applying it as I deemed necessary.&lt;br /&gt;The first night however, I still applied my cort cream and bandages...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and then....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days in and I found incredible relief/healing.&lt;br /&gt;Three days in and I was off to work attempting no bandaged fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Four days in and the big red welt on my wrist (how&#x27;d it go from only fingers to wrist?!?!!) was dissipating.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has completely healed, I&#x27;ve still painful areas... but this outcome FAR OUTDOES any other I&#x27;ve found to date.&lt;br /&gt;YEP, I still bandage at night - but not to the same extent as before.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps 2 fingers each hand (or less? depends obviously)... but I&#x27;m still a FAR HAPPIER INDIVIDUAL and less painful soul than I was less than 5 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now carry this stuff with me to work and then back home with me. I ignore the instructions and apply it as I SEE FIT. So far I haven&#x27;d died from &#x27;over-application&#x27;. The healing in just almost 4 days time is almost what I might call miraculous (albeit not, but still a &#x27;finger-saver&#x27;) (not to mention a bandaging $$ saver at this point also).&lt;br /&gt;The tears too, well, they&#x27;ve been saved for another time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back for 6 more bottles of this stuff.... for home, for work, for travel, for backup. I shall never be without BOTH my mud and THIS DERMAREST STUFF. Adovia Mud IS STILL EXCEPTIONALLY FAB, however not a longterm relief when an outbreak occurs. This DERMAREST Eczema -- egaaads, it&#x27;s beyond the bee&#x27;s knees!!! I&#x27;ve really no words for this stuff and am still thanking &#x27;that above&#x27; for it. In fact, I&#x27;m only back here at amazon to order a bulk 6-pack of the stuff --and only 4 days into using the stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just thought, that along the way --- I&#x27;d update my review here in order to include this info to other poor suffering fools like me and perhaps offer even the &#x27;painfully-almost-in-tears&#x27; folks out there a second hope. This little bottle has changed my life in just 4 days.... perhaps it can for you too? We are all one humanity. If I can benefit from this little bottle of lotion.... then so shall the rest of you perhaps --future cost increase aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, no promise, no guarantee to anyone out there... but when I compared the cost of the ER (with no real feasible relief offered in the long run) to perhaps another 2 weeks or so of trying whatever I could get my hands onto and hope for relief along the way (based only on reviews via the internet).... well, here I am, back again and babbling again, and hopefully offering a bit of hope otherwise to those of us &#x27;infected&#x27; with this nasty and ugly condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there, whatever! - take that you corporate suits!!!&lt;br /&gt;Raise the price! Go ahead... I dare ya!&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll all know why when you do!&lt;br /&gt;Yep... you&#x27;ve a product that is exceptional, it sells, and better yet -- sells only to a few special folk in need! Why not gouge our wallets, you&#x27;ll get richer and well... we&#x27;ll keep buying what we must ----but hey mr suit - can you spare a dime? I&#x27;ve a family to feed and not much to feed them with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the upside mr corporate suit --thank you!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve changed my day-to-day life.&lt;br /&gt;While not perfect, and I&#x27;ve still somewhat painful lesions... you&#x27;ve offered me hope and hopeful healing!&lt;br /&gt;That oughta be worth a-meal-a-week-or-so out of my paycheck eh?&lt;br /&gt;For that, I guess in this day &amp; age that I can&#x27;t really complain.&lt;br /&gt;Please though... all I ask, is that you remember &#x27;that I am not as rich as you&#x27; and never will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the healing properties may not last (they have so far with me; the lotion is medicated), this stuff DOES work, at least for me, and at least for today.&lt;br /&gt;I feel better, and the label ingredients have also talked me into taking Zinc daily (just in case that&#x27;ll help too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is St. Patty&#x27;s Day...&lt;br /&gt;I sip &amp; toast to all of us suffering with this dreaded condition who may have perhaps finally found a possible &#x27;help&#x27; to alleviate the pain accompanying our sorry state!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and green beer to all! :)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;pting no bandaged fingers.  Four days in and the big red welt on my wrist (how&#x27;d it go from only fingers to wrist?!?!!) was dissipating.  Nothing has completely healed, I&#x27;ve still painful areas... but this outcome FAR OUTDOES any other I&#x27;ve found to date.   YEP, I still bandage at night - but not to the same extent as before.   Perhaps 2 fingers each hand (or less? depends obviously)... but I&#x27;m still a FAR HAPPIER INDIVIDUAL and less painful soul than I was less than 5 days ago.    I now carry this stuff with me to work and then back home with me. I ignore the instructions and apply it as I SEE FIT. So far I haven&#x27;d died from &#x27;over-application&#x27;. The healing in just almost 4 days time is almost what I might call miraculous (albeit not, but still a &#x27;finger-saver&#x27;) (not to mention a bandaging $$ saver at this point also).   The tears too, well, they&#x27;ve been saved for another time.  I&#x27;m back for 6 more bottles of this stuff.... for home, for work, for travel, for backup. I shall never be without BOTH my mud and THIS DERMAREST STUFF. Adovia Mud IS STILL EXCEPTIONALLY FAB, however not a longterm relief when an outbreak occurs. This DERMAREST Eczema -- egaaads, it&#x27;s beyond the bee&#x27;s knees!!! I&#x27;ve really no words for this stuff and am still thanking &#x27;that above&#x27; for it. In fact, I&#x27;m only back here at amazon to order a bulk 6-pack of the stuff --and only 4 days into using the stuff!

While not perfect, and I&#x27;ve still somewhat painful lesions... you&#x27;ve offered me hope and hopeful healing!  That oughta be worth a-meal-a-week-or-so out of my paycheck eh?  For that, I guess in this day &amp; age that I can&#x27;t really complain.  Please though... all I ask, is that you remember &#x27;that I am not as rich as you&#x27; and never will be.      While the healing properties may not last (they have so far with me; the lotion is medicated), this stuff DOES work, at least for me, and at least for today.   I feel better, and the label ingredients have also talked me into taking Zinc daily (just in case that&#x27;ll help too)    Today is St. Patty&#x27;s Day...   I sip &amp; toast to all of us suffering with this dreaded condition who may have perhaps finally found a possible &#x27;help&#x27; to alleviate the pain accompanying our sorry state!

            <li> I read many of the reviews before deciding to try this item of people with problem skin and skin conditions who have experienced relief by using this soap. I get the occasional breakout which is frustrating as an adult and I am hoping this soap will help me as well. I like that it is unscented and lathers very well. It leaves my skin squeaky clean as I hate moisturizer soap that leaves me feeling greasy. I am not a national, but I also am a fan of supporting Israel and that is where this soap is made. I prefer soaps that do not have alot of multiple-syllable ingredients and would recommend this brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day. It was a great buy. It came quickly and works like a dream. My mother used to have very itchy skin and bad Eczema/Psoriasis on her body and face. It took about 2 weeks to see results in her skin but only took 1 use to feel them. She noticed a huge difference and was very pleased. She said her skin stopped itching and her skin felt velvety smooth. She would recommend using a good moisturizer if you have dry skin though, as it can be drying to the skin. I would recommend this to anyone seeing as it has helped my mother so much.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail maybe 2 weeks ago &amp; I have already seen a huge change in my skin. I have olive toned skin which is combination/oily &amp; have issues with breakouts in random spots. This soap goes on with very little lather (i even go over my mouth with it) and it leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth and takes away all unnecessary oils. My friend uses a much more expensive soap &amp; has seen similar results, but for the money this is the best deal around. Same results for maybe 1/3 of the price, not to mention you get SO much more than the other supposed \\&quot;WONDER\\&quot; brand... just sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have seb derm (male 27) and i have to be really careful with what goes on my face. its so sensitive. This irritated my face and made it red. Its not the soaps fault its a good soap just doesnt work with my face like ALOT of products. My wife uses it on her feet they&#x27;re super soft lol.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for one of my sons. He really loved it and said that it works. A great buy.</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason I&#x27;ve developed Eczema at the ripe old age of 64.  I&#x27;ve gone to the doctor, had numerous prescriptions and nothing helped. For those who never experienced this ailment it varies from from intense itching, pain and infections from scratching, etc.  Plus never knowing where it will crop up from my ears, scalp, stomach, etc.  I came across this soap on Amazon and I felt desperate so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try never expecting it to work. I&#x27;m on my second bar and it has made such a difference in my life.  Although it&#x27;s no cure-all it has done so much to relieve the symptoms. I&#x27;ve recently discovered Cortizone for Eczema so now I use both. The Eczema still comes back but I&#x27;ve found if I use the Cortizone at the first sign I don&#x27;t have the itching or pain and it goes away much quicker. I&#x27;m so afraid that they&#x27;ll quit making the soap I&#x27;ve stocked up enough to last me for the next 20 years.  Oh, yes and added bonus it makes my skin feel silky smooth.  It&#x27;s well worth a try and you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose but a few dollars if it doesn&#x27;t. But for me it&#x27;s been a miracle.</li>
            <li> I love Thia dead sea. Soap I used it with another product I bought on here I combine dead sea soap with 10%benzyl peroxide and vitamin c serum those three work together so well helps me clear my face I love this soap its like an exfoliater for your face and dusnt dry out your skin and I waiting for my second bar to come in.</li>
            <li> I feel a little misled on the size of this product. Maybe a little smaller than the size of a credit card...but seems good so far. Washes away clean! If it helps clear my skin it&#x27;s worth the 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for sensitive skin. Thank you!</li>
            <li> smooth transaction, good product</li>
            <li> I occasionally have acne problem, but it seems I have them much less when I am using this soap. It really makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> feeling a little change or not.....</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin incredibly smooth and soft. No drying.  If it&#x27;s good enough for Cleopatra it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that I can use.  I use it on my entire body.  If I try to use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; soap my pores get clogged and then bumps and acne reappear.  I never realized the full extent as to which my pores where clogged.  With use over about a three month period I could literally see the junk come out.  I use this in combination with Andovia Intensive Anti-wrinkle cream and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle but a nice soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two day of using this fabulous product! I have acne outbreaks a lot, blackheads white heads cystic you name it and this soap has dried up most of it with 2 days I will come back to tell you how my skin is within 2 weeks! So far so good!! In love and I don&#x27;t care how much they raise the price on this product ! If it works I&#x27;ll pay any amount ... I&#x27;m sure most of you spent the 50$ for proactive... Lol yea didn&#x27;t work out so well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this expecting it to fix all your skin problems. I tried it out and it dried my skin horribly. Didn&#x27;t help my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month now, twice to three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;I have a little rosacea on my nose, it hasn&#x27;t helped with that, but, it isn&#x27;t advertised to help with that, so.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my psoriasis, but it does feel nice, and leaves a good clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Can tell it&#x27;s a good soap, will probably buy it again.  Just don&#x27;t have hopes of it really clearing up any skin problems.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I use it every night on my face. One bar has literally lasted me a year!</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis for many years. This mud soap left my skin feeling refreshed and soft. I will continue to use it. Loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I have a mild form of psoriasis and after 2 or 3 weeks of using this soap, it has almost cleared up and is not as nearly bothersome as what it once was.  I came across Adovia through a Groupon purchase and thought since the price was reasonable I would give it a try.  I think I paid $15.00 for 3 bars of soap.  It worked better than the prescription lotion that I had been prescribed by my doctor, and I have not touched the prescription since.  I can&#x27;t say that it is the cure for all psoriasis problems.  I&#x27;m sure those suffering from extreme psoriasis have tried everything.  I can say that for what I have experienced it works and helped to diminish my symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con is the price.  I hope Groupon offers this item again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with problem skin. I ordered this soap based on Cleopatra&#x27;s choice and Amazon reviews. I&#x27;ve been using for 1 week and my skin has greatly improved in texture, clarity, and tone. I&#x27;m 34 with adult acne, uneven tone, and dark spots. I have tried tons of products (prescription and over counter) and nothing has shown the results this awesome soap has done. I&#x27;m so glad I finally have the answer to my 15 year search for great skin care. Can&#x27;t wait to get the rest of the adovia line of products. Thank you adovia!!!!</li>
            <li> Dry and not work. Do waste your money and it is not a cheap staff, i promise it is the last time i buy this soap.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it. It doesnt do anything different...waste of money seriouslt:-( please dont waste ur money ont hg e foolishness</li>
            <li> Nothing works better than mud soap bars for treating acne. Forget the honey, or the clearcare junk. I use this on my face every other day, the bar will last for more than a year. No strong scent so it is easy on sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t think the soap brands really matter, but this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> For acne ?????not make scene on me .I used it everyday but my back rash still the same .what a shame</li>
            <li> See previous reviews.  This is a wonderful product.  Clears without drying my skin.  I recommend for all age groups.</li>
            <li> My brother uses this to help with the psoriasis he has on his arms, legs, stomach. This is working really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift to my friend and i&#x27;m rating this product at her will since she doesn&#x27;t speak English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I have minor acne at both sides of my face. At first I used it before going to bed, and when I woke up in the morning, I was surprised to discover that most of the little red pimples had dried up. Now I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 3 weeks, and the acne on my face has completely gone. It&#x27;s a good product overall. ALSO, I&#x27;m very happy with how slowly this soap goes away under daily usage.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess i&#x27;m gonna buy one for myself....</li>
            <li> If you can get this soap for a good price I would jump on it. It is a great soap, I just can&#x27;t justify spending that kind of money on something that is used up so quickly. My skin seems to do well with just plain Dove and I have sensitive skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Minerals with certain atomic structures latch onto oils and carry them off the surface of skin, while minerals with other atomic structures penetrate skin and hunt for oils and other atoms with free electrons to complete their outer valences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that&#x27;s what I thought I knew when I bought this little miracle bar.  Now I don&#x27;t care to be vain about what I thought I knew.  The fact is, this soap is doing for me the exact thing I bought it for - drawing whiteheads out of my skin and clearing them before they turn into disgusting acne cysts.  I don&#x27;t really care if that proves my scientific analysis or not.  I&#x27;m just very glad the soap works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing to my skin. After giving the product a try for a few month, I don&#x27;t notice any positive effects from habitual usage this it what-so-ever. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff its great&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin feeling so soft after first use you wont regret buying it&lt;br /&gt;Definately will purchase again...</li>
            <li> Too expensive $11 for one bar which last only a month. I&#x27;m using Dudu Osun instead. Gentle on sensitive skin. Mud treatment is a luxury.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who had psoriasis, but we haven&#x27;t spoke about it&#x27;s efficiency much.  I know it helps his skin, but it&#x27;s kind of expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> it was ok i did not try it again becasue it did not work for me dead sea salt soaks are much more affective</li>
            <li> Good soap and worked!</li>
            <li> great product, great price, fast ship.</li>
            <li> This soap is a life saver! I was hesitant to buy anything other than Ahava brand products because I have relied on them for decades, but we desperately needed the mud for my child&#x27;s Eczema, and the competitors&#x27; was not available, so we gave this a try, and we are glad we did! My child has a mild case, and this soap clears the Eczema in two (maybe three) treatments.</li>
            <li> it feels great for my psoriasis but is tiny and dissolves quickly in standing water.</li>
            <li> This soap is great! I have very dry mixed skin and I suffer from eczema and severe razor burn every time I shave or veet. About five days after I started using this soap my eczema had somewhat improved which works for me since really its inflammatory and you can only do so much, but my razor burn is gone, done, over with! I will continue to purchase this product and will be looking for it in bulk.</li>
            <li> this product is very good for those with eczema and psoriasis problems and this product is ideal for daily bath, leaving your skin feel clean and hydrated as it is infused with essential minerals.  I recommend it for daily use.</li>
            <li> I floated in the Dead Sea in Israel back in 2004 on a Birthright Israel trip and it was one of the best experiences of my life. We covered ourselves in mud and the salt content was so intense that it made me notice every tiny cut or blemish on my skin. It burned, but then miraculously, everything healed ... even an infected hangnail was all better same day. I had oily skin at the time, and it properly dried out my acne. Since then, I have wanted to try just about every dead sea mud product I can find. If it isn&#x27;t made in Israel, skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Adovia soap is made in Israel. It smells a bit citrusy, which is light and pleasant, and it does not leave a lasting scent on your skin, which I view as a positive. Just as my experience at the sea, this soap dried out my skin a bit, which would be perfect for those with oily skin... but I am older now and my skin is dry. The minerals in the mud will help anyone&#x27;s skin, but if you have dry skin, I recommend using a moisturizer to go along with this soap. Overall, it&#x27;s pleasant, and I can recommend trying it, especially if you have oily skin/acne on your body (I never use bar soap on my face.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I had horrible psoriasis all over my face and a lot on parts of my body. I had been buying the black soup dudu osun and using it on my face with Shea butter as a moisturizer and it was working nicely to help reduce redness and flakiness. I saw this soap and read the reviews and thought I would give it a shot thinking maybe it might work better then the other soap. NOPE! It didn&#x27;t do anything for me or my psoriasis. I just wanted to leave a review letting anyone who might be thinking about buying it for that reason. It didn&#x27;t work for me, not saying it wont for you, just not me. I used it to wash my face with once to twice a day for a month (so it has a good thorough test) and no worky..</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she was very satisfied with it. I would recommend that others buy it.</li>
            <li> first time trying this soap and after i use it a few times i felt the different on the sking</li>
            <li> Great facial soap for daily use but can be a little drying need a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as I had hoped for my face and all the irritations and whiteheads that have arisen since turning 40.  Still using it as a body soap and feeling as dry as ever.</li>
            <li> just not sure what its benefits were. it definitely didnt help soothe or hydrate the skin. i think it left an awful film too.</li>
            <li> Excellent love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Best soap for psoriasis ever made!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great for eczema and acne. I will purchase this product again in the near future. I love it !</li>
            <li> I remember buying this soap for 4 dollars. I bought one and liked it and then ordered 50 bars for 4 dollars each. I ran out of them and currently came on to buy another batch but woah! 10.99 for a bar of soap? It&#x27;s mud and salt....not gold! I did some research and it turns out the seller has changed the price of this soap so many times. It is a shame. I have mild acne and this soap has helped but there are others soaps with exactly the same ingredients for FAR less. Those of you contemplating buying this - It is definitely not worth the 10.99. It only lasts about 2 weeks. You can find similar soaps, with the same ingredients, that work just the same for a lot less (One with Nature and Sea of Spa brand.) which are also sold here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This soap really helps.  I am very please</li>
            <li> feel not much, but so far so good, used only two times.........8 more words required??? what the hell, are u kidding</li>
            <li> read some reviews that the soap doesn&#x27;t lather well, but I had no issues with that.  I&#x27;ve only used this bar of soap since I received it, unfortunately i don&#x27;t notice anything different about my skin.  For the price, i think i&#x27;ll find something else.</li>
            <li> This is the last time I buy a $10 bar of soap. There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute and I was a sucker for thinking this stuff would actually help me. I have a mild-moderate skin irritation and they claim that this soap would help it, right there in the title. It did not. I did not notice any improvement. My dermatologist recommended that I buy Dove brand, UNSCENTED. I went to a wholesale store and bought a 14 pack for a few dollars more than I paid for this single bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate in my search for something to help with the symptoms and I felt like this company preys on people like me who are seeking any plausible solution to incurable skin aliments. Save your money and buy the unscented Dove.</li>
            <li> I let my brother and friends try this soap and they all hated it, since it makes your skin very dry. I tried it on my face too and my face is red the whole day. Please stay away from this soap it will damage your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soap but doesn&#x27;t do much for psoriasis</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews about this product for people with atopic eczema, I decided to try it. To my dismay, I was absolutely disappointed. It did absolutely nothing for me - as a matter of fact, it made my skin dry whenever I bathed with it and after that, nothing. I think that it even made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I have been having breakouts and am looking for all sorts of remedies for it (I think hormone is the real issue though). I got this soap because of all the great reviews. Well it doesn&#x27;t do magic and neither did I expect it to but it&#x27;s a very good soap. Every time after I use it my face feels clean and still moist. Soaps usually just dries up your skin but this one doesn&#x27;t. It helps a little bit with my acne but it didn&#x27;t do wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the soap is pretty rough and sandy. I will wet a facial mitten first and rub on the soap and use the mitten to clean my face so it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap cleans everything off of your face! It works amazingly well for acne! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT AND WORKS PERFECT ON DRAY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this soap&#x27;s powers was worthy of letting others know. It really does work brilliantly making your face feel so clean afterwards. Not too dry either, just clean. If you have an oily face, this will help it even in the long run. I&#x27;ve seen less acne since I&#x27;ve been using it and I think my face is looking brighter. Only negative I can think of is that it smells like mud but then again it is made from mud from the dead sea.</li>
            <li> I like it this kind of soap. It make my skin feeling good. Try it you will not loss your money :)</li>
            <li> This soap is great for people who have oily/combo and blemished proned skin. I think if you have dry skin this would be too drying. I use this from time to time along with their mud mask. I wish there was a way for this to be in a cleanser form, because I find bar soaps to be a little messy and possibly unhygienic. Besides that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful, helped with itching and started to relive rash within a couple of days, I use it daily and rash is almost gone. Thank you</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect from the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap. I am very happy with it. I normally do not use bar soap since I personally do not like the \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean feeling of it. I prefer for my skin to be soft and moisturized after washing. This however feels just as soft as the dead sea mud mask upon application, it feels creamy with just enough abrasiveness while using to clean my body. I feel it does really great especially under the arms and on ly elbows and heels. My face well... it takes my makeup off quite well too. It does not irritate my skin in any way. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> In our household we have varying skin issues - extremely dry skin, psoriasis, eczema AND acne! I am usually purchasing multiple soaps for each person and their specific issue or having to change frequently. We&#x27;ve all been using this soap for the past few weeks and we&#x27;re all pleasantly pleased! It is virtually odorless and leaves you feeling clean.  After reading previous reviews, we found it is best to lather up really well and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing off. Very pleased overall!</li>
            <li> In keeping with the spirit of rejuvenation this week I decided to do a review of a new kind of soap. I am branching out in my blog and have decided that since this stay at home mom is not very good at crafts or gardening I am going to give you some beauty and fashion tips for moms. Hopefully you like this idea.&lt;br /&gt;  So I have been signing up and getting many new samples of fashion things and beauty items lately. We have had fun testing them and it is something that I have always had an interest in. I have very dry, sensitive skin, yet I also have mild acne which is a horrible combination to try to find the right product for. I have a few favorites but nothing that I am not willing to swap for something that works even better so I am always open to new options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With Summer just around the corner I wanted to make sure my skin is in good shape. I do not tan, nor do I spray tan. I am proud to show my fair skin and quite frankly I have no idea why people feel the need to tan. Therefore, my fair skin still needs to look hydrated and cared for better than I usually get to do. So I was searching for a soap to help with moisture and to really rid the skin of  dead cells. I decided to try the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap  it has received many good reviews on Amazon and it is said to be great for Eczema, Psoriasis and acne. On it&#x27;s website it claims to remove dirt and cleanse your skin, while simultaneously infusing it with minerals essential to keeping your skin hydrated and moisturized.  It is enriched with century old Dead Sea Mud leaving your skin cleansed and nourished. It contains a unique combination of Dead Sea minerals derived from Dead Sea Mud 100% All Natural Moisturizing soap.&lt;br /&gt;  After using the soap for a little over two weeks now I have to say that I am very disappointed in it. It does seem to relieve some dead skin, but to be honest it irritated my sensitive, dry skin. It makes me much more irritated and itchy and unless I bathe myself in lotion after using this soap it really is not worth it. The soap was so bad I could not even use it on my face without it being red.&lt;br /&gt;  I thought my reaction to this soap was perhaps just because of my skin so I had my husband try and use the soap as well. He has oily to normal skin. He said he did not mind it but did not notice any difference in it. He did appreciate that it did NOT have a fragrance so for once he was not bathed in something too flowery, but he did not notice a difference in his skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Quite frankly for the $11.00 they charge you for this soap is extremely expensive considering all the better soap options you can get for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap 1 Star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t give up hope on rejuvenation though, just go back out to the store and try a different soap to help detox and cleanse yourself so you can fully rejuvenate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to check out Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap for yourself you can buy it&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon here for $11.00 (for a 4.4oz bar) and right now they are offering free shipping!lotion after using this soap it really is not worth it.

            <li> I purchased this product for my son for his severe case of acne.  I must say we have tried everything and this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is nice but not as effective for me as the Jericho brand also sold on Amazon.  The Jericho brand has an exfoliant in it that makes all the difference.  However, the Adovia bar does last longer.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been trying out the Dead Sea Mud Mask and she is also using the Soap. She has a little trouble with small patches of eczema on her face so we are always looking for something that will work for her.&lt;br /&gt;After using the mask and the soap her patches seem to be clearing up so she is pretty happy about that! We will also be trying out the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo that we just received so a review will follow on that too!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has excema and says it helps but it&#x27;s defiantly not a cure other then that we both agree that using this mud soap our skin feels really good better the other named brand stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only three weeks since I started using this product, but I would say it&#x27;s a good complement to your skin care products.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural soap with no artificial color or fragrance. I also have some dry patches on my ear in addition to somewhat oily skin. The clay or natural silt, is supposed to bind to the oils and clean the skin. I wondered if an all-natural bar of soap would work and if I would really notice a difference. After 20 uses I definitely like this soap. My skin feels clean with no residue. After gentle washing the oily skin is smooth and a little tingly. I though this was odd due to the natural composition. It might be the salt. In any case the soap does not irritate my skin, smells nice, and rinses away easily. I like the way my skin feels..smoother and cleaner.That is the only way to describe it. I have switched back and forth between the regular bar soap and the Adova.. I can tell that there is a difference. I don&#x27;t like to scrutinize a product just to find a negligible difference and justify the purchase...but I know this soap has made an improvement in my skin. I will buy this soap again.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me.  I did not purchase it from Amazon, I had received a Groupon deal for 3 bars for 18, if I knew what a steal that was I would of ordered more!!!  I&#x27;m using it as a facial cleanser for helping get rid of blackheads and evening my somewhat oily skin out.  For my purposes, it&#x27;s been great.  I used to get little non irritated pimples on my forehead, I would feel them but they would not be obvious to others... I&#x27;m rubbing my forhead right now and they are completely almost gone.. my skin looks better, I feel like I&#x27;ve dropped a few years already!  To the people complaining it dries your skin out.. stop reviewing it one star.  It clearly states part of the purpose is to get rid of the oils.  That&#x27;s common sense.  Combine this with a good facial moisturizer, and you are golden.  If you suffer pimples and blackheads make so you get a non-pore clogging facial moisturizer, your face will feel like new.  I used it this morning before going into work with no facial moisturizer and my face just feels great.  Not dry, not oily.. just, great.</li>
            <li> Top soap choice.  Does not dry out skin and is pH balanced so it doesn&#x27;t mess up protective outer layer and irritate skin.  Have had nightmare reactions from expensive green clay products that also contained harmful chemicals.  Glad I was able to get past that and still try this product.  Not disappointed this time. TerraBathe minerals is #1 choice for itching and clear skin.</li>
            <li> it is just smelly soap nothing special do not buy it was not worth it so lame i dont like it at all useless</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  Cleans and Sooths my face especially during this long dreadful winter!&lt;br /&gt; Now my husband uses it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local health store in California. This caused me intense, unbearable itching. Unfortunately, the store wouldn&#x27;t accept a used bar of soap for a refund.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help out at all I think it made my face get worse</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> I use it every night. very good product. give me a clean feeling. just one thing, wish it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve have a problem with acne since middle school. I&#x27;m 21 and I&#x27;m really sick and tired of products that don&#x27;t help or dry my skin out like crazy. This one didn&#x27;t help AT ALL. It dried out my skin, and for $10, I am not a happy user!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that using an actual bar of soap on your face could help. I thought it would leave residue behind and worsen the acne. I&#x27;ve had this soap for a month and a half now and my acne is almost completely gone! It also took away the scars from acne. Unlike a lot of acne medicines and cleansers, this actually doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It&#x27;s a decent sized bar. It does hurt a bit if you get it in your eyes, but just put a warm washcloth over them and it should be good. I am absolutely happy with my purchase and I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; my acne, and unlike other reviews, it just didn&#x27;t work for me :/ I used this, and only this, for over a week straight and it only made my acne worse and my skin significantly more oily, and when I tried mixing it with my other skin care products, it didn&#x27;t affect anything and didn&#x27;t improve anything; face OR body. I guess this just wasn&#x27;t for me! I was hoping it&#x27;d work since other dead sea mud items have helped at least some, but this didn&#x27;t do anything. :(</li>
            <li> I received Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap a couple of weeks ago and have been showering with it everyday since. According to the box this soap is for all skin types. However, it does advertise to be very helpful to people with psoriasis, eczema, and acne. My husband has been known to call my skin, miracle skin or perfect so I can unfortunately (or fortunately?) not tell you the results in change against any of these three skin problems. I can however still give you my point of view from a &amp;#34;normal skinned&amp;#34; girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar can be used with a loofah (like I do) or it lathers up well on it&#x27;s own also. I just prefer the loofah on a daily basis because I am a creature of habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about scent. It does not smell like mud! ;) I was actually very concerned that the soap would when I applied to review it, however, I can safely say that it merely has a fresh soap smell. I have read other reviews where some smelled like lemons from lemongrass, but I&#x27;m assuming they received a different bar than myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant. My skin was left feeling clean, moisturized but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I continue to use this product? Yes! I love that it has lasted me so long as opposed to my liquid soaps. I also love the fresh clean feeling I have after showering with this product. It feels great especially after a sweaty workout or run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a fan of the ingredients. This product is not packed full of crazy ingredients and chemicals. It is all natural! It is really good to know what I am putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that we have found for psoriasis on my hubby. He has it on his elbows and knees and a few spots in between. We have tried lots of psoriasis meds before. Topical and ingested. This Dead Sea Mud Soap did the best job! I had been told before about the healing properties of products from the Dead Sea. I am sold! I recommend for psoriasis and other skin issues. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either!</li>
            <li> I saw soaps like this on sale at a spa in Jordan. (Float in the Dead Sea, walk out crunchy and crusty as Lot&#x27;s wife, and then wash off with a black soap that makes dark gray foam...such are the broadening experiences of travel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the soap neat enough to be one of those things I might bring back as a gift. But I have made some bad calls before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that saffron from Avila and vinegar from Portugal are cheaper and certainly easier to buy here.  The beagles sniffing at Customs don&#x27;t go nuts.  And you are not going to dislocate your shoulder lugging a couple of several kilos of glass bottles of salad dressing around an airport (This is no longer possible given TSA regs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if dry skin is an issue for you, this soap works remarkably well.  The bar gives daylong relief from itching.  To be clear, up front, candid, and personal, this means I am not rubbing or scratching like a chimp with no one around to help groom me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally while not cheap, it lasts for an impressively long time--which makes it a surprisingly good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers offer additional details praising this soap that might address more specific concerns for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From me,  buy it.</li>
            <li> It is better than the PD cleaser I paid 24 dollar or more. No artificial acent and poweful cleanability, good&#x60;</li>
            <li> Have shared with my granddaughter. She also has expressed surprise at the difference in her complexion in a short period.</li>
            <li> The product I like but the first time I bought it it was no more than $10 and now when I went to buy it again it&#x27;s almost $20.  Something is not right with that.</li>
            <li> This is my second Adovia Products that I have been using for two weeks.Yes! it&#x27;s a Bar Soap that&#x27;s great for my Acne skin! Let me tell you first , that  I usually don&#x27;t use bar soap for my body/face.I always prefer face wash kinda stuff for my face &amp; body wash/shower gel for the whole body. So far I have tried Dove bar soap  and recently fall in love with this amazing little soap bar from Adovia!! It is not a fancy bar but it&#x27;s magically works great for my skin which is why I love it.As you can see, it&#x27;s a dead-sea mud soap which is great for any skin type.This soap bar is mainly great for acne,  psoriasis, eczema symptoms.I don&#x27;t have acne on my face that much but I do have bacne[ acne on the back] and sometimes it&#x27;s so itchy that I wanna die!! This little black soap actually removes/cleanse those nasty  bacne and reduce the itchiness!! I am really impressed!! I have dry skin,so i wasn&#x27;t sure at first that how it&#x27;s react on my skin. I was happy to see that it&#x27;s not only hydrates my skin but also moisturized!! My husband have lots of acne issues! So it was plus point to test this soap on him! He has also oily skin, so he used it and loved it! This one bar soap is quite costly;so we only use it on the effective areas.I highly recommend this soap to anyone! I am definitely gonna repurchase it for my hubby !!&lt;br /&gt;got this for free to review.</li>
            <li> I originally bought mud soap on a visit to Israel years ago and loved it so much that I now only use mud soap. Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud soap is a great product that I use on my face and body. It does not dry out my skin or irritate it at all, but instead leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how this unusual soap makes my skin feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;I am not getting any younger and I have noticed changes in the look and feel of my skin. Drier and fine lines are my biggest complaint, I have used this soap for about a week and I like how my shin feels. Clean and refreshed. The dullness seems to have been replaced with a soft glow. The fine lines are still present (I didn&#x27;t really think they would go away),&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this product. You will be too!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a promotional price in return for my review</li>
            <li> When I first saw the soap, I actually loved the color of the soap. I loved the concept of using Dead Sea mud as soap because I have read about how the Dead Sea mud is very healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a light fragrance which I was happy about because some soaps are so overpowering with perfume. I decided to use the soap while I took a shower. I used the soap on my entire body. When I was done showering, I instantly could tell how my skin was different. My skin was softer and felt so smooth. And I loved how the soap didn&#x27;t leave any grim or film on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I battle with dry and cracked skin and this soap helped soften those spots. I have used this soap for several weeks, and I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions. My skin feels healthier and looks more vibrant. I&#x27;m totally in love with this soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I have always been acne prone. I am now in my early twenties and irritated to see that I still get seasonal and hormonal breakouts! I have tried almost everything including prescription medication/face washes. I was excited to give a mud based soap a try because I had heard great results that it gives. After about a week of using this soap I was amazed to see that my skin looked clearer. The soap did not irritate or dry my skin out. My skin looked healthier and clearer than I have ever seen it. I never knew I could get results like this from a bar of soap! Sometimes simpler is better and in this case it definitely is!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for a while... a very long while. Iv&#x27;e tried proactive, clean &amp; clear, all that bs. I even tried home remedies (my little sister hooked me up lol). So after trying all these products and stuff it did show some improvements by clearing up what was already there, then a few weeks later BAM! Back at it again with a face spotted with redness and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the type of guy that HATES to keep putting on all these creams and taking care of my skin as if I were Americas next top model, so I did some research and found this; read reviews and felt convinced so I ordered it for myself. As soon as it came I&#x27;ve already had 2-4 pimples on my face. So that night I showered and slapped my face with the soap like it owed me money, I scrubbed for a good while and left it there till I was ready to get out the shower. I cleaned it off and did noticed that the pimples that were growing to be big mighty adults seemed to kind of dried up... a little though, not too much. I felt my skin and it was left very smooth, and I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;So three days have passed and the couple of pimples that were on my face since the product came are completely gone (after using the product for the three nights straight). There is very little marks of where the pimples used to be and currently I don&#x27;t see any of them growing. I don&#x27;t expect this product to work like black magic on my face, but I am pleased with the results after using all these other products for a long time. I work out a lot and my face is constantly sweating, plus I have long hair so that gets on my face too (this causes pimples, or so I&#x27;ve heard). Little by little I should expect for the product to continue to healing my face which has been suffering from acne for years and have battle scars with all the other products that I&#x27;ve used. So I guess until I&#x27;m done with the soap or till I feel like my face is similar to a babies butt cheeck, I will write another review on the product. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally decided it was time to revisit the review. Well... it&#x27;s honestly nothing special, but still pretty good. I have used a little over 25% of the soap already and my skin looks average, as in NOT SO MANY OR NOT SO NOTICEABLE PIMPLES!!!! Before you get to excited, there are downsides. This is NOT the fountain of youth. The scars from previous pimples have not gone, but have faded. This product, in my own opinion and experience, is great for people with oily skin; use it in the morning and have not so dry skin during the resat of the day. This soap is not the answer for the cure of pimples, but damn does it keep it under control. Iv&#x27;e used this product everyday and it has reduced the amount and size of pimples I usually had before I bought the product. What it seems to do is clean very well inside the pores of your skin and deep clean those dirty mother- at the source. My problem is like I said, I&#x27;m constantly working out and my face is exposed outside with plenty of pollution in the air and large amounts of my sexy sweat dripping down on my beautiful face :(. To finish this horrible review, I have honestly written this review with the deepest truth and a large effort because I know first hand how annoying pimples can be, especially when you&#x27;re beautiful like me lol! All I can say is, buy this product as a VERY good face soap/cleanser thing and with hopes that it will reduce your pimple problems. However, you should try other products while using this one. I&#x27;m thinking into buying Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay (search on amazon) and/or Tepezcohuite (also look up). Hope this review helped you out, if you have any questions that have been unanswered, don&#x27;t be shy and feel free to comment on my post and I will try to help you out asap.on the product.

            <li> So far no eczema, psoriasis and acne.</li>
            <li> It really has not help my skin.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This has been helpful in calming down my psoriasis. This combined with vitamin D3 10,000IU cream has helped considerably! I love how its all natural and the way it makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap for my boyfriend because his eczema was progressively getting worse and he didn&#x27;t want to use any steroid creams. He took a bath with it the night he got it, and he can already feel relief. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> After 2 months of trying almost everything I could to alleviate the pain and appearance of psoriasis on the back of my neck , I stumbled across a blog that recommended this soap. I placed the order, and as soon as I received it, I used it! In 3 days, you could tell the difference. In a week and a half, it was completely gone! I did not take before and after pictures because I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work. I now use this on my face and it&#x27;s been the softest and purely cleansed it&#x27;s ever been !!</li>
            <li> I got this soap because I have oily skin and I have a lot of breakouts. With only using this for about 2 weeks, my skin has cleared up from acne, and the overall texture and radiance of my skin has improved. I LOVE this soap. I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it because my acne got worse.</li>
            <li> it seems pretty good......i brought this because i saw the reviews below...i really excited for the results! i hope it works....!this is my second days using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to update this review. This product irritated my skin so badly. Don&#x27;t buy it if you have very sensitive skin. It makes my skin even worst, my acne break out SO BADLY!!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! I was very skeptical about some of the other reviews....but it really works! I have a breakout here and there, but since I&#x27;ve been using this soap ZERO breakouts! It leaves my skin clean and very smooth! I also have very oily skin...not anymore! Love this soap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m up in arms about this product. The ingredients are natural and have healing and cleaning properties. After the first use my skin felt so clean and tight and somewhat lighter in complexion. Downside is that it pulls all the oil from my already oily face. I thought that&#x27;d be great, right? Nope. It makes my face produce even more oil to make up for what was lost. I still will keep this and use it as a weekly cleanser but everyday use isn&#x27;t for me. It&#x27;s too drying. Maybe using a natural oil afterwards would replenish my skin. (Oils like coconut or olive oil) I was using Shea butter at first but realized the brand I had wasn&#x27;t pure. I think leaving the cleanser on as a mask would help dry up pimples and whiteheads. I don&#x27;t want to give up just yet though.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh.  The best...such a clean feeling and it really soothes troubled skin.  This soap is forever on my list!  MW</li>
            <li> MY SKIN WAS SPLOTCHY AFTER USE.</li>
            <li> My son is using it because of his psoriasis and says it is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t burn his skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice so far, seems to really kill black heads and loosen dead skin, I like it already.. I have not used long enough yet to see full results but I surly like it so far!! I would honestly say I would recommend this as of so far it is working fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great soap. I use it mostly for my face and it gives a very clean feel without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> Its nice soap, but does not last long at all... Seriously softer than any soap I&#x27;ve seen, to the point where it&#x27;s noticably smaller after the first use, and for the price you kindof want it to last.  Also, I bought this specifically for the claimed &amp;#34;blackhead-clearing&amp;#34; properties its supposed to have, and the entire bar had no effect by the time I&#x27;d gone through it.  Overall, I&#x27;d say not really worth it...</li>
            <li> This broke my skin out incredibly bad. Back to just water and a scrub brush for me.  Try out the</li>
            <li> This soap is so amazing. I have sensitive skin and I break out easily. But this soap leaves my skin soft and glossy! Love it!</li>
            <li> Occasionally I develop a sort of itchy irritation where the band of my bra meets my torso. It can get very inflamed and uncomfortable. Now, whenever it appears, I wash with this stuff for a day or two and it clears it right up. It is definitely drying, but sometimes that&#x27;s just what you need. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> product is excellent. i give it 5 stars, is not drying like other soap, feels good on the skin</li>
            <li> My two year old granddaughter has Eczema and it broke my heart to see her scratching her skin until it bled.  Her pediatrician had prescribed an ointment that didn&#x27;t relieve her problem as much as I felt it should.... considering the expense.  The Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap is a great moisturizing soap as well as a healing aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  We use filtered Shea Butter after she bathes with the soap, and her skin has never been this beautiful.  Not only that, but her old scars are fading, which we weren&#x27;t expecting.  It&#x27;s just wonderful that we found a solution for her skin issues without having someone write a prescription..and then being disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It has certainly improved the quality of her life.  If anyone reading this review has a problem with Eczema, please consider this soap.  There is a place on the web called cleopatraschoice.com that sells this soap a little cheaper than Amazon.  It lathers nicely and I am so pleased with the results.  Try one bar to see how you like it.  It&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;miracle skin cure&amp;#34;, but dead sea mud is amazing for your skin, and I like that the soap has a clean, fresh smell. If you&#x27;re using it on your whole body, I would worry that it might not last long and is therefore a bit pricey, but if you&#x27;re using it primarily to clean your face, it&#x27;ll probably last a good long while.</li>
            <li> Decided to use this product for about a week and a half before writing this review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a history of bad bacne and wanted to find a product I could use in the shower to help me remove or at least reduce it all. Since this product was reasonably-priced and claimed to be good against bacne, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did very well to disappoint me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap with a wash cloth to ensure that I really got in there and opened up my pores to allow the soap to penetrate my skin. I also made sure to wait a minute or two before rinsing off. Did NOT make a dent in the bacne AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to conclude that this is simply an ordinary bar of soap that smells like mud.</li>
            <li> Works great.I am using this soap,along with cream to try and clear up a rash type thing on my arms.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this over the past month while DH tries another type of soap from this company (Adovia.) First, they are quick to respond to all questions and very kind which is a nice bonus (not all sellers are like this, especially in this product category!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a different and interesting scent - not overpowering or bad, just kind of interesting and new if you&#x27;ve never used non scented / natural produts before. It&#x27;s not going to be like your lavender, mango, vanilla soaps and it&#x27;s not meant to - this is a natural product that has all kinds of benefits, and with that comes the &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; scent. I&#x27;ve used many products that were terrible / unbearable and this is defintely not like that - unless you have it right up to your nose you may not even notice it.  The bar is not cracking after a month of use, and seems to be lasting a good amount of time even with 1-2 times a day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue I had was dry skin, and after about 6 days of use I noticed improvement with this. At 3 weeks it was a bigger improvement and I expect it will continue - even with skipping a day, my skin definitely has not gone back to as dry as it was beore I started.  I am not sure about the claim os helping some of the other isuses (excema etc) as I don&#x27;t have those, but I would imagine it can only improve / lessen any kind of skin issue along these lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priced well, especially if it lasts as long as it seems to be lasting. Something about using black soap is very cool too :)</li>
            <li> This soap bar is amazing. I usually have a really oily skin in the T zone and almost dry in the rest of my face. I use it once a day (at night before bed) and I dont wake up with this horrible greasy face in the morning and the effect lasts all day. Other great thing about the soup is after all this use, its seems to stay the same size! Its like a rock.</li>
