            <li>Best I have found for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very mild fragrance (if any).  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job of relieving dry skin.</li>
            <li>Came from Cali where I never had to use lotion at all to a super dry climate and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I called Curel about it, they didn&#x27;t tell me much but just sent free product coupons.</li>
            <li>So great on my very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The best part I like about these I ordered on Amazon is the size; not too big but not too little also.</li>
            <li>It works and is more convenient to carry then the bigger ones for when I go camping or hiking or on a trip.</li>
            <li>anything more can make hair flat).</li>
            <li>This one does the trick and the&lt;br /&gt;size of the smaller tubes makes it easy to take with us&lt;br /&gt;and for traveling</li>
            <li>it seems and the new products seem more runny but ultimately act the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The big bottles are too bulky and heavy when I fly.</li>
            <li>It really heals the skin even the elbow skin...</li>
            <li>You rub it in, and it really absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li>a bit dry, not as good as expected</li>
            <li>Also absorbs quickly which is a big plus.</li>

            <li>right after i bought a bigger one.</li>
            <li>Your fingers aren&#x27;t all greasy like some other brands, which is important to me, because I play guitar and use my telescope a lot, and those are things you don&#x27;t want to get all greasy.  </li>
            <li>It restores the company&#x27;s natural moisture.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>It is not as light as other lotions I have tried, but they probably don&#x27;t last as long as this lotion on your skin.</li>
            <li>The stores in my town only sell the real little purse-size or the bigger 13 or more oz bottles.</li>
            <li>Since I use it as a hand/body/hair lotion, the small ones run out too quick</li>

            <li> This is a thorough healing lotion. It is not greasy. It is not as light as other lotions I have tried, but they probably don&#x27;t last as long as this lotion on your skin. It has a light citrus scent which is pleasant. Some lotions sting, but this one doesn&#x27;t. I put it on my feet which tend to dry out in the winter. We have a wood-burning stove so put on lotion daily for my skin. It restores the company&#x27;s natural moisture. It won&#x27;t clog pores says the company. This seems to be a quality lotion which protects your skin.</li>
            <li> a bit dry, not as good as expected</li>
            <li> When my skin cracks when in dry climates or traveling-this is the go to repair. Works great and fast.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but you can get this item at K-Mart for $2.49 each. It arrived on time as stated when purchased.</li>
            <li> Love it! So great on my very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No issues, just what the doctor ordered. On time and on target. Would order again. I do not like writing reviews and will not do it again with this stupid minimum word count.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there.  Came from Cali where I never had to use lotion at all to a super dry climate and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I use Curel lotion exclusively. I use it on my hands after every wash, all over my body after showers, and even as a leave in hair detangler/conditioner/volumizer (only the smallest amount needed to detangle hair seems to add volume-anything more can make hair flat). Other lotions don&#x27;t moisturize me as well or as long, and no other lotion I have tried works in my hair like a small amount of Curel (hairdresser-of-the-stars mentioned it in Cosmo). The best part I like about these I ordered on Amazon is the size; not too big but not too little also. The stores in my town only sell the real little purse-size or the bigger 13 or more oz bottles. Since I use it as a hand/body/hair lotion, the small ones run out too quick so I have to pack several. The big bottles are too bulky and heavy when I fly. This size is perfect. I put one in my purse and one in my luggage. They take care of me for a week to 10 days.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps your skin moist during the dry weather in Illinois. It can last throughout the day without re-applying. I will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what i would do it without this lotion. I was kind of suspicious when i read all GOOD reviews so i bought the small one to try and right after i bought a bigger one. It really heals the skin even the elbow skin...</li>
            <li> Moisture but not greasy</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona you have to moisturize your entire body every day or suffer.  My hubby forgot that rule &amp; had split open fingers.  Ouch!  I&#x27;m a Curel lover, so I bought him this 3 pack...one for home, gym bag &amp; office.  Within 4 applications he was healing beautifully.  Now he&#x27;s a devoted user.</li>
            <li> This has been the very best lotion for us after trying out&lt;br /&gt;dozens and dozens.  This one does the trick and the&lt;br /&gt;size of the smaller tubes makes it easy to take with us&lt;br /&gt;and for traveling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for the pocket sized version of Curel - and finally found it here. Curel is incredible lotion for those that hate oily feel of other lotions. I&#x27;ve been buying Curel for the last 25 years because I like how it absorbs into my skin without leaving oily sheen!</li>
            <li> My favorite hand lotion in a handy size.  Very mild fragrance (if any).  You rub it in, and it really absorbs into your skin.  Your fingers aren&#x27;t all greasy like some other brands, which is important to me, because I play guitar and use my telescope a lot, and those are things you don&#x27;t want to get all greasy.  I usually buy the big bottles for around the house, but these little ones (wish they had one size smaller, too), will easily fit in my travel bag, and in my guitar case, so immediately spread them around so I have them when I need them.  I put the 3rd one in my center console of my car.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Best I have found for dry skin. And believe you me I have tried all the lotions. Also absorbs quickly which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> It works and is more convenient to carry then the bigger ones for when I go camping or hiking or on a trip.</li>
            <li> After just a few minutes of applying, this lotion is almost unnoticeable. I don&#x27;t get that greasy feeling, nor does it feel too watery like some lotions. It does a very good job of relieving dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.  I put it on once and it keeps my hands soft.  It almost feels like there is a protective barrier on my hands.  Through science labs I&#x27;m able to wash my hands numerous times without my hands feeling dry.  This lotion is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Great product, they changed their formula it seems and the new products seem more runny but ultimately act the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called Curel about it, they didn&#x27;t tell me much but just sent free product coupons.</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite.  We&#x27;re always on the look out for smaller size so she has one to carry in her purse.</li>
