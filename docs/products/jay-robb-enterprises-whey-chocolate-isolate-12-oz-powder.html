            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>There is another one made by a company called One World Whey that is supposed to be the best.</li>
            <li>This one works and tastes perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Jay Robb makes the best protein powders out there!</li>
            <li>No after taste and the chocolate is the best one out there.</li>
            <li>but to me, the taste is not the best.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>It had a very good taste, and also dissolved well into liquids.</li>
            <li>The chocolate whey protein powder has a great flavor, mixes well, and is perfect if you need a protein supplement or are doing any type of cleanse.</li>
            <li>Jay Robb&#x27;s Chocolate Whey Protein is the best mix of \\&quot;good for you\\&quot; and \\&quot;tastes good.\\&quot;</li>

            <li>Extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>Tastes great-</li>
            <li>Chocolate is my favorite, but vanilla is also really great!</li>
            <li>The strawberry is good as well.</li>
            <li>Shake it and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I will say that the protein shake tastes good but upon inspection one notices that the supposed protein from grass-fed cows is not from grass-fed cows after all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, there are good alternatives out there like Biochem, Resveratage, Jarrow,  Solgar, etc.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as sweet, but i have to say it taste best with milk or soy.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!! :)</li>
            <li>I have to say first of all I was relieved that I did not think this was the best tasting whey protein I had ever tasted.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand of protein shakes!</li>
            <li>Good product, good flavor, great taste and exactly what I was looking for in a protein powder.  </li>
            <li>I use 0 sugar almond milk with the JR Whey Protein which thickens it and gives it a kind of sweet/salty taste that I like.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, always using it in smoothies.  </li>
            <li>Also great tasting and easy to mix, which is really important if you&#x27;re taking this with you on the road or to the gym and don&#x27;t have a blender handy.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and tastes good (with fat-free milk).</li>
            <li>How awesome to finally find a healthy good-tasting protein powder!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but a bit too sweet.</li>
            <li>, but scoop is huge!  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many...</li>
            <li>and I also love it blended with a cup of frozen strawberries-</li>
            <li>I love the chocolate and the strawberry too.   </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love the flavor, doesn&#x27;t taste chalky.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every brand out there and consider my self well versed in most nutrition products.  </li>
            <li>There are so many ways to mix this up</li>
            <li>If they would make one with some fiber, this would be a 5+ star rating from me for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I liked that there wasn&#x27;t a huge list of ingredients either.</li>
            <li>I had better hopes for the chocolate flavor.</li>
            <li>on the company&#x27;s Website is more bull.  </li>
            <li>Again this is more lies from the company...</li>
            <li>There is also soy lecithin in this product which is a known allergen and better products avoid it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion you won&#x27;t find a better Whey protein supplement unless you want to spend twice the money.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from the product.</li>
            <li>This shake tasted great and gave you so much energy.  </li>
            <li>We use this for recipes from Trim Healthy Mama cookbook, specifically the Fat Stripping Frappa on page 240.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the vanilla flavor for this recipe.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tasting protein powder.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is no soy or RBHT in this protein powder.</li>
            <li>I go through this stuff pretty quick and wish it was a bit cheaper, but it&#x27;s really good quality and the flavor is good</li>
            <li>It really is great tasting, high in protein, fills you up,</li>
            <li>It is a super healthy and yummy way to get your protein!</li>
            <li>This is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This tastes pretty good, mixes well, but is kinda pricey.</li>
            <li>There is usually a rule that if they taste good then they aren&#x27;t very good for you.</li>
            <li>and you could make great soft serve ice cream,</li>
            <li>Easy to mix using shaker or hand mixer.</li>
            <li>(it dissolves easily with no noticeable side effects.)  </li>
            <li>The product is still excellent, but the pouch is less convenient.</li>
            <li>It mixes smoothly and easily, tastes amazing and contains absolutely no junk, just high quality whey protein -- and delicious chocolate.</li>
            <li>I bought this and shakeology and this is hands down WAY better!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get as much of the chocolate flavor as I would of liked, it&#x27;s lightly flavored.</li>
            <li>I think it was filled about 1/2 way.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried the chocolate Jay Roobb product but think I will happily return to a cheaper whey protein isolate drink to meet my requirements.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that my local GNC carried it.</li>
            <li>The flavor is fantastic, and doesn&#x27;t have the texture that some powders have</li>
            <li>but again the compnay is too cheap to cough up the bucks to use</li>
            <li>I also use a soy protein that is 30g of protein per scoop, and two scoops of that easily fit into the one Jay Robb scoop.  </li>
            <li>The stevie taste was to sweet and strong</li>
            <li>which is ok since i could store it easily without taking too much space.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I was excited to try out this protein powder.</li>
            <li>Love the chocolate flavor, my favorite so far</li>
            <li>all the reviews were right!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wayyyyyyyyyy too sweet for me</li>
            <li>Jay Robb Whey has no sugar and only 1 gram of carb, but you cannot tell because it tastes really good.</li>
            <li>I will admit that it doesn&#x27;t taste as good with only water and after mixing it with almond milk,</li>
            <li>This product has a good flavor and is very low calorie.</li>
            <li>I would venture to say that Chobani uses more milk in one day than Jay Robb uses in a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Organic Valley and Horizon have organic milk in virtually every supermarket throughout the US, but surprisingly Jay Robb cannot find enough supplies.  </li>
            <li>I find it sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s so sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when I blend it with cool coffee, ice cubes and a large pinch of instant espresso powder</li>
            <li>I liked Vanilla better because I can mix it with other stuff like fruit.</li>
            <li>I like the chocolate flavor very much, and am tickled it&#x27;s made with stevia, but it wasn&#x27;t keeping me full.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li>line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with almond milk and some Gaia Chia Fresh Fiber.</li>
            <li>You know, that kind of slimey taste that aspartame leaves on the back of the tongue.  </li>
            <li>I have also added it to plain no fat yogurt with fresh fruit and agave nectar, also with great results.</li>
            <li>The taste is good compared to other protein</li>
            <li>i love the taste and really help for my diet program, highly recommended to use this product when you taking your diet</li>
            <li>from Jay&#x27;s picture right on the bottle, it&#x27;s not too showy.  </li>
            <li>Bioplex Pure WPI is by far the better choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other whey proteins such as; BSN&#x27;s Syntha 6, Bioplex Pure WPI, Bodystrong, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard, Prolab and Bodytech all of which taste much better and are a better value.  </li>
            <li>I used my first container - it goes fast!  </li>
            <li>so try the product, if you haven&#x27;t bought Jay Robb&#x27;s products before, i suggest you start with the 12 oz first</li>
            <li>, it tells you how \\&quot;superior\\&quot; the product is, but it really isn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>they were only like 15 servings per container or something like that - i thought there would be more...</li>
            <li>I have tried several protein powders but Jay Robb is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>So I just had my first taste of the whey protein, with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the last time I purchased it had free shipping, now it looks like they are charging for shipping.  </li>
            <li>Avoiding sugar has worked really well</li>
            <li>The result is 25g of protein and only 1g of carbs that I actually enjoy drinking every morning.</li>
            <li>and it is really tasty.  </li>
            <li>They state that they cannot use organic because there are not enough supplies available.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t seem to have a contact number readily</li>
            <li>The price is a bit higher than most other powders I&#x27;ve found locally, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed.</li>
            <li>Finally, the product is shpped in the new tuna fish packaging, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s done this way to cut corners for the company so they could pay less in shipping than having a nice container which would be easier to open and close, and would be convenient for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure adding other things with it in the blender will be even yummier!</li>
            <li>Please use less stevia in this product and it would be better.</li>
            <li>Less is More.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that it is not super chocolatey but it is very enjoyable in a protein drink/shake.</li>
            <li>The package does not mention a thing about it, and if it was from grass-fed cows, rest assurred they would mention it just like a car mentions when it gets high gas</li>
            <li>know it is supposed to be made of high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the best tasting powder I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>if drank with only pure water, it has that funny after taste.</li>
            <li>that is what lead me to pay triple the price for what I normally would pay for my protein supplements.  </li>
            <li>My local GNC only has the bags (rather than the large containers on the site here) for about $18, which is cool this way it is cheaper for me to change up the flavors if I want to.     </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried it with just milk or water and it&#x27;s decent</li>
            <li>I found that NOW protein powder mixed a lot better and tastes less \\&quot;sweetened.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>For example, Bioplex Pure WPI is 91% protein (20g of protein in a 22g scoop) where Jay Robb delivers only 83% protein (25g of protein in a 30g scoop).  </li>
            <li>Bioplex Pure WPI costs about $49 for 5 POUNDS with no fat, no cholesterol, no carbs, no sugars and only 90 calories/scoop!  </li>
            <li>certainly there is enough organic milk out there</li>
            <li>The price for this powder is very comparable to what I have paid for others locally.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to aspartame.</li>
            <li>I have to admint I was surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li>Jay products have far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>all natural, naturally sweeten (stevia), etc</li>
            <li>My least favorite is the dreamsicle.</li>
            <li>, I make a smoothie after my body sculpting class with chocolate powder and a half a banana, but when I add banana to this it&#x27;s soooooo sweet.  </li>
            <li>Solid product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazingly, Chobani yogurt, which is in virtually every supermarket in the US, is able to get enough steroid-free milk for its yogurt but little Jay Robb cannot get enough for its company.  </li>
            <li>I am constantly testing new recipes with this powder and it mixes well with them all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the major brands of protein shakes on the market.</li>
            <li>I like this product enough to overlook that it&#x27;s a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>It claims the cows are not given the hormone rBGH, but Jay Robb weasels out of this one by putting a disclaimer on this and stating that at times there are not enough rBGH milk supplies available and they&#x27;ve to use US supplies--translation US milk from cows filled with artificial steroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whey comes from grass fed, free range cows, and the mix is sweetened with Stevia (which makes it really sweet without any calories and without the harmful side effects of artificial sweeteners).</li>
            <li>Apparently, the product is not from grass-fed cows either--another falsehood listed on the Amazon ad for Jay Robb Whey Protein.  </li>
            <li>I really like the taste, and protein gram weight is the highest of any other ones I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>I mix extra cocoa and some natural sweetner with it, so it tastes the same as the others to me.</li>
            <li>Oddly, I usually like sweet things, but this is gross.</li>
            <li>Because it is highly over priced when compared to other whey protein shakes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love that there is no soy or RBHT in this protein powder.</li>
            <li> I go through this stuff pretty quick and wish it was a bit cheaper, but it&#x27;s really good quality and the flavor is good</li>
            <li> It really is great tasting, high in protein, fills you up,</li>
            <li> It is a super healthy and yummy way to get your protein!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This tastes pretty good, mixes well, but is kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> There is usually a rule that if they taste good then they aren&#x27;t very good for you.</li>
            <li> and you could make great soft serve ice cream,</li>
            <li> Easy to mix using shaker or hand mixer.</li>
            <li> (it dissolves easily with no noticeable side effects.)  </li>
            <li> The product is still excellent, but the pouch is less convenient.</li>
            <li> It mixes smoothly and easily, tastes amazing and contains absolutely no junk, just high quality whey protein -- and delicious chocolate.</li>
            <li> I bought this and shakeology and this is hands down WAY better!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as much of the chocolate flavor as I would of liked, it&#x27;s lightly flavored.</li>
            <li> I think it was filled about 1/2 way.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried the chocolate Jay Roobb product but think I will happily return to a cheaper whey protein isolate drink to meet my requirements.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that my local GNC carried it.</li>
            <li> The flavor is fantastic, and doesn&#x27;t have the texture that some powders have</li>
            <li> but again the compnay is too cheap to cough up the bucks to use</li>
            <li> I also use a soy protein that is 30g of protein per scoop, and two scoops of that easily fit into the one Jay Robb scoop.  </li>
            <li> The stevie taste was to sweet and strong</li>
            <li> which is ok since i could store it easily without taking too much space.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was excited to try out this protein powder.</li>
            <li> Love the chocolate flavor, my favorite so far</li>
            <li> all the reviews were right!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wayyyyyyyyyy too sweet for me</li>
            <li> Jay Robb Whey has no sugar and only 1 gram of carb, but you cannot tell because it tastes really good.</li>
            <li> I will admit that it doesn&#x27;t taste as good with only water and after mixing it with almond milk,</li>
            <li> This product has a good flavor and is very low calorie.</li>
            <li> I would venture to say that Chobani uses more milk in one day than Jay Robb uses in a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Organic Valley and Horizon have organic milk in virtually every supermarket throughout the US, but surprisingly Jay Robb cannot find enough supplies.  </li>
            <li> I find it sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s so sweet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when I blend it with cool coffee, ice cubes and a large pinch of instant espresso powder</li>
            <li> I liked Vanilla better because I can mix it with other stuff like fruit.</li>
            <li> I like the chocolate flavor very much, and am tickled it&#x27;s made with stevia, but it wasn&#x27;t keeping me full.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with almond milk and some Gaia Chia Fresh Fiber.</li>
            <li> You know, that kind of slimey taste that aspartame leaves on the back of the tongue.  </li>
            <li> I have also added it to plain no fat yogurt with fresh fruit and agave nectar, also with great results.</li>
            <li> The taste is good compared to other protein</li>
            <li> i love the taste and really help for my diet program, highly recommended to use this product when you taking your diet</li>
            <li> from Jay&#x27;s picture right on the bottle, it&#x27;s not too showy.  </li>
            <li> Bioplex Pure WPI is by far the better choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other whey proteins such as; BSN&#x27;s Syntha 6, Bioplex Pure WPI, Bodystrong, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard, Prolab and Bodytech all of which taste much better and are a better value.  </li>
            <li> I used my first container - it goes fast!  </li>
            <li> so try the product, if you haven&#x27;t bought Jay Robb&#x27;s products before, i suggest you start with the 12 oz first</li>
            <li> , it tells you how \\&quot;superior\\&quot; the product is, but it really isn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> they were only like 15 servings per container or something like that - i thought there would be more...</li>
            <li> I have tried several protein powders but Jay Robb is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> So I just had my first taste of the whey protein, with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the last time I purchased it had free shipping, now it looks like they are charging for shipping.  </li>
            <li> Avoiding sugar has worked really well</li>
            <li> The result is 25g of protein and only 1g of carbs that I actually enjoy drinking every morning.</li>
            <li> and it is really tasty.  </li>
            <li> They state that they cannot use organic because there are not enough supplies available.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t seem to have a contact number readily</li>
            <li> The price is a bit higher than most other powders I&#x27;ve found locally, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed.</li>
            <li> Finally, the product is shpped in the new tuna fish packaging, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s done this way to cut corners for the company so they could pay less in shipping than having a nice container which would be easier to open and close, and would be convenient for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure adding other things with it in the blender will be even yummier!</li>
            <li> Please use less stevia in this product and it would be better.</li>
            <li> Less is More.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that it is not super chocolatey but it is very enjoyable in a protein drink/shake.</li>
            <li> The package does not mention a thing about it, and if it was from grass-fed cows, rest assurred they would mention it just like a car mentions when it gets high gas</li>
            <li> know it is supposed to be made of high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the best tasting powder I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> if drank with only pure water, it has that funny after taste.</li>
            <li> that is what lead me to pay triple the price for what I normally would pay for my protein supplements.  </li>
            <li> My local GNC only has the bags (rather than the large containers on the site here) for about $18, which is cool this way it is cheaper for me to change up the flavors if I want to.     </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried it with just milk or water and it&#x27;s decent</li>
            <li> I found that NOW protein powder mixed a lot better and tastes less \\&quot;sweetened.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> For example, Bioplex Pure WPI is 91% protein (20g of protein in a 22g scoop) where Jay Robb delivers only 83% protein (25g of protein in a 30g scoop).  </li>
            <li> Bioplex Pure WPI costs about $49 for 5 POUNDS with no fat, no cholesterol, no carbs, no sugars and only 90 calories/scoop!  </li>
            <li> certainly there is enough organic milk out there</li>
            <li> The price for this powder is very comparable to what I have paid for others locally.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to aspartame.</li>
            <li> I have to admint I was surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li> Jay products have far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> all natural, naturally sweeten (stevia), etc</li>
            <li> My least favorite is the dreamsicle.</li>
            <li> , I make a smoothie after my body sculpting class with chocolate powder and a half a banana, but when I add banana to this it&#x27;s soooooo sweet.  </li>
            <li> Solid product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazingly, Chobani yogurt, which is in virtually every supermarket in the US, is able to get enough steroid-free milk for its yogurt but little Jay Robb cannot get enough for its company.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly testing new recipes with this powder and it mixes well with them all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the major brands of protein shakes on the market.</li>
            <li> I like this product enough to overlook that it&#x27;s a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> It claims the cows are not given the hormone rBGH, but Jay Robb weasels out of this one by putting a disclaimer on this and stating that at times there are not enough rBGH milk supplies available and they&#x27;ve to use US supplies--translation US milk from cows filled with artificial steroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whey comes from grass fed, free range cows, and the mix is sweetened with Stevia (which makes it really sweet without any calories and without the harmful side effects of artificial sweeteners).</li>
            <li> Apparently, the product is not from grass-fed cows either--another falsehood listed on the Amazon ad for Jay Robb Whey Protein.  </li>
            <li> I really like the taste, and protein gram weight is the highest of any other ones I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> I mix extra cocoa and some natural sweetner with it, so it tastes the same as the others to me.</li>
            <li> Oddly, I usually like sweet things, but this is gross.</li>
            <li> Because it is highly over priced when compared to other whey protein shakes.  </li>
            <li> 12 oz doesn&#x27;t last very long for the $$$$</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much arsenic and other heavy metal might be in it as it was not one tested by Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the protein powders out there, and they all have things I don&#x27;t like about them -- this one clumps up, that one has too many carbs and artificial sweeteners.  </li>
            <li> Jay Robb is not even one of the leading producers of protein, much less a major player in the milk market.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bag of Pina Colada flavor and can&#x27;t wait to go back to the GNC to get the other flavors.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to have to try his other flavors next time :</li>
            <li> What tastes terrible to me might be great to you.</li>
            <li> using water makes it taste a little flat.</li>
            <li> I have memory loss as well as other problems, so I avoid artifical sweetners like the plague.</li>
            <li> I forgot to add it to a smoothie the other day</li>
            <li> Due to Gastric-bypass I have to drink a protein drink every day.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different ones and hated most of them.  </li>
            <li> Not as chocolate-y as I&#x27;d hoped, tastes a little too fake-sweet when mixed with plain water.</li>
            <li> Usually low carb no sugar whey tastes pretty bad, but I will continue to buy JR Whey</li>
            <li> Jay Robb mixes well taste fab and has all the good stuff and none of the bad and 1 carb!!</li>
            <li> I require a lot of protein to keep from breaking down muscle.  </li>
            <li> maybe sometime I will try other flavors!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So what you are getting with the product is an insanely overpriced protein that may or may not be rBGH steroid-free and certainly Jay Robb does not say that his product is free from all artificial hormones--which one should get at these ridiculously high prices for protein.</li>
            <li> On the upside, one idea is to add whatever type of milk you prefer, half a frozen banana and a half a scoop of this to the blender</li>
            <li> I typically take in 60 to 80 grams of protein a day and lift weights 5 days a week and some form of cardio 7 days a week.  </li>
            <li> Likewise the brands that are really good for you (Garden of Life) taste terrible and are really hard to choke down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I measured it out, and there are like maybe 10 scoops in  this little bag.  </li>
            <li> My main goal was to find a whey powder that came from non-hormone pumped cows and without artificial ingredients or sucrose.  </li>
            <li> Jay Robb&#x27;s is clearly the worst tasting and most expensive whey protein powder I&#x27;ve had yet.  </li>
            <li> double scoop to even fill remotely &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and very expensive for the little amount you receive.</li>
            <li> I hate the other products that have the ripped Adonis on the bottle, which makes me feel really inadequate (plus the &amp;#34;d-bag glares&amp;#34; I get when standing in the checkout</li>
            <li> I have tried protein powders in the past.</li>
            <li> I drink these everyday!</li>
            <li> I do like that the product is made with Stevia and not other artificial sweetners and</li>
            <li> I have a protein shake for breakfast at least 4 mornings out of the week.  </li>
            <li> No fillers, which is a common thing in the low-end brands.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I feel like I put my tongue in a bag of stevia.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a protein powder made with stevia instead of splenda or any other artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t have this nasty aftertaste, this got four stars because this is my first time trying the chocolate</li>
            <li> Hated the lumps and most tasted horrible.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for fake sweeteners......or sugar either.</li>
            <li> It is extremely expensive though.</li>
            <li> But I found this shake to have a terrible aftertaste that I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other protein powder I&#x27;ve used during the six or eight years I&#x27;ve used protein</li>
            <li> and it tasted flat and boring without it.  </li>
            <li> I do not have the time or patience to deal with recovering from a protein powder that makes me either sick on my stomach or have to leave the room every 5 minutes (you know what I mean).  </li>
            <li> If I had a complaint it would be that Amazon should offer it on auto delivery!!!</li>
            <li> It was extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> Mix it with cold milk</li>
            <li> It is very expensive for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> I hate to say that,</li>
            <li> so I felt I would just try to deal with horrible tasting whey...</li>
            <li> I have tried others and they tasted terrible no matter what you add for taste.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When Jay Robb says this is the best on the market, I totally agree, this is the only protein powder I have tried...and I have tried many...that doesn&#x27;t have this nasty aftertaste, this got four stars because this is my first time trying the chocolate and it&#x27;s wayyyyyyyyyy too sweet for me, I make a smoothie after my body sculpting class with chocolate powder and a half a banana, but when I add banana to this it&#x27;s soooooo sweet.  On the upside, one idea is to add whatever type of milk you prefer, half a frozen banana and a half a scoop of this to the blender and you could make great soft serve ice cream, but I&#x27;m going to stick to his Vanilla flavor from now on.</li>
            <li> I go through this stuff pretty quick and wish it was a bit cheaper, but it&#x27;s really good quality and the flavor is good (the label isn&#x27;t lying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from Jay&#x27;s picture right on the bottle, it&#x27;s not too showy.  I hate the other products that have the ripped Adonis on the bottle, which makes me feel really inadequate (plus the &amp;#34;d-bag glares&amp;#34; I get when standing in the checkout line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with almond milk and some Gaia Chia Fresh Fiber.</li>
            <li> i love the taste and really help for my diet program, highly recommended to use this product when you taking your diet</li>
            <li> I used my first container - it goes fast!  I think it was filled about 1/2 way.

I bought it because it doesn&#x27;t have any sugar - I mix extra cocoa and some natural sweetner with it, so it tastes the same as the others to me.</li>
            <li> Pros: Mixes well in shaker bottle and with blender, not chalky at all, great nutritionally, plus no sugar! Cons: Not as chocolate-y as I&#x27;d hoped, tastes a little too fake-sweet when mixed with plain water. I like this product enough to overlook that it&#x27;s a little too sweet for me. It&#x27;s great when I blend it with cool coffee, ice cubes and a large pinch of instant espresso powder and I also love it blended with a cup of frozen strawberries- instant yummy!</li>
            <li> Smooth and tastes good (with fat-free milk). Easy to mix using shaker or hand mixer.</li>
            <li> I have tried several protein powders but Jay Robb is my absolute favorite.  I have a protein shake for breakfast at least 4 mornings out of the week.  I do not have the time or patience to deal with recovering from a protein powder that makes me either sick on my stomach or have to leave the room every 5 minutes (you know what I mean).

I am constantly testing new recipes with this powder and it mixes well with them all.  The price for this powder is very comparable to what I have paid for others locally.  If I had a complaint it would be that Amazon should offer it on auto delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried protein powders in the past. Hated the lumps and most tasted horrible. Thought I would give this a try and I am glad I did. I am extremely sensitive to aspartame. I have memory loss as well as other problems, so I avoid artifical sweetners like the plague. I like that it is sweetened with stevia and doesn&#x27;t have fillers. This brand mixes well and I love the flavor, doesn&#x27;t taste chalky. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have to say first of all I was relieved that I did not think this was the best tasting whey protein I had ever tasted.  Why?  Because it is highly over priced when compared to other whey protein shakes.  I have tried just about every brand out there and consider my self well versed in most nutrition products.  I do like that the product is made with Stevia and not other artificial sweetners and that is what lead me to pay triple the price for what I normally would pay for my protein supplements.  I typically take in 60 to 80 grams of protein a day and lift weights 5 days a week and some form of cardio 7 days a week.  I require a lot of protein to keep from breaking down muscle.  I have only tried the chocolate Jay Roobb product but think I will happily return to a cheaper whey protein isolate drink to meet my requirements.</li>
            <li> I have to admint I was surprised by the taste. I always thought whey protein is whey protein. I want to lose weight so I felt I would just try to deal with horrible tasting whey...but I was wrong. I bought this brand of Whey Protein after reading the book Belly Fat Cure. I was happy to see that my local GNC carried it. I have tried whey protein before and stopped using it when it actually caused me to gain weight. Boy, have I learned a lot since then. Jay Robb Whey has no sugar and only 1 gram of carb, but you cannot tell because it tastes really good. Usually low carb no sugar whey tastes pretty bad, but I will continue to buy JR Whey and I do recommend it. I bought a bag of Pina Colada flavor and can&#x27;t wait to go back to the GNC to get the other flavors. My local GNC only has the bags (rather than the large containers on the site here) for about $18, which is cool this way it is cheaper for me to change up the flavors if I want to.     I use 0 sugar almond milk with the JR Whey Protein which thickens it and gives it a kind of sweet/salty taste that I like. I will admit that it doesn&#x27;t taste as good with only water and after mixing it with almond milk, using water makes it taste a little flat. I want to mix things up and try orange juice or coconut milk and soy milk. There are so many ways to mix this up and I think I can finally look forward to losing some weight now.</li>
            <li> Love the chocolate flavor, my favorite so far</li>
            <li> My main goal was to find a whey powder that came from non-hormone pumped cows and without artificial ingredients or sucrose.  Jay products have far exceeded my expectations.  The flavor is fantastic, and doesn&#x27;t have the texture that some powders have (it dissolves easily with no noticeable side effects.)  I haven&#x27;t tried it on it&#x27;s own, always using it in smoothies.  I forgot to add it to a smoothie the other day and it tasted flat and boring without it.  How awesome to finally find a healthy good-tasting protein powder! (I&#x27;ve tried both the vanilla and chocolate, and also use the unflavored one in cooking.)</li>
            <li> I like the chocolate flavor very much, and am tickled it&#x27;s made with stevia, but it wasn&#x27;t keeping me full. If they would make one with some fiber, this would be a 5+ star rating from me for sure.  I have used it to add to cooked steel cut oats with fruit and cinnamon, and it&#x27;s wonderful. I have also added it to plain no fat yogurt with fresh fruit and agave nectar, also with great results.</li>
            <li> This is a great protein.  My only suggestion is that it is not super chocolatey but it is very enjoyable in a protein drink/shake.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the jar container but it was in a packet (12 oz.) which is ok since i could store it easily without taking too much space. The taste is good compared to other protein shakes I&#x27;ve had before, it&#x27;s not as sweet, but i have to say it taste best with milk or soy. if drank with only pure water, it has that funny after taste. so try the product, if you haven&#x27;t bought Jay Robb&#x27;s products before, i suggest you start with the 12 oz first and then just go from there. i&#x27;m going to have to try his other flavors next time :</li>
            <li> I have been using the fatbelly diet and it was suggested that Jay Robb had the best tasting protein powder.  Avoiding sugar has worked really well and I have lost 12 pounds however if I had to do it by drinking Jay Robb&#x27;s stuff I would not bother.  I found that NOW protein powder mixed a lot better and tastes less \\&quot;sweetened.\\&quot;  You know, that kind of slimey taste that aspartame leaves on the back of the tongue.  The Jay Robb also left globs in my almonds milk while the NOW did not.  So, I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. However, the picture is misleading.  It arrived in a pouch, not a canister. The product is still excellent, but the pouch is less convenient.</li>
            <li> This product has a good flavor and is very low calorie. I will definitely be ordering it again. The strawberry is good as well.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good. So far I&#x27;ve tried it with just milk or water and it&#x27;s decent I&#x27;m sure adding other things with it in the blender will be even yummier! I bought this and shakeology and this is hands down WAY better!!!</li>
            <li> Jay Robb&#x27;s is clearly the worst tasting and most expensive whey protein powder I&#x27;ve had yet.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other whey proteins such as; BSN&#x27;s Syntha 6, Bioplex Pure WPI, Bodystrong, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard, Prolab and Bodytech all of which taste much better and are a better value.  For example, Bioplex Pure WPI is 91% protein (20g of protein in a 22g scoop) where Jay Robb delivers only 83% protein (25g of protein in a 30g scoop).  Jay Robb costs about $43 for 24oz.  Bioplex Pure WPI costs about $49 for 5 POUNDS with no fat, no cholesterol, no carbs, no sugars and only 90 calories/scoop!  Don&#x27;t get suckered by the Jay Robb \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; hype.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;highway Robb-ery\\&quot;.  Bioplex Pure WPI is by far the better choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using protein supplements for years and this is among the best that I&#x27;ve found.  No fillers, which is a common thing in the low-end brands.  Also great tasting and easy to mix, which is really important if you&#x27;re taking this with you on the road or to the gym and don&#x27;t have a blender handy.  This is among the easiest to mix powder that I&#x27;ve found.  Shake it and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a protein powder made with stevia instead of splenda or any other artificial sweetener. I think this was recommend out of the Belly Fat Cure. I liked that there wasn&#x27;t a huge list of ingredients either. This tastes pretty good, mixes well, but is kinda pricey. 12 oz doesn&#x27;t last very long for the $$$$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the major brands of protein shakes on the market. There is usually a rule that if they taste good then they aren&#x27;t very good for you. Likewise the brands that are really good for you (Garden of Life) taste terrible and are really hard to choke down. Jay Robb&#x27;s Chocolate Whey Protein is the best mix of \\&quot;good for you\\&quot; and \\&quot;tastes good.\\&quot; The whey comes from grass fed, free range cows, and the mix is sweetened with Stevia (which makes it really sweet without any calories and without the harmful side effects of artificial sweeteners). The result is 25g of protein and only 1g of carbs that I actually enjoy drinking every morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but a bit too sweet. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again unless I find one with no Stevia in it. I don&#x27;t care for fake sweeteners......or sugar either.</li>
            <li> I have been drinking this protein mix for about 8 months!  I really like the taste, and protein gram weight is the highest of any other ones I&#x27;ve seen.  I always put 1/2 frozen banana and frozen blueberries in with some ice and it is really tasty.  I always buy Chocolate.. maybe sometime I will try other flavors!</li>
            <li> It really is great tasting, high in protein, fills you up, all natural, naturally sweeten (stevia), etc.... I only give it a 4 star just because of the price. It is very expensive for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> I had better hopes for the chocolate flavor. Nope. Same issue with the strawberry shake: double scoop to even fill remotely &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and very expensive for the little amount you receive.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was excited to try out this protein powder. It was extremely disappointing. It has almost no flavor! I&#x27;m going to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product. The stevie taste was to sweet and strong</li>
            <li> I will say that the protein shake tastes good but upon inspection one notices that the supposed protein from grass-fed cows is not from grass-fed cows after all.  The package does not mention a thing about it, and if it was from grass-fed cows, rest assurred they would mention it just like a car mentions when it gets high gas mileage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it tells you how \\&quot;superior\\&quot; the product is, but it really isn&#x27;t!  It claims the cows are not given the hormone rBGH, but Jay Robb weasels out of this one by putting a disclaimer on this and stating that at times there are not enough rBGH milk supplies available and they&#x27;ve to use US supplies--translation US milk from cows filled with artificial steroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, Chobani yogurt, which is in virtually every supermarket in the US, is able to get enough steroid-free milk for its yogurt but little Jay Robb cannot get enough for its company.  Jay Robb is not even one of the leading producers of protein, much less a major player in the milk market.  Basically the only \\&quot;cow\\&quot; product we get from this company is a lot of bull.  I would venture to say that Chobani uses more milk in one day than Jay Robb uses in a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then on the company&#x27;s Website is more bull.  They state that they cannot use organic because there are not enough supplies available.  Seriously?  Organic Valley and Horizon have organic milk in virtually every supermarket throughout the US, but surprisingly Jay Robb cannot find enough supplies.  Just how big does Jay Robb think his company is?  Again this is more lies from the company...certainly there is enough organic milk out there but again the compnay is too cheap to cough up the bucks to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what you are getting with the product is an insanely overpriced protein that may or may not be rBGH steroid-free and certainly Jay Robb does not say that his product is free from all artificial hormones--which one should get at these ridiculously high prices for protein.Apparently, the product is not from grass-fed cows either--another falsehood listed on the Amazon ad for Jay Robb Whey Protein.  Finally, the product is shpped in the new tuna fish packaging, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s done this way to cut corners for the company so they could pay less in shipping than having a nice container which would be easier to open and close, and would be convenient for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, there are good alternatives out there like Biochem, Resveratage, Jarrow,  Solgar, etc.  Companies that actually deliver what Jay Robb claims to deliver and they don&#x27;t try to weasel out of their claims--unlike Jay Robb&#x27;s products.  There is also soy lecithin in this product which is a known allergen and better products avoid it.  Bascially, with Jay Robb&#x27;s products you are paying for a Lexus and getting a Chevy, but then again what would we expect from a guy whose last name is Robb!</li>
            <li> I know taste is subjective. What tastes terrible to me might be great to you. But I found this shake to have a terrible aftertaste that I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other protein powder I&#x27;ve used during the six or eight years I&#x27;ve used protein powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is supposed to be made of high quality ingredients. I don&#x27;t know how much arsenic and other heavy metal might be in it as it was not one tested by Consumer Reports. Moreover, there is (as of this writing) nothing on their site about it and they don&#x27;t seem to have a contact number readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Susanna K. Hutcheson</li>
            <li> Good product, good flavor, great taste and exactly what I was looking for in a protein powder.  Solid product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> all the reviews were right! this stuff is awesome! great taste! only thing is i didnt realixe they were only like 15 servings per container or something like that - i thought there would be more...</li>
            <li> This is soo great!! It is soo delicious! It is a super healthy and yummy way to get your protein! I drink these everyday! I&#x27;m in love!! :)</li>
            <li> Due to Gastric-bypass I have to drink a protein drink every day.  I have tried a number of different ones and hated most of them.  Then I got this powder and use it to make a wonderful drink every night.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. No grit. Taste just like a chocolate malt. I love it. Just bought another 80oz bag. In my opinion you won&#x27;t find a better Whey protein supplement unless you want to spend twice the money. There is another one made by a company called One World Whey that is supposed to be the best. It is extremely expensive though. I didn&#x27;t try it. This one works and tastes perfect for me. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from the product. Extremely happy with it. Highly recommend. Yummy.</li>
            <li> This shake tasted great and gave you so much energy.  I have tried others and they tasted terrible no matter what you add for taste.  I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> We use this for recipes from Trim Healthy Mama cookbook, specifically the Fat Stripping Frappa on page 240. I like this better than the vanilla flavor for this recipe.</li>
            <li> Jay Robb makes the best protein powders out there! My two go to are the vanilla and chocolate.  No after taste and the chocolate is the best one out there. My least favorite is the dreamsicle. This flavor, to me, tastes like soap. I hate to say that, but to me, the taste is not the best.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tasting protein powder.  Mix it with cold milk and I swear it tastes just like a milk shake.  The only drawback is the cost/small amount you get.  Yes, there are &amp;#34;25g of protein per scoop&amp;#34;, but scoop is huge!  I also use a soy protein that is 30g of protein per scoop, and two scoops of that easily fit into the one Jay Robb scoop.  Just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I measured it out, and there are like maybe 10 scoops in  this little bag.  That is $2/scoop!  While my soy protein costs like $.15 per scoop.&lt;br /&gt;So I use this powder only when I need a treat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the protein powders out there, and they all have things I don&#x27;t like about them -- this one clumps up, that one has too many carbs and artificial sweeteners.  But I have no complaints about Jay Robb&#x27;s protein powder.  It mixes smoothly and easily, tastes amazing and contains absolutely no junk, just high quality whey protein -- and delicious chocolate.</li>
            <li> Tastes great- I add instant coffee to it every morning (and a teaspoon of almond butter!).</li>
            <li> The chocolate whey protein powder has a great flavor, mixes well, and is perfect if you need a protein supplement or are doing any type of cleanse. The price is a bit higher than most other powders I&#x27;ve found locally, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. It had a very good taste, and also dissolved well into liquids. I love that there is no soy or RBHT in this protein powder. Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> So I just had my first taste of the whey protein, with high hopes. I find it sickly sweet. In fact it&#x27;s so sweet I couldn&#x27;t finish it. Its been two hours and I still taste the stevia. I can&#x27;t tell if it taste lake chocolate because  stevia is all that I can taste. Seriously, I feel like I put my tongue in a bag of stevia. Oddly, I usually like sweet things, but this is gross. I&#x27;m really bummed. Please use less stevia in this product and it would be better. Stevia is 600x sweeter then sugar. Less is More.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of protein shakes! I didn&#x27;t get as much of the chocolate flavor as I would of liked, it&#x27;s lightly flavored. I liked Vanilla better because I can mix it with other stuff like fruit.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the best tasting powder I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. Do yourself a favor and try it! Chocolate is my favorite, but vanilla is also really great! Love this stuff!!!</li>
