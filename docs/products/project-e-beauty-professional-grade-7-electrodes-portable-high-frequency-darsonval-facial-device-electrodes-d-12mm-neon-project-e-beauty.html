            <li>Fine lines started to disappear after the first use.</li>
            <li>and they were very apologetic and made a very quick response and assured me another comb would be sent out immediately.</li>

            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed that any acne I get goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I hope seller makes this right.</li>
            <li>Overall, so far so good.</li>
            <li>The product I received is exactly as it was described online.</li>
            <li>Product also functions exactly like it was described online.</li>

            <li>I recieved the package much quicker than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra and get this double kit because there are more device options.</li>
            <li>A rating of even &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; is too high.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Each device is a hollow glass tube filled with gas.</li>

            <li>When I received this item, I opened the package to make sure all items were intact and nothing broken as a lot of the components are glass.  </li>
            <li>The electrodes I ordered were of the orange and one was the blue, the roller electrode was so loose that it now rolls sideways rather than straight.</li>
            <li>I am stuck with an item I cannot use for the fear of using it wrong, and I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company again at all....and not from Amazon either if they have companies representing them that do not have enough knowledge about their own products to put together a product manual.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it only 4 days and have seen a major improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li>Further, it was supposed to be new, but clearly is not.</li>

            <li> Further, it was supposed to be new, but clearly is not.</li>
            <li> I usually have very oily skin and that has improved a moderate amount.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional, so</li>
            <li> Took a week to arrive and who knows how long it will take to get all the parts.</li>
            <li> have not used this machine for very long</li>
            <li> The redness has gone down and the white bumps have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Started breaking after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> how long have I used this machine.....1 DAY!!!!  </li>
            <li> Amazon took my complaint and said seller will call me within 24 hours and should send me the missing parts, but it should have been here complete.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only negative was that it comes without a user guide.</li>
            <li> It appears as if its something I can fix myself with little difficulty.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Takes away dead cells and marks.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I have noticed an improvment in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I usually turn it up about 3/4th of the way.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m seeing results or not.</li>
            <li> And because the devices are somewhat difficult to remove from the unit, pick up one of those flat, rubber grips used for opening kitchen jars you find in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the common complaint I read about.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The ugly scar on my wrist is starting to flatten and fade.  </li>
            <li> its too weak, it feels like it is alredy worn out.</li>
            <li> but I did find that one of the pieces was broken</li>
            <li> two of the tools were broken</li>
            <li> my package arrived the comb was broken; I emailed the company and I had a replacement within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the comb electrode was broken.</li>
            <li> The adjustments to the handheld probe is the worst, as it has to be done constantly!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Really sad!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;glass wand&amp;#34; separated from it&#x27;s metal base.</li>
            <li> I am very, very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very convenient and happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. The handheld probe has to be adjusted continuously to make contact with the electrodes. The electrodes I ordered were of the orange and one was the blue, the roller electrode was so loose that it now rolls sideways rather than straight. None of this is mentioned anywhere. The adjustments to the handheld probe is the worst, as it has to be done constantly! If you want a refund/exchange you have to go through amazon or the company will have you pay for it to be sent back, and then it&#x27;s a minimum of 30 days. It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  Started breaking after only a few uses.  Save your money, buy another brand.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like the #7 electrodes offered with this package. Gives you choices as to what shape you want to use on a specific area. Seller has very easy to work with and the product came on time.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this machine for very long so I have no feed back yet as to the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hopeful and will add to this review in the future :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am healing acne bumbs at lightning speed.  The ugly scar on my wrist is starting to flatten and fade.  My face is tighter and my neck is shrinking up into its former good looks.... how long have I used this machine.....1 DAY!!!!  WOW</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my Acne patients and also for anti aging but I did find that one of the pieces was broken and I need to contact the company for another one.</li>
            <li> I received the item; it was packaged very nicely but WITHOUT ANY ATTACHMENTS. Well, am sending it back and waiting for a credit. I think I&#x27;ll give it another try once I receive the credit and let you know how it works.</li>
            <li> I give this a zero.  I am not a professional, so I don&#x27;t have a clue how to use this without a manual.  You would think they would have some concern about the safety of the consumer.  I am stuck with an item I cannot use for the fear of using it wrong, and I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company again at all....and not from Amazon either if they have companies representing them that do not have enough knowledge about their own products to put together a product manual.  Anyone want to buy a Professional Grade 7 electrodes Portable High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval facial device?</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition and on time. The product I received is exactly as it was described online. Product also functions exactly like it was described online. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that one of my attachments broke rather easily. The &amp;#34;glass wand&amp;#34; separated from it&#x27;s metal base. It appears as if its something I can fix myself with little difficulty. Overall, so far so good.</li>
            <li> its too weak, it feels like it is alredy worn out. It does not seem to be working at full strength</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Clears your skin as you use it frecuently. Takes away dead cells and marks. Leaves a whiter skin. I live in Colombia and had no voltage problems</li>
            <li> When I received this item, I opened the package to make sure all items were intact and nothing broken as a lot of the components are glass.  I turned the device on to make sure it was functioning but i didn&#x27;t get around to actually use the device until after my 30 grace period for returns or exchanges was up.  The device seems to have a short of some sort.  The control switch which regulates the intensity doesn&#x27;t appear to work properly.  If you try to increase or decrease the settings it sometimes shuts of.  It doesn&#x27;t increase to its full intensity.  Not very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great. happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and I am very happy with the results.  Fine lines started to disappear after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have only used this device twice so far, but I notice improvement already.  I look forward to using it more. The only negative was that it comes without a user guide. I had to go onlinel and research how to use it.</li>
            <li> A rating of even &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; is too high.  This is a piece of junk.  No instructions as to how to operate or how each of the instruments should be used.  I can&#x27;t tell if it works or not since there are no explanations.  Further, it was supposed to be new, but clearly is not. It is either a return by someone else or it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;second&amp;#34;  I am very, very disappointed with this product.  Doesn&#x27;t Amazon check out the suppliers?  Think twice before buying this product from Amazon, goods are not as they are advertised.</li>
            <li> it doest work 4 me. it hurt my skin. sent me the used one. two of the tools were broken</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I have noticed an improvment in my skin.  My face is less red and also my fine lines have been reduced.  I also have noticed that any acne I get goes away pretty quickly.  I feel that my pores look smaller.  I usually have very oily skin and that has improved a moderate amount.  I feel my face overall looks younger.  I&#x27;m also using this on the top of my head because I have moderate hair loss.  One major improvment I have noticed is that my head doesn&#x27;t get as oily.  It&#x27;s still too soon to see if it will help grow my hair back but if it does I will update this review.  I haven&#x27;t had to turn this device all the way up yet.  I usually turn it up about 3/4th of the way.  I can feel the tingle at that level. I wish I would have known about this when I was a teenager with really oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Professional Grade 7 electrodes Portable unit.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I can see excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Yes, was a good choice ,I m very happy,great product .works well and feels well  it just really good .</li>
            <li> The unit arrived in a little box that they put in a huge box with no padding.......and NO electrodes!!!!! So I have a unit I can&#x27;t use. Description showed unit and 7 electrodes and cost me a lot of money. Amazon took my complaint and said seller will call me within 24 hours and should send me the missing parts, but it should have been here complete. I saved up to buy this and wanted to use it but not going to happen. Took a week to arrive and who knows how long it will take to get all the parts. Really sad! I hope seller makes this right. Also the direction sheet is not understandable. I will update if this gets corrected.</li>
            <li> The item is worth the money.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e6754a197f3fbcb6482b9924044ca2e]] I love this product. I have been using it only 4 days and have seen a major improvement to my skin. The redness has gone down and the white bumps have disappeared. I have made a video on how to use it properly. If you follow the directions you should see major improvements to your skin. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great device! Amazing difference in skin tone. Well worth the money. Spend the extra and get this double kit because there are more device options. Great for circulation problems. Not only is it for your face and neck but use it on your toes, fingers, arms and legs too!&lt;br /&gt;When my package arrived the comb was broken; I emailed the company and I had a replacement within 2 weeks. Don&#x27;t be alarmed because even though these devices are sturdy, they are fragile too. Each device is a hollow glass tube filled with gas. And because the devices are somewhat difficult to remove from the unit, pick up one of those flat, rubber grips used for opening kitchen jars you find in the grocery store. This seems to be the common complaint I read about.</li>
            <li> Recieved my high frequency machine from Project A Beauty and love it! Unfortunately the comb electrode was broken. I e mailed the people at Project A Beauty and they were very apologetic and made a very quick response and assured me another comb would be sent out immediately. I recieved the package much quicker than anticipated. It only took a week from overseas. Very happy with the service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I love it. But the reason why I rated it 3 stars is this is my second purchase. The first one I bought stop working just over a month after I got it. So I&#x27;m hoping not to have the same problem with this second one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. Not sure if I&#x27;m seeing results or not. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and report back later. It works and it&#x27;s nice to have all the attachments.</li>
            <li> Love this for skin care</li>
    </ol>
