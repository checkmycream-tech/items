            <li>not to happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Amope Pedic Perfect advertised on TV,  she likes this one better.</li>
            <li>Worked once ok.</li>
            <li>Never worked for more than 2 minutes after that.</li>
            <li>lovely feet</li>
            <li>I bought this product and once it was finally received it was great!  </li>
            <li>Love it you have to invest in this</li>
            <li>The speed is not as strong as I though will be.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful, and I like it more than I thought I would between pedicures</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, she really likes it!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little purchase.</li>
            <li>Product itself seems to be working well,but battery died after first use.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, I was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance, but the battery slowed down to almost a halt before even finishing one foot.</li>
            <li>The dead skin does not come up as easy and does not leave it as smooth as the picture shows.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t charge it won&#x27;t fit my outlets not useful without a charge</li>
            <li>I left it charge for 2 days, tried it again, started out full power but ran down even quicker than the first time.</li>
            <li>And the battery ran down fast.</li>
