            <li>Perfect and very helpful.</li>
            <li>the job done&amp;#34; quite nicely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li>It will rinse off/out with warm water, as it is water-soluble and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Nice, inexpensive lube for the amount of it you get.</li>
            <li>So really kind of a neutral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will NOT keep it&#x27;s consistency of a gelatin as you use it and it starts to warm up from body temperature and will leak out of your toys or orifices.</li>
            <li>This is where it being a non-staining lube is nice as it can and probably will leak onto pillows or sheets/blankets during use.</li>
            <li>Great stuff and a very smart buy!  </li>
            <li>Still, this is by far the best lube out there for the price.</li>
            <li>It works great and is easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>It works great, not sticky, and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>It seems to suck up a lot more air</li>
            <li>myself and my girlfriend love this.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you order the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; and not the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>5 stars if it had a better pump.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lubes.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to be sure</li>
            <li>Both are better than any of the brands that are considered &amp;</li>
            <li>I love the service and the product as well.</li>
            <li>As a personal lubricant, this is the very best.  </li>
            <li>Gel is much much better than the  liquid.</li>
            <li>She says it makes anal sex much more enjoyable and no pain.</li>
            <li>I think that is the most polite way I can phrase that without giving it away...</li>
            <li>Non-oily, non-irritating and lubricates better than anything on the market that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>It is a touch thicker than the original, but it stays where you put it rather than dribbling off!</li>
            <li>this stuff works very well and its alot cheaper than good clean love</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s the best lubricant..</li>
            <li>I give it full marks!</li>
            <li>34;handy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The product stays in place until we&#x27;re done with it, then easily washes off.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily too.</li>
            <li>Also after opening it form the &#x27;closed/locked&#x27; pump state the entire thing shaft of the lever that pops up out of the pump is covered in a fair bit of lube which seems kind of wasteful to me.</li>
            <li>I never thought this would end up being hands down the best lube ever!</li>
            <li>Got here quick!</li>
            <li>Best lube we have ever tried....would highly recommend as it does not dry out very quickly</li>
            <li>Easy clean up no stains or</li>
            <li>Water soluble, never sticky, no taste and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>think of anything else to comment about, any questions feel free to ask.</li>
            <li>But the important thing to say here is that this is a quality product for lubricant needs and comes with a convenient pump.</li>
            <li>Worried this wouldn&#x27;t be as good, presently surprised to find out</li>
            <li>kind of the main reason of getting this was the feel.</li>
            <li>Originally used the Just Like Me water based lube...</li>
            <li>Been using for years, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or rashes even on freshly shaved skin!</li>
            <li>Super clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It will still last for a good 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>a clinical sexologist, I recommend this to all of my clients, especially my older clients.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and a great water based product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Slippery Stuff for the past 5 years and am convinced it is the superior sexual lubricant.</li>
            <li>Low price, I just love it!</li>
            <li>This product works very well to make my partner comfortable for doing the deed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried silicon based lubricants and the water based lubricant is thicker and feels more natural.</li>
            <li>I liked the extra value of 32 OZ but the pump was defective.</li>
            <li>Originally developed to assist divers and surfers in getting into their wetsuits, it has enjoyed a &amp;#34;second life&amp;#34; as a boudoir aid ... and deservedly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried some other recommendations but this works best especially for anal play and toys.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensual massage, but it is great for any other intimate act.</li>
            <li>Priced right I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if we could get a smaller bottle at a reasonable price, but this quart sized bottle &amp;#34;gets</li>
            <li>I love this product, but for some reason the new clear dispenser pump is not as good as the old, white one.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of pumping to get it started the first time and seems to pick up a lot of air throughout</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll probably find a smaller pump bottle to keep more &amp;#</li>
            <li>I have tried many different ones and nothing compares.</li>
            <li>Do not use more SS, it is not necessary.</li>
            <li>one of the longer lasting lubes I have used but make sure you turn off any fans in your room or where ever you may use it.</li>
            <li>Clean, no odor, and dries without residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels very natural.</li>
            <li>Really slick,  non sticky, good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this produce.</li>
            <li>so much I tried the liquid and the silicone.  </li>
            <li>;.. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My wife really loves this lube.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s been warmed up it reminds me of the Astroglide Lube which is a lube I have found to be really</li>
            <li>really wanted to like the bottle</li>
            <li>VERY slippery, long lasting, easy clean up</li>
            <li>I was on a search to find a decent lube.</li>
            <li>but this is the main reason for this getting a 3/5, 2 stars for 2 grievances, I figure is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rate it highly because it is also great for less conventional intimacy.</li>
            <li>The liquid is too runny and makes more of a mess.  </li>
            <li>then the normal Gun Oil brand I&#x27;m use to but needed to give it a try anyways for the price</li>
            <li>Wonderfully slick with real staying power - doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; so many do.</li>
            <li>Not quite as thick as we like, but nice and slippery.</li>
            <li>Works good but does tend to dry out a little faster</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant consistency, odorless, colorless, flavorless, cleans up easily, can use with any toy w/o concern of damage, and stays moist a long time, but if it does dry  out (and it can), simply spritz a little water, (</li>
            <li>But it typically drys and is easy to wash</li>
            <li>It will dry out rather quickly if you have a ceiling fan on or a corded fan circulating air in the room.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly and is also latex compatible.</li>
            <li>Far better than the usual brands we get in stores</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really bother me much one way or the other as to what it smells like as long as it&#x27;s not atrocious smelling.</li>
            <li>They need to make the difference a little more obvious.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful in providing lubrication, and has been one of the only ones that has not given me an allergic reaction, or cause an infection after using it.</li>
            <li>Keep your old bottles and use this as a refill</li>
            <li>And are ready to buy our second bottle!!!</li>
            <li>It is also a great value, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>I mean, it DOES work for a little bit and it is easy to clean up...</li>
            <li>but it does leave one kind of sticky but that can be fixed by other having a small spray battle with water on hand to spray on yourself or your toy to bring the lube &#x27;back to life&#x27; or applying a very small amount of more of this lube.</li>
            <li>Slick and fun without being sticky or slimy feeling!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great feeling so long as it is cold or at room temperature.</li>
            <li>I got this because during my search I would only buy the smallest amount of a new lube to try it first and since even the smallest amount you can get will cost over $10 it was a slow process</li>

            <li> It has a pleasant consistency, odorless, colorless, flavorless, cleans up easily, can use with any toy w/o concern of damage, and stays moist a long time, but if it does dry  out (and it can), simply spritz a little water, (</li>

            <li> but it does leave one kind of sticky but that can be fixed by other having a small spray battle with water on hand to spray on yourself or your toy to bring the lube &#x27;back to life&#x27; or applying a very small amount of more of this lube.</li>

            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other brands and always return to this product.</li>
            <li> this lube comes in but the pump that comes in it annoys the heck out of me due to the fact that in order to lock it in place you have to fully decompress the pump lever than twist it to get it to the &#x27;closed/locked&#x27; position in order to store it.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer uses a slight colored visual on the label and the small words &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;LIQUID&amp;#34; on the label.  </li>
            <li> I transfered ( not fun) the lube to my 16 oz and 8 oz bottles and threw this container in the trash.</li>
            <li> Had to reapply every two minutes or less.</li>
            <li> so I sometimes have to pump it like four or five times just to get one little blob out.</li>
            <li> When I got the package delivered there was a little leakage too..</li>
            <li> I used this a few times on myself.</li>

            <li> Not sure what that&#x27;s about</li>
            <li> Also not sure if it&#x27;s from the toys I am using or this lube</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product, but for some reason the new clear dispenser pump is not as good as the old, white one. It seems to suck up a lot more air so I sometimes have to pump it like four or five times just to get one little blob out. Not sure what that&#x27;s about but it&#x27;s worth noting. Still, this is by far the best lube out there for the price.</li>
            <li> Super clean and smooth. Not smelly of sticky.</li>
            <li> The contents of the bottle are great. But, the reason why I am giving only 4 stars is because the pump does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both myself and my girlfriend love this. We&#x27;ve tried silicon based lubricants and the water based lubricant is thicker and feels more natural.</li>
            <li> Just like it say&#x27;s, slippery stuff, works well.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this lubricant for the past several years.  It works great and is easy to clean up.  Just make sure that you order the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; and not the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34;.  The liquid is too runny and makes more of a mess.  The manufacturer uses a slight colored visual on the label and the small words &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;LIQUID&amp;#34; on the label.  They need to make the difference a little more obvious.</li>
            <li> Great product! Got here quick! Low price, I just love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.. Far better than the usual brands we get in stores.. The only drawback is the dispenser as it gets jammed and u need to keep pumping for a while.. For that reason, I gave it 4 stars..  When I got the package delivered there was a little leakage too.. They should do something about this dispenser.. Other than that, it&#x27;s the best lubricant..</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using it for years and the consistency leaves nothing to be desired.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It is very helpful in providing lubrication, and has been one of the only ones that has not given me an allergic reaction, or cause an infection after using it. I am very please with this produce.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! VERY slippery, long lasting, easy clean up and it stays where you put it. I tried some other recommendations but this works best especially for anal play and toys. Priced right I will buy this again. BUT what don&#x27;t I like? The pump stinks. It takes a lot of pumping to get it started the first time and seems to pick up a lot of air throughout it&#x27;s use, you have to do a lot of pumping. Fix the pump and I would go nuts over this stuff. 5 stars if it had a better pump.</li>
            <li> Perfect and very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is the worst lub on the market, I will never buy it again, it dries up before putting it on .</li>
            <li> Stays where you put it, does the job, and does it well. Best &amp;#34;bang&amp;#34; for your buck. I give it full marks!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and a very smart buy!  Everything is just as described</li>
            <li> My wife and I joke that &amp;#34;it won&#x27;t be enough&amp;#34;. It would be nice if we could get a smaller bottle at a reasonable price, but this quart sized bottle &amp;#34;gets the job done&amp;#34; quite nicely. We&#x27;ll probably find a smaller pump bottle to keep more &amp;#34;handy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The product stays in place until we&#x27;re done with it, then easily washes off.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Originally used the Just Like Me water based lube... Worried this wouldn&#x27;t be as good, presently surprised to find out I was completely wrong. This stuff works great. Lasts quite awhile too.</li>
            <li> I would say the price is right, given the size, but the pump is very inconvenient and in the future I might buy different packaging.</li>
            <li> Best lube I ever used . Apply it lasts for hours. Easy clean up no stains or rude smell.&lt;br /&gt;Just can&#x27;t wait to try with my wife</li>
            <li> we love this stuff and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff! Long lasting and a great water based product! We&#x27;ve tried other brands and always return to this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lubes. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky at all!</li>
            <li> Water soluble, never sticky, no taste and fragrance free.  Stands up to the challenge.  Cures what ails ya.  Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> Works good but does tend to dry out a little faster then the normal Gun Oil brand I&#x27;m use to but needed to give it a try anyways for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong :)</li>
            <li> I was on a search to find a decent lube. I never thought this would end up being hands down the best lube ever! I got this because during my search I would only buy the smallest amount of a new lube to try it first and since even the smallest amount you can get will cost over $10 it was a slow process and I wanted to be sure if I ran out I had something to use. This was extreamly inexpensive for the amount. I ended up liking it so much I tried the liquid and the silicone.  Both are better than any of the brands that are considered &amp;#34;Name Brand&amp;#34;.. Highly recommend! Even if you are happy with your brand what can it hurt to spend 6 bucks to try it . You&#x27;ll be amazed when you realize what good lube feels like.</li>
            <li> I used this a few times on myself. Had to reapply every two minutes or less. You know how those hand sanitizers are slippery for a few seconds and then dries up when you rub your hands together? Slippery Stuff does the same thing, only not quite as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad on it&#x27;s own...I mean, it DOES work for a little bit and it is easy to clean up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one unforgivable thing is that it doesn&#x27;t maintain it&#x27;s slipperiness while inside my girlfriend&#x27;s business. She hates it, and told me to buy Liquid Silk again instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Slippery Stuff, but I would rather point people towards something else than endorse your product.</li>
            <li> What can I say, you know what it&#x27;s for and it works fantastically.</li>
            <li> This is the best lube I have ever. I have tried many different ones and nothing compares. I would give the lube 10 stars if I could, but I should drop a star for this 32 oz bottle. The lube is too good to take the star off but the pump just doesnt work. I transfered ( not fun) the lube to my 16 oz and 8 oz bottles and threw this container in the trash. I liked the extra value of 32 OZ but the pump was defective. Keep your old bottles and use this as a refill</li>
            <li> this stuff works very well and its alot cheaper than good clean love .more bangin for ur buck will be buying again for sure.make getting into those hard places muchhhhhhhhh easyer :0)</li>
            <li> Best body lubricant available.  Rather overpriced though.</li>
            <li> Clean, no odor, and dries without residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels very natural.</li>
            <li> This is the finest water-soluble lubricant I have ever seen, and I have looked at dozens. Originally developed to assist divers and surfers in getting into their wetsuits, it has enjoyed a &amp;#34;second life&amp;#34; as a boudoir aid ... and deservedly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a clinical sexologist, I recommend this to all of my clients, especially my older clients. For post-menopausal women, this can be a godsend for continuing intimacy into one&#x27;s senior years.</li>
            <li> I love the service and the product as well. I will be back!</li>
            <li> As a personal lubricant, this is the very best.  It has a pleasant consistency, odorless, colorless, flavorless, cleans up easily, can use with any toy w/o concern of damage, and stays moist a long time, but if it does dry  out (and it can), simply spritz a little water, (I keep a little spray bottle bedside) and it will &#x27;come back&#x27;.  Do not use more SS, it is not necessary. It will rinse off/out with warm water, as it is water-soluble and not greasy.  This is the only pl I use, and have for years.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Gel is much much better than the  liquid.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this lube.  She says it makes anal sex much more enjoyable and no pain. Great product</li>
            <li> good stuff but price increased 5$ so I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice, inexpensive lube for the amount of it you get.That being said there are some things about it that should be taken into consideration while/when looking for a lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell 4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell 4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the fact that it smells like an antibiotic hand sanitizing gel is why I rate this a 4 out of 5. Some people may like it some people may not. Doesn&#x27;t really bother me much one way or the other as to what it smells like as long as it&#x27;s not atrocious smelling. So really kind of a neutral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me this was kind of the main reason of getting this was the feel. It&#x27;s great feeling so long as it is cold or at room temperature. If you like to warm/heat your lubes up you can heat/warm this but it will have the consistency of water and you can feel the difference between it being a gel when it cold/room temp and when it&#x27;s warmed up and has a water feel to it. It will NOT keep it&#x27;s consistency of a gelatin as you use it and it starts to warm up from body temperature and will leak out of your toys or orifices. This is where it being a non-staining lube is nice as it can and probably will leak onto pillows or sheets/blankets during use. Also not sure if it&#x27;s from the toys I am using or this lube but it does leave one kind of sticky but that can be fixed by other having a small spray battle with water on hand to spray on yourself or your toy to bring the lube &#x27;back to life&#x27; or applying a very small amount of more of this lube. When it&#x27;s been warmed up it reminds me of the Astroglide Lube which is a lube I have found to be really runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity 4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely one of the longer lasting lubes I have used but make sure you turn off any fans in your room or where ever you may use it. It will dry out rather quickly if you have a ceiling fan on or a corded fan circulating air in the room. It will still last for a good 10-15 minutes if you do leave/have fans on in the room. I have found that with allfans off the lube can easily last 30 minutes with out needing to be &#x27;rejuvenated&#x27; or reapplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottle 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like the bottle this lube comes in but the pump that comes in it annoys the heck out of me due to the fact that in order to lock it in place you have to fully decompress the pump lever than twist it to get it to the &#x27;closed/locked&#x27; position in order to store it. This may not be an issue for people willing/able to store it in the open or in a bathroom under the sink or in other tall places. But if you want to store it a drawer or lay it on it&#x27;s sides rather than standing up than you need to have it in the locked position as I have found that the lube will leak out of it when the pump lever is extended and not locked/closed. Also after opening it form the &#x27;closed/locked&#x27; pump state the entire thing shaft of the lever that pops up out of the pump is covered in a fair bit of lube which seems kind of wasteful to me. Not sure if I just got a badly built pump/lever or not but this is the main reason for this getting a 3/5, 2 stars for 2 grievances, I figure is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of anything else to comment about, any questions feel free to ask.</li>
            <li> This product works very well to make my partner comfortable for doing the deed. It doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly and is also latex compatible. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensual massage, but it is great for any other intimate act. It washes off easily too. I rate it highly because it is also great for less conventional intimacy. I think that is the most polite way I can phrase that without giving it away... But the important thing to say here is that this is a quality product for lubricant needs and comes with a convenient pump. Use it and use it often- she will thank you.</li>
            <li> works.  doesnt dry out.  not tacky.</li>
            <li> We have enjoyed slippery stuff! And are ready to buy our second bottle!!! Very satisfied. It does dry. And can get tack if you apply a lot. But it typically drys and is easy to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have enjoyed it a lot!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully slick with real staying power - doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; so many do.</li>
            <li> Slick and fun without being sticky or slimy feeling! The gel is great. It is a touch thicker than the original, but it stays where you put it rather than dribbling off! Been using for years, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or rashes even on freshly shaved skin!</li>
            <li> Really slick,  non sticky, good stuff.</li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as we like, but nice and slippery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Slippery Stuff for the past 5 years and am convinced it is the superior sexual lubricant. Non-oily, non-irritating and lubricates better than anything on the market that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> This is the best water based lube we have ever tried. Great for anal or vaginal. Doesn&#x27;t have a taste or film if you get it in your mouth. We love that slippery stuff!! &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Best lube we have ever tried....would highly recommend as it does not dry out very quickly</li>
            <li> Should come with a reusable applicator.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff! It works great, not sticky, and easy to clean up. It is also a great value, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
