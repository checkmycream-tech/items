    <ol>
            <li>If you like transparent looking color its perfect.</li>
            <li>Very good lipstick!!!!</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Love them and deff recommend them!</li>
            <li>I just love the kleancolor lipstick they are so good</li>
            <li>Love Catalina</li>
            <li>but I wish it had better pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Really love these colors they really stand out but honestly do need a primer to use with these!</li>
            <li>Delivered as expected colors are marvelous!!</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t get the free earrings</li>
            <li>But it still wipes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on purchasing cheap lipstick and thats exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I love the new lipstick but one of Them was broke.</li>
            <li>But besides the white, I do still love the others.</li>
            <li>My only problem with these lipsticks was that the black didn&#x27;t work I was surprised to see the white worked perfectly</li>
            <li>Before I applied the other colors I added a layer of eye liner on my lips, the same color, to  fill it in better and that worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>They do all have the matte look, but they are probably a little better suited for people with lighter colored lips.</li>
            <li>but I did not receive the free gift that they said would come along with it other than that I would recommend the product to anyone</li>
            <li>Not really the matte texture and like most it requires constant applying.</li>
            <li>Only some apply real well!</li>
            <li>Only the greyish one comes out opaque, the rest not so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick enough.</li>

            <li> The white is weak but the dark colors are a success when added heavily</li>
            <li> but the black didn&#x27;t really show up unless i applied it harder to the point where it kind of hurt which made me sad since I really wanted the black to work :(</li>
            <li> I already was taking a risk by getting these crazy colors (the blue and black set), but they don&#x27;t all go on opaque enough to make the bold statement that they&#x27;re intended to make.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is small and has a long lasting wear</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> I love the new lipstick but one of Them was broke.</li>
            <li> It depends on the color! Only some apply real well! Love Catalina</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting what you paid for. I took a chance on purchasing cheap lipstick and thats exactly what I got. Applying this lipstick is like trying to color with a dry erase marker on a dry erase board. You know how if you go over a line it erases itself a bit? Thats what it does. The colors are beautiful but I wish it had better pigmentation. If you like transparent looking color its perfect. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t. And well since I used it I was stuck with it. Can&#x27;t return used makeup.</li>
            <li> Very good lipstick!!!! will buy again...</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Only the greyish one comes out opaque, the rest not so much. Before I applied the other colors I added a layer of eye liner on my lips, the same color, to  fill it in better and that worked pretty well. But it still wipes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> The white doesn&#x27;t go on too well. It&#x27;s not thick enough. The gray color is matte while the others are kinda glossy. But besides the white, I do still love the others.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be matte enough for me.</li>
            <li> I just love the kleancolor lipstick they are so good</li>
            <li> The lipstick is small and has a long lasting wear but I did not receive the free gift that they said would come along with it other than that I would recommend the product to anyone</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected colors are marvelous!!</li>
            <li> Really cheap colors that apply thinly (Don&#x27;t fully cover lips) and three of the lipsticks came smashed upon delivery.</li>
            <li> I already was taking a risk by getting these crazy colors (the blue and black set), but they don&#x27;t all go on opaque enough to make the bold statement that they&#x27;re intended to make.

            <li> Good but didn&#x27;t get the free earrings</li>
            <li> these were not matte and when on almost sheer. they were not opaque at all and I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My only problem with these lipsticks was that the black didn&#x27;t work I was surprised to see the white worked perfectly but the black didn&#x27;t really show up unless i applied it harder to the point where it kind of hurt which made me sad since I really wanted the black to work :(</li>
