            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>It is remarkable for the care of one&#x27;s skin.</li>

            <li>I bought 6 jars of it and it REALLY smells horrid!!  </li>
            <li>I started using this hand cream a long time ago and love it!</li>

            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I am sure i am not the only one.</li>
            <li>Have been using for 40 yeawrs and hve found nothing which equals the positive effect.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better for chronically dry hands.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;d wipe a dab from an empty jar each night waiting to get some more.</li>
            <li>and I know many nail techs who won&#x27;t due a manicure without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin and has a very slight \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to all.</li>
            <li>highly recommend Balm Barr.</li>
            <li>Nurses working in the newborn nursery washed their hands many times an hour with a harsh anti-bacterial soap.</li>
            <li>We have had trouble finding it but was able to order online.  </li>

            <li>My wife and I have used Balm Barr for too many years to remember and take it above any other cream.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that after two days my hands were healing and actually soft!</li>
            <li>My friend told me about this, but she hadn&#x27;t been able to find it lately.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for nearly fifty years.  </li>
            <li>Balm Barr helped keep their hands soft and moist.</li>
            <li>My Mother used Balm Barr before I was born and I am 77 years young.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have frequently given a gift of Balm Barr to my Diabetic patients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesnt feel, smell or work like the old stuff in the magenta jar.  </li>
            <li>My grandma always used Balm Barr and I came across an old bottle of hers.</li>
            <li>Over the years, my mom has never been without a container of Balm Barr, uses it every night before bed, even though she&#x27;s had to special order it for thirty years from the last tiny independent drug store in town.</li>
            <li>I have used the old one for many, many years, and I am so disappointed that the manufacturer decided to change.</li>
            <li>No other lotion works as well as Balm Barr!</li>
            <li>Rough red skin such as hands enjoy the comfort received by Balm Barr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last order came in the new packaging.  </li>
            <li>It lasts so much longer than even the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>but apparently they have messed with the formula.  </li>
            <li>I still use Balm Barr occasionally simply because it makes my garden or cleaning for company hands that &#x27;feel like boards&#x27; feel soft again, healed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that really helps my husbands dry skin patches.  </li>

            <li> I ended up ordering a whole box of the stuff for myself and will never use any other lotion as long as I can get my hands on balm Barr!!!</li>
            <li> Neither of us developed stretch marks due to the help of the moisturizing creme.</li>
            <li> Cracked, red, dry.</li>
            <li> This product with the green lid and label is not the same as the old one with the purple label.  </li>
            <li> We were buying in large quantities (at least 6 jars per order).  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> I have tried every other lotion on the market, but I keep coming back to my Balm Barr.</li>
            <li> Relieves pain due to the softening of the sole tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well the purple has morphed into magenta, and it seems to contain far less lanolin, and the scent has changed a bit, it&#x27;s less dense</li>
            <li> It heals my chapped, dry hands overnight!</li>
            <li> It has lanolin in it which differentiates it from other creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna know the ingredients because practically nothing else in my house has parabens or methyls and other unpronounceable ingredients, which I suspect this may have.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have used it year round</li>
            <li> My hands are always desperate for moisture and very chapped!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this stuff since she was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> Wonder what was missing in our diets then?</li>
            <li> The lotion is so old that it stinks....</li>
            <li> I was out of my usual lotion</li>
            <li> Still, it has lanolin, hard to find nowadays, and healing like nothing</li>
            <li> It works like the Balm Barr I&#x27;m used to, but WOW, it stinks!  </li>
            <li> Hard to find tho!!!</li>
            <li> We are grateful for Amazon because it has become very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> They now have added a HORRIBLE  perfume to it that stinks  and have also doubled the price.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, smells like urine.</li>
            <li> and my hands still looked and felt dreadful.</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t the same as my mother&#x27;s which she used every day.  The smell is horrible, smells like urine.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this, but she hadn&#x27;t been able to find it lately.  I looked on Amazon where I always look first and voila!  There is was.  It has lanolin in it which differentiates it from other creams and lotions.  It&#x27;s great for dry skin and has a very slight \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li> The lotion is so old that it stinks....we can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for as long as I can remember and I was thrilled when it was available from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for nearly fifty years.  There is nothing better for chronically dry hands.  We are grateful for Amazon because it has become very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Recommended by an aunt who has used it for many, many years and couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  I ordered for her and decided to buy one for myself.  Very light creme and works very well to keep my hands soft.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> My mother used this product when I was growing up and I know many nail techs who won&#x27;t due a manicure without it. I use it at night and slather my hands to allow it to just soak in.</li>
            <li> I am perhaps Balm Barr&#x27;s best customer, having used it every day of my life for 40 years!  I have very dry skin and have used it year round and it was the only cream that worked--not greasy and lasted on my skin.  It was a great product, made with lanolin in it but not greasy.  Wonderful in summer and winter.  They now have added a HORRIBLE  perfume to it that stinks  and have also doubled the price.  I would begrudging pay the price but apparently they have messed with the formula.  The 3 jars I ordered that have this new label are sitting in my linen closet until I can donate them to a shelter.</li>
            <li> It is the same wonderful cream I remember using as a young woman in Chicago. It heals my chapped, dry hands overnight! I&#x27;m so glad I found it again! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> My mother heard about Balm Barr from her farmer sister in law and began using this in the 1940&#x27;s, when it came in a glass jar with a painted metal purple lid. Well the purple has morphed into magenta, and it seems to contain far less lanolin, and the scent has changed a bit, it&#x27;s less dense, it&#x27;s now in plastic sigh, but it still WORKS. I don&#x27;t wanna know the ingredients because practically nothing else in my house has parabens or methyls and other unpronounceable ingredients, which I suspect this may have. Still, it has lanolin, hard to find nowadays, and healing like nothing manmade can. I still use Balm Barr occasionally simply because it makes my garden or cleaning for company hands that &#x27;feel like boards&#x27; feel soft again, healed. Back to the 50&#x27;s - my sister and I grew up sneaking into our parents room and eating mom&#x27;s Balm Barr, like school paste. Wonder what was missing in our diets then? Over the years, my mom has never been without a container of Balm Barr, uses it every night before bed, even though she&#x27;s had to special order it for thirty years from the last tiny independent drug store in town. She&#x27;d wipe a dab from an empty jar each night waiting to get some more. She&#x27;s going to be 92 next week. Wait&#x27;ll I tell her I found Balm Barr on amazon!</li>
            <li> Its too greasy -I prefer it without the Lanolin</li>
            <li> I bought 6 jars of it and it REALLY smells horrid!!  It works like the Balm Barr I&#x27;m used to, but WOW, it stinks!  Like a barnyard!  I was really disappointed!</li>
            <li> No other lotion works as well as Balm Barr! I have tried every other lotion on the market, but I keep coming back to my Balm Barr. It lasts so much longer than even the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing cream I have ever used - espically thru the dry winter months here in Texas.  Highly recommended to all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme for many years. I started using this product in the 1960&#x27;s when I was a nursing student. Nurses working in the newborn nursery washed their hands many times an hour with a harsh anti-bacterial soap. Balm Barr helped keep their hands soft and moist. Both my niece and I used Balm Barr on our pregnant tummies (she had 2 pregnancies and used it both times). Neither of us developed stretch marks due to the help of the moisturizing creme. I can&#x27;t say that it would work for everyone, but it worked for 2 people and I can verify that.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Balm Barr. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used Balm Barr all my life. My Mother used Balm Barr before I was born and I am 77 years young. I am a Registered Nurse and a Certified Diabetic Instructor. I encourage the students to use Balm Barr cream. Especially on Diabetic feet. It moisturizes and softens the crusty soles of most Diabetic feet. Relieves pain due to the softening of the sole tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frequently given a gift of Balm Barr to my Diabetic patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Insulin Dependent Diabetic. I apply Balm Barr to my feet twice daily. It is remarkable for the care of one&#x27;s skin. Rough red skin such as hands enjoy the comfort received by Balm Barr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna Hanesford, RN</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this stuff since she was a little girl.  We have had trouble finding it but was able to order online.  We were buying in large quantities (at least 6 jars per order).  My last order came in the new packaging.  i was hoping the contents had not changed as well, but to my surprise it has.  it doesnt feel, smell or work like the old stuff in the magenta jar.  I am so disapointed.  I am sure i am not the only one.</li>
            <li> This product with the green lid and label is not the same as the old one with the purple label.  The formula is not the same.  The odor is offensive.  I have used the old one for many, many years, and I am so disappointed that the manufacturer decided to change.</li>
            <li> I started using this hand cream a long time ago and love it! My mother loves it and my daughter, who is a hairdresser, says that it is the only cream that actually softens her hands!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that really helps my husbands dry skin patches.  This is a product we always have on hand.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used Balm Barr for too many years to remember and take it above any other cream.</li>
            <li> I love Balm Barr. I have a housefull of kids and no dishwasher. I also use cloth diapers instead of disposables. All of this adds up to a lot of dishes and a lot of scrubbing! My hands are always desperate for moisture and very chapped! Up until now I have tried every \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; healing product out there and my hands still looked and felt dreadful. Cracked, red, dry. My grandma always used Balm Barr and I came across an old bottle of hers. I was out of my usual lotion so I used it until i could get to the store. I was surprised to find that after two days my hands were healing and actually soft! Not only that but the effect lasted even when I used the lotion sparingly. I ended up ordering a whole box of the stuff for myself and will never use any other lotion as long as I can get my hands on balm Barr!!!</li>
            <li> An excellent moisturizing creme. Have been using for 40 yeawrs and hve found nothing which equals the positive effect.</li>
            <li> My mom has worn Balm Barr hand cream since the 1930s.  It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! Hard to find tho!!!</li>
