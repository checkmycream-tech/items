    <ol>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love these hair accessories!</li>
            <li>but once you figure it out it looks nice</li>
            <li>The piece fits very comfortably, just make sure you get the closest color to your hair</li>
            <li>A girly, girl will love doing hair styles with them.</li>
            <li>This product has about an 1/2 inch of velcro across the top and this pulls my hair.  </li>
            <li>What I love most about this product is that I don&#x27;t have to tease my hair or do anything but put the insert on and cover it with hair.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I do better jod with the com</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this product because of the velcro , but otherwise this would be a great product if you wanted to wear a high puff or up-do.</li>
            <li>Gives you a good lift -not too much.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love it it really works❤</li>
            <li>Very nice, much better than a hard plastic bump-it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to figure out, but I just wasn&#x27;t sure which side was for the front.  </li>
            <li>Right it got caught on my headbands and clothes.</li>
            <li>worth the money and does the job very well!</li>
            <li>I was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time.</li>
            <li>They are better than Bumpits but a far cry from the real thing.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this product because the instruction was not in English.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than a traditional bump it hair product.</li>
            <li>they should make it bigger and give more variety in colors.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, soft, stays in place, I really like it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s always flat on top.</li>
            <li>The reason I wanted to get these is because I thought it would not show as much as the plastic Bumpits</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin but this held my hair and stayed in place easily.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to take off, I just slide it down my hair.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than the hard plastic \\&quot;bump its\\&quot; you can find in the U.S.</li>
            <li>It really gives the natural looking, curvy volume to the back of the head.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected, but still useful.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, these are not going to give me the kind of poof</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the small one so far, the large one may be too big on my head.</li>

            <li> Received only one after a month, where is the other one?</li>
            <li> you feel like you will loose all your hair that is stick to the velcro.</li>
            <li> I use the small one of these to give extra lift/volume to my pony tail or bun.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this would work for a blonde.</li>
            <li> Of course you lose a few strands but that doesn&#x27;t bother me since I lose much more on a daily base just sitting around.  </li>
            <li> but then my hair is dark.</li>
            <li> It stays on quite well because of the velcro above and below the bun (noted that I usually use a little clip to style my hair half up).  </li>
            <li> Completely useless and a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am looking for because both of them are way too small.</li>
            <li> Will have to keep searching for sponges that are big enough. :(</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to use the instructions suck</li>
            <li> I was wrong and I wasted a few dollars on these things.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> but I ended up not using them because my hair is thin</li>
            <li> Bad thing is when you&#x27;re taking it down in the evening</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> It was flat as hell....... horrible product</li>
            <li> and it is so hard to hide them.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with these!</li>
            <li> It kept falling off and and it look ugly and werid</li>
            <li> These are awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A girly, girl will love doing hair styles with them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have enough hair to use it yet.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! worth the money and does the job very well!</li>
            <li> I love these hair accessories! They are much better than the hard plastic \\&quot;bump its\\&quot; you can find in the U.S. I use the small one of these to give extra lift/volume to my pony tail or bun. I have really thin hair that&#x27;s always flat on top. These make such a difference for me. I&#x27;ve only used the small one so far, the large one may be too big on my head.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> Very nice, much better than a hard plastic bump-it. My hair is very fine and thin but this held my hair and stayed in place easily. It din&#x27;t show but then my hair is dark. Not sure how this would work for a blonde.</li>
            <li> Received the item as shown in the picture. It was exactly what I expected. And it works. I like these a lot.</li>
            <li> Gives you a good lift -not too much. Bad thing is when you&#x27;re taking it down in the evening you feel like you will loose all your hair that is stick to the velcro.</li>
            <li> This product has about an 1/2 inch of velcro across the top and this pulls my hair.  I don&#x27;t like this product because of the velcro , but otherwise this would be a great product if you wanted to wear a high puff or up-do.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this product because the instruction was not in English.  It&#x27;s not hard to figure out, but I just wasn&#x27;t sure which side was for the front.  The answer is, the wider part is for the front.  Now to the product itself, it comes in 2 sizes.  I have only used the bigger one, which is really not that big at all but gives just enough of a bump and looks quite natural.  What I love most about this product is that I don&#x27;t have to tease my hair or do anything but put the insert on and cover it with hair.  It stays on quite well because of the velcro above and below the bun (noted that I usually use a little clip to style my hair half up).  It&#x27;s also easy to take off, I just slide it down my hair.  Of course you lose a few strands but that doesn&#x27;t bother me since I lose much more on a daily base just sitting around.  Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The piece fits very comfortably, just make sure you get the closest color to your hair color if you don&#x27;t want to use a lot of hair to cover it.</li>
            <li> i was dubious about the effectiveness of these buns, but after seeing them on my mother, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. It really gives the natural looking, curvy volume to the back of the head.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t expensive so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try...I was wrong and I wasted a few dollars on these things. They are better than Bumpits but a far cry from the real thing. Save your money for a comb and some hair spray.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to use the instructions suck but once you figure it out it looks nice just complicated need better explanation</li>
            <li> my niece loves these - learning how to style hair</li>
            <li> This is so much better than a traditional bump it hair product. Easy to use, soft, stays in place, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought these but I ended up not using them because my hair is thin and it is so hard to hide them.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. Right it got caught on my headbands and clothes. It kept falling off and and it look ugly and werid</li>
            <li> Completely useless. They slip out of your hair quicker than you can say, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m done&amp;#34;. Which by the way takes forever as well. Completely useless and a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great! Works well for me.</li>
            <li> seems to give my hair the lift with out looking to funky and stays in place</li>
            <li> Product was as described.  Works great. Shipment came earlier than estimated</li>
            <li> Love it it really works❤️</li>
            <li> These are awful. There&#x27;s no instructions. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give any pop to my hair. Kept falling out</li>
            <li> The bump didn&#x27;t work to bulky I do better jod with the com</li>
            <li> It was flat as hell....... horrible product</li>
            <li> I was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time. Unfortunately, these are not going to give me the kind of poof I am looking for because both of them are way too small. They do not compare to Bumpits, which I currently use. The reason I wanted to get these is because I thought it would not show as much as the plastic Bumpits and I thought it would give the same effect. These are not even big enough to give the effect the picture shows. A little disappointed with these! Will have to keep searching for sponges that are big enough. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected, but still useful.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work the way it should!  they should make it bigger and give more variety in colors.  I would not buy it again!</li>
            <li> Received only one after a month, where is the other one?</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t how to use it-</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as it was advertised to work</li>
