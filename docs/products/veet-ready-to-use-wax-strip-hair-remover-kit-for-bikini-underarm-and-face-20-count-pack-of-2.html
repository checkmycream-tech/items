            <li>Worked great!</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li>I WAS SO IMPRESSED.  </li>
            <li>they grab the best and work great for an at-home touch up.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>However, I found that the directions weren&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>and choose the correct places to use these, and you&#x27;ll be happy with the result.</li>
            <li>Great for eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>so great for bikini line.</li>
            <li>The strips work great</li>
            <li>However I contacted the seller and they were very courteous about the issue.</li>
            <li>after I did it, I pointed out my nakid lip to my man, Norman, and he said \\&quot;amazing!</li>
            <li>Works fairly well.</li>
            <li>Bought this product because I had a good experience with Veet Hair Removal Gel Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By virtue of the fact that the intention of this product is forcibly rip hair out of your body, it does hurt, but these do a great job</li>
            <li>Fair to good.....have used better, but travels well and for the price does a fair job.</li>
            <li>I honestly got more hair out trying to get the wax residue off then when I was using the strips!</li>
            <li>Just rub the strips between your hands to warm up the wax and then wax away.</li>
            <li>Is this a mosquito trap kind of like those mice traps where when they step on they get glued to it ?  </li>
            <li>This brand is typically good though however I strongly recommend using a hair removal cream rather than wax.</li>
            <li>Veet has the best wax strips I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for strong face hairs!</li>
            <li>, one more word on my mustache.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to rip so many times.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to the bikini area, but most of the time if just takes one strip per area to get the desired results.</li>
            <li>I suggest buying more finishing wipes tho.</li>
            <li>its nice and smooth..</li>
            <li>i think they are perfect for upper lips..</li>
            <li>My favorite waxing strips -</li>
            <li>and there, I think I&#x27;m better off just going to the salon.</li>
            <li>I will say it did an ok job at removing those &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but that is okay.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience and money i save from at home waxing...</li>

            <li>i think these work pretty good.</li>
            <li>but these are on a good backing material and actually pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li>Excited to wax (ouch!).</li>
            <li>I originally bought Celestial wax strips to try them out from the dollar store not expecting much, those ones were great.</li>
            <li>Price was good and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>but sum baby oil cleans it right off!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but, hey, it&#x27;s cheaper than a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not do underarms, shaving is easy.</li>
            <li>Easily removed the hair</li>
            <li>easy to do it yourself at home.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use &amp; you can do it yourself or get some help.</li>

            <li>like me, cheap &amp; easy,</li>
            <li>sure, it hurts, it&#x27;s a fun pain.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>It works really well, but you have to hear it with a hair dryer on a low setting to get the best results.</li>
            <li>and they also come with easy to use wipes for quick clean up.</li>

            <li>better than a fast rip of a band</li>
            <li>Might have been worth it if my legs were smooth, but nope.</li>
            <li>But the strips are good enough for the face waxing.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they work ok, could be better but ok.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>

            <li>I like the pre-waxed strips because they are easy to use and are not messy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt very much.</li>
            <li>, I got my box of Veet, first time here, tried to read directions - and the font</li>
            <li>is to RIP it off FAST!</li>
            <li>tried using these in a bunch of random places to see what they worked best for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used these on my leg first and followed the instructions.</li>
            <li>For what I use it for it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Like that I don&#x27;t have to heat them up first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time home waxer.</li>
            <li>- just remember to pull fast, ladies!</li>
            <li>But when I opened the first box...</li>
            <li>&amp; i was a first time waxer.</li>
            <li>After following the instructions that came with the product I have discovered that these strips stick more readily to the skin rather than to the hair...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every positive review is a shill.</li>
            <li>I stick them in the microwave for around half a minute or until they&#x27;re comfortably warm.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get all hairs in bikini area, but better than shaving or paying the big bucks for getting it professionally done!</li>
            <li>Got this product in the mail today tried it out, left me a huge bruise and no hair removal.</li>
            <li>Just rubbing it between your hands like the packaging says doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>you really needed that!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>residue sticks too your skin and doesnt really take off much hair</li>
            <li>it is really hurt, if you never used it before.</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>Just think it&#x27;s too much of a hassle I wish I never purchased it.</li>
            <li>It stings as much as waxing your eyebrows does.</li>
            <li>but the strips don&#x27;t really leave much residue.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re relatively cheap, can be taken anywhere, gets the job done, and beats having to drive someplace to get my upper lip waxed for $5+ and a tip!</li>
            <li>But it was very sticky and gooey.</li>
            <li>Had best luck on face area and found that cutting it to size was helpful.</li>
            <li>Never have I ever had this many regrets from using a product.</li>
            <li>THANKS, LYNDA IN LOUISIANA</li>
            <li>It does not have any real stick to it and really doesn&#x27;t remove hair well.</li>
            <li>It can not really be used more than once as advertized.</li>
            <li>The wide strips are good for inner thighs.</li>
            <li>so I thought they would be at least as good</li>
            <li>It works well enough and clean up isn&#x27;t a nightmare or anything</li>
            <li>It might make the strips not able to be re-used as many times but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>so small you need a gnome or 8 year old with good eyes to read it, so I gave up.</li>
            <li>and it is still hard to be precise since it isn&#x27;t easy to see WHERE the wax is on the strip, then I applied them going with the grain</li>
            <li>It was slightly messy but mostly hurt a lot.</li>
            <li>great little item and costs less than the salon for the waxing.</li>
            <li>I tried to use these this morning, and the wax doesn&#x27;t get warm enough rubbing them in your hands as per the instructions, I had to cut the strips way down</li>
            <li>left it red and sore, but, so smooth and</li>
            <li>I get really lazy about my upper lip and these are super convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used these wax strips for about 2 years now for my eyebrows, and actually, I cut the sheets (because they are so big) into 4 different strips that are a better size for the brow area.</li>
            <li>The other wax strips I can clean up my eyebrows in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how small the packages were when I got it and how many there were.</li>
            <li>had the large box form walgreen in the same price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though it says sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>In fairness, the oil hasn&#x27;t caused my somewhat sensitive skin any problems.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to just get it professionally done at the salon from now on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really hard to clean the wax!</li>
            <li>lol some of the reviews seem low just because its uncomfortable!</li>
            <li>I personally do not like that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair completely.</li>
            <li>the area with huge red bumps- need to wax at least 2-3 days before you expect anyone to see the area&lt;br /&gt;-Annoying cleanup-</li>
            <li>Since I only use it on my upper lip I cut the thicker strips in half getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, these do not work anything like hot wax.</li>
            <li>After following the instructions, not a single hair came along with the strip but men a lot of wax was left on my skin.</li>
            <li>Whole of the area around my lips became red and later turned black.</li>

            <li> and it is still hard to be precise since it isn&#x27;t easy to see WHERE the wax is on the strip, then I applied them going with the grain</li>
            <li> It was slightly messy but mostly hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> great little item and costs less than the salon for the waxing.</li>
            <li> I tried to use these this morning, and the wax doesn&#x27;t get warm enough rubbing them in your hands as per the instructions, I had to cut the strips way down</li>
            <li> left it red and sore, but, so smooth and</li>
            <li> I get really lazy about my upper lip and these are super convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used these wax strips for about 2 years now for my eyebrows, and actually, I cut the sheets (because they are so big) into 4 different strips that are a better size for the brow area.</li>
            <li> The other wax strips I can clean up my eyebrows in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how small the packages were when I got it and how many there were.</li>
            <li> had the large box form walgreen in the same price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though it says sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> In fairness, the oil hasn&#x27;t caused my somewhat sensitive skin any problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to just get it professionally done at the salon from now on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to clean the wax!</li>
            <li> lol some of the reviews seem low just because its uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> I personally do not like that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair completely.</li>
            <li> the area with huge red bumps- need to wax at least 2-3 days before you expect anyone to see the area&lt;br /&gt;-Annoying cleanup-</li>
            <li> Since I only use it on my upper lip I cut the thicker strips in half getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, these do not work anything like hot wax.</li>
            <li> After following the instructions, not a single hair came along with the strip but men a lot of wax was left on my skin.</li>
            <li> Whole of the area around my lips became red and later turned black.</li>
            <li> The only reason I took away one star is that I really don&#x27;t like having to use the oily stiff wipes to remove wax residue after use.  </li>
            <li> Not only are my legs left completely hairy, but I was left with a sticky mess on my legs even after carefully following the instructions.</li>
            <li> (how the hair grows), ripped them off fast and these pulled out very little hair and left a BUNCH of residue on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other brands and keep coming back to Veet because their extreme effectiveness keeps the unpleasantness of waxing to a minimum.</li>
            <li> the second hoc was the same, some strips were missing.</li>
            <li> I used a few times before and it left redness for a day or two, but last night I used it</li>
            <li> Starting from the center of my upper lip, smoothing it down a couple times, tighten my upper lip and pull the skin a little and just yank it off as close to the skin as I can.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it come in the small size and the same price of the big one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only half the amount of strips were there...</li>
            <li> They are a little bit bigger and easier to use, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it is the right size for those hard to reach places or hard to get waxed.</li>
            <li> (it was more painful than getting the tattoos that I</li>
            <li> You only get a few with the wax</li>
            <li> Have to go over area again if using same strip a few times</li>
            <li> Must be cleaned off with the finishing paper in this pack, but the pack only comes with a few pieces.</li>
            <li> I spent over an hour waxing about a square inch of skin</li>
            <li> the underarm strip is too small to cover the entire underarm air in one go.  </li>
            <li> My upper lip and chin feel so sticky and painful right now.</li>
            <li> some are very fine and blond, but, you know, ladies, once in a while you get that black ugly one, you feel for it when driving, and look in the mirror and YIKES!</li>
            <li> The sting and the slight redness fade in minutes.</li>
            <li> I think it makes all the difference in effectiveness, less wax residue remaining, less pain.</li>
            <li> Oh, and if you don&#x27;t already know this, use a little baby powder on your skin before waxing.  </li>
            <li> it can get a little sticky in ur fingers</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t messy like the microwave waxes or the wax I put in my little heater thing from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like using masking tape instead of duct tape don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> After I took it off no hair was removed but some wax was still left behind.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> As a college student trying to save a few pennies here</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier and less painful to just go in with a set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> And it gets messy using it in small parts over and over again.</li>
            <li> BOTH sides of the paper, after you peel it, and use it over and over till there ain&#x27;t no more on it.</li>
            <li> Sure its painful, but it gets the job done and for a fraction of what salons charge!!</li>
            <li> no more going to salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is up with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of these strips in the least bit.</li>
            <li> At least the wipes worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, whenever I tried to use it on my face, it removed none of the hairs and left behind a layer of sticky wax that was difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic and grow quite a bit of hair so it does leave a few behind which I pluck out no problem.</li>
            <li> yank that baby like you mean it.</li>
            <li> an, uh, ummm..., older woman - I get the annoying chin hairs that never were there before</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that my old wax was discontinued</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s just this ugly red mark</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to rub between your hands without it slipping around.</li>
            <li> Waxing is the worst but these strips make it so much easier.</li>
            <li> if not better, wrong!</li>
            <li> Its actually a little painful.</li>
            <li> 4 hours, still a bit sticky, really red and inflamed, and very very painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it did not show the volume which made me angry after receiving it so</li>
            <li> not perfect,</li>
            <li> the secret - pay attention!</li>
            <li> ill admit they can be a bit tricky but all the waxing products out there are</li>
            <li> hairs that may be a bit difficult to pluck, but for coarser hair</li>
            <li> gotta say its less painful then the salon waxing!</li>
            <li> too chicken to do bikini - eeeeeeee...</li>
            <li> Was hesitant about using premade strips because I&#x27;ve tried others years ago that were terrible and hard to use</li>
            <li> It hurt so badly.</li>
            <li> I purchased these strips for my bikini area trying to save money by not going to the salon, however in the end this turned out to be so extremely painful that I could not continue</li>
            <li> painful- could not finish the waxing&lt;br /&gt;-Left</li>
            <li> Just hate cleaning up the wax and the feel of any leftover wax is very uncomfortable and sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible</li>
            <li> The worst mistake I ever made was buying this.</li>
            <li> These were awful!</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible product.</li>
            <li> Horrible Product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works really well, but you have to hear it with a hair dryer on a low setting to get the best results. Just rubbing it between your hands like the packaging says doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> Got this product in the mail today tried it out, left me a huge bruise and no hair removal. not going to buy this product again</li>
            <li> This product is terrible it&#x27;s like using masking tape instead of duct tape don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t get all hairs in bikini area, but better than shaving or paying the big bucks for getting it professionally done! The wide strips are good for inner thighs. Have to cut the strips to use for bikini area. Doesn&#x27;t hurt very much.</li>
            <li> the underarm strip is too small to cover the entire underarm air in one go.  And it gets messy using it in small parts over and over again.</li>
            <li> Veet has the best wax strips I&#x27;ve found so far. They are the most effective for coarse hair and they also come with easy to use wipes for quick clean up.</li>
            <li> Ripped of a chuck a of my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take off any hair.</li>
            <li> Rash. Even though it says sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I personally do not like that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair completely. Its actually a little painful. Price was good and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> do not buy this one&lt;br /&gt;it come in the small size and the same price of the big one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the large box form walgreen in the same price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it did not show the volume which made me angry after receiving it so I has to returned back</li>
            <li> These work really well, but the key to the most effective use is to exfoliate well beforehand and to follow the directions in the pamphlet if you have never used a product like this before.</li>
            <li> like me, cheap &amp; easy, but, they do a job. not perfect, but, hey, it&#x27;s cheaper than a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not do underarms, shaving is easy. legs? no. too chicken to do bikini - eeeeeeee... maybe someday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my chin and mustache.  yes, upper lip - left it red and sore, but, so smooth and nakid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as an, uh, ummm..., older woman - I get the annoying chin hairs that never were there before, some grow 6 inches overnight, and can be embarrassing! I have been searching and plucking for the last 10 years. daily. hourly. some are very fine and blond, but, you know, ladies, once in a while you get that black ugly one, you feel for it when driving, and look in the mirror and YIKES! it is scary!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, I got my box of Veet, first time here, tried to read directions - and the font so small you need a gnome or 8 year old with good eyes to read it, so I gave up. I got the part about warming it in your hands and went from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use BOTH sides of the paper, after you peel it, and use it over and over till there ain&#x27;t no more on it. the secret - pay attention! is to RIP it off FAST! yank that baby like you mean it. sure, it hurts, it&#x27;s a fun pain. better than a fast rip of a band aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, a couple hairs were so stout and stubborn I had to tweezer &#x27;em after. oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, one more word on my mustache. after I did it, I pointed out my nakid lip to my man, Norman, and he said \\&quot;amazing! you really needed that!\\&quot; men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy ripping, ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SS</li>
            <li> The worst mistake I ever made was buying this. Not only are my legs left completely hairy, but I was left with a sticky mess on my legs even after carefully following the instructions. It took nail polish remover and baby oil and 20 minutes of my time to finally get it off. Might have been worth it if my legs were smooth, but nope. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> residue sticks too your skin and doesnt really take off much hair</li>
            <li> Waxing is the worst but these strips make it so much easier. I&#x27;ve tried various other brands and keep coming back to Veet because their extreme effectiveness keeps the unpleasantness of waxing to a minimum. By virtue of the fact that the intention of this product is forcibly rip hair out of your body, it does hurt, but these do a great job so you don&#x27;t have to rip so many times. I only use these on my face (upper lip, between the brows, and the occasional wily chin hair) so I can&#x27;t speak to the bikini area, but most of the time if just takes one strip per area to get the desired results. These are my go-to and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> ....Of course it hurts. Its waxing! lol some of the reviews seem low just because its uncomfortable! These work great! I used them on my bikini area for summer time and would always do it at night so I wasn&#x27;t too red for the morning. Sure its painful, but it gets the job done and for a fraction of what salons charge!! I suggest buying more finishing wipes tho. You only get a few with the wax but they are a must post ripping! Soothes and cleans up all of the excess wax</li>
            <li> it is really hurt, if you never used it before. Then, never try it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s really hard to clean the wax!</li>
            <li> i think these work pretty good. ill admit they can be a bit tricky but all the waxing products out there are but i tried these on my upperlips and although painfull (like all waxing) it only last a second and its nice and smooth..i think they are perfect for upper lips..but i used them for my eyebrows and they worked well however it was tricky to get the right angle but i like how you can use these over and over so all in all i like this for my lips and i would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> great little item and costs less than the salon for the waxing.</li>
            <li> These are great. They aren&#x27;t messy like the microwave waxes or the wax I put in my little heater thing from Sally&#x27;s. However, I found that the directions weren&#x27;t all that great. Warming the strips in your hands didn&#x27;t work well for me. I actually will use my hair drier on them on the low setting for 5 seconds on each side of the strip before I pull them apart. It works *really* well that way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using these in a bunch of random places to see what they worked best for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES:&lt;br /&gt;face, finer bikini hairs, hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO:&lt;br /&gt;thicker bikini hairs, underarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick and choose the correct places to use these, and you&#x27;ll be happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Fair to good.....have used better, but travels well and for the price does a fair job.</li>
            <li> Great for eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;Not so great for bikini line.</li>
            <li> My favorite waxing strips - they grab the best and work great for an at-home touch up.</li>
            <li> no more going to salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> I used these on my leg first and followed the instructions. It was slightly messy but mostly hurt a lot. After I took it off no hair was removed but some wax was still left behind. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I didn&#x27;t like it. This brand is typically good though however I strongly recommend using a hair removal cream rather than wax.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, these do not work anything like hot wax. Used twice and they still did not get the hair.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  Just think it&#x27;s too much of a hassle I wish I never purchased it.</li>
            <li> I only use these on my upper lip hair. I&#x27;ve never tried it anywhere else on my body. For what I use it for it works pretty well. I get really lazy about my upper lip and these are super convenient and easy to use. I stick them in the microwave for around half a minute or until they&#x27;re comfortably warm. Starting from the center of my upper lip, smoothing it down a couple times, tighten my upper lip and pull the skin a little and just yank it off as close to the skin as I can. I&#x27;m Hispanic and grow quite a bit of hair so it does leave a few behind which I pluck out no problem. I don&#x27;t see how this would work on underarms or bikini area so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those areas. Since I only use it on my upper lip I cut the thicker strips in half getting my money&#x27;s worth. It stings as much as waxing your eyebrows does. The sting and the slight redness fade in minutes. I&#x27;ve used the oil if I&#x27;m in a rush but the strips don&#x27;t really leave much residue. I buy them for convenience. They&#x27;re relatively cheap, can be taken anywhere, gets the job done, and beats having to drive someplace to get my upper lip waxed for $5+ and a tip!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of these strips in the least bit. Had to use 3 separate sets of strips to get any results. As a college student trying to save a few pennies here and there, I think I&#x27;m better off just going to the salon. Was using it for chin hairs and after 3 sets of strips over the course of 2 days, I still had to  go back and pluck the unsightly thicker hairs. I will say it did an ok job at removing those &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; hairs that may be a bit difficult to pluck, but for coarser hair it&#x27;s much easier and less painful to just go in with a set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that my old wax was discontinued (Nair Microwave Peach Melon Sugar Wax).  Tried this as a replacement.  Relieved to find that this will be acceptable and I will continue to buy it.  Pretty effective.  Have to go over area again if using same strip a few times but that is okay.  Was hesitant about using premade strips because I&#x27;ve tried others years ago that were terrible and hard to use but these are on a good backing material and actually pretty convenient.  Like that I don&#x27;t have to heat them up first.  The only reason I took away one star is that I really don&#x27;t like having to use the oily stiff wipes to remove wax residue after use.  It works well enough and clean up isn&#x27;t a nightmare or anything but I just don&#x27;t care for the oiliness, nor the wipes&#x27; stiffness.  In fairness, the oil hasn&#x27;t caused my somewhat sensitive skin any problems.  Oh, and if you don&#x27;t already know this, use a little baby powder on your skin before waxing.  It might make the strips not able to be re-used as many times but it&#x27;s worth it.  I think it makes all the difference in effectiveness, less wax residue remaining, less pain.</li>
            <li> These were awful! I originally bought Celestial wax strips to try them out from the dollar store not expecting much, those ones were great. Veet is more expensive and a brand name so I thought they would be at least as good if not better, wrong! The other wax strips I can clean up my eyebrows in under 5 minutes. I tried to use these this morning, and the wax doesn&#x27;t get warm enough rubbing them in your hands as per the instructions, I had to cut the strips way down and it is still hard to be precise since it isn&#x27;t easy to see WHERE the wax is on the strip, then I applied them going with the grain (how the hair grows), ripped them off fast and these pulled out very little hair and left a BUNCH of residue on my face. Veet includes finishing wipes which you MUST use to get the residue off. I honestly got more hair out trying to get the wax residue off then when I was using the strips! I&#x27;m gong to stick to the dollar store wax strips!</li>
            <li> Awful product. Claims to &amp;#34;act like a liquid&amp;#34;, whatever that means. Grabbed maybe a couple hairs and that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s not that it hurt, I&#x27;ve been waxed before. It&#x27;s that it just didn&#x27;t even work right. It&#x27;s impossible to rub between your hands without it slipping around. I tried the microwave instead. I tried the bikini and the underarm. Now I&#x27;m covered in red bumps.  I&#x27;m going to just get it professionally done at the salon from now on. At least the wipes worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every positive review is a shill. Terrible, terrible product.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience and money i save from at home waxing... it can get a little sticky in ur fingers but sum baby oil cleans it right off!! gotta say its less painful then the salon waxing! don&#x27;t kno why.. but thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Works fairly well. Just hate cleaning up the wax and the feel of any leftover wax is very uncomfortable and sticky. Can&#x27;t even wash it off with alcohol or water. Must be cleaned off with the finishing paper in this pack, but the pack only comes with a few pieces.</li>
            <li> I like these a bit better than the Sally Hanson&#x27;s strips. They are a little bit bigger and easier to use, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly. But it was very sticky and gooey. It left a ton of sticky gel on my skin, I had to do it several times before it removed about 10 hairs. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because I had a good experience with Veet Hair Removal Gel Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, whenever I tried to use it on my face, it removed none of the hairs and left behind a layer of sticky wax that was difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I have used these wax strips for about 2 years now for my eyebrows, and actually, I cut the sheets (because they are so big) into 4 different strips that are a better size for the brow area. They are effects and painless! Love them....</li>
            <li> Leaves wax residue that the cloth included doesn&#x27;t clean off. Other than that, they work ok, could be better but ok.</li>
            <li> After following the instructions that came with the product I have discovered that these strips stick more readily to the skin rather than to the hair...&lt;br /&gt;I guess I have to look for another product, that works.</li>
            <li> Works well for the areas that are intended to be worked on. Had best luck on face area and found that cutting it to size was helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time home waxer. I used the strips on my upper lip, eyebrow, and bikini line. Worked great! Easily removed the hair - just remember to pull fast, ladies! Relatively painless in comparison to plucking each hair. Came with wipes that removed leftover wax.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of trial between NADs and Veet body wax strips, Veet wins. Comparatively strips pick up more hair and seem to pick up shorter hair as well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up longer finer hair though, could just be me. I like the pre-waxed strips because they are easy to use and are not messy. Just rub the strips between your hands to warm up the wax and then wax away.</li>
            <li> Ouch. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been saying all day since I&#x27;ve tried this product. My upper lip and chin feel so sticky and painful right now. Wanted to buy this so I can avoid a trip to the spa to get waxed. Never have I ever had this many regrets from using a product. 4 hours, still a bit sticky, really red and inflamed, and very very painful. Cheap but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> However this product is kind of OK for underarm, but i do not recommend it for upper lips.&lt;br /&gt;Once i used on my upper lips, it peeled off my skin. It hurt so badly. Whole of the area around my lips became red and later turned black. I could not open my mouth for days and also faced difficulty in eating. I won&#x27;t ever use this product to wax my upper lips again.</li>
            <li> I received the package and I as excited to start... Yes! Excited to wax (ouch!). But when I opened the first box... Only half the amount of strips were there...the second hoc was the same, some strips were missing. However I contacted the seller and they were very courteous about the issue. They said that they would send out a replacement immediately(still awaiting).</li>
            <li> I purchased these strips for my bikini area trying to save money by not going to the salon, however in the end this turned out to be so extremely painful that I could not continue (it was more painful than getting the tattoos that I have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Low price&lt;br /&gt;-No need to microwave or heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely painful- could not finish the waxing&lt;br /&gt;-Left the area with huge red bumps- need to wax at least 2-3 days before you expect anyone to see the area&lt;br /&gt;-Annoying cleanup- super sticky!&lt;br /&gt;-Time consuming- I spent over an hour waxing about a square inch of skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is up with it. I used a few times before and it left redness for a day or two, but last night I used it and it made my upper lip break out. Again this never happened before and I did the same method as I always have. Now it&#x27;s been 2 days and the redness is still there and it did burn for awhile, but now it&#x27;s just this ugly red mark and it was itching now it&#x27;s just drying out. This is just my personal opinion and my personal experience. Everyone is different, but I figured I would share my story to hopefully help someone.</li>
            <li> NO MUSS &amp; NO FUSS! THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT! I WAS SO IMPRESSED.  I&#x27;LL REORDER&lt;br /&gt;THIS WHEN MY SUPPLY IS ALL USED UP. THANKS, LYNDA IN LOUISIANA</li>
            <li> This product skimps on the wax. It does not have any real stick to it and really doesn&#x27;t remove hair well. It can not really be used more than once as advertized.</li>
            <li> This wax kit is especially designed for the  upper lip and face, I&#x27;ve not used it for underarms. But the strips are good enough for the face waxing. Not recommended for strong face hairs!</li>
            <li> wastage of time and effort and money</li>
            <li> I chose it because of the amout of waxing strips it brought I was surprised how small the packages were when I got it and how many there were. The strips work great</li>
            <li> Horrible Product. Ended up sticky and red all over</li>
            <li> Is this a mosquito trap kind of like those mice traps where when they step on they get glued to it ?  After following the instructions, not a single hair came along with the strip but men a lot of wax was left on my skin. I wanted to go out and see how many mosquitos could get using this a a trap....</li>
            <li> it is the right size for those hard to reach places or hard to get waxed. easy to do it yourself at home. I have been using Veet wax for about 6 months now &amp; i was a first time waxer. it&#x27;s easy to use &amp; you can do it yourself or get some help.</li>
