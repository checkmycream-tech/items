            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced this color&lt;</li>
            <li>And I love the finish, not too matt, and not too shiny, a perfect blend.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not to bright on the lips</li>

            <li>I love the tube!</li>
            <li>The color would be ok, but IT HAS GLITTER IN IT!</li>
            <li>but once i put it on my lips, i fell in love!</li>
            <li>I love the tube!</li>
            <li>Honestly I will say I doubted this product</li>
            <li>Color is perfect for a nice, natural look.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not terrible when the texture and shade are so nice.</li>
            <li>and I love the color. :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick bc</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>It lasts more than eight hours for me.</li>
            <li>I love this color for spring and summer.  </li>
            <li>Recieved on time love the color</li>
            <li>so I have to put it on a certain way to make it look good on my lips.</li>
            <li>so I have to put it on a certain way to make it look  good on my lips.</li>
            <li>This shade of pink is perfect, just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun, playful color, though, for date night or the weekends, and it has nice pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>I have medium to fair skin and brown eyes, so I normally stay with warmer colors.  </li>
            <li>So you might use it up quickly!</li>
            <li>This is a very moist silky lipstick with a nice satin finish.</li>
            <li>i really cant complain like i said i love the color tho..</li>
            <li>I like this color a lot; it&#x27;s a light pink that is good for cool skin tones.  </li>
            <li>My personal opinion Its better then spending 25 dollars on some mac lipstick!</li>
            <li>So pretty!  </li>
            <li>It has moisture like a lip balm, but gives you this gorgeous pink color.</li>
            <li>Disco Pink is absolutely the most perfect pink I have found for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I am glad to have it for when I want this medium light pink sp arkle.</li>
            <li>but I am glad to have it for when I want this medium light pink sp arkle.</li>
            <li>I love buying new pink lipsticks in the spring and had read good things about these new Maybelline High Shine shades; even though it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve tried Maybelline lipsticks, I thought I&#x27;d try one out.  </li>
            <li>This color did not work for me its more of a teen look.  </li>
            <li>More sheer than a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>My sister with blue eyes looks better in cooler colors.  </li>
            <li>It has a hint of purple color on my skin (which is the color of hot chocolate).</li>
            <li>It was more shinier and not really as solid as I thought it would be, even though it still works.</li>
            <li>and they said sometimes the stick rolls up and hits the top during the postal cycle which to me is pretty much a total bummer.</li>
            <li>I loved the color of this lipstick but the glitter in it is a bit excessive....</li>
            <li>The lipstick container had scratches around it and the lipstick itself was not pointed like brand new lipsticks are!!</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a beautiful soft pink</li>
            <li>It actually moistens the lips a little, It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>was fast, I think deserves 5 ​​stars</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The lipstick came on time and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of this Maybelline line of lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>My local Ulta didn&#x27;t have very many in stock, so I took a chance by ordering this color (Disco Pink) on Amazon, based on some swatches I had seen on Makeup Alley.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very natural looking aside from said glitter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>It is a true pink but not harsh.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a nice pink lipstick, since I usually stick to corals and reds.</li>
            <li>Goes on very creamy and lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is that it is normal, moisturizing lipstick, and does not last.  </li>
            <li>but if you use a lip liner to shade in your lips prior and coat it with a little gloss it really isn&#x27;t that noticeable</li>

            <li> It gives irritation and you have too put it on alot of times plus the colors too shiny</li>
            <li> I love the tube! I like the color its a bit too sparkly so I have to put it on a certain way to make it look good on my lips. This color for me is not an everyday type of color but I am glad to have it for when I want this medium light pink sp arkle. It is disco pink so expect a party on your lips!</li>
            <li> This color did not work for me its more of a teen look.  Plus it is also glittery or shimmery which I am not fond of.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice pink lipstick, since I usually stick to corals and reds. No. The color would be ok, but IT HAS GLITTER IN IT! I spent forever trying to scrub glitter off my lips. If you don&#x27;t want GLITTERY LIPS, do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Good stuff here. It actually moistens the lips a little, It&#x27;s a great product and I love the color. :)</li>

            <li> I love this lipstick bc it&#x27;s not to bright on the lips but I don&#x27;t like is the glittery it has but I don&#x27;t mind on it . Overall it&#x27;s a beautiful soft pink</li>
            <li> So glad to find this on Amazon, as I have been unable to find this color in stores anymore.  This is a very moist silky lipstick with a nice satin finish. More sheer than a matte finish.  Disco Pink is absolutely the most perfect pink I have found for my skin tone.  It is a true pink but not harsh.  When the  finish wears off, the color remains, almost like it has a stain base.  I have medium to fair skin and brown eyes, so I normally stay with warmer colors.  My sister with blue eyes looks better in cooler colors.  Both of us can wear this shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced this color&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautiful, I love pinks much&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, I think deserves 5 ​​stars&lt;br /&gt;I did not see where anything negative you can experience and judgment in that</li>
            <li> This is a sort of glittery chapstick. It has a hint of purple color on my skin (which is the color of hot chocolate). It is very moisturizing. If a glittery chapstick is what you are looking for, look no further. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was more shinier and not really as solid as I thought it would be, even though it still works.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, when I received this lipstick it looked USED!!! The lipstick container had scratches around it and the lipstick itself was not pointed like brand new lipsticks are!! Trashed it!</li>
            <li> Only thing is, it doesn&#x27;t stay on long. Have to reapply often. Color is perfect for a nice, natural look.</li>
            <li> I love the tube! I like the color its a bit too sparkly so I have to put it on a certain way to make it look  good on my lips.

The lipstick came on time and I absolutely adore it. It lasts more than eight hours for me. Very much worth the price. I&#x27;ll be buying again soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Anna</li>
            <li> Not the color I had expected, it&#x27;s really pink and seemed like it was used already. I called and they said sometimes the stick rolls up and hits the top during the postal cycle which to me is pretty much a total bummer.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of this Maybelline line of lipsticks.  This shade of pink is perfect, just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  And I love the finish, not too matt, and not too shiny, a perfect blend.  The only thing I would say is that it is normal, moisturizing lipstick, and does not last.  But that&#x27;s not terrible when the texture and shade are so nice.</li>
            <li> I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND MY FAVORITE...LIPSTICK!!!&lt;br /&gt;AND AS A BONUS I RECIEVED IT TWO DAYS EARLIER THAN I HAD EXPECTED.&lt;br /&gt;MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THAT OF THE ENVELOPE HAD BEEN OPENED, BUT THE LIPSTICK WAS STILL SEALED.&lt;br /&gt;I AM A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER. THANK-YOU.</li>
            <li> I love this color for spring and summer.  So pretty!  Goes on very creamy and lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Recieved on time love the color the only thing is it doesnt last long i dont have time to reapply my lipstick all the time but for the price i paid i really cant complain like i said i love the color tho..</li>
            <li> Not a good color for me.</li>
            <li> La mercancia es de excelente calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo 100 %... Venezuela</li>
