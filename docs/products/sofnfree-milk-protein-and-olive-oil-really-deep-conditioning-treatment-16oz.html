            <li>I got a sample packet to try at first and was amazed at the results!</li>
            <li>worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, I am re-purchasing another one bc</li>
            <li>Right now I am transitioning,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I could find it in a larger quanity than the one time use packet.</li>
            <li>I purchased the individual pack from Wal-Mart  and tried it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>First, you do not need any heat on your hair with this.  </li>
            <li>Make my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>Most of the time I use salon brands, but I was willing to try other brands as well.</li>
            <li>i really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks Softnfree.</li>
            <li>It really detangles and moisturizes the hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for my hair until I went into this journey</li>
            <li>It really softens any new growth and makes the hair manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was my first time yesterday putting it on my hair, it&#x27;s fine if u don&#x27;t want to buy it, but give it a try even if it&#x27;s a little too pricey.</li>
            <li>the ending results i had extremely soft, detangled, manageable and conditioned hair!!</li>
            <li>I am a women of color with natural hair and it made my hair so soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>My  hair comes out nice and soft and looks thick.  </li>
            <li>THIN HAIR Great, unlike the chemicals in wild root which cvs only has..  </li>
            <li>Ok I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for any products</li>
            <li>I usually buy something based on how many stars the item have or the reviews, this one had a lot of stars + it has protein in it.</li>
            <li>I then rinsed it out with warm water and then blow dried and flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li>I leave it on my hair since I am doing a bleaching schedule and since it&#x27;s all natural, there&#x27;s nothing to react with the bleach.</li>
            <li>It Leaves My Hair Soooo SOFT.</li>
            <li>i really like this deep conditioning</li>
            <li>so I decided to go natural</li>
            <li>anywhere near water bc</li>
            <li>would I think this product would make my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>ordering a jar now because the single packets i had first ordered are out of stock.</li>
            <li>This product works better than matrix deep conditioning balm I usually use, and at the fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a deep conditioning treatment I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for my natural african american textured hair.</li>
            <li>Left them soft and shiny</li>
            <li>my hair was so soft &amp; I could actually finger comb which I could never do before.</li>
            <li>I applied to my scalp directly because I suffer from dandruff and dry scalp and also applied over hair.</li>

            <li> It made my hair very soft, my hair actually gained moisture, and once i dried it, it was shiny!</li>
            <li> my hair is so thin ( my natural hair is thick) &amp; so easily to break.</li>
            <li> my hair is damaged from perming and colouring , I found this product helped in repairing and taming my hair after 4 applications , the only thing is they say use entire contents which is not true</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my hair shine in a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had really dry ends.</li>
            <li> i am natural with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and will leave your hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Extremely conditioning.</li>
            <li> I am reordering today and just wanted to give this product its due credit.  </li>
            <li> I had less breakage &amp; it was manageable.</li>
            <li> My glair messed up real bad like whenever I shampooed my hair it would all tangled into a big mess that took me hours to detangled, it did not get any better +</li>
            <li> Of course, I still have a long way to go to repair my hair, but at least now I have some hope that there is a conditioner that works well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO heavy and makes your hair look greasier than before you&#x27;ve showered.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it for at least 30 minutes while I watch TV.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting it all off though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bomb. I have never tried a deep conditioner that actually deep conditions my hair. This stuff is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> i really like this stuff. I leave it on my hair since I am doing a bleaching schedule and since it&#x27;s all natural, there&#x27;s nothing to react with the bleach. It does have a bit of a smell though, since it has menthol in it. It&#x27;s not bad though.</li>
            <li> Loved it, great stuff :) I will be purching more in the very near future, my hair is a lot more manageable and softer, Thanks Softnfree.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had really dry ends. I ended up cutting it all off though. So I decided to use it on my short hair. DO NOT USE IF YOU&#x27;RE GOING OUT RIGHT AFTER YOUR SHOWER! This stuff is SO heavy and makes your hair look greasier than before you&#x27;ve showered. I also have not seen a jump in hair growth like it claims to do. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product. It&#x27;s good for your hair.... but it&#x27;s not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair</li>
            <li> my hair is damaged from perming and colouring , I found this product helped in repairing and taming my hair after 4 applications , the only thing is they say use entire contents which is not true I got 4 uses out of every tub and I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have been through tons of deep conditioners, from when i was permed to now i am natural with thick curly hair. As soon as i covered my hair with this conditioner it instantly softened and Detangled which is IMPORTANT for ME!It tingled my scalp (in a good way) the tingling feeling lets me know its working and getting DEEP! i recommend this conditioner to everyone! the ending results i had extremely soft, detangled, manageable and conditioned hair!! love it! ordering a jar now because the single packets i had first ordered are out of stock.</li>
            <li> Smells great it&#x27;s thick. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This Product Is So amazing It Leaves My Hair Soooo SOFT. OMG , if you didnt try it you have toooo like NOW. (:</li>
            <li> This product does not smell very good  and can cause some itchy.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I&#x27;m so glad that I could find it in a larger quanity than the one time use packet.</li>
            <li> conditioner is okay.  I have only used it once or twice because I do alternate with deep conditioners but it&#x27;s works fine.</li>
            <li> Product was okay..,.Didn&#x27;t really do much for my natural african american textured hair.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best conditioner I have ever tried. I purchased the individual pack from Wal-Mart  and tried it and fell in love with it. It leaves a tingling sensation on your scalp so you know that it is working. I applied to my scalp directly because I suffer from dandruff and dry scalp and also applied over hair. I sat under the dryer with a plastic cap for about 30 mins. Let me tell you that it was the BEST feeling. It felt like I was getting a head massage.  I then rinsed it out with warm water and then blow dried and flat ironed my hair. I am a women of color with natural hair and it made my hair so soft and very manageable. I am ordering the 16oz tub from Amazon so it will last longer. I highly recommend this conditioner. TRUST ME you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Really Deep Conditioning Treatment makes my hair so soft and smell so good!  If you are looking for a deep conditioning treatment I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> USED ONCE SERCHING FOR CONTAINER---THIS HAS A NICE FEEL TO IT AFTER RINSE!  I THINK WOMEN WOULD LOVE IT.  I USE A DIFFERENT OLIVE OIL ( PRODUCT FOR HAIR DRESSING AND NOT THAT GREASY KIDS STUFF--HOLDS THIN HAIR Great, unlike the chemicals in wild root which cvs only has..  THE OLIVE OIL hair products I get from target, except the above obtainable from amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and will leave your hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love!!!!  My hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li> i seen this on a you tube video.  I do no have any complaints about it at all. worth the money</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCTS, FEEL VERY COOL WHEN YOU RINSE. WORKS WELL, HAIR FEELS NICE AFTERWARDS. WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Extremely conditioning. Worth the try!</li>
            <li> AMAZING. You can FEEL it working in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I got a sample packet to try at first and was amazed at the results! My hair has been though a lot, mostly bleaching, coloring, etc so I am always looking for a great deep conditioner. Most of the time I use salon brands, but I was willing to try other brands as well. This product works better than matrix deep conditioning balm I usually use, and at the fraction of the cost. I applied it after washing my hair, and kept it for about 40 minutes without heat. It made my hair very soft, my hair actually gained moisture, and once i dried it, it was shiny! I haven&#x27;t seen my hair shine in a long time! It also fixed some of the breakage I have due to dry hair. Of course, I still have a long way to go to repair my hair, but at least now I have some hope that there is a conditioner that works well. The price is also great.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the individual packets from walmart but they discontinued them. It did wonders for my hair. Left them soft and shiny</li>
            <li> i really like this deep conditioning, i feel a cooling sensation soon after applying it, im not a fan of the smell but overall a very good product</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of conditioners made for African Americans. You name it, CPR, Elasta, Dr. Miracles, etc.  This conditioner is really really good. First, you do not need any heat on your hair with this.  Just put it on after your shampoo and rinse.  Put a plastic cap over your head and let it set for a bit.  I usually leave it for at least 30 minutes while I watch TV.  Rinse this out with nice warm water.  Rinse alot.  After that I just spray a leave in conditoner like Motions Moisture Plus in and comb and go.  My  hair comes out nice and soft and looks thick.  (I have fine hair).  I am reordering today and just wanted to give this product its due credit.  I also use the conditioning shampoo and there is a leave-in that I am ordering today.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews &amp; I must say it is one of the best deep conditioning treatments I have ever used. My hair feels extremely soft although I am 3 months post relaxer and have a lot of new growth, and it smells great. I would recommend this product for anyone and will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Love it great stuff, better than buying a small packet at Walmart this lasts you longer and it works great I started the strengthening cr&amp;egrave;me, and leave in for this and it&#x27;s awesome highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner that I have ever used. It really detangles and moisturizes the hair. The best of all is that it penetrates the scalp and you can feel the tingling sensation from it. It makes your scalp feel so good. I use it once a week and sit under the dryer for 30 minutes and rinse out and my hair loves it. It really softens any new growth and makes the hair manageable. I will continue to buy and use this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Make my hair super soft! 4 hair type</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner you can feel working</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing. I had damaged my hair severely through chemicals this has done amazing to repair it.</li>
            <li> Ok I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for any products bc it&#x27;s a waste of time. I had to write a review for this one. I put texturizer on my hair 2 years ago then I had a relaxer then went back to texturizer. My glair messed up real bad like whenever I shampooed my hair it would all tangled into a big mess that took me hours to detangled, it did not get any better + my hair was falling out. I didn&#x27;t like washing my hair at all for that reason so I decided to go natural mostly bc my hair was falling out + I could not go anywhere near water bc my hair is so thin ( my natural hair is thick) &amp; so easily to break. Right now I am transitioning, last time I had any chemicals in my hair was 4 months ago. I didn&#x27;t really care for my hair until I went into this journey so I decided to look up stuff I can buy that&#x27;ll stop my hair from breaking. I came across a vid on YouTube that said always buy Deep conditioners so I searched up deep conditioners on here. I usually buy something based on how many stars the item have or the reviews, this one had a lot of stars + it has protein in it. I bought bc I needed a conditioner, not in a million years would I think this product would make my hair so soft. I put that on my hair yesterday, I thought I was dreaming bc my hair was so soft &amp; I could actually finger comb which I could never do before. My hair is so bouncy &amp; has volume. I had less breakage &amp; it was manageable. It was my first time yesterday putting it on my hair, it&#x27;s fine if u don&#x27;t want to buy it, but give it a try even if it&#x27;s a little too pricey. It&#x27;s worth the money, I am re-purchasing another one bc the thought of never using this kills me.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!! I LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
