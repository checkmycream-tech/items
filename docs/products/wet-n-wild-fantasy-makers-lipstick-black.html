            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I was sent a cheap knockoff or</li>
            <li>but then again it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for $5.00 and free shopping.</li>
            <li>It goes on great at first but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lipstick a few months ago, and the first time I ordered it, it was wonderful</li>
            <li>I love black,i really love this color on my lips,its great for cosplay events,or normal everyday makeup!!</li>
            <li>With such an uncommon color id go with a better quality next time though.</li>
            <li>It did the job, stayed on pretty well and didn&#x27;t feel like cheap make up.</li>
            <li>this is a beautiful black, when you wear this color make sure you have a natural eye.</li>
            <li>BUT its definitely worth the 5$</li>
            <li>A good black lipstick is hard to find and this is the best one I&#x27;ve run into so far.</li>
            <li>but it actually came in just a few days which was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Eh, the color is nice but you really have to layer it on and keep reapplying constantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend shelling out a few more bucks for a better made lipstick.</li>
            <li>Smudges easily and takes many times over your lips to actually be black..</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>but it definitely served it&#x27;s purpose for a cute night out.</li>
            <li>Great color and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and is a rich dark color.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of lipstick for like Halloween and such since it doesn&#x27;t smudge too much</li>
            <li>Did not hold up at all, had to reapply constantly, not even good for a short duration Halloween party.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s easy to find during the Halloween season, it&#x27;s very low quality.</li>
            <li>Its kind of easy to come off but with a little concealer under it, makes it last alot longer.</li>
            <li>It is very lipglossy.</li>
            <li>like I said before ladies go to u tube and lean as much as you can its very helpful</li>
            <li>and you have to apply a lot to make you lips black but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I am not going to send it back because it will cost more to send it back than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a good color, but it doesn&#x27;t  last as long as other lipsticks I&#x27;ve  worn.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what the comments said I would get, I was constantly afriad it was going to smear</li>
            <li>It came carefully packaged and within a really quick amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely buy this if you love black</li>
            <li>some black and red eyeshadow make sure you put a primer on your eyelids</li>
            <li>The feel of the tube and shape of the lipstick seems a little cheap though.</li>
            <li>I love it and its so hard to find.</li>
            <li>So it has to be reapplied frequently.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t even have it that far out.</li>
            <li>Not worth  the full $10</li>
            <li>Especially in the high heat like in the high 90s and such.</li>
            <li>To make the black look very smooth you can put chapstick on before putting this on (just wait a few minutes before applying).</li>
            <li>It is very melty and wet.</li>
            <li>but it does feel a little heated when you first wear it.</li>
            <li>First off, you get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;Super sheer, goes on really uneven and rubs off on EVERYTHING even if there is barely contact</li>

            <li> First off, you get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;Super sheer, goes on really uneven and rubs off on EVERYTHING even if there is barely contact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply to your lips unless you dampen either your lips or the lipstick first, otherwise it&#x27;ll come close to tearing skin off your mouth.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t long lasting</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick to wear often but it&#x27;s something you would want to wear for halloween,it&#x27;s very sticky and comes off very easily ,very messy.</li>
            <li> Its shear and your real lip color shows through its also hard to apply neatly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fee like it should have taken so long.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I put the product on my lips</li>
            <li> and I would not recommend wearing it for too long.</li>
            <li> Waste of money unless you dont mind having a gloss with a little black to put over your favorite black lipstick!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry, in the sense that it smudges like hell, and runs.</li>
            <li> I mine a few years ago for a costume and just recently dug it for a different costume</li>
            <li> If you are careful it will last a while and not smudge unless you mess with your lips.</li>
            <li> but if you are more careful it is not so bad.</li>
            <li> So you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> A very low quality lipstick and very mess.</li>
            <li> even then I can still see a little pink.. get what you paid for I guess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> this lip stick is black and dark just what i like .</li>
            <li> so when you buy black lipstick its going to be black as the night .  </li>
            <li> It looks as if the color black is transparent on my lips.</li>
            <li> but you can use a black eye shadow to seal it into place.</li>
            <li> Still, i prefer keeping black lipstick on me for any case.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it was too fragile and broke instantly</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with finding a black lipstick that goes on well.</li>
            <li> I have to put a few layers of this on for it to cover my lips</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t WASTE Your Money.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know what happened to the one I ordered a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find black lipstick anywhere.</li>
            <li> not sure how to ate lipstick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m explaining it correctly</li>
            <li> The one I received was so hard</li>
            <li> It does tend to smudge around a bit if you put it on six inches thick like she does</li>
            <li> This is not a good type of lipstick.</li>
            <li> and it was very hard to put on my lips</li>
            <li> Its very hard to get off</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> but The color is not perfect.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to even put it on my lips</li>
            <li> I wanted to wear this often as a casual lipstick but it was not up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> but it was REALLY bad,  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> It is honestly horrible I was going out</li>
            <li> that is how awful it was.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does not apply well and the color looks a bit cheap. Waste of money unless you dont mind having a gloss with a little black to put over your favorite black lipstick!</li>
            <li> This is a good lipstick but if you want one that will stay on longer I don&#x27;t suggest this one. It is very lipglossy.</li>
            <li> Best black lipstick ever. I love it and its so hard to find. I will definitely buy more. it looks so good</li>
            <li> This can be taken either way, you can say boo or yay. It goes on great at first but doesn&#x27;t last all day. So it has to be reapplied frequently. And it does smudge easily. So you have to be careful. Especially in the high heat like in the high 90s and such. But for a Black lipstick its awesome. A good black lipstick is hard to find and this is the best one I&#x27;ve run into so far. If you are careful it will last a while and not smudge unless you mess with your lips. I find it more then suitable. It came carefully packaged and within a really quick amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> its glossy and last me 5 months! im getting more of this soon! but it does feel a little heated when you first wear it. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> No joke ladies  this is a beautiful black, when you wear this color make sure you have a natural eye. Goes  on creamy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a good color, but it doesn&#x27;t  last as long as other lipsticks I&#x27;ve  worn.</li>
            <li> this lip stick is black and dark just what i like . i am gothic and punk . so when you buy black lipstick its going to be black as the night .  wet n wild and amazon  are the best  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does its job but tastes like plastic, smears easy. BUT its definitely worth the 5$</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick to wear often but it&#x27;s something you would want to wear for halloween,it&#x27;s very sticky and comes off very easily ,very messy.</li>
            <li> I love the color,  love the way it looks on my lipsn</li>
            <li> This shade of black is perfect, and affordable! I will definitely purchase this item again. Buy buy buy!!! Great product</li>
            <li> This Lipstick I bought for Halloween since many places had it. Its shear and your real lip color shows through its also hard to apply neatly. So if you are going to use this often or you want a better cover one. Don&#x27;t buy this one. I wanted to wear this often as a casual lipstick but it was not up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love black,i really love this color on my lips,its great for cosplay events,or normal everyday makeup!! Definitely buy this if you love black</li>
            <li> i LOVED this product! i bought it around Halloween for a costume and before i got it i was thinking it will be this is cheap lipstick and it is not going to be what i wanted.... but NO this is amazing creamy, goes on lips well, feels right smells good! it is great i add a bit of red and just wear it regularly!  This is a great product i recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> It is an ok lipstick. I have always had trouble with finding a black lipstick that goes on well. I have to put a few layers of this on for it to cover my lips but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Another Cosplay item for my Granddaughter.  The lipstick is great and does not smear easily so perfect for her costuming.</li>
            <li> It is honestly horrible I was going out and I thought it would be nice to use the lipstick I just bought and I put it on and it was very hard to put on my lips not only that it looked just awuful</li>
            <li> The lipstick went on smooth it wasn&#x27;t long lasting but it definitely served it&#x27;s purpose for a cute night out. I loved it!</li>
            <li> Very Cheap.. It Comes Off Very Easy. Don&#x27;t WASTE Your Money.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this lipstick I thought that it would take forever to come but it actually came in just a few days which was wonderful. It goes on very smooth and is a rich dark color. The feel of the tube and shape of the lipstick seems a little cheap though. Its kind of easy to come off but with a little concealer under it, makes it last alot longer. Overall I like this product and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Eh, the color is nice but you really have to layer it on and keep reapplying constantly.</li>
            <li> A very low quality lipstick and very mess. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. With such an uncommon color id go with a better quality next time though.</li>
            <li> I loveeee this lip stick!!It&#x27;s not chalky at all! It&#x27;s very smooth and it has a gloss to it!!</li>
            <li> not sure how to ate lipstick but i love it :3. mit looks great on my lips as well lol</li>
            <li> This is so different for me but I like to be different from everybody else some black and red eyeshadow make sure you put a primer on your eyelids that&#x27;s important if you can get some makeup setting spray just alittle mist to keep your makeup on like I said before ladies go to u tube and lean as much as you can its very helpful let me know how it turns out</li>
            <li> I love this brand of lipstick for like Halloween and such since it doesn&#x27;t smudge too much but when I bought this it took over a week to arrive from NY to FL. I don&#x27;t fee like it should have taken so long. I will not be buying again despite the good quality. It&#x27;s just not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product. its an okay product it came on time and was described correctly but The color is not perfect. No matter how long I put the product on my lips it does not go on. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m explaining it correctly but the color is very light I thought it would be darker. It looks as if the color black is transparent on my lips. I&#x27;ve tried another wet and wild product  from Amazon and still was not up to my standards, it broke a day later and the color was off. I guess I will not be purchasing wet and wild products anymore.</li>
            <li> Great color and long lasting.</li>
            <li> too greasy was looking for more of a matte finish</li>
            <li> This is not a good type of lipstick. I was putting it on and it broke, I didn&#x27;t even have it that far out.</li>
            <li> Did not hold up at all, had to reapply constantly, not even good for a short duration Halloween party.</li>
            <li> Perfection. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Cruelty free an cheap? My kind of product.</li>
            <li> Not great. It is very melty and wet. It doesn&#x27;t dry, in the sense that it smudges like hell, and runs. This is more like a one time &#x27;quick lets take a picture&#x27; type of lipstick and I would not recommend wearing it for too long. It stains, and it is like tar- Its very hard to get off</li>
            <li> I got exactly what the comments said I would get, I was constantly afriad it was going to smear but instead it sucked out all the moisture in my lips and so I took it off, I liked the look but if you want to be constantly checking it and fixing it and stressing out all day then get this product. I will wear it when I have to go to like an hour or two hour event</li>
            <li> Bought this for Halloween. It did the job, stayed on pretty well and didn&#x27;t feel like cheap make up.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a very nice lipstick. It is easy to smear but you can use a black eye shadow to seal it into place. To make the black look very smooth you can put chapstick on before putting this on (just wait a few minutes before applying). I mine a few years ago for a costume and just recently dug it for a different costume and it was still fresh and went on nicely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply to your lips unless you dampen either your lips or the lipstick first, otherwise it&#x27;ll come close to tearing skin off your mouth. Still, i prefer keeping black lipstick on me for any case.</li>
            <li> I bought many tubes of this at Halloween stores since they&#x27;re just a dollar and it&#x27;s hard to find black lipstick anywhere. While it&#x27;s easy to find during the Halloween season, it&#x27;s very low quality. You definitely get what you pay for. It comes of incredibly easily, I cannot drink or eat anything with it on. I&#x27;d recommend shelling out a few more bucks for a better made lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love ❤ it.  It arrived on time</li>
            <li> this lipstick is cheap</li>
            <li> Smears very easy and you have to apply a lot to make you lips black but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lipstick a few months ago, and the first time I ordered it, it was wonderful it went on smooth and creamy.  But I don&#x27;t know what happened to the one I ordered a few weeks ago.  The one I received was so hard and I was unable to even put it on my lips, it was like a crayon  LOL I actually broke it trying to apply it to my lips,  that is how awful it was.  I don&#x27;t know if I was sent a cheap knockoff or what,  but it was REALLY bad,  I am not going to send it back because it will cost more to send it back than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Used this on Halloween.  It wore well.</li>
            <li> You have to put ALOT on for the color to show and broke after like two uses</li>
            <li> Smudges easily and takes many times over your lips to actually be black.. even then I can still see a little pink.. get what you paid for I guess.</li>
            <li> The kiddo loves it. I have bought the same brand a couple times for her. It does tend to smudge around a bit if you put it on six inches thick like she does but if you are more careful it is not so bad.</li>
            <li> First off, you get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;Super sheer, goes on really uneven and rubs off on EVERYTHING even if there is barely contact</li>
            <li> It looked like the picture unfortunately it was too fragile and broke instantly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last at all but then again it&#x27;s cheap so I can not give it a 1 star. I just need something for Halloween. Looks nice when you first apply it and I&#x27;m not even a lipstick fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for $5.00 and free shopping. Not worth  the full $10</li>
