            <li>and I prefer the combination of anti-perspirant and deodorant because it is more effective.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>It is quite refreshing and does not rub off on the clothes.  </li>
            <li>Axe makes some pretty good products.</li>
            <li>The scent in this Axe deodorant, unlike most others is not as strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is mostly fine and the deodorant does an OK job if you&#x27;re just sitting around, but does not have a lot of staying</li>
            <li>He loved this deodorant because it has a clean smell and stayed fresh all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not perfumy: he hates too much scent, and he loved the fact that the aroma isn&#x27;t particularly strong.</li>

            <li>This deodorant has a nice fresh scent that both myself and my wife enjoy.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear something without it being too strong and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>Its not the strong lingering scent I associate with some Axe products.</li>
            <li>It has a strong, musky scent.</li>
            <li>It fees cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>For reasons that they will not divulge, my armpits&#x27; primary desires are two-fold</li>
            <li>Armpits&#x27; Primary Desire #2.</li>
            <li>well, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, and doesn&#x27;t stop sweating, and it can leave light marks in clothing.</li>
            <li>Axe line is marketed to men, but women who prefer vetiver or sandalwood over floral scents will also enjoy using this.</li>
            <li>I have the world&#x27;s best son-in-law, always ready to carry my groceries, open my windows and help with whatever products</li>
            <li>Smells great for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The color is soothing: It has a cool teal/aqua color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some kids really go way over the top with Axe body spray</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and is much better than many more expensive choices!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe a good choice for a young boy or someone who does not have much underarm odor.</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly without leaving any visible residue.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>The Axe Peace deodorant goes on smooth, smells GREAT, and lasts long enough to keep me from stinking up my workplace, which is filled with women who keep the heat cranked all day and make me sweat like a pig in hell.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to apply as it glides smoothly.  </li>
            <li>About 2 years ago, I switched over to Axe products and have rarely been dissapointed since.  </li>
            <li>The scent does smell a tad different than the face wash, but it works in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this scent better than Axe Harmony by far.  </li>
            <li>Smells much, much better than Degree or Old Spice.</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a fresh woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>This Axe Fresh</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking at shopping for a young boy, I think the deodorants are a better choice than the body sprays.</li>
            <li>It says it gives 24 hour protection and that seems about right.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is very clean, primarily slightly sweet cedar or sandalwood with a bit of generic citrus and just a hint of spice that fades</li>
            <li>People around me generally seem pleased by this too.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I was excited to review three of the new deodorant products from Axe.  </li>
            <li>It holds up pretty well all day without feeling sticky, and does its job well.  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased with it and look forward to using it further.</li>
            <li>Axe Harmony Antiperspirant, 2.7 Ounce]]), is my second favorite.  </li>
            <li>ok i have teen boys who i got this product for&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day he wore this, we were in the car for about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>The blue gel stick has a much stronger, more abrasive scent and it doesn&#x27;t protect me for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually fine with the first of these aims as it&#x27;s a fairly simple task to keep these hairs covered and out of sight.</li>
            <li>deodorant is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a new scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the Axe Peace Dry</li>
            <li>it is easy becaue they actually like to use it&lt;</li>
            <li>Not only does it help keep me dry all day, but it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Axe Peace face wash and figured I would like this deodorant as well.</li>
            <li>It even held up to the intense Texas heat and</li>
            <li>He says he stopped doing it because he really didn&#x27;t need it any longer after using Axe.</li>
            <li>again not happening so much with this brand</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my brother, because he really loves the Axe product line: he already has the body wash and a body spray.</li>
            <li>It is indeed long-lasting and works very well to mask body odor without interrupting the body&#x27;s cooling mechanisms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Enjoying the scent or not is obviously a matter of personal opinion, and you might want to sniff a few bars in a physical store to figure out what &#x27;flavors&#x27; you like before you place orders, but otherwise I really haven&#x27;t experienced anything with their products that&#x27;s objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said that this product kept him dry throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating it 3 stars because of the extremely strong scent.</li>
            <li>I usually stay away from AXE products because they smell so strong but this one is very mild but still masculine smelling.  </li>
            <li>24 Hour Deodorant is a blue gel that feels cool when applied</li>
            <li>I just ordered a bunch more, because my liking a new product generally means they&#x27;re going to stop making it in short order.</li>
            <li>My least favorite is the Axe Peace Fresh 24H Deodorant Stick.  </li>
            <li>: it went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave any flaky residue like other deodorants he has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think moderation imposes itself a little more naturally with something like this</li>
            <li>Not that they smell bad but this smells much more like a nice cologne.</li>
            <li>I, along with several of my male friends, enjoy using the Axe hygiene products.  </li>
            <li>However, it definitely kept him odor free, and he works physically for a living.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that gets rashes with pretty much every antiperspirant and several brands of deodorant as well, but this axe peace deodorant gives me no such issues.  </li>
            <li>I like its clean, subtle, non-offensive scent that reminds me of freshly laundered sheets; it keeps my underarms dry and pleasant smelling for at least, if not more than, 24 hours; and it has a strong, masculine appearance.  </li>
            <li>It also smells nice and keeps my underarms dry and pleasant scented for approximately 24 hours; however, its scent is not quite as subtle as the Axe Peace Anti-Perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is clear, and that makes my husband itch, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>So here we have a rarity, a fragrance that both my 23 year old son and my 65 year dad like.</li>
            <li>As far as how it works, it works</li>
            <li>, that doesn&#x27;t seem like something you can/should completely cover yourself with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough to last his workday, but not strong enough to handle a workout afterward or night owl evenings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a youthful, very fresh scent that is woodsy and green.  </li>
            <li>In the mornings, when I&#x27;m getting ready for work, my underarms don&#x27;t smell as fresh as when I have used the Axe Peace Dry or the Axe Harmony Dry.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly.</li>
            <li>The second of these aims, however, is *not* something that I&#x27;m okay with for my armpits are skilled at producing ucky smells that cannot be hidden by mere cotton garments.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s NOT Old Spice, because in my opinion the point of wearing deodorant is so everyone else doesn&#x27;t smell your arm pits, and with the Old Spice, it was darn near cologne level in scent- which is admittedly strongly preferable to 65 year old man who still works hard every day, but it&#x27;s still smelling his armpits from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to be very careful not to apply too much of the Axe Peace Fresh or my underarms will slightly burn and sting during the day.  </li>
            <li>It is a clear blue gel that disappears when you put it on</li>
            <li>By masking the pits&#x27; natural stink (with the smell of &amp;#34;Peace,&amp;#34; in this case), I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how long I can counteract</li>
            <li>The scent IS masculine, but not so much that women that like orientals would not enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to do, then, is to counteract my armpits&#x27; efforts by smearing various concoctions of resins, gels, old spices and such upon them.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin, and the ingredients in this don&#x27;t cause any issues for him like standard antiperspirants have, and he likes the scent well enough that we will buy it in the future for him.</li>
            <li>particular one is not too overpowering like other name brands on the market</li>
            <li>He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him.</li>
            <li>In this regard, the product performs very well providing about 12 hours of odor control in the form of a slight minty smell.</li>
            <li>This is more subtle less obvious scent.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a youthful, very fresh scent that is woodsy and green.  </li>
            <li> In the mornings, when I&#x27;m getting ready for work, my underarms don&#x27;t smell as fresh as when I have used the Axe Peace Dry or the Axe Harmony Dry.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly.</li>
            <li> The second of these aims, however, is *not* something that I&#x27;m okay with for my armpits are skilled at producing ucky smells that cannot be hidden by mere cotton garments.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s NOT Old Spice, because in my opinion the point of wearing deodorant is so everyone else doesn&#x27;t smell your arm pits, and with the Old Spice, it was darn near cologne level in scent- which is admittedly strongly preferable to 65 year old man who still works hard every day, but it&#x27;s still smelling his armpits from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to be very careful not to apply too much of the Axe Peace Fresh or my underarms will slightly burn and sting during the day.  </li>
            <li> It is a clear blue gel that disappears when you put it on</li>
            <li> By masking the pits&#x27; natural stink (with the smell of &amp;#34;Peace,&amp;#34; in this case), I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how long I can counteract</li>
            <li> The scent IS masculine, but not so much that women that like orientals would not enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to do, then, is to counteract my armpits&#x27; efforts by smearing various concoctions of resins, gels, old spices and such upon them.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin, and the ingredients in this don&#x27;t cause any issues for him like standard antiperspirants have, and he likes the scent well enough that we will buy it in the future for him.</li>
            <li> particular one is not too overpowering like other name brands on the market</li>
            <li> He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him.</li>
            <li> In this regard, the product performs very well providing about 12 hours of odor control in the form of a slight minty smell.</li>
            <li> This is more subtle less obvious scent.</li>
            <li> It is a fresher scent, but still sort of musky.&lt;br /&gt; Despite its blue colour, it still will make white marks on dark clothes- not as much as the white ones, so you still have to be especially careful if you are pulling something over your head, not to rub it up against your underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thees products usually do not last as long as they should&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take note that this particular product is a deodorant only so it will not help with excessive sweat.</li>

            <li> does keep me dry, but not for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> main complaint is the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; aspect of it.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and as long as you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy or need strong antiperspirants, it should work.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It seems a little short on the protection time though.</li>
            <li> but the problem is that it feels wet when you apply it</li>

            <li> This particular product is a deodorant and not anti-perspirant; therfore, while it will not stop or otherwise reduce perspiration, it will prevent bad odor (actually mask).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This deodorant has a nice fresh scent that both myself and my wife enjoy.  It holds up pretty well all day without feeling sticky, and does its job well.  I have sensitive skin that gets rashes with pretty much every antiperspirant and several brands of deodorant as well, but this axe peace deodorant gives me no such issues.  I will definitely be looking to purchase this again.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I switched over to Axe products and have rarely been dissapointed since.  This product is no different. This particular product is a deodorant and not anti-perspirant; therfore, while it will not stop or otherwise reduce perspiration, it will prevent bad odor (actually mask).  In this regard, the product performs very well providing about 12 hours of odor control in the form of a slight minty smell. The product applies evenly and does not stain shirts.  Also, it appeals to my wife&#x27;s senses.</li>
            <li> I really like the Axe Peace face wash and figured I would like this deodorant as well. The scent does smell a tad different than the face wash, but it works in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant leaves no marks on shirts. That&#x27;s my big problem with antiperspirants. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering to the point where everyone you&#x27;re around is constantly reminded that you&#x27;re wearing deodorant as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a new scent. I was really pleased with it and look forward to using it further.</li>
            <li> I like this scent better than Axe Harmony by far.  It&#x27;s a youthful, very fresh scent that is woodsy and green.  It is a clear blue gel that disappears when you put it on and it does not stain your clothes.  At 3 ounces, it&#x27;s a fairly big antiperspirant product that should lat a while.&lt;br /&gt;It is clear, and that makes my husband itch, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It keeps me dry.  The scent IS masculine, but not so much that women that like orientals would not enjoy it.  It says it gives 24 hour protection and that seems about right.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with underarm odor or wetness while I was putting it on daily.&lt;br /&gt;It is Made in the USA, and it is a Unilever product.</li>
            <li> I, along with several of my male friends, enjoy using the Axe hygiene products.  Therefore, I was excited to review three of the new deodorant products from Axe.  My favorite is the Axe Peace Dry 24H Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant ([[ASIN:B00HNKQU0O Axe Peace Antiperspirant, 2.7 Ounce]]).  I like its clean, subtle, non-offensive scent that reminds me of freshly laundered sheets; it keeps my underarms dry and pleasant smelling for at least, if not more than, 24 hours; and it has a strong, masculine appearance.  The Axe Harmony Dry 24H Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant ([[ASIN:B00HNKQTZU Axe Harmony Antiperspirant, 2.7 Ounce]]), is my second favorite.  It also smells nice and keeps my underarms dry and pleasant scented for approximately 24 hours; however, its scent is not quite as subtle as the Axe Peace Anti-Perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My least favorite is the Axe Peace Fresh 24H Deodorant Stick.  The blue gel stick has a much stronger, more abrasive scent and it doesn&#x27;t protect me for 24 hours.  In the mornings, when I&#x27;m getting ready for work, my underarms don&#x27;t smell as fresh as when I have used the Axe Peace Dry or the Axe Harmony Dry.  Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to be very careful not to apply too much of the Axe Peace Fresh or my underarms will slightly burn and sting during the day.  I&#x27;ve had this same experience with other blue gel sticks.  The white invisible solids never irritate or aggravate my underarms.  From now on, I&#x27;m sticking with the white invisible solids and I prefer the combination of anti-perspirant and deodorant because it is more effective.  Deodorants alone simply cover up the smell of the perspiration whereas anti-perspirants help prevent perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells great for a long time. Smells much, much better than Degree or Old Spice. Not that they smell bad but this smells much more like a nice cologne. I would recommend to others. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 days now.</li>
            <li> For reasons that they will not divulge, my armpits&#x27; primary desires are two-fold: 1) grow scraggly, awkward-looking hairs and 2) smell bad. I&#x27;m actually fine with the first of these aims as it&#x27;s a fairly simple task to keep these hairs covered and out of sight. The second of these aims, however, is *not* something that I&#x27;m okay with for my armpits are skilled at producing ucky smells that cannot be hidden by mere cotton garments. These scents bother the people around me, and they bother the non-armpits parts of me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve taken to do, then, is to counteract my armpits&#x27; efforts by smearing various concoctions of resins, gels, old spices and such upon them. This bar-shaped material from the Axe Corporation is one such concoction. By masking the pits&#x27; natural stink (with the smell of &amp;#34;Peace,&amp;#34; in this case), I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how long I can counteract Armpits&#x27; Primary Desire #2. People around me generally seem pleased by this too.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.  Easy application and lasts for 24 hours easily.  It even held up to the intense Texas heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and pleasing, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product.</li>
            <li> So here we have a rarity, a fragrance that both my 23 year old son and my 65 year dad like. They like it well enough that dad uses this deodorant, and my son uses the antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s NOT Old Spice, because in my opinion the point of wearing deodorant is so everyone else doesn&#x27;t smell your arm pits, and with the Old Spice, it was darn near cologne level in scent- which is admittedly strongly preferable to 65 year old man who still works hard every day, but it&#x27;s still smelling his armpits from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, and doesn&#x27;t stop sweating, and it can leave light marks in clothing. It does keep natural body odor down, and it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex. He has sensitive skin, and the ingredients in this don&#x27;t cause any issues for him like standard antiperspirants have, and he likes the scent well enough that we will buy it in the future for him.</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from AXE products because they smell so strong but this one is very mild but still masculine smelling.  As far as how it works, it works okay.  It does the job and as long as you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy or need strong antiperspirants, it should work.&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; aspect of it.  It is a basic stick gel deodorant but the problem is that it feels wet when you apply it AND THEN IT STAYS THAT WAY!  Usually when I apply a wet one it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky under your arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a good choice for a young boy or someone who does not have much underarm odor.</li>
            <li> Axe Peace Deodorant has a strong and pleasant smell that keeps sweat at bay all day.  It is quite refreshing and does not rub off on the clothes.  The Axe does not show up when arms are lifted up and nobody would know it was worn, as it cannot be seen.  It is aluminum-free, but not vegan type.  The Axe contains harmless dipropylene glycol (perfume solvent), propylene glycol (vaporizer), sodium stearate (soap), alkyl benzoate C12 - C15/benzoic acid ester (sweat resistant to increase lasting), disodium EDTA/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (improves stability in air), BHT/butylated hydroxytoluene/butylhydroxytoluene (prevents oxidation), Blue 1/Brilliant Blue FCF (colorant).</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s best son-in-law, always ready to carry my groceries, open my windows and help with whatever products I happen to be testing at the minute.  He&#x27;s been wearing this [[ASIN:B00HNKQTTQ Axe Peace Deodorant]] for several weeks now and here&#x27;s the verdict.  The scent is mostly fine and the deodorant does an OK job if you&#x27;re just sitting around, but does not have a lot of staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great if you have a desk job in an air conditioned office, absolutely useless at the gym. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma suggests you buy a single copy locally to try before you buy a case.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent! It smells like cologne to be honest. He says that it lasts him throughout the day. Usually he has to reapply after he is done with work and goes to the gym. He says he stopped doing it because he really didn&#x27;t need it any longer after using Axe.</li>
            <li> ok i have teen boys who i got this product for&lt;br /&gt;it is a chore at times to remind them to use any underarm product usually&lt;br /&gt;however the AXE brand it is easy becaue they actually like to use it&lt;br /&gt;this particular one is not too overpowering like other name brands on the market&lt;br /&gt;and being on the younger end of the teen spectrum they often forget to close caps&lt;br /&gt;thus thees products usually do not last as long as they should&lt;br /&gt;however again not happening so much with this brand&lt;br /&gt;so anything that they will use is a great product in my book lol</li>
            <li> Axe products are typically great and this Peace Antiperspirant does not disappoint. I like to wear something without it being too strong and this fits the bill.  Axe also has an anti-persiprant version of this scent.[[ASIN:B00HNKQU0O Axe Peace Antiperspirant, 2.7 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a fresh woodsy scent. Its not the strong lingering scent I associate with some Axe products. This is more subtle less obvious scent.My and I  family has found it very effective at keeping underarm odor away.Take note that this particular product is a deodorant only so it will not help with excessive sweat.</li>
            <li> I received this Axe Peace Antiperspirant through the Amazon Vine review program. My husband tested the product. He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him. He said that this product kept him dry throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating it 3 stars because of the extremely strong scent. The first day he wore this, we were in the car for about 45 minutes. The smell of it actually made me nauseous, and we had to open all of the windows in the car. He finished using it up while he was traveling for work, so I didn&#x27;t have to smell it anymore. Even though the product performed well, we definitely won&#x27;t be buying the Peace scent again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of scented deodorant.  I mean, after all, doesn&#x27;t DE-ODORant actually imply the removal of odor?  Still, as far as scented deodorants go at least this one is abhorrent.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband, who runs six miles twice a week and sweats up a storm. If there&#x27;s anybody who needs a good deodorant, it&#x27;s him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gives it a mixed review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Cool packaging: black and silver colors appealed to him. It imparts a coolly masculine vibe and looks expensive, even though the price is quite reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No residue: it went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave any flaky residue like other deodorants he has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not perfumy: he hates too much scent, and he loved the fact that the aroma isn&#x27;t particularly strong. It has a nice minty aftershave lotion quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is soothing: It has a cool teal/aqua color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works: it kept his sweat from stinking up his clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours.\\&quot; He was disappointed that it stopped working after 6 hours or so. It&#x27;s good enough to last his workday, but not strong enough to handle a workout afterward or night owl evenings.</li>
            <li> Axe Peace deodorant is for lighter days when you don&#x27;t need those hard to wash aluminum zirconium chemicals.  It is much easier to apply as it glides smoothly.  It fees cool and refreshing. The minty scent is a personal preference and I like it.  At the end of the day, I find it not as effective compared to others that have I tried.</li>
            <li> I gave this deodorant to my husband to us. He tried it, and I could smell it on him. It has a strong, musky scent. However, it definitely kept him odor free, and he works physically for a living.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is disgusting at best &amp; truly repulsive. My husband trashed it.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome product. I purchased it for my brother, because he really loves the Axe product line: he already has the body wash and a body spray. He loved this deodorant because it has a clean smell and stayed fresh all day. This is a great product, and is much better than many more expensive choices!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite deodorant. I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirants, and my lifelong deodorant of choice (Speed Stick) has become so cheapened and watered-down as to be virtually useless. The Axe Peace deodorant goes on smooth, smells GREAT, and lasts long enough to keep me from stinking up my workplace, which is filled with women who keep the heat cranked all day and make me sweat like a pig in hell. It also doesn&#x27;t flake all over the bathroom while I&#x27;m putting it on, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on my shirts. I&#x27;m happy. I just ordered a bunch more, because my liking a new product generally means they&#x27;re going to stop making it in short order. Stock up!</li>
            <li> This is a great scented deodorant for men. I had my brother try it and he loved it. Said he would look for it in stores!</li>
            <li> This Deodorant is awesome.  Not only does it help keep me dry all day, but it smells really good.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great smelling deodorant, that works well this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> This Axe Fresh 24 Hour Deodorant is a blue gel that feels cool when applied and it dries quickly without leaving any visible residue. It is indeed long-lasting and works very well to mask body odor without interrupting the body&#x27;s cooling mechanisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very clean, primarily slightly sweet cedar or sandalwood with a bit of generic citrus and just a hint of spice that fades very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe line is marketed to men, but women who prefer vetiver or sandalwood over floral scents will also enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> Axe Peace Deodorant is a nice smelling deodorant. For an Axe product, the scent is not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, or stain my shirts. It seems a little short on the protection time though. It&#x27;s supposed to be a 24 hour deodorant, but seem to lose its effectiveness around the 12 hour mark. If you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant that has to last for an entire day, you may want to look elsewhere. Otherwise I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The scent in this Axe deodorant, unlike most others is not as strong. It is a fresher scent, but still sort of musky.&lt;br /&gt; Despite its blue colour, it still will make white marks on dark clothes- not as much as the white ones, so you still have to be especially careful if you are pulling something over your head, not to rub it up against your underarms.&lt;br /&gt;It does keep me dry, but not for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Axe makes some pretty good products. They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly. Enjoying the scent or not is obviously a matter of personal opinion, and you might want to sniff a few bars in a physical store to figure out what &#x27;flavors&#x27; you like before you place orders, but otherwise I really haven&#x27;t experienced anything with their products that&#x27;s objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at shopping for a young boy, I think the deodorants are a better choice than the body sprays. Some kids really go way over the top with Axe body spray and I think moderation imposes itself a little more naturally with something like this, that doesn&#x27;t seem like something you can/should completely cover yourself with.</li>
