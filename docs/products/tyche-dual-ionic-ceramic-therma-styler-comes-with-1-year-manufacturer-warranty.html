            <li>and I could see the great ratings and</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that it heats up very quickly</li>
            <li>the good things said....</li>
            <li>and I think with practice it might be a good product.</li>
            <li>So if your hair is frizzy or needs to be smoothed, I guess it would be good for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tyche, thank you for making this top notch product affordable and good for our hair!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>this iron just smooth&#x27;s them out so beautifully.</li>
            <li>that runs about $90.00...no better than this one!</li>
            <li>this tool tames it and makes my hair more &amp;#34;finished looking&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright but not anything amazing like it claims.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Automatic off would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Nice shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this works so good on my hair</li>
            <li>Otherwise it seems like a nice product.</li>
            <li>The tyche dual ionic ceramic therma styler has worked great for me and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Safe to use, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>For years I have been using a very cheap curling iron.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Would love to have 3 settings.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What more can a curling iron do?  </li>
            <li>but I am so glad I gave this one a try.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>You can not beat the price but more importantly, the value and quality of this heat styling brush.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy/curly and I am able to get my hair smooth and under control.</li>
            <li>The iron holds very nice in the hand, the cord is nice and long, but you will find a problem with the on/off switch like others mentioned.  </li>
            <li>The curl is just perfect, hair comes out looking soft and the bounce in the curl is almost too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to easy to keep turning up or off the heat while using.</li>
            <li>Causes hair to be full of static.</li>
            <li>It holds you hair on the brush (I have fine hair).</li>
            <li>works well on my fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>since I am not blessed with that, I wouldn&#x27;t know if this would straighten curls, but on my fine hair this styler does the trick.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, is comfortable in my hand, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Provides her with nice gentle curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made well, has a comfortable handle and even on the lower setting</li>
            <li>Nice I really like it</li>
            <li>I would love it but the designer put the on off switch on the handle right where you have to hold it.</li>
            <li>She was so excited when she opened the box.</li>
            <li>I am editing my original review.</li>
            <li>This is cheap, quick easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great for when you don&#x27;t want to wash and blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair are in better shape, and my hair is left looking nice for two days.</li>
            <li>This styler is cool to touch.</li>
            <li>but maybe that is why they are selling at such a good price.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I really did not have much success with this product as I still like using a curling iron better.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;perfector&amp;#34; sold by QVC only goes up to 395 degrees (or so) while this one goes up to 410-425 and does not exceed 450 degrees, which is good because that type of heat will cause major damage to most hair types.</li>
            <li>Kind of works, only 2 heat settings.</li>
            <li>They both curl the hair right?  </li>
            <li>This will replace my rollers when I just want to do a quick job or touch up, I love it, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, but is cool to the touch on the bristles.</li>
            <li>It also  has a cool to the touch tip, which makes using the styler much easier.</li>
            <li>The price was decent enough to try for sure!  </li>
            <li>It did heat up very fast which is a plus</li>
            <li>U can only imagine how many hair stylers ive had.</li>
            <li>It does not get too hot and burn her scalp.</li>
            <li>and I prefer the red color anyway :)</li>
            <li>My coworkers have started complimenting my hair on a regular basis:)</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of the reviews, and I am not sorry.</li>
            <li>With this ceramic therma styler I am able to get lift at the root and bouncy waves that last all way.</li>
            <li>The grip has a soft silicone type texture and I enjoy having a hi-lo heat setting.</li>
            <li>It does everything they claim it does and has never gotten too hot for my hands to hold the brush head.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a real safety issue!</li>
            <li>Very easy to style hair when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and give my super straight hair curl and volume.</li>
            <li>When I came back home after working all day, I found it had been on all day and was still hot!!!</li>
            <li>Even my husband has commented how nice my hair looks and was surprised to see how I actually USE this tool rather than have it store away as a &amp;#34;notion.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>There were not many but the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this leaves my hair feeling soft and looking &amp;#34;flowing&#x27; with soft curls that a very fashion forward.</li>
            <li>And slide switch does tend to get turned off easily, but not big deal.</li>
            <li>easy to use helps my curly hair look better less frizz and soft curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a curling brush and it doesn&#x27;t even curl well because it&#x27;so large.</li>
            <li>Life much easier with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a woman who spends much time on hair.</li>
            <li>it curls fast, not to mention that it&#x27;s soo much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Straight or curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really add volume or anything.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay that price not knowing if it would work any different than the cheap one I had been using.  </li>
            <li>my ineptness at learning to use this product did not help as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I really like my curling brush, I was looking at another one</li>
            <li>well it has eliminated so much time from my hair routine.  </li>
            <li>I really like this tool....</li>
            <li>Doesnt really curl - but smoothes hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I like that it is very light and seems to do the job as the more expensive one did.</li>
            <li>Brand new!</li>
            <li>I was using a Helen of Troy curling iron exclusively for many years, but that would end up frying the ends of my hair, no matter what brand of heat protectant I used, ranging from top of the line, i.e., expensive to pharmacy off the shelf &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
            <li>The rubber band holds the switch in a steady place....</li>
            <li>High will burn my hair, and low doesn&#x27;t work as quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I highly recommend this styling tool because you will reach for it all the time--</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse hair and most of the stylers like this have fine wire bristles on the brush part which did not hold up to my hair type.</li>
            <li>Really was surprised how this one shines over the perfector.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive ones this one works great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Im not good at managing my own hair.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the same</li>
            <li>This styling tool has become my favorite as I have used it exclusively for the past 2-months, since it&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li>I tried almost evetything, flat iron, blow drier, curling iron, rotating hairstyler, hot wind blowing brush, etc</li>
            <li>I like result from flat iron and curling iron but its too hot, burns my ears and makes me sweat.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I fixed it by winding a rubber band around it.  </li>
            <li>Having only used it 2 times, I can&#x27;t really give it an opinion.  </li>
            <li>This styler heats up quickly and works very well - it curls and will also straighten, but not sure about naturally curly hair -</li>
            <li>No sweat,  no burn on my poor ears, no noise, light weight..  no need to worry about sweaty hot summer day hair styling.  </li>
            <li>This does not dry hair, your hair must be dry first before using.</li>
            <li>I have thin, flat hair, and this leaves me with nice soft waves and added volume.  </li>
            <li>a third time- to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s inevitable especially when working fast).</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was tired of having the accidental burn mark on m forehead, the back of my neck or my ear lobes</li>
            <li>I have tried the other higher priced ones and I do not see any difference in the end result.</li>
            <li>I wear a bob with a stacked back, and my hair can get a little fuzzy and very full when I blow dry it...</li>
            <li>This one has thick silicone bristles that move smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li>Very dim light and poor function..</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the very expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I am possibly the world&#x27;s worst at styling my own hair, but I find this styler to be even more foolproof than my flat iron.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the way this leaves my hair feeling soft and looking &amp;#34;flowing&#x27; with soft curls that a very fashion forward.</li>
            <li> And slide switch does tend to get turned off easily, but not big deal.</li>
            <li> easy to use helps my curly hair look better less frizz and soft curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a curling brush and it doesn&#x27;t even curl well because it&#x27;so large.</li>
            <li> Life much easier with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a woman who spends much time on hair.</li>
            <li> it curls fast, not to mention that it&#x27;s soo much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Straight or curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really add volume or anything.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay that price not knowing if it would work any different than the cheap one I had been using.  </li>
            <li> my ineptness at learning to use this product did not help as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> I really like my curling brush, I was looking at another one</li>
            <li> well it has eliminated so much time from my hair routine.  </li>
            <li> I really like this tool....</li>
            <li> Doesnt really curl - but smoothes hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I like that it is very light and seems to do the job as the more expensive one did.</li>
            <li> Brand new!</li>
            <li> I was using a Helen of Troy curling iron exclusively for many years, but that would end up frying the ends of my hair, no matter what brand of heat protectant I used, ranging from top of the line, i.e., expensive to pharmacy off the shelf &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
            <li> The rubber band holds the switch in a steady place....</li>
            <li> High will burn my hair, and low doesn&#x27;t work as quickly.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I highly recommend this styling tool because you will reach for it all the time--</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and most of the stylers like this have fine wire bristles on the brush part which did not hold up to my hair type.</li>
            <li> Really was surprised how this one shines over the perfector.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive ones this one works great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Im not good at managing my own hair.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same</li>
            <li> This styling tool has become my favorite as I have used it exclusively for the past 2-months, since it&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li> I tried almost evetything, flat iron, blow drier, curling iron, rotating hairstyler, hot wind blowing brush, etc</li>
            <li> I like result from flat iron and curling iron but its too hot, burns my ears and makes me sweat.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I fixed it by winding a rubber band around it.  </li>
            <li> Having only used it 2 times, I can&#x27;t really give it an opinion.  </li>
            <li> This styler heats up quickly and works very well - it curls and will also straighten, but not sure about naturally curly hair -</li>
            <li> No sweat,  no burn on my poor ears, no noise, light weight..  no need to worry about sweaty hot summer day hair styling.  </li>
            <li> This does not dry hair, your hair must be dry first before using.</li>
            <li> I have thin, flat hair, and this leaves me with nice soft waves and added volume.  </li>
            <li> a third time- to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s inevitable especially when working fast).</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was tired of having the accidental burn mark on m forehead, the back of my neck or my ear lobes</li>
            <li> I have tried the other higher priced ones and I do not see any difference in the end result.</li>
            <li> I wear a bob with a stacked back, and my hair can get a little fuzzy and very full when I blow dry it...</li>
            <li> This one has thick silicone bristles that move smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li> Very dim light and poor function..</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the very expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I am possibly the world&#x27;s worst at styling my own hair, but I find this styler to be even more foolproof than my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely, fine, silky, hair that refuses to hold a style, and am too lazy and impatient to spend 45 minutes every morning to create a look that will be flat by noon.</li>
            <li> My  flat iron is also tyche.  </li>
            <li> It is 12/21/2015 not quite a year later from the first use, teeth have broken off not enough left to use the iron heat still works but not enough teeth to use,</li>
            <li> I would also like to note, that my hair is very thick and this tool helps me accomplish my styling task quickly.</li>
            <li> It also has a high heat setting, which is essential for thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is mid-length straight and hard to curl.  </li>
            <li> Now I can let my hair air dry at night while watching Netflix and spend 10 minutes in the morning</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, let it air dry and then use this.</li>
            <li> I just wish the wand was a little smaller around.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it is less damaging than a curling iron or flat iron</li>
            <li> My hair routine just takes a few minutes, wish maybe that the rod would be a little smaller as I have very short hair</li>
            <li> This works exactly like the expensive brand.</li>
            <li> There is one other problem with this styling wand that I do not like.</li>
            <li> Styling my dry hair in the morning  takes as little as 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> just wish it got slightly hotter.</li>
            <li> I can get the ends to curl under ever so slightly</li>
            <li> I was looking for a styling tool that would be less damaging on my already damaged hair but</li>
            <li> And, I have hopes that this will cause less damage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried flat irons, all manner of curling irons and rollers that are growing dusty in the bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> And Get Anxious When Its Noisy.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;perfector&amp;#34; is expensive ($100-150) and for less than $30 (US), you will get a tool that will meet the standards of the tool sold on QVC.</li>
            <li> I hate blow dryer, rotating brush styler cuz its hot and noisy , driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Another plus, this was the least expensive product of this type that I found.</li>
            <li> Thats why I wanted to buy that expensive Calista thing but</li>
            <li> Its too expensive.  </li>
            <li> !sorry to share</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and could never get my hair to twist on a non bush iron.  </li>
            <li> In sorry hate to make a bad review but was sent a email to do so ..</li>
            <li> My mom saw a tool like this and wanted it so badly.</li>
            <li> Very bad heating mechanism ..</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Omg. Best hair styler ever. U can only imagine how many hair stylers ive had. I Have A Lot Of Frizzy, curly, Breast Length layered hair. Im not good at managing my own hair. I tried almost evetything, flat iron, blow drier, curling iron, rotating hairstyler, hot wind blowing brush, etc.. u name it , I have it.  Im sweaty..And Get Anxious When Its Noisy.  I hate blow dryer, rotating brush styler cuz its hot and noisy , driving me crazy.  I like result from flat iron and curling iron but its too hot, burns my ears and makes me sweat.  Thats why I wanted to buy that expensive Calista thing but Its too expensive.  I finally found this tyche styler and i knew I would like it. My  flat iron is also tyche.  This styler is cool to touch. Safe to use, very easy to use. No sweat,  no burn on my poor ears, no noise, light weight..  no need to worry about sweaty hot summer day hair styling.  i wish I can give 7 stars.  This is &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item. Life much easier with it.</li>
            <li> Very happy. I&#x27;m not a woman who spends much time on hair. This is cheap, quick easy.&lt;br /&gt;Automatic off would have been nice. And slide switch does tend to get turned off easily, but not big deal.</li>
            <li> Kind of works, only 2 heat settings. Causes hair to be full of static.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My mom saw a tool like this and wanted it so badly. She was so excited when she opened the box. This gives her something uncomplicated to curl her hair. It does not get too hot and burn her scalp. Provides her with nice gentle curls. She&#x27;s happy/ I&#x27;m happy!!!</li>
            <li> Work well, great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent transaction on all levels!!</li>
            <li> This works exactly like the expensive brand. My pricey curler broke for a second time and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money- a third time- to buy a new one. I ran accross this and thought to give it a try. I am so happy I did. It works exactly the same and I prefer the red color anyway :)</li>
            <li> I have extremely, fine, silky, hair that refuses to hold a style, and am too lazy and impatient to spend 45 minutes every morning to create a look that will be flat by noon. I&#x27;ve tried flat irons, all manner of curling irons and rollers that are growing dusty in the bathroom cabinet. As it happens, I was about to purchase the $90.00 version of this tool at Armstrong McCall(I&#x27;m an esthetician) when I came across this by accident. So happy I purchased this instead! Now I can let my hair air dry at night while watching Netflix and spend 10 minutes in the morning styling my hair with this. My coworkers have started complimenting my hair on a regular basis:)</li>
            <li> Really was surprised how this one shines over the perfector.  It&#x27;s made well, has a comfortable handle and even on the lower setting it curls fast, not to mention that it&#x27;s soo much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this curling brush. It holds you hair on the brush (I have fine hair). It does not leave crimps like a curling iron. It heats up fast, but is cool to the touch on the bristles. It is great for when you don&#x27;t want to wash and blow dry your hair. It is great at giving body and shine. What can I say it is great!(and a great price too)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but not anything amazing like it claims. It&#x27;s just a curling brush and it doesn&#x27;t even curl well because it&#x27;so large. Returned.</li>
            <li> works well on my fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> easy to use helps my curly hair look better less frizz and soft curls.Does not ever burn my hands when using</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have thick, coarse hair and most of the stylers like this have fine wire bristles on the brush part which did not hold up to my hair type. This one has thick silicone bristles that move smoothly through my hair. It also has a high heat setting, which is essential for thick, coarse hair. It also  has a cool to the touch tip, which makes using the styler much easier. NOTE: This does not dry hair, your hair must be dry first before using. Another plus, this was the least expensive product of this type that I found.</li>
            <li> This styler heats up quickly and works very well - it curls and will also straighten, but not sure about naturally curly hair - since I am not blessed with that, I wouldn&#x27;t know if this would straighten curls, but on my fine hair this styler does the trick.</li>
            <li> Great styling iron. Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive ones this one works great.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Heats up quickly. Very easy to style hair when it&#x27;s dry. Straight or curls.&lt;br /&gt;Tyche, thank you for making this top notch product affordable and good for our hair!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great.</li>
            <li> Nice I really like it</li>
            <li> Nice shiny hair.  I just wish the wand was a little smaller around.  My hair is short.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I had ordered the more expensive caliste brush iron but returned it to,purchase this one.  It does an excellent job for a lot less money. Great quality and great product</li>
            <li> It works ! Good price !</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews.  There were not many but the reviews were good.  The tyche dual ionic ceramic therma styler has worked great for me and the price was right.  I have tried the other higher priced ones and I do not see any difference in the end result.</li>
            <li> Works great! Brand new!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really curl my hair. I like it and all and I feel like it is less damaging than a curling iron or flat iron just wish it got slightly hotter. I can get the ends to curl under ever so slightly but it doesn&#x27;t really add volume or anything.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the reviews, and I am not sorry. This surpassed my expectations. I&#x27;m a bit of a hair snob when it comes to products and styling tools and I was prepared to spend $100+, but then I read the reviews and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. The curl is just perfect, hair comes out looking soft and the bounce in the curl is almost too much. This will replace my rollers when I just want to do a quick job or touch up, I love it, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent iron, delivered on time. Would love to have 3 settings. High will burn my hair, and low doesn&#x27;t work as quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it. Heats up fast and give my super straight hair curl and volume.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  I&#x27;ve always used brush type curling irons and considered buy the $100.00 brush styler from television but saw this one on Amazon and gave it a try. My hair is mid-length straight and hard to curl.  With this ceramic therma styler I am able to get lift at the root and bouncy waves that last all way. Styling my dry hair in the morning  takes as little as 10 minutes. Styler is sturdy and well made. Considering buying a second one as a back up.</li>
            <li> This styling tool has become my favorite as I have used it exclusively for the past 2-months, since it&#x27;s arrival. You can not beat the price but more importantly, the value and quality of this heat styling brush. I wash my hair, let it air dry and then use this. My hair is wavy/curly and I am able to get my hair smooth and under control. I love the way this leaves my hair feeling soft and looking &amp;#34;flowing&#x27; with soft curls that a very fashion forward. I was using a Helen of Troy curling iron exclusively for many years, but that would end up frying the ends of my hair, no matter what brand of heat protectant I used, ranging from top of the line, i.e., expensive to pharmacy off the shelf &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; stuff. The ends of my hair are in better shape, and my hair is left looking nice for two days. On the third day I &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; by running this brush through my hair. I would also like to note, that my hair is very thick and this tool helps me accomplish my styling task quickly. The grip has a soft silicone type texture and I enjoy having a hi-lo heat setting. The &amp;#34;perfector&amp;#34; sold by QVC only goes up to 395 degrees (or so) while this one goes up to 410-425 and does not exceed 450 degrees, which is good because that type of heat will cause major damage to most hair types. The &amp;#34;perfector&amp;#34; is expensive ($100-150) and for less than $30 (US), you will get a tool that will meet the standards of the tool sold on QVC. You can hold onto the brush of this tool and NOT get burned. Honestly, I was tired of having the accidental burn mark on m forehead, the back of my neck or my ear lobes (it&#x27;s inevitable especially when working fast). Anyhow, I highly recommend this styling tool because you will reach for it all the time--I know I do. In fact, I keep this tool on my counter, while the others are stored away. Even my husband has commented how nice my hair looks and was surprised to see how I actually USE this tool rather than have it store away as a &amp;#34;notion.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase. For years I have been using a very cheap curling iron. It was all I could find in the brush style in my local Walmart /discount stores.  Then I looked at Target and they had very good ceramic ones but they were 100.00. I didn&#x27;t want to pay that price not knowing if it would work any different than the cheap one I had been using.  They both curl the hair right?  What more can a curling iron do?  When I saw Amazon offer this one and I could see the great ratings and the good things said....I gave it a whirl.  The price was decent enough to try for sure!  I cannot tell you what a difference curling irons can make!!  I do not understand it but I am so glad I gave this one a try.  My hair always carried a frizzy look on the shorter layers and this iron just smooth&#x27;s them out so beautifully. I have very thin hair and could never get my hair to twist on a non bush iron.  With the bristles they hold the hair in place while winding the hair up. The iron holds very nice in the hand, the cord is nice and long, but you will find a problem with the on/off switch like others mentioned.  They need to fix this but maybe that is why they are selling at such a good price.  Anyway, I fixed it by winding a rubber band around it.  I use one setting and I just unplug it instead of using the switch. The rubber band holds the switch in a steady place.... otherwise your hand is sliding it in the off or unwanted heat position without you even knowing it.</li>
            <li> I really did not have much success with this product as I still like using a curling iron better.  I was looking for a styling tool that would be less damaging on my already damaged hair but my ineptness at learning to use this product did not help as much as I thought it would.  I think with practice it might be a very good styling tool.... Just not for me. It did heat up very fast which is a plus and I think with practice it might be a good product.</li>
            <li> I really like my curling brush, I was looking at another one but it was $100.00 dollars and I thought I would give this one a try. The best thing about it is that it heats up very quickly and you never burn your scalp.  My hair routine just takes a few minutes, wish maybe that the rod would be a little smaller as I have very short hair but it still works well it has eliminated so much time from my hair routine.  The results are awesome I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the very expensive brand. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool....theres one out there that runs about $90.00...no better than this one! I wear a bob with a stacked back, and my hair can get a little fuzzy and very full when I blow dry it...this tool tames it and makes my hair more &amp;#34;finished looking&amp;#34;! P.S I do hair for a living, and I know a good tool when I use it!</li>
            <li> Doesnt really curl - but smoothes hair.  So if your hair is frizzy or needs to be smoothed, I guess it would be good for you.</li>
            <li> Great response time and wonderful product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Love this works so good on my hair</li>
            <li> Great styler! It does everything they claim it does and has never gotten too hot for my hands to hold the brush head. Recommend!</li>
            <li> It is 12/21/2015 not quite a year later from the first use, teeth have broken off not enough left to use the iron heat still works but not enough teeth to use,</li>
            <li> Works as well as my Prestige brand does. I decided to try this one to see if the bristles last. Heats up quick. Wish they could place the on/off switch in a spot where you could not accidentally turn it off.</li>
            <li> In sorry hate to make a bad review but was sent a email to do so .. Very bad heating mechanism .. Does nothing at all actually .. Very dim light and poor function..!sorry to share</li>
            <li> Having only used it 2 times, I can&#x27;t really give it an opinion.  I like that it is very light and seems to do the job as the more expensive one did.</li>
            <li> I would love it but the designer put the on off switch on the handle right where you have to hold it. It&#x27;s to easy to keep turning up or off the heat while using. Otherwise it seems like a nice product. 9-16-15 I am editing my original review. There is one other problem with this styling wand that I do not like. I accidentally forgot to switch it off or unplug it. When I came back home after working all day, I found it had been on all day and was still hot!!! This is definitely a real safety issue! It should automatically shut off, when it is left unattended for 10 or 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I am possibly the world&#x27;s worst at styling my own hair, but I find this styler to be even more foolproof than my flat iron.  I have thin, flat hair, and this leaves me with nice soft waves and added volume.  And, I have hopes that this will cause less damage!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, is comfortable in my hand, and is easy to use.  I really like it.</li>
