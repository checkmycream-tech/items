    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I ordered this from HOLLYWOODglam and it is absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li>It came wrapped up and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I tried it on and it is beautiful!</li>
            <li>came before the deadline that Amazon gave me and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect addition to my polishes and for my nail art designing.</li>
            <li>It is really good!</li>
            <li>I gave this to my niece as a gift, she loved it!</li>
            <li>The color was beautiful when I put it on</li>
            <li>Very light colored!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Purchased to use on top of my acrylic nails - the color was nice, but the gel I use over my acrylics did not agree with whatever was in this polish -- probably will not use again.</li>
            <li>like most everyone else stated, it does chip WAY too easily, yet it takes a lot of polish to take off!</li>
            <li>I love this color and what it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>It is not as purple, at first, like it shows but it turns out absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>So I went to return this but found that the seller expects you to pay for the return shipping which is more than the original product cost.  </li>
            <li>The color changes in the sun, but she also discovered it changes more quickly under hot/cold water.</li>
            <li>To me, however, it just seems like a cheap gimmick.  </li>
            <li>It could be that I put a top coat on it the first time but</li>
            <li>I Was really excited to get this .</li>
            <li>I thought it would be cool to have polish that changes colors.</li>
            <li>It is more of a mauve and champagne or rose gold than a purple and pink.</li>
            <li>do have to apply heat to it in order for the color to change, but it is still a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>The purple color is very pretty</li>
            <li>it is a very pretty color when applied</li>
            <li>I really would not suggest anyone buy it!!</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>this product, not so much!</li>
            <li>Pretty sparkle purple</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really pretty color, but the mood changing element did not work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came fast, But the product does not work like it claims.</li>
            <li>Yea... not so much.</li>
            <li>It is more like a mauve pink that it turns into, but it still could change colors again.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I highly doubt my mood never changed over a week!  </li>
            <li>Even with a kevlar topcoat it still chipped off really fast.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying from HOLLYWOODglam and this product if you like purple/pinkish.</li>
            <li>THE COLOR WENT FROM A LIGHT PURPLE TO A DARK PINK!!!!!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It works, but not enough to justify buying a whole bottle of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>It stayed the same color the whole time.</li>
            <li>pretty but not very durable</li>
            <li>while it is a pretty, sparkly dark hot pink, it does not change to purple</li>
            <li>It was an extremely light pink, almost a white color and changed to a darker pink.</li>
            <li>A waste of money &amp; I didn&#x27;t even receive the right color, smh</li>
            <li>it was not what I expected, not long lasting, not worth the money and was much to light to be noticed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It came fast, But the product does not work like it claims. There is no color change. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> it was not what I expected, not long lasting, not worth the money and was much to light to be noticed</li>
            <li> If you like this stuff, then go for it.  To me, however, it just seems like a cheap gimmick.  It works, but not enough to justify buying a whole bottle of nail polish.  &amp;#34;OOOHHHH THE COLOR WENT FROM A LIGHT PURPLE TO A DARK PINK!!!!!&amp;#34;  Yea... not so much.</li>
            <li> This nail polish does not color change. I had it on my nails for almost a week and it never changed. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from HOLLYWOODglam and it is absolutely beautiful! It came wrapped up and in perfect condition. I tried it on and it is beautiful! You do have to wait a little bit for it to change colors, but it definitely does what it says it does. It does change colors.

This is a perfect addition to my polishes and for my nail art designing. I love it! Thank you for this product! It is really good! No complaints!</li>
            <li> The purple color is very pretty but it does not change colors like described. I wish I would of read the reviews before I bought it</li>
            <li> The color was beautiful when I put it on but it never changed after that.  It&#x27;s supposed to be a mood polish.  I highly doubt my mood never changed over a week!  It could be that I put a top coat on it the first time but the second application I didn&#x27;t and it still didn&#x27;t change.  Even with a kevlar topcoat it still chipped off really fast.  Pretty color but I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> Shade isn&#x27;t at all what it looks like. Very light colored!</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t the same as it says and it doesn&#x27;t change for anything.  Save your money. Buy another brand.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be cool to have polish that changes colors. this product, not so much! while it is a pretty, sparkly dark hot pink, it does not change to purple what so ever! like most everyone else stated, it does chip WAY too easily, yet it takes a lot of polish to take off! I regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> A waste of money &amp; I didn&#x27;t even receive the right color, smh</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...has not changed color so I gave product away</li>
            <li> The color is nothing like it shows on here. It is more of a mauve and champagne or rose gold than a purple and pink. But it does change colors depending on if its hot or cold.</li>
            <li> Within minutes of putting this on,  my nails turned pink and the tips stayed purple. Looks like a French manicure. It leaves a matte finish though.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use on top of my acrylic nails - the color was nice, but the gel I use over my acrylics did not agree with whatever was in this polish -- probably will not use again.</li>
            <li> Does not change color at all.  Painted nails and placed hand in very hot water and then cold water for several minutes each and there was absolutely no change in color.  I attempted this process several times in the hope that there would be some change.  So I went to return this but found that the seller expects you to pay for the return shipping which is more than the original product cost.  I contacted the seller to ask if they could pay the cost since the product does not work as advertised and never heard back from the seller.</li>
            <li> Never changed colors and was a total waste of my money</li>
            <li> Order this color and another color never got this one I got 2 of the same color and it didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Pretty sparkle purple but won&#x27;t change color....:-(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really pretty color, but the mood changing element did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;It just stayed the lighter color.</li>
            <li> It does not work as the label says. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Save your money. This item does not do what it is supposed to do. There is no color change whatsoever. It doesn&#x27;t even stay on well.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever gave this item 5 stars must be the ones selling it. The shade you get doesn&#x27;t even match the shade on the screen.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is awful. it chips and smells like toxic chemicals. I really would not suggest anyone buy it!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t change colors when u put it on . Color is a lot different from picture. Goes on real ugly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you are wanting this to change colors. It stayed the same color the whole time. I kept it because the polish dries almost instantly and I let my daughter use it so she doesn&#x27;t have to wait for her nails to dry before she plays.</li>
            <li> I got this and it wasn&#x27;t even purple. It was an extremely light pink, almost a white color and changed to a darker pink. I like it but wanted to warn people its not the color on the screen shot.</li>
            <li> pretty but not very durable</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece as a gift, she loved it! The color changes in the sun, but she also discovered it changes more quickly under hot/cold water.</li>
            <li> Sucks peals off in a day</li>
            <li> I Was really excited to get this . it is a very pretty color when applied but it does not change colors once so ever and it chips a lot.kind of a waste of money</li>
            <li> This polish is so hard to get off.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this and didnt like it, &amp;#34;it chipped off too easy&amp;#34;. .</li>
