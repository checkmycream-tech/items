            <li>I discovered this soap in England years ago and have always brought home a supply for years -- it is nice to find a place in the USA where I can buy it -- it is easier and cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely delighted to be able to buy this again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it --- the incredibly rich lather, the scent (which smells great in the shower but doesn&#x27;t linger strongly afterward), and how well made it is.  </li>
            <li>This beautiful, creamy, delightfully perfumed luxury soap has been my favorite for as long as I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin clear and lathers great!</li>
            <li>I first experienced this product in Ireland.</li>
            <li>just my thing :-)</li>
            <li>So glad I can order it online...</li>
            <li>I love this soap, I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The smell is gorgeous, fresh and lathers well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a girly feminine smell, I cannot even describe it, men would love it too, but it isn&#x27;t like a man product that women wouldn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon, now I don&#x27;t have to buy it while I&#x27;m overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but those who love it really love it.  </li>

            <li>Nice product and quick delivery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent evokes wonderful memories of time spent in Britain.</li>
            <li>This was a great soap, but the package I received today was far from the bars I just used</li>
            <li>Lush lather, great scent, good cleaning action.</li>
            <li>I reordered what I supposed was UK-made Imperial leather and it was a cheap Thai knockoff.</li>
            <li>so I am grateful to this seller who has made it available.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a cheap reproduction sans Imperial Leather perfume.</li>
            <li>We started using Imperial Leather soap 30 years ago at the Shangri-la in Hong Kong&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has made this available here.</li>
            <li>Very long lasting, lots of lather, great clean smell and GREAT to shave with, this is the Rolls Royce of fine bar soap.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find a source of this classic luxurious soap.</li>
            <li>The original is from UK.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Really good quality English soap -</li>
            <li>When I was in U-K last summer, I discovered Imperial Leather (bar) soap and loved the smell and feel of it.</li>
            <li>This is a true bar of soap unlike the concoctions sold in America.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell or foam like true Imperial Leather.</li>
            <li>We bought a whole case to keep her supplied for a while :)</li>
            <li>I have ordered multiple times and have received my order in good order</li>
            <li>It is clean smelling.well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Used this soap as I was brought up in England, the fragrence brings back many memories!</li>
            <li>The bars also last a lot longer than competing brands which is nice.</li>
            <li>Not knowing whether I liked it or not until I returned to the U.S., I only bought 3 bars.  </li>
            <li>It has a rich lather, cleans beautifully and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>My late wife(Elizabeth)was a &amp;#34;Londoner&amp;#34;.She introduced me to this wonderful soap,and I still use it!This particular version is a Thai Import.</li>
            <li>Son loves this soap, he first purchased while living in England</li>
            <li>I love this soap, I bought some in the UK to bring back with me.</li>
            <li>The fragrance takes me back to my childhood - I will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to obtain it until quite recently from Rite Aid but now for some reason they have stopped stocking it.</li>
            <li>Was first introduced to this soap in Scotland.  </li>
            <li>it cleans better than any other product and leaves me smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The description is not honest about this soap, and when I read the label after receiving it, I saw that this company has licensed the rights to use the name, but is making its own soap!  </li>
            <li>and I keep a large supply on hand.  </li>
            <li>My in laws used to buy this soap in large cases twenty five years ago.</li>
            <li>Yes, $2.00 a bar is expensive, but happy skin is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the real thing.</li>
            <li>The 12 case lasts me the whole year.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price considering</li>
            <li>but it just works better than other soaps.</li>
            <li>Be warned, this is NOT the original Imperial Leather, it looks like it, it is the same color and shape but no distinctive Imperial Leather perfume!  </li>
            <li>This is the way to buy the real thing and not to pay stupidly high shipping charges.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few soaps that we both like, and, although it has what might be described as a masculine smell when we&#x27;re using it, it leaves our skin with a fresh scent that is not &amp;#34;masculine.&amp;#34;  We love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe the seller&#x27;s source has changed since some of these older reviews.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that likes a mild soap - can be used as facial wash too.</li>
            <li>Each bar, about the same size as an American bar, lasts many times longer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Cany yet gigure out why the label on the top of the soap is different from other Cussons Imperial leather soaps</li>
            <li>This is the fourth time we&#x27;ve ordered a case and will continue to do so as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for nearly 40 years</li>
            <li>placed this order yesterday, bought from British Delights and fulfilled very swiftly by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was amazed and pleasantly surprised at the speed in which this order was fulfilled.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I have been purchasing for the last 12 years, since I was first introduced to it.</li>
            <li>So Sad to see another old favorite bite the dust.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half as much as the soap shipped from London.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s half as much as the soap shipped from London.</li>
            <li> She used Cussons Imperial Leather her entire life and won&#x27;t use any other soap on her soft creamy British complexion.  </li>
            <li> up.!t is not Hard milled and the frangrance is half of what it was.  </li>
            <li> Says moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t do so much as to leave you feeling slick.</li>
            <li> Long Lasting.</li>
            <li> Amazon dealt very efficiently with my complaint</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this British bath soap a few years ago and it immediately became a favorite - smells faintly of leather, but not over powering and leaves your skin feeling like baby skin without residue.  </li>
            <li> The smell is just masculine enough without feeling forced like Zest or Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> I can not possibly use any other soap.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the real thing, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I collect bar soaps from our travels around the world, and I discovered this one at a little grocery store in Harrich, England, while our ship was docked.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding it</li>
            <li> It is not generally available in the US.</li>
            <li> I fail to see ANY other difference?</li>
            <li> I purchased the 12-pack, but disappointed because it&#x27;s not the WHITE soap!</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed to see that the soaps are all made in Thailand instead of UK mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> I eagerly opened the package to be at once disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Excellent I recommended smells great refreshing</li>
            <li> I discovered this soap in England years ago and have always brought home a supply for years -- it is nice to find a place in the USA where I can buy it -- it is easier and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Our order was lost and today we got a replacement. Thank you. We love the soap!!</li>
            <li> I will always use Imperial Leather soap since my father in-law brought it back from England. The smell is so amazing</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; enough for me. I like having a signature scent....just my thing :-)</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this British bath soap a few years ago and it immediately became a favorite - smells faintly of leather, but not over powering and leaves your skin feeling like baby skin without residue.  So glad I can order it online...trips to England though wonderful are costly.</li>
            <li> Son loves this soap, he first purchased while living in England</li>
            <li> I love this soap, I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, I bought some in the UK to bring back with me. The smell is gorgeous, fresh and lathers well. You feel like you&#x27;re pampering yourself with the finest luxury. It isn&#x27;t a girly feminine smell, I cannot even describe it, men would love it too, but it isn&#x27;t like a man product that women wouldn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tried this, you would be hooked on it forever. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon, now I don&#x27;t have to buy it while I&#x27;m overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measurements of soap are 3 1/2\\&quot; x 2 1/4\\&quot; x 1 1/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The smell is just masculine enough without feeling forced like Zest or Irish Spring. The bars also last a lot longer than competing brands which is nice. Says moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t do so much as to leave you feeling slick. I can not possibly use any other soap.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting, lots of lather, great clean smell and GREAT to shave with, this is the Rolls Royce of fine bar soap.</li>
            <li> I received the package yesterday. It was a pack of 12 soaps and arrived in time. But I was disappointed to see that the soaps are all made in Thailand instead of UK mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> This soap was in our self catering apartment in Scotland when we checked in ... and we have used it ever since. Went to the Co-Op on the way to Edinburgh airport as we left and bought several bars. We now order it through Amazon. Great fragrance and texture. A reminder of a great golf trip!</li>
            <li> I use it for shaving, terrific product!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I am from England, and grew up using Imperial Leather. It has a rich lather, cleans beautifully and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality as advertised.</li>
            <li> I reordered what I supposed was UK-made Imperial leather and it was a cheap Thai knockoff. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use to get this soap in England,My uncle use to send it to me. This soap make your skin feel very clean and does not make you feel like soap is still on your skin. It is clean smelling.well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for nearly 40 years and I keep a large supply on hand.  it cleans better than any other product and leaves me smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of a day that goes by without showering with it.</li>
            <li> Really good quality English soap - My family used it when I was a kid in England - when I saw I could buy it through Amazon I ordered it immediately. Maybe its just me but it just works better than other soaps. The fragrance takes me back to my childhood - I will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> All was GREAT with this purchase! Delivery was significantly faster that promised! Used this soap as I was brought up in England, the fragrence brings back many memories!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!  I love Imperial Leather and used to get it from the Vermont Country Store, but this is NOT it!  It does not smell good at all, and it is made in Thailand.  The description is not honest about this soap, and when I read the label after receiving it, I saw that this company has licensed the rights to use the name, but is making its own soap!  I bought it with Amazon points, and would have to pay UPS a lot to return it - they won&#x27;t let you use the USPS.  So I am just out all my points for this bad-smelling soap!  Maybe the seller doesn&#x27;t know the difference, but I do!  Maybe the seller&#x27;s source has changed since some of these older reviews.</li>
            <li> I have ben using this soap for 40 years.  I take it with me when I travel, why?  Because this soap is the only one I can use on my skin that never has caused any problems.  I have trouble finding it so I am grateful to this seller who has made it available. Yes, $2.00 a bar is expensive, but happy skin is worth it.</li>
            <li> Pros...received in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Cons...Not 125 g but 115 g after packaging...Made in Thailand....Have purchased this soap in UK, produced in UK.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; on package, a misnomer. The original is from UK.&lt;br /&gt;Will try, cant be bothered to return for &amp;#34;not as described&amp;#34;. Hope it is as good !</li>
            <li> Excellent lather, reminds me of many trips to London.  I would recommend this product to anyone that likes a mild soap - can be used as facial wash too.</li>
            <li> Made by Cussons and has been around for years and years and years. This beautiful, creamy, delightfully perfumed luxury soap has been my favorite for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to obtain it until quite recently from Rite Aid but now for some reason they have stopped stocking it. So that is what brought me to faithful Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely delighted to be able to buy this again. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed this order yesterday, bought from British Delights and fulfilled very swiftly by Amazon. I was amazed and pleasantly surprised at the speed in which this order was fulfilled. I eagerly opened the package to be at once disappointed. Be warned, this is NOT the original Imperial Leather, it looks like it, it is the same color and shape but no distinctive Imperial Leather perfume!  Also, the soap packages are different and the label stuck in the middle of the soap. It appears to be a cheap reproduction sans Imperial Leather perfume. Amazon dealt very efficiently with my complaint and I have now ordered a packet of 4 from another company, Cooking Marvellous.  Will post a review about those when they come.</li>
            <li> We started using Imperial Leather soap 30 years ago at the Shangri-la in Hong Kong&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has made this available here. We bought a years supply&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderfully luxurious soap.&lt;br /&gt;Roberta Abbey&lt;br /&gt;Oceanside,  NY</li>
            <li> When I was in U-K last summer, I discovered Imperial Leather (bar) soap and loved the smell and feel of it. I brought six bars home with me and then found this online. I purchased the 12-pack, but disappointed because it&#x27;s not the WHITE soap! It&#x27;s a tan color and the smell is definitely not what I like. I will give it away.</li>
            <li> I want to buy it which is made in England, not from Thailand !</li>
            <li> the soap is not what I was buying</li>
            <li> Was first introduced to this soap in Scotland.  It keeps your skin clear and lathers great!</li>
            <li> Probably the nicest fragrance for the man&#x27;s shower. Ran into it in Scotland and had to order this when I returned home. All the men in the family use it now.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Great value.</li>
            <li> We used this soap on our visit to England. We brought a lot home, but when we found we could order it here, I have been buying it for him for him every year. The scent is great and the lather wonderful.</li>
            <li> Been trying to find a source for some time. Can&#x27;t rely on Big Lots to have a refresh supply!!  This is the way to buy the real thing and not to pay stupidly high shipping charges. I am a happy man.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this soap.  This is the fourth time we&#x27;ve ordered a case and will continue to do so as long as it is available.  Great lather and wonderful scent.  I have very sensitive skin but this one works well for me.  Besides the scent brings back our fond times in England.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves this soap.  It works well in the shower, but prefer liquid soap for the sink.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this product was still available in the US. I had been able to purcase Imperial Leather bath soap in Canada for many years.&lt;br /&gt;About 5 years ago it was no longer avilable in Canada. It was not being imported by the distributor.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to have found a source through Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> My in laws used to buy this soap in large cases twenty five years ago. We loved it, and were happy to find it again. Lush lather, great scent, good cleaning action.</li>
            <li> My wife is British living in America.  She used Cussons Imperial Leather her entire life and won&#x27;t use any other soap on her soft creamy British complexion.  This is a true bar of soap unlike the concoctions sold in America.  It doesn&#x27;t contain anti-bacterial skin drying ingredients which can&#x27;t be understood without a chemistry degree.  This is traditional soap.  Each bar, about the same size as an American bar, lasts many times longer.  I&#x27;m now hooked on it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Soap is very nice and smells great. This is the only brand I have been purchasing for the last 12 years, since I was first introduced to it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find a source of this classic luxurious soap. It&#x27;s scent evokes wonderful memories of time spent in Britain.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the real thing, unfortunately. Doesn&#x27;t smell or foam like true Imperial Leather. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the real thing.</li>
            <li> JUst love the smell of this soap.  The 12 case lasts me the whole year.</li>
            <li> This was a great soap, but the package I received today was far from the bars I just used up.!t is not Hard milled and the frangrance is half of what it was.  The bargain price IS NOT a bargain.  So Sad to see another old favorite bite the dust.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this product in Ireland. It is not generally available in the US. I love the scent, which is unlike anything else I&#x27;ve used. Now that I know where ti find it, I will get it again.</li>
            <li> I have using this soap menu years</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this for quite some time, it is husband&#x27;s favourite soap.  Got it for him as a Valentine&#x27;s day present.  It did not disappoint.  Reasonable price considering it comes from England.  It arrived before the stated date which was a bonus!</li>
            <li> My hubby and some of our friends really love this soap from the UK.  It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but those who love it really love it.  We give it for gifts at Christmas!</li>
            <li> Just how I remermbered</li>
            <li> I collect bar soaps from our travels around the world, and I discovered this one at a little grocery store in Harrich, England, while our ship was docked.  Not knowing whether I liked it or not until I returned to the U.S., I only bought 3 bars.  Once we got home and tried it, both my husband and I absolutely loved it --- the incredibly rich lather, the scent (which smells great in the shower but doesn&#x27;t linger strongly afterward), and how well made it is.  So I ordered a case of 12 on Amazon and now I know I don&#x27;t have to go back to England to get this wonderful soap!  This is one of the few soaps that we both like, and, although it has what might be described as a masculine smell when we&#x27;re using it, it leaves our skin with a fresh scent that is not &amp;#34;masculine.&amp;#34;  We love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will refer it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> My late wife(Elizabeth)was a &amp;#34;Londoner&amp;#34;.She introduced me to this wonderful soap,and I still use it!This particular version is a Thai Import.It&#x27;s half as much as the soap shipped from London.I fail to see ANY other difference?</li>
            <li> Our daughter, living overseas, asked for this soap because she feels it&#x27;s the best cleaning soap she&#x27;s ever used.  We bought a whole case to keep her supplied for a while :)</li>
            <li> Nice product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> A good price, but it is made in Thailand. Have to do until our next trip to the UK.</li>
            <li> I love the soap and am able to get it at my door. I have ordered multiple times and have received my order in good order</li>
            <li> CUSSONS  IMPERIAL  LEATHER  SOAP  HAS  A  WONDERFUL  SMELL  WITH  THE  GOLD  TRADE  MARK  PLATE  IN  THE  MIDDLE  OF  BAR. I&#x27;VE  BEEN  USING  THIS SOAP FOR 30  YEARS. IT&#x27;S  A  ALL  TIME  FAVORITE  OF  MINE.  YOU  WILL SIMPLY  AGREE !  TRY IT !</li>
            <li> Great valiue. Long Lasting. Wonderful smell. Cany yet gigure out why the label on the top of the soap is different from other Cussons Imperial leather soaps</li>
