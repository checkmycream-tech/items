            <li>I used this product for a year now, and this is one of the best purchases</li>

            <li>These work incredibly well.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t ideally designed for just the nose  &lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I view it as an excellent purchase and am happy to have it.  </li>
            <li>I am mostly happy with this product but there are some issues that keep it from being excellent.   </li>

            <li>have been using it for about a month and its really great.</li>
            <li>The unit is great for nose hair and eyebrow trimming.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>This does not do a great job trimming your hairs.  </li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This device works great and does not pinch or hurt.</li>
            <li>I bought this in 2008 and it&#x27;s working great and as well today as it did seven years ago.</li>
            <li>This is a good product at a good price!</li>
            <li>Very handy.</li>
            <li>Does a very nice job on ears, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t even trim hair effectively!  </li>
            <li>it was the replacement for the discontinued excellent Panasonic ER411 that I had for many years.</li>
            <li>Honestly!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>great price good service</li>
            <li>Works great, the light is a great idea!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am very pleased and this trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works perfectly well, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The good news is, this thing works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my fiance &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li>In this age of over-hyped products, it is good to find one that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>but still.. it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>However, the performance is not quite as good, so it takes awhile to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price</li>
            <li>This unit has good power, trims hair with no problems.</li>
            <li>good product&lt;</li>
            <li>good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good quality design.</li>
            <li>I loved it, no hair pulling or irritation in nose after the use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with the Panasonic ER421.  </li>
            <li>This is a good item for the price.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic also sells replacement blades, so that is good.  </li>
            <li>Light isn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li>I too was delighted that he welcomed it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer was good while it lasted...</li>
            <li>i did a good amount of research for nose trimmers and found this one.  </li>
            <li>I needed to replace the one that I had which was not as good but also did the job.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a good job trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Operates on battery, but the product is good.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Panasonic use to make a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>nuff said...not that good for ears...</li>
            <li>Does a good job on eyebrows as well FYI.</li>
            <li>Good product to gift.</li>
            <li>To my surprise and relief, I find this trimmer never pulls hairs, but does a good trimming job.</li>
            <li>Good question</li>
            <li>and it did a fair job of trimming hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either good</li>
            <li>This is a good nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>THE GOOD:  </li>
            <li>and he LOVED it.</li>
            <li>but it can go in the shower so its good for me.</li>
            <li>When it works, it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It looks good.</li>
            <li>The cheaper Panasonic is probably just as good.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it was wet/dry.  </li>
            <li>It is probably as good as any you will find.  </li>
            <li>and then so it doesn’t get a good rating nor would I recommend it or buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Good trimmer, but</li>
            <li>This one is really good to get rid of almost all the hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved this thing while I had it.</li>
            <li>so I figured that this would be a good bet.</li>
            <li>It does not do a good job in my nose.  </li>
            <li>Works good for ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li>but this one seemed to strike me as a good balance between convenience and cost.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and the clean results.</li>
            <li>, It does an excellent job both for the nose hairs as well as the ear hairs, close and clean.</li>
            <li>The greatest feature he liked about it was the light component.</li>
            <li>It was quick and the added eye brow trimmers are great!</li>
            <li>user-replaceable battery is also quite handy - great with your own rechargeables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have used the Panasonic Nose Trimmer ER411 for years and have been very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that we are both pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Compared to my od trimmer this is quiter, better, easier to manuver and fits great in my hand.</li>
            <li>It works OK now but its not that great a design.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly, in great condition and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>has like also because the light help better to check out a perfect TRim</li>
            <li>Recommend it for sure!</li>

            <li>It&#x60;s a very good deal, only need one AA battery if you use an alkaline one can use it for 3-5 months, very good quality and performance</li>
            <li>The bathroom is the most brightly lit room in my house.   </li>
            <li>the light was a great addition to help locate hairs that would otherwise have been missed.  </li>
            <li>This replaced a great Sharper Image Turbo-Groomer 5.0 model that wore out and is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the light helps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair this trimmer is supposed to cut, but it don&#x27;t cut mine.  </li>
            <li>The blade is catching on the interior metal.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a must own for every man.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job quite nicely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>A magnifying mirror with good vanity mirror lighting is better.</li>
            <li>Nice image - a guy with a nose trimmer hanging from his nose -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying various nose hair trimmers for years in search of the best, because none of them have been all that great.  </li>
            <li>It really is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am very happy with the purchase as is my husband who happily uses this handy tool regularly.  </li>
            <li>Its water resistance which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>nice unit, but</li>
            <li>nice instructions with the product.</li>
            <li>I like the feel in my hand, kind of like a mini version of the Oral-B Triumph toothbrish series, which I also own and recommend.</li>
            <li>As for the ear, have you ever tried to look into your own ear canal?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to see a video review of this product, but it does keep the nostrils and ears nice and tidy.</li>
            <li>The light is a good idea but the cutter doesn&#x27;t work that good.</li>
            <li>I called the Panasonic warranty department (800-332-5368) who were kind and courteous, but the Rep informed me that the blade assembly (block) was excluded from warranty.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice tool.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Make sure the battery is good.</li>
            <li>Really is this the best we can expect????</li>
            <li>I guess if the power goes out, it&#x27;s a handy backup flashlight?  </li>
            <li>Product was as described and  advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied  with my purchase , Price was good</li>
            <li>Does a nice job on ears.</li>
            <li>This can be used to effectively remove hair from every area, nose, ears, etc.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect - thanks.  </li>
            <li>The top compartment traps a fair of nose hair shavings and mucus.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice unit.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer is great; it trims your hairs, whether they are from your nose or ears, with a clean no hassle way.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model Panasonic that always worked perfect until I needed to replace it.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER421KC is a fantastic piece of grooming equipment that works perfectly and quickly.  </li>
            <li>It worked great, has lots of cool features..</li>
            <li>This compact cutter is very effective in removing nose and ear hair and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The best she could offer was for me to purchase a new block,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about two months now, and it does a good job though it does sound kind of underpowered.</li>
            <li>Not the total best trimmer in the world but really good for what you pay.</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly and efficiently and  is a great grooming aid.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic does the best job, is easy to use, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It works good, effective, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, cuts it cleanly.</li>
            <li>The construction of the unit is very sturdy, though, and feels very good to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>I use it since years with great success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too impressed by it so far (after 2-3 uses).  </li>
            <li>But based on trimming, I&#x27;d have to say the Panasonic is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly light, compact and feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I own the Wahl trimmer and have never been satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, the trimmer performed better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Tried about 4 or 5 of these before finding this one, clearly the best of them.</li>
            <li>The light is good for a post-trim inspection.  </li>
            <li>It worked brilliantly, as I wasn&#x27;t putting it through anything intense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s comfortable and feels good.</li>
            <li>Gentleman, if I have to have a meeting with one more college professor, economist, or scientist who looks as though they don&#x27;t own a mirror--I am going to shoot myself.  </li>
            <li>but this one not even as bright as the power light on my computer.  </li>
            <li>The light is good too.</li>
            <li>the trimmer itself is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far...</li>
            <li>The light &amp;#34;never&amp;#34; shines where it will do any good.</li>
            <li>Light is good for checking your work after the job, it does not point into your nose.</li>
            <li>This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>I buy this product on amazon, and is a excelent product the light is good when you trim your nose.</li>
            <li>In the beginning this trimmer worked exceptionally well in my husband&#x27;s ears, but the blades dulled very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is great to use; easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love love love this thing!</li>
            <li>Works great, does a very nice job on tiny hairs too!  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice trimmer and the light is kind of cool, you could also use the light in an emergency and have some light!!</li>
            <li>This product worked great when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li>I had good expectations for this product based on other reviewers, but I found it to be medicre at best.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for the first 6 months or so</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t do that great of a job in the first place.</li>
            <li>worked great at first but died within 6 months of use  </li>
            <li>exactly as described, worked perfectly, great communication would recommend purchasing from this vendor if anyone is considering this type of purchase</li>
            <li>The top twists off easily for very easy and effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not well constructed - very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This trimmer trims very smooth.</li>
            <li>very light use.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to use, and trims hairs nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During its life it worked well and effectively and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The light just shines all around my nose, it&#x27;s somewhat comical!</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine and is handy.</li>
            <li>This is a very good nose trimmer and the replacement for my old Wahl - which lasted about a month.  </li>
            <li>But, this one is quieter (very good while trimming inside ears), trims the hair closer to the skin, and never pulls the hairs like the old one did.  </li>
            <li>Worked OK up to then.</li>
            <li>Has good battery life and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering the manual one, sounds like it is built better....</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>The quality &amp; power was much better than the Wahl, and the Panasonic trimmed better too.  </li>
            <li>but I still think a product should be able to withstand some travel...</li>
            <li>I have yet to call Panasonic, but I sure plan on it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just so damn satisfying.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a distraction, than an improvement...</li>
            <li>It seems to be a more precision blade assembly</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer over a year ago and was satisfied with it intially, however after a year - it just died.  </li>
            <li>Imagine a power driven nose hair puller - that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m glad for the better on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>What more needs to be said about a nose hair trimmer??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>something sure does.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my boyfriend which is much better than the Panasonic ER405AC Wet/Dry Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer I bought for myself.</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; such a good price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well pleased with this device.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d say that unless you have tremors or something, you&#x27;d be much better off with a $3-pair of manicure scissors.  </li>
            <li>The top busted off but</li>
            <li>I have a feeling this may be the reason many have had their trimmers quit working.</li>
            <li>but it probably would have ended up costing me more in time and effort.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>There might be a better one out there but not for the price.</li>
            <li>but I do think it could be better in three ways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love them all.</li>
            <li>Buy confidently.</li>
            <li>panasonic devices are generally better than this.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;ll just have to use more often...</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer in 2006, and ended up using a cheapo trimmer that I picked up at Marshall&#x27;s much more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and it worked like magic.  </li>
            <li>ok, they were boarderline torture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve updated this review at the end - I found a better</li>
            <li>Buy it and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>And the light does come in handy.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.</li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>It was not my favorite gift to give.  </li>
            <li>If you want to use the light to target something, it&#x27;s handy.  </li>
            <li>better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheapo version availalbe at Pharmacies.</li>
            <li>and I love the light!  </li>
            <li>Boy, what a difference and not for the better.</li>
            <li>If this product is on sell, I would suggest buying it, but if it is not on sale, you might want to look for a better trimmer for the price.  </li>
            <li>OK, I have to admit...</li>
            <li>This works for me and it makes the trimmer more efficient in its cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Im sure.</li>
            <li>Still wish the hair was on top of my head.</li>
            <li>I own a PV GS500 camcorder and a ES8168S shaver - both fantastic products</li>
            <li>Trims better than anything I have tried, and I have tried just about everything.  </li>
            <li>I have too many chargers to carry every time I travel.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you do that.</li>
            <li>But in contrast to nose, many may have more hair on the ear rather than in the ear.    </li>
            <li>In the end I found one AA unit (among MANY AA Alkalines) that it does work with.</li>
            <li>If you have alot growing on up there or in your ears look for a more \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; strength model.</li>
            <li>you just mowed to get the many blades that resisted it.</li>
            <li>The light comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Quite possibly the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I dropped the top piece in my bathroom sink drain and couldn&#x27;t get it out.</li>
            <li>This one gets the job done in about 2 minutes and does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;ll see if best buy carries the same model, just to save all that&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The light feature could be nice, if an engineer would have designed it instead of Helen Keller.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that it works, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It works better for the nose.</li>
            <li>Tweezers work better .</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Well-built, light, safe to use and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>and I think was a better product than this one.</li>
            <li>no complaints and a hell of a lot better than the crappy ones i got drug stores branded with the name &#x27;conair&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Sharper Image one has a better tip design to catch and cut hair, which was why I went with 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>Price is ok.</li>
            <li>Light is nice to have.</li>
            <li>Seems to work okay</li>
            <li>This latest model is efficient, convenient with a stronger motor.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer</li>
            <li>ER112 works 100% better than this one.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Conair.  </li>
            <li>It lightweight, quite and safe</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure.</li>
            <li>None have lasted more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not pointed properly to be able to do so).  </li>
            <li>But most of all, this unit is super-cheap.  </li>
            <li>It assembles as so: the top plastic piece twists on into a groove that holds it, the \\&quot;guts\\</li>
            <li>CHEAP!      </li>
            <li>This works ok, but not like the trimmer I had before.</li>
            <li>It works but it needs more time to get things done.</li>
            <li>Nothing would pursuade her to repair the unit after 10 more minutes of discussion.  </li>
            <li>Good buy, worth the price.</li>
            <li>The ER415 is very much better.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;ve never had a nose trimmer</li>
            <li>He has only used it once in about two weeks because it did the job perfectly</li>
            <li>I was also glad we wouldn&#x27;t have another power cord to deal with.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic product works infinitely better than the Whal unit it is replacing.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>Good buy well worth the money.</li>
            <li>A better choice is Groom Mate.</li>
            <li>Much better than the electric Panasonic.</li>
            <li>My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and it is safe for him to use.</li>
            <li>Find better.</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>But I was expecting the motor to have more power considering</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely happy with it and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t lose with this trimmer  :)</li>
            <li>After about two years the top part stared falling off and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>So, if your are also using for ears on your SO, get the one with the light!</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried most of them including The Sharper Image.</li>
            <li>This was a worthwhile purchase, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would love to find one that works as well . . .</li>
            <li>I breath much better thru my noise believe it or not.     </li>
            <li>He used it maybe 10 times, then it wouldn&#x27;t cut any more.</li>
            <li>Battery life was good, this has been easy to clean, and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs.  </li>
            <li>This one is excellent, if you only use it once!.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe I&#x27;m writing a review about a nose trimmer. :)</li>
            <li>It does say on the package that it will trim no closer than 1/16&amp;#34;, so it&#x27;s OK for the ears, but I get better results with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>have been using it for many years now . . .</li>
            <li>I have a Panasonic shaver that I love</li>
            <li>along w/ trimming the hair around the top of ears/sideburns.  </li>
            <li>and it seems like its the best of all possible trimmers.</li>
            <li>I have bought another to make sure I got one around for grooming if one breaks.</li>
            <li>bought this model because a reviewer said the light was a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>But I’m glad I bought it now.  </li>
            <li>Ignore the recommendation to use disposable batteries, it works much better with the Sanyo Eneloop batteries.</li>
            <li>Im sure most women wouldn&#x27;t admit needing a trimmer, but I wanted to review the item because it does work so well.</li>
            <li>I think he like this better then the no</li>
            <li>What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li>This trimmer is much better than the trimmer I bought 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I had an model, it was slimmer had more power and was more efficient</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my husband and he is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend to people.</li>
            <li>The device does what it&#x27;s intended to do as advertised, but the tickling sensation it creates in my nose is more than I can stand for even 2 or 3 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Someone should do a better job of writing instructions.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s goofy.</li>
            <li>It worked well at first: great at trimming, easy to use, and did not hurt.</li>
            <li>Battery life has been great as it&#x27;s still working fine on it&#x27;s first battery.</li>
            <li>But his one does have a nice cushy handle for easy grip and is very quiet.</li>
            <li>I had an older Panasonic that was great but dropped it causing it to not work any longer, but could not find that model &amp; settled for this one.</li>
            <li>My older version was great</li>
            <li>i just did, it works great, better than the battery operated ones, and, as a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t have a motor to can out on you.  or needing new batteries all the time.  </li>
            <li>The light is good for a quick review of your work, and to see if you&#x27;ve missed anything.  </li>
            <li>It never pulls and it cuts very cleanly.</li>
            <li>The ER411NC was the best until now, but it would cause minor trimming agony.  </li>
            <li>This nose trimmer has a nice shape, heft and a cool rubberized surface.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, I bought it for the nose but was hoping it would be more effective as a precision groomer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked good the first 4 times.</li>
            <li>if you go in at an angle it trims pretty good.</li>
            <li>It does a good job just not as well as my first one.</li>
            <li>I have had this for 18 months, and loved it the first six months or so.  </li>
            <li>I am happy but it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s billing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is indeed useful, and you can get a good look up your nostril.</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to clean as well.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a simple nose hair trimmer for a good price this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The light is incredibly useful, it&#x27;s actually surprising.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>On the positive side it did a good job of nose and ear trimming.</li>
            <li>This is the original and better than the one with the curved head :)</li>
            <li>I usually am impressed by the build quality of most Panasonic items, but the metal tip that hides the blades on this is extremely flimsy.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic brand is superb as we have other products by them and they work wonderful, even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li>It is a very good trimmer for personal use and for a gift</li>
            <li>The overall quality of the trimmer is very good.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>No pulling experienced so far.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with this one.</li>
            <li>My old \\&quot;non-ER\\&quot; trimmer worked great.</li>
            <li>Includes a light instead of the mirrored cap the upgraded version has which in my opinion is better.</li>
            <li>Battery life so far has been great.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I bought it because I hoped the quality would be better then the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>This one runs more smoothly, and is stronger.  </li>
            <li>I have blinded myself more than anything with that light.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s the most important.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light it has helps make sure you dont miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>, so far it works Great.</li>
            <li>Most importantly remove the blade cap and wash thoroughly after each use or your blades</li>
            <li>Good sissors are very expensive,so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  </li>
            <li>Good for the machinery but not so much for your nose.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much so it should still be in good shape.</li>
            <li>this may very well be a good product</li>
            <li>Its a really fast and strong machine, my husband loved it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of guy who will spend a ton of money to find the right product so that when I need to use it, it will do what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer does not cut most hair without a significant amount of gyrations of angles for it to get the hair in the openings.</li>
            <li>This is the best model of trimmers my husband has ever used and refuses to use any other brand or model.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li>Easy and efficient..........</li>
            <li>In addition, the head is removable for easy cleaning.    </li>
            <li>But when I turned the unit on, the blades were making a more pronounced contact with the inside of the metal tip and while it still trimmed hair, it had a pronounced tendency to tug/pull rather than cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to pack for a trip if i need to.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and move around.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t dare drop it or the housing of the blades with easily break.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Kudos to Amazon for an easy return process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered another model</li>
            <li>NOT TO TAD AN ITEM LIGHT COULD BE MORE ACCURATE</li>
            <li>Easy and not as noisey as the hedge clipper style trimmers.</li>
            <li>Have to use it to realize how easy it is</li>
            <li>The light is kind of on the side of the unit and my husband said he can&#x27;t think of ANY reason why or when it would be useful.</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use and easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li>The service was very quick, too.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It easily jams and needs to be taken apart.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and no concerns for pulling or tugging hair out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use/clean.  </li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use, efficient.</li>
            <li>Mine died: when I took the battery cap off, the battery had leaked and I couldn&#x27;t easily get the battery out.</li>
            <li>Cleans easy, seems like the battery AA life will go awhile.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts forever and cleaning the product is easy.</li>
            <li>needs strong charged battery.</li>
            <li>In all seriousness it smelled STRONGLY of rotting organic compounds.     </li>
            <li>it feels good in the hand, cuts easily and quickly plus the light is actually useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 4/5/10 - Still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Trims the nose/ear hair and keeps running strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer for my husband in November of 2006, and it is still going strong after over two years.</li>
            <li>I got this one because my old one gave up the ghost after years of good service and the nose hair trimming head on my multitasking beard trimmer pulls more hair than it cuts.</li>
            <li>I always had to play with the end that holds the battery in to make it run, and it never did run to strong...</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it to everyone, men and women.</li>
            <li>His comment was that he likes it very much and it is handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>2 year warranty is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic recommendation is kind of funny since Panasonic owns Sanyo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product and maybe ok at the price, but I will need to replace it soon.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and the light makes it easy to see those spots that are often missed.  </li>
            <li>It quickly and easily removed most of the nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate and light weight.</li>
            <li>Works fine for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Brought it in Feb. 2008, and its been working fine till now.</li>
            <li>The trimmer function itself is just fine.  </li>
            <li>It looks fine</li>
            <li>Who knows why they felt obligated to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; a product that was working fine.    </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0002D5Y92 Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted]]&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine.</li>
            <li>This nose trimmer fits easily in the hand and is light weight.</li>
            <li>This works fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine though.  </li>
            <li>Over all seems fine.</li>
            <li>This nose hair trimmer work just fine</li>
            <li>One would think to replace the battery, but the battery was fine.  </li>
            <li>Light is pretty handy but takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Light, well balanced, trims hairs easily without pinching nose.  </li>
            <li>end cutter feature especially good for outer hair growth; built-in light not useful but harmless; also bought some for others who also like it.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>Does the job, comfortable, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Have had it for 2 years...runs fine.</li>
            <li>I really love the light feature and also the fact the whole unit is immersible in water (makes the cleaning process very easy).  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but I wasn&#x27;t able to use it because the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; on the top doesn&#x27;t work when connected to the top.  </li>
            <li>This product does an excellent job of trimming nose hair, and if you don&#x27;t like the light, turn the  instrument upside down</li>
            <li>This product is about half the price which is good, it is lighter, which is good.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But this one is so nice and easy that my nose wants it every day.</li>
            <li>but I am fine just using the light in the bathroom to take care of any hairs that poke out of my nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll need a bright light, two mirrors, a fair amount of agility with your fingers and hands, some patience and a little time.</li>
            <li>this is a very high class item for a low cost, im impressed.</li>
            <li>so I bought this one especially as I thought the light is a great idea...</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m still happy with it, but wish you could switch off the light.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t for use while the trimmer is inside your nostril.  </li>
            <li>Your supposed to use the light to look into your nose while the trimmer is out, so that you can see inside your nose &amp; look for any hairs that may have been missed.  </li>
            <li>How could anyone expect to see the light inside their nostril while the trimmer is in there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done everything I can to try to fix it, but it just appears to be a bit cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomically the device is comfortable to hold, along with the rubberized finish.</li>
            <li>There is a light on it</li>
            <li>I put it to use last night and it works great.  </li>
            <li>and so cheap.......</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t see the reason for the light.  </li>
            <li>Was not returned because then Amazon&#x27;s free shipping would be cancelled.  </li>
            <li>It was a sharper image and did a great job (except for ultimately quitting).  </li>
            <li>I thought the light would be focused so that when you were using the clippers it would shine where you were clipping</li>
            <li>You have to remove the clippers and then shine the light and then resume clipping.</li>
            <li>I like the light feature  </li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that the light is NOT intended to help you guide the device while it&#x27;s in your nostril and trimming, but instead is intended to enable you to check your work, and locate any stubborn/missed hairs for another pass.    </li>
            <li>The blade inside attempts to spin but won&#x27;t I looked inside and saw how truly cheap this was.</li>
            <li>I had another cheap trimmer for years.</li>
            <li>light is useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Except, how do you look into your ear with the light, I can&#x27;t figure it out..??</li>
            <li>The quality of this speaks for itself - I always buy Panasonic items when available.</li>
            <li>This unit is easy to use and clean and works without pain.</li>
            <li>The light is a joke.</li>
            <li>I never understood why there was a light.</li>
            <li>light is useless&lt;br</li>
            <li>He likes this one as well, saying it&#x27;s as smooth as the manual one.</li>
            <li>It has a light on the side</li>
            <li>It is constructed well, does not feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>bathroom mirror lacks a vanity light.</li>
            <li>Light could have been brighter or easier to aim into the nostril while in use</li>
            <li>They are more powerful</li>
            <li>This is my second one and it works great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, but I am puzzled about why there is a light?  </li>
            <li>but I guess you get what you pay for and the price was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Could have done without the light, but I didnt buy it for the light.  </li>
            <li>Is it me or do all the reviews for this product sound phony?  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sound genuine...</li>
            <li>The ER411 did such a great job, I don&#x27;t know why panasonic had to fiddle with the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and cleans up well and does what it needs to do with ease.</li>
            <li>It works, but the light shines in your eye and not in your nostril.  </li>
            <li>have no idea what the light is for...  </li>
            <li>Smooth running and cuts well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light anyway.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need the light anyway.  </li>
            <li>One and one but not with light.</li>
            <li>The built-in light is helpful in identifying hair particles</li>
            <li>quite and smooth running</li>
            <li>oohh.. the smell of freshly cut nose hair 8-)</li>
            <li>Its cheap and</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t listen to reviewers who complain about the light.  </li>
            <li>After you&#x27;ve trimmed your nostrils, you shine the light in there to check the results.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light and most trimmers don&#x27;t even have one, so the light is somewhat useful.</li>
            <li>the Light  </li>
            <li>The unit was easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t get me started on the light.</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed about light is not point to inside of nose hole.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and it does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li>Just wish they would get rid of the light to save the battery.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>it has a light on it that does not shine anywhere close to where it trims.  </li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t get the light...</li>
            <li>But the cheap one I bought for 10 bucks 4 years ago still works.</li>
            <li>Thank god the nose hair trimmer has a flash light on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the light, come on, the light is useles</li>
            <li>You can also use device to precisely cut an errant hair sticking out of your sideburn as well.  </li>
            <li>Great device, if you can ever get over the ticklish concept that you actually need a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any use for its light though.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t comment on the ear hair trimming because i fortunately don&#x27;t have that problem</li>
            <li>The light makes it easier to see in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT DOES PULL YOUR HAIRS AT TIMES AND THE LIGHT SHINES EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li>the light: you aren&#x27;t supposed to use the light WHILE you are using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see a line of trimmers that use one of the newer Li-Ion 3.7 volt batteries and a more powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Hope I got a smile out of someone out there who read this. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the light points into the ear or nostril while you&#x27;re trimming hair in those areas.</li>
            <li>That one was more powerful than this one.  </li>
            <li>this does everything it&#x27;s supposed to (excluding the &#x27;light&#x27; feature).</li>
            <li>This is cheap and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve still yet to figure out what the light is for.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer died after one year of light use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a light to find my nose</li>
            <li>and once it is in there, the light has no value.      </li>
            <li>Why did they put a light on it, it drains the battery, and I can&#x27;t remove the light.</li>
            <li>P/N WER415K1058, at the cost of $12.18 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, rinky-dink motor...died after 6 months and MAYBE 5 uses.  </li>
            <li>what is the deal with the light on this?  </li>
            <li>The built in light can be bothersome at times.  </li>
            <li>I found the trimmer to be virtually pain free.</li>
            <li>, cuts my closer than my Remington trimmer, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Had a Panasonic before lasted a few years,,very impressed.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the predecessor to this model, the 411, for several years and had great luck with it.  </li>
            <li>--when you use this trimmer on nose and ear hairs, there&#x27;s no way you can see what the light illuminates.</li>
            <li>Gave it a 1 star reduction because it is supposed to have a light and the light one mine was inoperative on arrival.</li>
            <li>Forget the light on this thing because it might as well not exist.  </li>
            <li>I recomend to everyone to use this product, it is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the light attachment.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Light is helpful.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is great, it cuts the hair in your ears and nose with out pulling and enough power to get it all.</li>
            <li>It smoothly and closely shaves the hair without pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li>the led light is a joke, I don&#x27;t know how the thing stays together</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>great only for the nose</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t bother with this model and get the one without the light.  </li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t seem to aim where you are trimming, but I don&#x27;t find this to be a problem</li>
            <li>I would pick another brand without a light.</li>
            <li>It is smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>it really isn&#x27;t useful beyond being an interesting feature.  </li>
            <li>(That is, the light should NOT, in my opinion, be a deciding factor in the purchase decision.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy using this thing.</li>
            <li>the light doesnt light anything up in your nose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the light.</li>
            <li>The light is on the side.  </li>
            <li>And the direction of thr light is not adjustable.  </li>
            <li>the light was placed at the end of he trimmer and shone around the blades INTO the nostril.  </li>
            <li>the one without the light.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The light is useful to make sure you did not miss any nose hairs.</li>
            <li>and they are both far superior to the Panasonics.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for a month now - so far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The light is very useful.  </li>
            <li>The light may not be very useful, atleast I did not find any use.</li>
            <li>The light is very useful but not when your trimming your hairs.</li>
            <li>What more could you want, right?</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs</li>
            <li>Very nice and quiet also!!</li>
            <li>I find this tool to be very useful.</li>
            <li>and you have to pull the hair to get free to clean it and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use with no pulling of hair.</li>
            <li>Trims nose/ear hairs rather quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Fortunate for me, I dropped it in the shower and decieded to try the ER421KC.  Panasonic has gotten this one right!  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this product off the shelf at target.</li>
            <li>My fiance was amusingly excited to receive this as a gift.  </li>
            <li>wasnt sure about it at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this thing for many years and the first two times I used the nose trimmer it worked</li>
            <li>I had that one originally.</li>
            <li>Face it, the original Sharper Image product is gone so</li>
            <li>Additionally, my wife is completely happy that I am no longer leaving long nose hairs on her floorboard during our commute.</li>
            <li>I cannot seem to find a good powerful trimmer that will last more than a year.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s order processing and delivery were excellent as usual.  </li>
            <li>When I received it I was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>How excited can you be about a nose hair trimmer?  </li>
            <li>Rich (rich584)</li>
            <li>I bought the first one at a drugstore in WI, then bought 3 more since 2010 on Amazon,</li>
            <li>This is a unique product it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hair trimmer -- how excited can you get about it?</li>
            <li>else my face is more crooked that most!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the light particularly useful, but I don&#x27;t need a light to find my nose.</li>
            <li>Luckily they were still available.  </li>
            <li>Nose trimmings can be a hassle to clean out of a sink, so use in the shower is reccomended.</li>
            <li>sure how much use the light is</li>
            <li>I have tried several of these gadgets and this one works the best by far.  </li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t do much but its not like you are paying more for that feature.</li>
            <li>Be sure to unscrew the top and clean it out frequently.  </li>
            <li>Does a good enough job; does easily and quickly and neatly trim away his nose hair and ear hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use, and clips the hair to a decent length.</li>
            <li>I really like the usability of this product - easy to clean, lightweight, good trimming action, and does not pull hairs out.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer though and better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>You can use this for Trimming Nose Hair, Ear Hair, Hair on your head and get a unique hair cut, I love it sooo much,</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it...</li>
            <li>Ive been using this now since 11/2006 and its pretty much simple operation, works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still nice to have a light in the general area.  </li>
            <li>This is the first nose and ear trimmer I have bought, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be a useful product.  </li>
            <li>Exactly to my expectations, &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product to use , easy to clean, does the job 100%.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really powerful, doesn&#x27;t do a great job, and the light...</li>
            <li>My husband appears to be delighted -the tool works simply and well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light isn&#x27;t useful at all, so don&#x27;t let that be any determining</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking  for an upgrade that will last this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>The light IS useful - it allows you to see into the nether regions of your nostrils to catch those that might otherwise show their hairs</li>
            <li>its a simple device for a good price.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the low price.</li>
            <li>The light is not as useful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>, I really need to purchase a better one.</li>
            <li>As others have commented, the light isn&#x27;t pointed anyplace useful to dispel the darkness in the nose.</li>
            <li>Good product for the low price.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Panasonic    Love, Bilbo</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, small form factor and light works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry Panasonic especially since your products and warranty coverage are usually good, but not in this case.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a pleasure to use because you can continually hear when it cuts a hair, giving you satisfaction :-) , and it really does cut the hair.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, useful.</li>
            <li>Two from the local stores were just not as good.  </li>
            <li>Every adult should own one.</li>
            <li>I may be in the minority here, but the light doesn&#x27;t seem all that useful to me</li>
            <li>This only good for nore hair.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job with trimming nose hair, but in my opinion does not cut close enough in the ears.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if it had a exchangeable straight head.</li>
            <li>They want 3 more words--OK Really junk</li>
            <li>I continue to use the device despite my full satisfaction with its performance.  </li>
            <li>It is the latest in a line of vibrating clippers, with this one having a new wrinkles, that it is waterproof and has a light, or so Panasonic claims.  </li>
            <li>Good sharp blades, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>What I mean is that it would be best if you refrain from just cramming it up your nose.</li>
            <li>This little gizmo trims them beautifully, then washes clean.</li>
            <li>Light did not work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>It quickly runs out of full power and then it tugs and pulls on your nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>Ihavent had any problems with mine and it works great, i dont know what other people were doing and how they hurt themselves.</li>
            <li>The new model is just as good as the older version.</li>
            <li>Its shape is better and the switch is better, but the Panasonic blades are bent at a different angle and have a tendency to grab my nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>As for the light -it is not too useful while you are trimming, but is useful when you need to check your work.    </li>
            <li>Fast, painless and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick review....</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands including Wahl and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, well built, and cuts clean and quickly just like it should.  </li>
            <li>Could even make you go from looking like a hairy slob to a super model.</li>
            <li>The product is good, I thought the light would help, not really.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend kept asking for one, ando delivery was quick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost worthy of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Batteries go quick.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t think it shines right up the nose the whole time you&#x27;re trimming; it does somewhat, but the main purpose of the light is to have it handy</li>
            <li>this replaces one I had for many, many years...needed a new blade but just replacing the old one with this one was cheap and convenient.</li>
            <li>And it was pretty cheap, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, when you first get it, it has a light oil film on the cutter.  </li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose!  </li>
            <li>but after you develop your own technique it becomes apparent as to why the designers and engineers chose that speed.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a step up from the cheap (~$10) first trimmer I bought.</li>
            <li>Well my good old Dad didn&#x27;t raise any sissies and I just want one to cut like my old cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li>The 415 cuts much closer and provides a clean, smooth finish around the nose and ears.  </li>
            <li>I have a strong feeling that pretty much any of the brands and models available</li>
            <li>originally started by buying the Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was able to hold it on and continue use, but this was not practical, so I bought a new one.     </li>
            <li>so i searched the internet for a new one and settled on the panasonic er421kc bought it and was glad i did man that rotary cutter gets the nose and ear hairs in no time.</li>
            <li>The new one more than lives up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Opened it in great excitement, since my previous trimmer died a week ago and I&#x27;ve missed it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the nose groomer because we had a previous one that worked great, also from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The battery life on the previous model was great.  </li>
            <li>First, the light actually is useful...</li>
            <li>It works adequately, though it seems to eat batteries, and it&#x27;s not as powerful as desired.  </li>
            <li>Small, compact, works perfectly, and shaves very close with no fear of snagging the skin.  </li>
            <li>Blade head is tool large to get fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Good little trimmer, easy to manage, no snagging or pulling.    </li>
            <li>This little device is a good size for the road and stores easily on the shelf between trips.</li>
            <li>The light is a joke, since it&#x27;s aimed directly down the barrel (though to be fair, all trimmers seem to do this - don&#x27;t ask me why they don&#x27;t aim off to the side</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it should!</li>
            <li>Would have given it 5 stars except that the claim that the \\&quot;light\\&quot; that is a part of this is a great asset is not true.  </li>
            <li>But after tweaking it with some needle nose pliers, it seems to actually run better than ever!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what my hubby wanted for Christmas (and he didn&#x27;t even know it!).  </li>
            <li>The new one is far superior.</li>
            <li>Old toothbrush works just fine!</li>
            <li>like they say and clean everything before the first use.</li>
            <li>the light is purely a marketing add on.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer takes a little getting used to but does a great job.   </li>
            <li>Great little trimmer for nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Trust me, if you take it a little at a time, the pain is greatly diminished and the effectiveness of the trimmer is enhanced.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this little puppy and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>A very good product, especially for the low cost.</li>
            <li>In theory the LED light shouldn&#x27;t draw much power, but....</li>
            <li>The light is not of much help, but I did not find that to be a problem.</li>
            <li>The light which is attached to the trimmer really does not help at all.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and works very well.</li>
            <li>not that I expect the light takes that much power.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a point for the light, but whatever.</li>
            <li>The built-in light isn&#x27;t very practical</li>
            <li>Light doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the point of the LED light, but I just ignore it.</li>
            <li>The light on the unit does absolutely nothing to assist in trimming hair in the target area.</li>
            <li>instructions are fairly accurate, but there are errors which require patience to unravel (as though one really requires instructions to utilize a nasal hair trimmer!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers.</li>
            <li>but it is nice and quiet</li>
            <li>For $15 this is one device well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was great initially but now the motor has grown considerably weaker over time, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>Infact the ER421KC has NO cutting sensation in the shower and</li>
            <li>I also liked the idea that it used external AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>Only improvement I would recommend is the light; it sure doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense because of where it&#x27;s aimed.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth $15.    </li>
            <li>I bought one of these trimmers 10 years ago and it didn&#x27;t work worth a damn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d return it if it was (1) returnable and (2) worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>and I do find it useful.</li>
            <li>I find this extremely useful as does my wife.</li>
            <li>Good product, better then most, still not perfect.</li>
            <li>I put in a tested fresh battery and switch it to on and nothing happens.</li>
            <li>Had the switch been on the same side as the light, things would have lit up better in my nose.</li>
            <li>Okay product, but I expected better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a much better value than my old sharper image one, I just hope it</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The trimmer just wasn&#x27;t stong enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>But, not enough power to be effective.  </li>
            <li>This one does a FAR better job of trimming the nose, ear, and even stray eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li>Rarely hurts.    </li>
            <li>I can laugh about it now.   </li>
            <li>She has a tendency to make fun of my technique, but she never complains about my grooming.</li>
            <li>but this trimmer is outstanding for its quiet operation and the light helps locate areas needing trimming.  </li>
            <li>Works well, the unit doesn&#x27;t pinch nearly as much as some of the others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The light, while seemingly gimmicky, works nicely to make sure you don&#x27;t miss a spot.</li>
            <li>not so.. not all that useful..</li>
            <li>&quot; It works ok, but not really any better than the $5 cheapo model from just about anywhere.</li>
            <li>best nose hair trimmer , are always panasonic, i always buy them, if they are lost or broken.</li>
            <li>I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Not quit as good as expected.</li>
            <li>A powerful LED might make a difference.    </li>
            <li>I hoped this could be helped by adding fresh batteries</li>
            <li>This does the job, no cutting, etc. of skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool for $16.  </li>
            <li>It is a much better design, with the actual trimmer feeling comfortable in my nose and ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a brand new battery it works ok, goes through batteries very, very fast.</li>
            <li>Other then that, it is definitively better then most.</li>
            <li>They cut well, cleanly, everything I expected from a cutter of this kind.  </li>
            <li>It also sports a built-in light, which the older model didn&#x27;t, but I haven&#x27;t found that useful yet.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li>It is also convenient to be wet/dry as I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting a shock when I use it right out of the shower.    </li>
            <li>I knocked out of the medicine cabinet and it bounced around in the sink (a fall of about 1 1/2 feet) and both  times the unit started right up and worked</li>
            <li>and you can start using it right away.</li>
            <li>It would not work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>(yes you read that right) trimmed, styled, and colored - to do so.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be too picky, right?</li>
            <li>They got the nose cap right</li>
            <li>I kindly informed her that the cost of a new trimmer was only $16 at Amazon with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>There is a tiny light which doesn&#x27;t add much and the clear plastic top needs to be better designed.</li>
            <li>The first few months, it was a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>For the first few weeks, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>it has lasted a long time, cheaply made falls apart a lot does not trim to well but its cheap !</li>
            <li>The light is pretty much a gimmick.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked great the first few times.  </li>
            <li>This replaced an older Sharper Image model that has not been available for years now.  </li>
            <li>Overall dimensions and weight are appropriate, and its single-axis (straight line) tapered cylindrical shape makes it easy to manipulate efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend but am still wondering - what is the light for?</li>
            <li>I never see the use of the light that is inbuilt - but otherwise I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i only use good batteries, but still, i put in a new one.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off using a mini-mag light or one of those little LED jobbies if you need a light.     </li>
            <li>This one was a couple of bucks more, but certainly a better piece of kit than the previous.    </li>
            <li>I got it because I had the previous model which worked much better than this one until the battery died after many years.</li>
            <li>But it works more or less ok</li>
            <li>The trimmer cuts well without pulling hairs, but the hair cutting process does produce a strong tickling sensation to the nose hairs; otherwise, perfect!</li>
            <li>The new one seems to be working fine, so we will see.</li>
            <li>Light is good for checking deep up there but not essential since no one can see up there anyway.  </li>
            <li>It does a really remarkable job of painlessly removing nose hair - far better than the small scissors, etc.  </li>
            <li>So just go back to the good old seaser and smile.</li>
            <li>The second unit worked flawlessly for a little over 2 years before I also damaged it by dropping.</li>
            <li>The light is a good idea, but it is really hard to remove hair with it.</li>
            <li>The cleanest shaving of nose and ear hair I&#x27;ve ever experienced; better than my much older Panasonic, and several other brands.</li>
            <li>-- how can the trimmer and the light fit in one&#x27;s nostril at the same time --</li>
            <li>Tweezers are really the only effective way to remove ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>Basic and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Finally... something that actually works and does a great job clearing out the nose and ear hair.  </li>
            <li>Only need to use it about every 3 days since it does such a great job.</li>
            <li>sure if the lighted tip was worth the extra couple bucks.  </li>
            <li>But this one works well and is quiet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Invest a few more buck and get a better model.</li>
            <li>The light, for me, is of no use as it seems to never point where I would need it to if I needed extra light up my nose.</li>
            <li>and this trimmer has been great with chopping those down to normal length.  </li>
            <li>18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eventually it died and I was happy to find I could replace it with the exact same model from Amazon at a very low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because MORE then LIKELY someone else will be cutting his ear hair for him, this light comes in handy!!!</li>
            <li>I had it too, and this thing has solved it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>just have not used it very much yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model is far more substantial  with a good engine and nice cutting surface.</li>
            <li>Though the water proof capabilities allow you to run this bugger under the faucet, your normal faucet doesn&#x27;t do much to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Does the job but takes a little time to do a good job.</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail and was excited to have gotten a new one.</li>
            <li>This item worked well at first.  </li>
            <li>The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>I expect a repeat performance of the first one.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear hair trimmer isn&#x27;t the first unit of this type I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li>Pretty soon they&#x27;ll market one that can text, take pictures and play music.    </li>
            <li>but this Panasonic ER421  really rocks!  </li>
            <li>Subsequently it has been modified, and is just a bit better than this one being reviewed.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my husband and it works better than the last one he had.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well -</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>That said, this thing is working exactly as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Panasonic trimmer, sadly, never worked as intended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not giving up on Panasonic and after my el cheapo groomer died, I am getting a Vortex trimmer which seems to be rated higher than this one.</li>
            <li>It was better than the Connair I had prior to it whose motor you could smell burning as you used it.</li>
            <li>My husband has since grown a beard and spends even more time trimming his facial hair.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>When I first recieived and used this product I rated it with 5 Stars and wrote the review below.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much it!  </li>
            <li>It works, was not expensive and is durable.</li>
            <li>It has a light on it so that he can see in dim lit situations.  </li>
            <li>The light is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>This trimmer never had much power so it would often snag hairs (ouch!)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a better product and recommend you do the same, unless you want to throw your money away.</li>
            <li>With this product causing more pain, I am back to scissors (bought about 3 years ago and still works like charm).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works, or not, sorry.</li>
            <li>The unit worked well the first time I used it</li>
            <li>hahaha!</li>
            <li>It is my first hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have been trying out different nose hair trimmers for the better part of thirty years and</li>
            <li>Pretty pain free thus far, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>The first one started to work for about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson the first time.  </li>
            <li>Going to order more next holiday to use as gifts for others.</li>
            <li>You can get a similar or better unit at any drug store.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>-- it does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Why else would he design so many males so that their hairs would fall out of their heads and sprout out of their ears, nose, and back?</li>
            <li>This was my first nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Overall, it is ok, but I would add a cover for protecting the tip.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly what the manufacturer claims it does.</li>
            <li>I use NiMH rechargeable batteries which might give it a bit more power than standard alkaline batteries,</li>
            <li>funny, it was probably those unsightly hairs sticking out of your nose.</li>
            <li>Funny story....  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to using scissors until I find a better trimmer than this Panasonic one.</li>
            <li>As far as the light, wouldn&#x27;t a man use this in a well lit bathroom or</li>
            <li>and from carrying it on a plane just once, somewhere inside of my bag the tiny plastic grooves broke and now the top no longer stays on.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li>This is my first nose and ear hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Motor seemed low-speed at first</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for nasal hair trimming and have been using it occasionally for about two years.</li>
            <li>Very Well!</li>
            <li>inspection, the blade unit isn&#x27;t rising up to the top, it stays low in meta guard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an engineer and studied the inside of the unit to make sure there wasn&#x27;t a manufacturing defect, and everything looked very solid and well assembled.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to any one who is an avid groomer.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever tried anything like this</li>
            <li>work really well!</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully exactly as described in product description.</li>
            <li>But the problem is most likely that it just needs a cleaning.</li>
            <li>I recognize that they are not expensive.  </li>
            <li>I think this trimmer is much better than most of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>you have to go over same spot to get any satisfaction to many times.</li>
            <li>That el cheapo was much better at actually grooming than this unit.</li>
            <li>First time using one of these.</li>
            <li>Much better than the no names I have picked up in local stores.</li>
            <li>The first one broke after I dropped it in the sink.</li>
            <li>first time i&#x27;ve ever used one of these</li>
            <li>The item gets so hot that almost feels like it burns..</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it uses disposable batteries, and the battery will last quite a while before it runs</li>
            <li>This thing was exactly what I was hoping to find.  </li>
            <li>This unit is *extremely* quiet - much better than the deafening beard trimmer that I was cramming into my crevices.  </li>
            <li>Hair has to actually go into the top to get cut.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does anyone make a nose hair trimmer that last more than a couple of months?</li>
            <li>I use it about once a month when I get a haircut, so that seems pretty durable to me</li>
            <li>First one arrived and did not work.</li>
            <li>Wish they made plugin nose trimmer with stronger motor and higher quality blade.</li>
            <li>cann&#x27;t contact very well with the battery!</li>
            <li>First, the trimmer does trim well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works exactly as any product would.</li>
            <li>Since the interface of this device is round, its of good use to swirl around inside nose.</li>
            <li>The panasonic product looks good on paper, but it has already has quit working twice in the few months that I have owned it.</li>
            <li>He joked, saying that IF we were in a black out situation &amp; someone were to feel it imperative to trim their nose hair or ear hair right then and there, he guesses that after the fact, MAYBE enough light could emit from the top side of the unit to maneuver the light in order to \\&quot;see\\&quot; if any more hair is very apparent and in need of trimming.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working far better than my new 421, which is headed for the trash or a return to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but the product works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not a bad price, but I&#x27;m going to spend a few more bucks on the replacement I buy to try to get something a little more reliable, and better designed.</li>
            <li>Overall, Great product, light should be in the middle of the trimmer that outside the casing of the unit.</li>
            <li>hey who needs a full blow vacuum sucker in your nose Does the job and very good at price</li>
            <li>I am not sure the light helps but it may be useful to inspect the result of your work :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for doing spot work around the beard line as well, but only if the hair is already pretty short.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than most, but still not very effective at the ONE thing it&#x27;s supposed to do!  </li>
            <li>The light is nice for checking for remaining hairs in those hard to see places.</li>
            <li>The light, presented as a great marketing feature,is useless except if you intend to use it to check the time on your watch during the night, while you&#x27;re in bed.  </li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t do much but the product performs just as well as the old 411.</li>
            <li>Even though I would run it under water to clean every time, it clogged and frequently pulled.</li>
            <li>, it works quickly, it works clearly, it will make your life more efficient, and simple.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t currently see anything else on Amazon which has received good enough</li>
            <li>is that it doesn&#x27;t reach quite far enough to take care of all the hair, perhaps for my own protection.  </li>
            <li>the light is totally a gimmick, no way that could be useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame Panasonic has to compete with Wally World and lowly priced competitors so often, they really do make quality products for the most part.</li>
            <li>If your trimmer starts turning slowly, try a drop of light weight oil on the cutter head - the kind that is used on hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>The round head isn&#x27;t as good as the straight cutter design.  </li>
            <li>&quot; look inside your nostril but rather tricky to point the tiny bulb light in the right direction.</li>
            <li>This little sucker does a good job for a fair price.  </li>
            <li>It was great at its job and lasted a long time on a single battery.</li>
            <li>The first use it seemed to work reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product it does exactly what</li>
            <li>but this time I ordered a higher end one that cost a whole $20</li>
            <li>It did not cost much, and as I said, it worked well at first, but I would think that once a week usage would not cause it to lose its life already.  </li>
            <li>It worked reasonably well the first couple of times, then stopped working.</li>
            <li>The light is located down on the side of the trimmer, so the only way it could even potentially be useful is if you pointed the light into your nose and then somehow managed to aim the trimmer where you&#x27;d pointed the light.</li>
            <li>I can tell the difference just by the sound, the ER115 sounded fast the ER421KC barely</li>
            <li>Very quiet and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its easy cut hair in nose just holding inside the nose, but for ear.. you need to chase the each hair strands with this tiny head.</li>
            <li>Nice product,gets the job done without mess</li>
            <li>I was the happy previous owner of a Panasonic trimmer, hence the draw back to Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Panasonic seems to almost always make a great product for the money, as evidenced by my wet dry shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery was fine and intact (no leaking or cracks) but the internal case smelled like a mixture of death, farts, and chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have been through 2 other trimmers over the past couple of years and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine, but I found similar trimmers in discount stores for well under $10 that look just like the one I have.</li>
            <li>Same problems, works fine with rechargeable NiMH AAs,   but often has problems with Alkalines.</li>
            <li>Second one works fine.</li>
            <li>The whole unit seems unnecessarily large but it doesn&#x27;t effect its use.</li>
            <li>Nice little product.</li>
            <li>First, the good - the blades are sharp and actually cut the hair instead of pushing it to the side....</li>
            <li>Panasonic does sell the replacement blade but it is priced pretty high.</li>
            <li>anyone relying on the lamp to trim eyebrows has overweening faith and far too little good sense.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a great little device that works very well.</li>
            <li>For $12 I&#x27;m not going to complain too much, but I&#x27;ll spend a bit more money the next time and see if I can get a unit that works a little better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found much use for the light but for the extra cost is negligible.</li>
            <li>I assumed the light would be located inside the tip where it would actually shine where you&#x27;re getting ready to trim, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It will trim your ear and nose hairs but is too much hassle to constantly having to unscrew the blade assembly to free up the motor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t necessary but may   be if vision is a problem.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever recall such a cheap thrill from the Motokata.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how much it helps</li>
            <li>but this tool really works well......</li>
            <li>The battery lasts much longer and it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is much quieter and does not pull on nose hairs while trimming so it does not hurt.</li>
            <li>And it helps to have the option of the light if necessary.</li>
            <li>Nothing much happens.  </li>
            <li>This is probably because the components are cheap Chinese plastic.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull as much, but it still pulls some.  </li>
            <li>Often times it is cheaper to buy the whole thing.</li>
            <li>i bought this item for my father for Christmas he really likes it.</li>
            <li>His former unit was a Remington unit without the light.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon...</li>
            <li>This is a very over rated product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s really very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The reasonable cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And does it very well.  </li>
            <li>Item works very well.</li>
            <li>The light is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never had much power but with patience can be used to get the job done.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>The item wasn&#x27;t even used that much.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the Wahl products over the Panasonic, absolutely.</li>
            <li>This product gets a very close shave and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product whole nosedly.  </li>
            <li>After much deliberation and doing probably too much research</li>
            <li>This is equal to the really cheap products out there.  </li>
            <li>But you really don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>They improved them tremendously in ten years because this thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I buy so much stuff on amazon</li>
            <li>It performs better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Now, I have mastered this modern marvel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usage:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this trimmer works best when you cut as if your trimming bushes, not as if you were cutting grass.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it with water is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>It advertizes an ability to do straight trims like sideburns and there is no way</li>
            <li>I really like Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>You have to use your regular bathroom light for that.    </li>
            <li>The light is on the opposite side of the switch, but for comfort of use I like to keep the switch facing my face, this makes the beam of light go on the outside of my nose.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>the only drawback is the light.  </li>
            <li>Really cut the hair</li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has done the mankind a favor by inventing this much needed gizmo, though no man with any pride would admit to buying or even needing this device.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The device is very well designed, it turns out.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used this thing \\&quot;wet\\&quot; yet and really can&#x27;t imagine doing so.</li>
            <li>You twist the very bottom</li>
            <li>The light is critical - it shows you where to cut; however, you don&#x27;t use it _</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really point up.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much touted \\&quot;headlight\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t move fast enought.</li>
            <li>It cuts hair real close to the skin wiht out pain.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like writing reviews like this, but, this time, I have to tell the truth--and there it is.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
            <li>those really stunk.</li>
            <li>only con to this trimmer is the led light.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle but thorough.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pissed off against Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It really does nothing.</li>
            <li>, the light helps you to see inside your nose (as the doctor does), is very quiet and works without even feeling.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fast and efficient, does its job.</li>
            <li>The blade compartment is cheap Chinese make i think, but hey, it aint gonan cost you a fortune.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>very practical and portable product.</li>
            <li>This Nose and Ear Hair trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely a piece of trash.</li>
            <li>In fact, it leaves as much hair as I used to start with when trimming with the 411.  </li>
            <li>The motor appears to be frozen, and will only work sporadically if I shake the unit to free it up.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is a manual twist but believe it or not, it really works.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay the extra for the light.  </li>
            <li>I would pay twice this much for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Really.   </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic wants $10.11 plus shipping to replace the tip.</li>
            <li>it feels very well made and substantial in my hand..</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>My only  &lt;br /&gt;complaint is: the light.</li>
            <li>This does the job over and over again and fast.</li>
            <li>, I won&#x27;t pay the extra for the light.</li>
            <li>The speed of the motor is not as fast as I think it should be.</li>
            <li>only thing that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is the LED light.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out any possible geometry between this device, my hand, my nose, and my eye that will allow me to use the light for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>If I knew this I would have probably purchased a similar model without the light.</li>
            <li>With that said, I still recommend it because of the price and it works very well as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a nose trimmer, and wanted one with a stainless steel  blade.</li>
            <li>Light helps seeing internally</li>
            <li>This product really fets the job done.</li>
            <li>Nothing like spending twice as much as I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This means that you sometimes have to hold it perpendicularly to the target area, much like you would a bleach pen or a glue stick.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt cut very well.</li>
            <li>Cleans ears and nose very well.</li>
            <li>This nose &amp; ear hair trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is not really necessary though.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I am VERY dissapointed in this item.</li>
            <li>It works well and seems to be very well designed from both a utility and a cleaning standpoint.</li>
            <li>While these trimmers and designed not to cut the skin and works very well on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>And even when working, it didn&#x27;t have much power and tended to pull hair rather than trim it.</li>
            <li>When I look at this product as a tool, it strikes me as being very well designed for it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Several day I received, this device didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When using the trimmer, whether or not inserted deeply into the nostril, the light shines into the user&#x27;s eye...</li>
            <li>but the tip is very flimsy, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, not a great product, but when it works properly it is better than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the batteries last a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also far more quiet to boot.  </li>
            <li>I see many good reviews about this product but purchased it and am extremely unhappy.  </li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t as useful as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s not really needed.  </li>
            <li>The light is useless because it does not shine where you need it and the top is falling apart pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>There were no replacements available because Panasonic apparently did some sunsetting design changes that were not improvements, but required the purchase of an entirely new trimmer.</li>
            <li>i had the early model it had a straight cutter and was all right but took sometime to get all the hairs probably still would be useing it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s easy to handle but ALMOST too small to comfortably handle for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>Power runs low pretty quickly and pulls the hairs rather than trimming them.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product though, the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted, I became a new man--reborn, rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dirty, well cleaned, have tried light oil, no oil, just not consistent.</li>
            <li>The ability to rinse the unit under the faucet is very convenient and for further cleaning the tip breaks down super quick and easy to aid in rinsing out clipped hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just weak and no matter how many new batteries I put in it, it still is gutless and ineffective for the most part.</li>
            <li>The very end comes off to clean but there is not one word about how to open it up..</li>
            <li>and i was struck by many bits of sharp plastic.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is quiter and seems to cut more thoroughly than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used -- although I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  </li>
            <li>Better than other products tried.</li>
            <li>This product worked much better than I had expected!</li>
            <li>Again, I haven&#x27;t used any other nose hair trimmer, but I can&#x27;t imagine paying any more than I paid for this one</li>
            <li>Wish I had purchased the other trimmer at another site, for $20 more that cut when you pushed the on button.</li>
            <li>Only reason I give it 4 stars is it originally came with the battery inside</li>
            <li>Panasonic is much better than other brands that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Better buy other ..</li>
            <li>If you want to keep some clean nostrils look no further.  </li>
            <li>I used to use scissors and occasionally a razor to get a really clean look on my ears and nose.  </li>
            <li>We much prefer the \\&quot;form factor\\&quot; of the older Nose Hair Trimmer, it was slim, and not so bulky.</li>
            <li>I have had an older version of the Panasonic trimmer and it did not give a very close trim</li>
            <li>Installing a single battery was easy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone who has to trim very often like myself.</li>
            <li>This trimmer yanks my nose hairs quite frequently and battery runs out very fast.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it may not be available in 4 years when I need a new one, so I am thinking of getting a spare.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a straight trimmer, this rotary works so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any, er, uh, nose-hair trimmers, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how simply and easily these worked.</li>
            <li>Also, I have noticed after the 3rd use, that when I start the clippers now the power seems to take 3 secs to get to full speed</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s not LED, but rather a dim micro flashlight bulb.</li>
            <li>No matter what battery I use it is NEVER enough charge to make this thing run at full speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think any less than 100% absolute satisfacation is that his previous one was from Brookstone &amp; cost something like $65 or $70 as I recall, many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>Once clean it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li>I just reordered and the new ones do not work!</li>
            <li>They are very pleased with the performance and the light helps tremendously, especially when you are older and hard to see!  </li>
            <li>In just a few minutes I was able to banish ALL of the offending hairs from sight, something I have never been able to do before with any other trimmer, manual or electric, or any of the scissors I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version  and decided after 8 years to get a new one!</li>
            <li>The on/off switch has a rubber coating so it is easy to switch on and off, even with wet fingers after rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li>its just OK&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more or less.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s suppose to do nothing more nothing less..</li>
            <li>The ER415 is a much better design and much less of a battery hog.</li>
            <li>works as promised and appears to be of better quality that previous versions I tried</li>
            <li>Ordered it and the service was quick, as 3 days later it was in my hands trimming my nose and ear hair again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just particular when it comes to this topic.  </li>
            <li>and I find the trimmer works quickly and very quietly...</li>
            <li>a year ago I replaced an older version of this Panasonic nose hair trimmer with the ER421.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this particular model.</li>
            <li>Does all that I need to get rid of those pesky unsightly hairs that us older men have.</li>
            <li>Looks like decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Nothing exciting, just does the job fairly well, but not perfectly.</li>
            <li>We threw out one of the older ones, because of (suspected) corrosion issues with the battery contacts.</li>
            <li>and then I washed the head part that contains the blade by detaching it from the main body as directed.</li>
            <li>Bought this model as an upgrade to the older panasonic model.</li>
            <li>Had to keep on replacing batteries on the older model</li>
            <li>I probably would not buy this item again even though it was a decent price.  </li>
            <li>The light however does not really help much as it does not illuminate the area you are working on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than the older one, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a slower blade speed or not.  </li>
            <li>As for the nose, did a good job trimming the hair but it irritated the inside of my nose after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>This was followed by me accidently dropping it ONCE into the sink, and (because the top doesn&#x27;t stay on) the inside white peice of plastic with the blades breaks in the same way.  </li>
            <li>I think it would probably cost me more to mail it back to Panasonic than to go with a different maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not shave as close as the older model.</li>
            <li>By the way, this review is mainly concerned about EAR hygiene.</li>
            <li>This is the only trimmer, out of many I have tried, that cuts close enough.</li>
            <li>As I get older I tend to have nose and ear hair which becomes unsightly.</li>
            <li>The thing works great for a couple months or so then starts having these stop-and-go problems where you have to remove and adjust the blade piece (as if you are cleaning it)  to get the thing going again at full speed...which it does for little while before slowing down again and starting to pull rather than cut....painful!</li>
            <li>Overall, this gets the job done and I am not sure how pleasant it should be to trim nose hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought this new Panasonic to replace same model older one that finally expired after many years of use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you close the drain on the bathroom</li>
            <li>and I can highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>Of course, I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It is simple to use, isn&#x27;t painful (or my husband would have abandoned it immediately), and the light is a handy way to \\&quot;check your work\\&quot; and make sure you haven&#x27;t missed anything.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest buying.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting some high powered Cree led in there</li>
            <li>I should have known and bought something high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a hairy guy, I highly suggest picking one up.</li>
            <li>I have high praise for the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for humans too though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, don&#x27;t waste money on Wahl and other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably no worse then the other models and brands; plus it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>It gets extra points for surviving a drop to my bathroom floor one morning when I was less wide awake than would have been ideal.</li>
            <li>little more.  </li>
            <li>The little light this thing has doesn&#x27;t really help all that much...</li>
            <li>Also, I would only buy an eyebrow trimmer if it had special attachments to hold the cutter a fixed distance from the eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, I had better nose hair trimmers, and worse ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Safe to use, no cuts or painful snags (yet)  - Easy to clean (just run under a faucet)    </li>
            <li>I thought the light feature would be a plus, but it&#x27;s a minus.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re done \\&quot;shaving\\&quot;, look at the sink below and be prepared to be surprised how much hair were shorn.  </li>
            <li>Have not really used the light for anything yet.</li>
            <li>I get a much closer trim with this one compared to my old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well, and you use it and think you are in the clear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting old, so I upgraded to the 421, which is much quieter and cuts with ease.  </li>
            <li>There really is no reason to have the light on this unit.</li>
            <li>The light does not really help at all, so that&#x27;s why it lost a star.</li>
            <li>Guys: Come up with a trimmer that works and lasts for more than just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Really only worth 8 bucks.</li>
            <li>Doubt it would last long either, but have no idea, since I haven&#x27;t used it once since my girlfriend found some no-name cheapo (&lt; $5) nose trimmer that works 20 times better than this.    </li>
            <li>Threw it away after few more months.  </li>
            <li>I just barely went to use this for the first time, and it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>If it could be disabled I&#x27;m sure it would help extend battery life.    </li>
            <li>Had a Remington which only lasted so long, then did some research and the Panasonic ER421KC came out on top.  </li>
            <li>After having success for several years with another Panasonic trimmer, I opted to replace it with the newer model.</li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t as powerful and you may think the battery is low, but it&#x27;s just how it operates.</li>
            <li>I saw this kind of trimmer -- same basic design -- at Bed Bath and Beyond several years ago.  </li>
            <li>--there&#x27;s a big difference between a fresh battery and one that&#x27;s been sitting in there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not expensive, quiet, works very well</li>
            <li>This is the third (different) trimmer I have owned, and I like this one far better than the others.  </li>
            <li>Worth keeping in the car or desk at work for nose hair emergencies, if there is such a thing.</li>
            <li>Dried nasal mucus (i.e., boogers) seem to increase with the use of this product; perhaps it&#x27;s simply more noticible with shorter hairs, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only useful for the nose, but also for the ears, too.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well at first but the motor and blade are less effective after a few uses (even with changing batteries) and begins to pull hairs.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a very good product that gets the job done extremely well, but with a few tears along the way.</li>
            <li>Other than that it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Turns out this new model has a straight blade set-up which does not perform as well as the old curved blades.</li>
            <li>That was kind of an odd statement, considering I wouldn&#x27;t pay an extra charge for a mistake that wasn&#x27;t my fault.</li>
            <li>This is the third Panasonic nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve had (two different models) that have the same problem, even though I keep them clean the motor sometimes won&#x27;t spin up to full speed.</li>
            <li>The little nub that goes in your nostril is highly polished stainless steel and is quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked great at first, but only lasted a few short months (with minimum use) before it simply stopped working!</li>
            <li>I returned the product because it did not work after installing several new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The product was defective  right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Nice that it can be used in wet and dry conditions too!</li>
            <li>I have no use for the light nor do I know how it could be used other than what one poster said to examine the area after the fact, which would be a valid use for it -- my bathroom is well lighted</li>
            <li>Been ordering the same model for past 5 years and same Great quality...</li>
            <li>The on board light is a joke despite other reviewers&#x27; claims.</li>
            <li>I noticed several of the high rated reviews were submitted within the first couple months of ownership.  </li>
            <li>After the first, three months, there was a high grinding noise that sounded like the blade was rubbing against the inner cap.</li>
            <li>I replace with a new battery with no change.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without one of these...</li>
            <li>I tried a new battery.  </li>
            <li>I placed a new battery in it and it did not work.</li>
            <li>I put a new battery in it and it did not work.</li>
            <li>Even with a brand spanking new Eveready battery.</li>
            <li>Put in new batteries .</li>
            <li>After a couple of years, even with a new battery the speed of the blades has slowed and I often end up with a nose hair attached to the now non-moving blades.  </li>
            <li>We then ordered a new one (ER421KC):</li>
            <li>For some reason I decided I should get a new one and ordered the ER421KC model.  </li>
            <li>New batteries didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I thought it was the battery, but, I would put in a new one</li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one, no charge.</li>
            <li>but then again it is NEW.  </li>
            <li>So, had to get this new one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s already run through a new battery in 5 wks.</li>
            <li>Yeah I know, why didn&#x27;t I buy this new trimmer 5 years ago?  </li>
            <li>They tranferred me to the parts department to buy a new blade.  </li>
            <li>This is even when a brand new battery has been installed.</li>
            <li>The cost to replace the blades is almost the cost of a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Just put a new battery in it and stick that baby up those hairy nostrils.  </li>
            <li>new ER421KC is so under powered.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>but it always seems like the battery is about to die, even with a brand new one in it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming its from the newly cut hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li>I can just get a new one when the blade wears out after 4 or 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had to live with</li>
            <li>I received a new one and it does work</li>
            <li>Needs new batteries often.</li>
            <li>We can no locate replacement blades, so now we have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>And yes, I put new batteries in it.</li>
            <li>I really did not want another cheaply made import because I have already thrown a few of those away</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, like so many things made by Panasonic, this item quits within a year, even with light use.  </li>
            <li>The ER421KC is also very reliable, it always runs (as long as the battery isn&#x27;t drained of course) and has never failed me, with the exception of the below cases, which were my fault.    </li>
            <li>Second, the light is mounted partway back from the tip of the business end.</li>
            <li>As a nose hair trimmer it seems to do a marginally better job than the Wahl, but I found the light difficult to aim</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was obvious, it was time to replace the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addtion, I personally never use the attached light accessory, I think it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>After several months of use I have not had to replace the battery yet, although I think the light is only of marginal utility - or</li>
            <li>Not very powerful, but if you put light oil on the blade (I use trumpet valve oil or similar) occasionally and clean it often it works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for adult males.</li>
            <li>think these trimmers should use two AA batteries instead of one - it would give the motor more torque - preventing it from slowing down, stalling, and pulling on the nose hair (ouch!!).</li>
            <li>and it was pretty good - this one does a very poor job, I expected that I was used to and liked the previous one, this one cannot seem to get the hairs well at all.  </li>
            <li>I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just about ready for trash now as it can barely muster any power at all.</li>
            <li>The light is not useful for me, but it is there.</li>
            <li>The one complaint I have at this point is that the light feature (which isn&#x27;t all that important for overall performance) is angled improperly and is therefore of no use whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Tried changing batteries several times, but it does absolutely nothing!  </li>
            <li>Overall, a pretty descent trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was at work and was so horrified by the giant clumps of hair sticking out of a client&#x27;s nostrils (no kidding) that I came straight home, went online, and purchased these nose trimmers for my husband!  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>this is the first trimmer that actually worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li>first, it takes some persistence to get the last stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>Still, by knowing exactly where the hairs are, you target them one by one instead of reaming out your entire nose.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s way better than other brands we tried and had to return such as the \\&quot;nose plucker\\&quot; from Sharper Image.</li>
            <li>This trimmer DOES come with the dual edged blades that I thought only came on the higher end Panasonic trimmers by the way.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that actually trims nose hair, without pulling.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It has a light, but I don&#x27;t trim in the dark anyway.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly yank the hairs, so if you can deal with a bit of stinging, then it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li>It is much better and faster than using the small scissors I had been using.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure what is better, but this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of awkward when it comes to aiming it and would have been better off if it was left out of the design.  </li>
            <li>The light was not a really useful tool.</li>
            <li>This item is pretty prices to only use it 10 times and have to replace it!</li>
            <li>I bought small scissors which are better.</li>
            <li>Also, the LED light is completely worthless and you really have to wonder what engineer thought that would be a good idea.</li>
            <li>The cap falls off too easily and is easy to lose due to its transparent color and small size.  </li>
            <li>should have looked around a bit more here at Amazon, because I would have found the same trimmer with the vacuum for the same price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a decent trimmer that wasn&#x27;t too loud to have near my ears.  </li>
            <li>I am always surprised at just how much hair it trims without pulling and the reservoir tip traps all of those small hairs which can then be easily rinsed out under running water.</li>
            <li>possibly the only negative is that the light is more a nuisance than anything else.  </li>
            <li>It worked ok the first few times, but then the motor began to loose it&#x27;s power to the point where it doesn&#x27;t spin at all.  </li>
            <li>the light on it really helps pick out the small ferns when youve already picked off the trees.</li>
            <li>The LED light on the end is just too much and usually just shines in my eyes when I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to go into a long detailed explanation, but I will say this:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different makes and models of nose hair trimmers and they were all junk/garbage.  </li>
            <li>In hindsight, I&#x27;d probably get one without a light just so that it&#x27;s one less thing using the battery,</li>
            <li>The sound it makes is a bit odd when hairs are cut</li>
            <li>Fortunately  I was able to swap the nose cones - which remained unchanged between the models - and continue using my trusty older model (trims hairs like a razor without cutting or nicking.)</li>
            <li>Now, with this Panasonic trimmer, it&#x27;s easy to use everyday if need be.  </li>
            <li>The clippers work good to cut the hair, but, I was disappointed with the light.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair with professional barber clippers and trimmers but using the trimmers to cut nose hair is not good.</li>
            <li>These other reviewers were right!  </li>
            <li>He liked how it felt, but it&#x27;s a little ridiculous to only be able to use it once.</li>
            <li>Works fine and beats the little scissors.</li>
            <li>I like it, it has a powerful motor that runs off a single battery</li>
            <li>My first one lasted a couple years, then stopped working for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>Note that the trimmer does not cut the hair completely: it just pares it down to the proper length, which is more than sufficient to keep hairs from poking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to break the bank on a nose hair trimmer, but it&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to get a decent one; this trimmer is just about right.    </li>
            <li>It works, but even with a brand new battery in it, it takes a couple seconds to get to full power, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  </li>
            <li>After buying and discarding several trimmers that didn&#x27;t seem to do anything but make noise, I tried this one (based on reviews) and was surprised to find that actually removes hair quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for a few months but will no longer power on.</li>
            <li>not as good as the less expensive version of this trimmer from Panasonic without the built in light (5 stars for that one, been working for years).</li>
            <li>But the sad thing is Panasonic ER421kc didn&#x27;t last strong for more than 20 uses.</li>
            <li>The little LED light is a joke.</li>
            <li>My only reticence about the product is the power - sometimes I think if could use a little more.</li>
            <li>Was a little tentative about buying this thinking it might be more of a toy than a solid tool.  </li>
            <li>Overall works decently!</li>
            <li>The low intensity light is of little use since it doesn&#x27;t illuminate much.</li>
            <li>I liked the product and when it finally gave out after years of service, I had a hard time finding another one.    </li>
            <li>you can hear when you are cutting and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>, the cutting blades works great.</li>
            <li>The light is an absolute gimmick: I can see nothing, at least not up my nose, with it.</li>
            <li>Probably worth more than one star, but the light is WORTHLESS.  </li>
            <li>My old conair trimmer had a straight blade and used to cut just close enough.</li>
            <li>About the light: someone said here they thought the light was useless.  </li>
            <li>Oh and also the light (what light) is useless, except for the fact that it is just burnin up battery</li>
            <li>This product cannot help remove hair {on} (edges of) ear, may be it could clear hair {in} the ear.</li>
            <li>Works very well,the light I found useless BUT NOT NEEDED worth the price.</li>
            <li>You can skip the lighted version as the beam of light does not really align with the area you are trimming, but the actual trimmer does clear the ear and nose of the unwanted follicles.</li>
            <li>and I have used it probably ten times so far, (I don&#x27;t have much hair)</li>
            <li>Its completely painless, fast, dirt simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near pointed where it needs to be pointed and can be quite distracting.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with the hair yanking or anything.</li>
            <li>Found it again here and it felt like finding an old friend.  </li>
            <li>use regularly daily performs very well.</li>
            <li>I assume this is because the blades don&#x27;t spin quite fast enough.    </li>
            <li>A couple days ago, it quit completely.</li>
            <li>But the unit completely broke and will not function at all.  </li>
            <li>the old Panasonic ER411 did.</li>
            <li>This one is quiet and very efficient.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer had a tendency to pull hair while trimming.</li>
            <li>Old model died, so hubby decided to stick with panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I have an old Connair el cheapo and it does the trick without pulling -</li>
            <li>completely safe...highly recommend it..great value.</li>
            <li>I agree completely.  </li>
            <li>An upgrade from my old cheapie one I had been given by a friend.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s lasted longer than others.</li>
            <li>In comparison to an old Sharper Image product this one does not pull the hair or pinch in anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer pointed at by young children or teased by woman.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer gave out on me and it always took about 7 minutes to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>So far this has done the job and has been everything it was advertised to be.</li>
            <li>and it was so dim</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very dissapointed when the second one broke, I decided to spend some money and buy the Turbo-Groomer.</li>
            <li>My old Panny nose/ear trimmer died on me, so I ended up going on a shaver/trimmer spree.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace the old panny trimmer.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer had a cover.</li>
            <li>It received 4, rather than 5, stars because I don&#x27;t see a way for a nose/ear hair trimmer to distinguish itself so far beyond its competition as to warrant a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a really old Sharper Image version I bought years ago.  </li>
            <li>Overall it works really well, and the ability to rinse with water has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find out soon enough but anyone that can help is much appreciated.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old</li>
            <li>This one uses a spinning blade, and the last one I used, was a real trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to an update to an old nose hair trimmer when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>Compact enough to travel which is a real plus.</li>
            <li>So if u think buying a trimmer will complete shave everything, this is not your choice.  </li>
            <li>light is a joke, not useful at all unless you are trying to use in the the pitch dark and then isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with this product thus far.  </li>
            <li>but so far it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I had the old style Panasonic and it worked well for a number of years.</li>
            <li>The blade on the 421 is recessed from the tip way too far.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned up my old 411</li>
            <li>The Panasonic RER421KC trimmer works well--better than the old trimmer it replaced.  </li>
            <li>My father is 73 years old and asked for a trimmer a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>HAd this about 4 weeks and no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble with these</li>
            <li>piece of junk, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to send it to Panasconic to get it fixed</li>
            <li>The light is a complete waste, it pointed somewhere off in space, nowhere near where you are trimming.  </li>
            <li>The light is useless - the only way it would work would require one to be able to remove one&#x27;s nose and peer into it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of course too early to evaluate longevity.</li>
            <li>but even when it does, it sounds like it is low on power and doesn&#x27;t have strength to really cut my nose hair.  </li>
            <li>My expectations were far exceeded.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s treated me well.  </li>
            <li>I was completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>60 uses so far).</li>
            <li>I recommend the use of real batteries and not standard rechargeables.  </li>
            <li>A \\&quot;ring of light\\&quot; at the top would have been a much better implementation for the various cutting angles required to trim your nose</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recomendation&lt;br /&gt;You still need old fashion scissors if you want perfection like me.</li>
            <li>But ... when I attempt to use it, it creates sensations so completely unbearable that I dread using it each time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have thick hair, more like peach fuzz in my nose.</li>
            <li>and so it turns slowly and is more of a hair puller than a hair cutter now.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, it&#x27;s good to be wrong...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this newer model has replaced their old model and is not as good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good tool to have in your shaving kit.</li>
            <li>When the motor spins up to full speed this cuts nose hair well, but all too often the motor slows down</li>
            <li>This trimmer had much better reviews than more expensive ones even when I checked sites other than Amazon.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re still on the first and the battery use is very long.</li>
            <li>The nose ane ear trimmer works pretty much as advertized, however, the light is not very good, and really is not needed!</li>
            <li>The tip is small and very smooth to touch, and you can actually press the tip to inside of your nose without any discomfort.  </li>
            <li>You almost have to trap a single hair in the middle of the top of this device, and even then, it takes repeated attempts just to remove a single hair.</li>
            <li>I had previous Panasonic trimmers, it&#x27;s essentially the same although the water proof feature is good, but the one single point of light is not really useful because it doesn&#x27;t shine on the spot it&#x27;s trimming, but outside of the nostril(on the nose).</li>
            <li>This has worked well for me as a \\&quot;first nose hair trimmer,\\&quot; and I recommend it to anyone who thinks maybe there&#x27;s a little too much jungle in their nostrils.   </li>
            <li>While not exactly a topic for the dinner table, this trimmer serves a useful purpose.</li>
            <li>after I posted my original review, I started having trouble with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is well worth the exorbitant price.     </li>
            <li>A single AA battery is much easier, especially considering that you won&#x27;t run this trimmer for more than a few seconds at a time.</li>
            <li>not sure why guys get more hair in their ears and nose then on their head later in life</li>
            <li>My first one I got simply didn&#x27;t turn on, I chalked it up to being defective and exchanged it for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My main \\&quot;like\\&quot; of this product is that it is quiet!  </li>
            <li>I had a similar unit (probably a panasonic unit repackaged for Sharper Image because it is exactly the same item)  </li>
            <li>Having had a panasonic trimmer in the past, I expected this to be equally as effective.....</li>
            <li>The light is useless but looks cool.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this when the older model that I had used for years to trim off my unsightly nose hairs finally stopped working.  </li>
            <li>being lazy, i&#x27;ve lived with it for a year, but i&#x27;ve had enough - time to find something better.</li>
            <li>Was fine at first (light&#x27;s sort of silly though), but the motor is winding down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought similiar products over the years and those that could actually cut ear hairs were so noisy with high pitched sounds that it was a pain to use them.  </li>
            <li>Overall, i highly recommend it to anyone looking around for armor to fight those hideous creatures showing up from inside the nose every now and then.</li>
            <li>However, the recent price is too high.</li>
            <li>Even with brand new batteries it will regularly stall completely on a nose or ear hair.</li>
            <li>This does very little except cover up the sound of your vibrator.</li>
            <li>These blades must have a very close tolerance because it took a very thorough exaination to find which blade was bent, and even then it was so slight</li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t focus where I thought it would, but it&#x27;s easily adjusted to see the hair that needs cutting before I cut it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After you run it under the faucet, hold tightly, bring close to your body, and then extend your arm quickly towards the sing.</li>
            <li>The light really helps and boy does the sucker cut !</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s a light on it, but there is.)</li>
            <li>The light on this machine is absolutely pointless.     </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother buying this thing, small, light, one battery.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much of a job and takes a long time to do what it does.</li>
            <li>but the light is pointless.  </li>
            <li>I also thought the small LED light would be helpful</li>
            <li>The light was absolutely pointless.</li>
            <li>The light on the device is rather pointless.</li>
            <li>The device itself is small and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>But the light seems pointless.  </li>
            <li>The light, however, is a waste as it does not really illuminate much of anything.</li>
            <li>Not easy to clean</li>
            <li>Works fine, but light is not directed to cutting tip.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace one that I ruined by dropping in water.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, lasts a long time, not very expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the light is useless and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use, it reaches those for hard to trim the nose and ears.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Except, as with many other reviews posted here, the one I purchased from Amazon died completely in less than 90 days.</li>
            <li>I pulled out the metal contact (it&#x27;s held in simply by the two \\&quot;points\\&quot; pressing against the plastic), scraped and sanded the contact a bit, but more importantly, I pulled the center portion out quite a bit to bend it enough to press pretty firmly against the battery negative end when reassembled.</li>
            <li>It finally gave out and my wife wouldn&#x27;t share hers with me, so I chose the Panasonic ER421KC as my new trimmer.</li>
            <li>I tried 4 different new batteries.  </li>
            <li>once again, I have gone through several batteries and now it will not work at all with a brand new battery.</li>
            <li>I tried cleaning it several times and inserted a new battery to no avail.       </li>
            <li>I ordered new blades and after a couple of weeks , the same noise came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final word to potential purchasers - nose hair stubble is a completely new experience.</li>
            <li>This nose hair trimmer works decently only when you have brand new batteries.  </li>
            <li>Removed it from the packaging, inserted a new battery only to discover it&#x27;s a dud!</li>
            <li>Ok this stupid rating system said I needed 15 more words so here they are.</li>
            <li>maybe if I could turn the light off the battery would last a few years.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I think was wasted on it was the light.  </li>
            <li>Knowing it had the light which would probably be useless, I bought this for him anyway because I thought that all in all it seemed like it was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>My use of the product has been &#x27;occasional&#x27;, perhaps once a week for light trimming, nothing heavy.  </li>
            <li>The little tiny clear plastic cap that covers the business end of the trimmer is ridiculously easy to lose, compared with the large cap on previous models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay, but it was quite a surprise to say the least!  </li>
            <li>The light is useless to me and actually kind of annoying as it shines in my eyes, but this is not a big enough concern to affect my final rating: 5 out of 5, a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>The first one last several months; the second lasted three weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to point the light in the right direction.</li>
            <li>The slightest bit of pressure seemed to bend in the tip just slightly which stops the product from working (as the blade is closely mounted right under)</li>
            <li>sink if you trim above it and rinse the blade to clean it because that&#x27;s what forced me to replace my older version of the trimmer</li>
            <li>Again, it only worked a few weeks before the power weakened significantly.</li>
            <li>I bought a Panasonic trimmer from Brookstones 3 years ago for $50.00, this trimmer works much better and it&#x27;s less then half the price with shipping.</li>
            <li>The light does nothing to illuminate, very week power, just a little hair and it slows down to a crunch!</li>
            <li>It leaves a little bit of stubble in there but unless someone is staring down your nose, it does an ok job.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item since Panasonic generally  makes quality products.  </li>
            <li>The cheaper ones get stuck, lose power, and just generally don&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li>The light is a pinpoint light and shines someplace different than the cutting head.  </li>
            <li>You can stick it in your nose until the battery dies (which actually is not such a long time), and you won&#x27;t cut as much hair as you could with a pair of scissors in 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re listening Panasonic, bring back the old blade or at least make it available for people to purchase</li>
            <li>I also take away one star because the position of the light is not appropriate , it should be on the same side as the switch.</li>
            <li>the light is pretty much useless, it doesn&#x27;t shine where you are trimming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stick with a simple trimmer and steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li>Mine stopped working not too far outside of warranty.</li>
            <li>The quality is similar to the Panasonic, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>It pulls the hair and much time is spent trying to get it to cut the hair.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is far above all of the others!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We can&#x27;t speak to longevity (yet) since we bought it recently, but thus far it seems to be a high-quality well-designed piece of equipment that does the job it was designed for.  </li>
            <li>Not a whole lot of power, but the question begs as to how much power you&#x27;d like to stick up your nostrils anyways.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>but then it started losing power often and recently quit working completely.  </li>
            <li>It would barely trim anything.  </li>
            <li>Did the job, barely.</li>
            <li>but it is apparently all in order.  </li>
            <li>Either my 15 year old unit was designed differently or I happen to use the LR6 without realizing it.</li>
            <li>dropped it on a tile floor from 3 feet this morning and apparently dented the metal tip.</li>
            <li>Did not hold up very well with minimal use.</li>
            <li>Neither unit failed on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Some directional arrows or a note on the casing would help slow people like me get through advanced technological procedures like changing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The trimmer works OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>Having used the ER411 since it first came out, I asked for this new one because the blade on the old one was getting dull.</li>
            <li>one of the selling-point \\&quot;improvements\\&quot;; of this trimmer over its earlier, less expensive and more compact sister-model is that this one has a light.  </li>
            <li>They emailed me back about 2 weeks later and said to mail it in with my receipt and they would send me a new one.  </li>
            <li>It would not work with several different brands of NEW AA Alkalines.</li>
            <li>Recently I started spending a lot of time in another city and instead of hauling this around I bought a second one for the new place.</li>
            <li>the light is not usefull to me at all but the cutting blade does an adequate job.  </li>
            <li>Excuse to buy a new one...    </li>
            <li>weak, inadequate, finally pitched this one and went to a Wahl which is much much better.</li>
            <li>The light is useless, and the product is a bit large.</li>
            <li>At times, it was hard to take off the cover/tip of the razor to clean it out or adjust the flimsy parts inside to get it to work again.     </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s easily considered overkill for such a small device, but only constant power will address the shortfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have yet to try out the trimmer, and will comment on this in the future after it has been used, however, I already have a HUGE complaint with the packaging of this item.  </li>
            <li>Works really well for nose &amp; ear hair, however the light is useless.  </li>
            <li>The light is a ridiculous gimmick that eats batteries.</li>
            <li>The light on it is useless, I don&#x27;t really see a need for it.  </li>
            <li>only negative with which I can agree is the usefullness of the light on the unit itself.  </li>
            <li>I went back to mu old smaller Panasonic trimmer, even though I have to unscrew the head every time in order to get it to work.  </li>
            <li>The light was worthless, as it wasn&#x27;t positioned appropriately on the trimmer to be of any use    3.</li>
            <li>because this little trimmer does exactly what it promises and I like the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now, and I haven&#x27;t had any major problems with it.</li>
            <li>Very reliable and seems to go a long time on a single battery.</li>
            <li>The switch is apparently worn out after possibly three cumulative hours of operation.</li>
            <li>Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate.</li>
            <li>The cutter spins slowly once in a while (not fast enough to cut) and doesn&#x27;t spin at all most of the time.  </li>
            <li>This worked pretty well for a few months, but then died.</li>
            <li>Works as good as the very expensive trimmers.</li>
            <li>Once in a while after using I clean the Tiny Blades with a Q-Tip, specially the cavity where the blades rest, after few uses it can get very dirty and I can tell by the sound the Trimmer makes.</li>
            <li>When I tried to remove the cap the whole thing came apart and the blade fell down the sink drain.  </li>
            <li>Not enough power or not sharp enough blades</li>
            <li>Bottomline eats batteries, not fine enouh unfortunately not recommended...</li>
            <li>Light is near worthless, take note that you can&#x27;t light and trim at the same time</li>
            <li>Even with a new battery, it stopped after 2 sec.</li>
            <li>we used to have a similar panasonic trimmer that worked great, but this one works so poorly, slow to cut, hard to figure out what angle you&#x27;re holding the edge to cut the hair, and the light seems useless.  </li>
            <li>Every year I buy the new model hoping they fixed the flaws of the previous model, and the same problems keep happening over and over.</li>
            <li>Have had it for a year or less, used it very infrequently and it no longer turns on.  </li>
            <li>My previous model lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It would have gotten a higher review if the light actually pointed at the area the blade was cutting.</li>
            <li>well-conceived (but for that dumb light) and works as it should.  </li>
            <li>The two things I wonder are hair type (maybe it works better for somewhat straighter and/or firmer hair, e.g., typical brown hair?) or that products coming from some off-brand sellers are not as reliable (I usually purchase directly from Amazon instead of other sellers, unless the price differential is huge)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for something that got a lot closer to the skin -- especially for my ears, where I&#x27;m less concerned about \\&quot;filtering.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>On the other hand the 421 is not really much better than the cheap, off-brand $10 trimmers you&#x27;ll find in discount stores.  </li>
            <li>The new one is taking forever to come to me, due to a change in supply (whatever that means)..   </li>
            <li>Overall, the product is fine but not great.  </li>
            <li>The blade is really slow and it takes a long time and repeated efforts to get a clean job done.  </li>
            <li>The actual trimming performance seems to be nearly identical--both of them trim just fine for me (I&#x27;m not looking for a close shave inside my nostrils), but the \\&quot;light\\&quot; on this one is completely useless except as a battery drain.</li>
            <li>The light is a little gimmicky.  </li>
            <li>The light helps guide the user to properly aim the cutting head; it is certainly a benefit for me.  </li>
            <li>, it works fine, it has a light (which is alarmingly practical), and it actually doesn&#x27;t have too bad of a design.    </li>
            <li>If you need light, get a small Maglite which you can also use to find your way around in the dark.</li>
            <li>The light is useless as far as I am concerned unless God had given me eyes on my chin.</li>

            <li> I bought this in 2008 and it&#x27;s working great and as well today as it did seven years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a good product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Very handy.</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job on ears, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t even trim hair effectively!  </li>
            <li> it was the replacement for the discontinued excellent Panasonic ER411 that I had for many years.</li>
            <li> Honestly!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> great price good service</li>
            <li> Works great, the light is a great idea!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am very pleased and this trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works perfectly well, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The good news is, this thing works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my fiance &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li> In this age of over-hyped products, it is good to find one that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> but still.. it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, the performance is not quite as good, so it takes awhile to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Good for the price</li>
            <li> This unit has good power, trims hair with no problems.</li>
            <li> good product&lt;</li>
            <li> good product for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good quality design.</li>
            <li> I loved it, no hair pulling or irritation in nose after the use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with the Panasonic ER421.  </li>
            <li> This is a good item for the price.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic also sells replacement blades, so that is good.  </li>
            <li> Light isn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li> I too was delighted that he welcomed it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was good while it lasted...</li>
            <li> i did a good amount of research for nose trimmers and found this one.  </li>
            <li> I needed to replace the one that I had which was not as good but also did the job.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Operates on battery, but the product is good.  </li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Panasonic use to make a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> nuff said...not that good for ears...</li>
            <li> Does a good job on eyebrows as well FYI.</li>
            <li> Good product to gift.</li>
            <li> To my surprise and relief, I find this trimmer never pulls hairs, but does a good trimming job.</li>
            <li> Good question</li>
            <li> and it did a fair job of trimming hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either good</li>
            <li> This is a good nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> THE GOOD:  </li>
            <li> and he LOVED it.</li>
            <li> but it can go in the shower so its good for me.</li>
            <li> When it works, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It looks good.</li>
            <li> The cheaper Panasonic is probably just as good.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it was wet/dry.  </li>
            <li> It is probably as good as any you will find.  </li>
            <li> and then so it doesn’t get a good rating nor would I recommend it or buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Good trimmer, but</li>
            <li> This one is really good to get rid of almost all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I loved this thing while I had it.</li>
            <li> so I figured that this would be a good bet.</li>
            <li> It does not do a good job in my nose.  </li>
            <li> Works good for ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> but this one seemed to strike me as a good balance between convenience and cost.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and the clean results.</li>
            <li> , It does an excellent job both for the nose hairs as well as the ear hairs, close and clean.</li>
            <li> The greatest feature he liked about it was the light component.</li>
            <li> It was quick and the added eye brow trimmers are great!</li>
            <li> user-replaceable battery is also quite handy - great with your own rechargeables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used the Panasonic Nose Trimmer ER411 for years and have been very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say that we are both pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Compared to my od trimmer this is quiter, better, easier to manuver and fits great in my hand.</li>
            <li> It works OK now but its not that great a design.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, in great condition and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> has like also because the light help better to check out a perfect TRim</li>
            <li> Recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted about a year ago and love it!  </li>
            <li> Voila, more RPM than I ever remember getting!</li>
            <li> It is better to have it then Not have it !      </li>
            <li> The first unit I owned worked flawlessly for about 10 months before I damaged it by dropping.</li>
            <li> I love it for my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> After one more try - unsuccessful - I found the item on another site, and ordered it with no problems - but at a lower price!  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?!?</li>
            <li> , I am overjoyed (yes I do need to get out more !)</li>
            <li> You will love this one!</li>
            <li> This is a product that does what it promises...and more!  </li>
            <li> I love this thing !</li>
            <li> love this product &amp; use it whenever I need to!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great looking and easy to use</li>
            <li> I just got this trimmer a couple of weeks ago and love it, very easy to clean and cuts great!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a very good deal, only need one AA battery if you use an alkaline one can use it for 3-5 months, very good quality and performance</li>
            <li> The bathroom is the most brightly lit room in my house.   </li>
            <li> the light was a great addition to help locate hairs that would otherwise have been missed.  </li>
            <li> This replaced a great Sharper Image Turbo-Groomer 5.0 model that wore out and is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the light helps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair this trimmer is supposed to cut, but it don&#x27;t cut mine.  </li>
            <li> The blade is catching on the interior metal.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a must own for every man.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job quite nicely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> A magnifying mirror with good vanity mirror lighting is better.</li>
            <li> Nice image - a guy with a nose trimmer hanging from his nose -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various nose hair trimmers for years in search of the best, because none of them have been all that great.  </li>
            <li> It really is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> That being said, I am very happy with the purchase as is my husband who happily uses this handy tool regularly.  </li>
            <li> Its water resistance which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> nice unit, but</li>
            <li> nice instructions with the product.</li>
            <li> I like the feel in my hand, kind of like a mini version of the Oral-B Triumph toothbrish series, which I also own and recommend.</li>
            <li> As for the ear, have you ever tried to look into your own ear canal?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to see a video review of this product, but it does keep the nostrils and ears nice and tidy.</li>
            <li> The light is a good idea but the cutter doesn&#x27;t work that good.</li>
            <li> I called the Panasonic warranty department (800-332-5368) who were kind and courteous, but the Rep informed me that the blade assembly (block) was excluded from warranty.  </li>
            <li> It was a nice tool.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Make sure the battery is good.</li>
            <li> Really is this the best we can expect????</li>
            <li> I guess if the power goes out, it&#x27;s a handy backup flashlight?  </li>
            <li> Product was as described and  advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied  with my purchase , Price was good</li>
            <li> Does a nice job on ears.</li>
            <li> This can be used to effectively remove hair from every area, nose, ears, etc.  </li>
            <li> Works perfect - thanks.  </li>
            <li> The top compartment traps a fair of nose hair shavings and mucus.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice unit.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer is great; it trims your hairs, whether they are from your nose or ears, with a clean no hassle way.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model Panasonic that always worked perfect until I needed to replace it.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC is a fantastic piece of grooming equipment that works perfectly and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It worked great, has lots of cool features..</li>
            <li> This compact cutter is very effective in removing nose and ear hair and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The best she could offer was for me to purchase a new block,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about two months now, and it does a good job though it does sound kind of underpowered.</li>
            <li> Not the total best trimmer in the world but really good for what you pay.</li>
            <li> It does the job quickly and efficiently and  is a great grooming aid.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic does the best job, is easy to use, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It works good, effective, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, cuts it cleanly.</li>
            <li> The construction of the unit is very sturdy, though, and feels very good to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> I use it since years with great success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed by it so far (after 2-3 uses).  </li>
            <li> But based on trimming, I&#x27;d have to say the Panasonic is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly light, compact and feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I own the Wahl trimmer and have never been satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, the trimmer performed better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Tried about 4 or 5 of these before finding this one, clearly the best of them.</li>
            <li> The light is good for a post-trim inspection.  </li>
            <li> It worked brilliantly, as I wasn&#x27;t putting it through anything intense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s comfortable and feels good.</li>
            <li> Gentleman, if I have to have a meeting with one more college professor, economist, or scientist who looks as though they don&#x27;t own a mirror--I am going to shoot myself.  </li>
            <li> but this one not even as bright as the power light on my computer.  </li>
            <li> The light is good too.</li>
            <li> the trimmer itself is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far...</li>
            <li> The light &amp;#34;never&amp;#34; shines where it will do any good.</li>
            <li> Light is good for checking your work after the job, it does not point into your nose.</li>
            <li> This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> I buy this product on amazon, and is a excelent product the light is good when you trim your nose.</li>
            <li> In the beginning this trimmer worked exceptionally well in my husband&#x27;s ears, but the blades dulled very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is great to use; easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love love love this thing!</li>
            <li> Works great, does a very nice job on tiny hairs too!  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer and the light is kind of cool, you could also use the light in an emergency and have some light!!</li>
            <li> This product worked great when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li> I had good expectations for this product based on other reviewers, but I found it to be medicre at best.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for the first 6 months or so</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t do that great of a job in the first place.</li>
            <li> worked great at first but died within 6 months of use  </li>
            <li> exactly as described, worked perfectly, great communication would recommend purchasing from this vendor if anyone is considering this type of purchase</li>
            <li> The top twists off easily for very easy and effective cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not well constructed - very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This trimmer trims very smooth.</li>
            <li> very light use.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use, and trims hairs nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During its life it worked well and effectively and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The light just shines all around my nose, it&#x27;s somewhat comical!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine and is handy.</li>
            <li> This is a very good nose trimmer and the replacement for my old Wahl - which lasted about a month.  </li>
            <li> But, this one is quieter (very good while trimming inside ears), trims the hair closer to the skin, and never pulls the hairs like the old one did.  </li>
            <li> Worked OK up to then.</li>
            <li> Has good battery life and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering the manual one, sounds like it is built better....</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> The quality &amp; power was much better than the Wahl, and the Panasonic trimmed better too.  </li>
            <li> but I still think a product should be able to withstand some travel...</li>
            <li> I have yet to call Panasonic, but I sure plan on it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just so damn satisfying.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a distraction, than an improvement...</li>
            <li> It seems to be a more precision blade assembly</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer over a year ago and was satisfied with it intially, however after a year - it just died.  </li>
            <li> Imagine a power driven nose hair puller - that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m glad for the better on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> What more needs to be said about a nose hair trimmer??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> something sure does.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend which is much better than the Panasonic ER405AC Wet/Dry Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer I bought for myself.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; such a good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well pleased with this device.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d say that unless you have tremors or something, you&#x27;d be much better off with a $3-pair of manicure scissors.  </li>
            <li> The top busted off but</li>
            <li> I have a feeling this may be the reason many have had their trimmers quit working.</li>
            <li> but it probably would have ended up costing me more in time and effort.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> There might be a better one out there but not for the price.</li>
            <li> but I do think it could be better in three ways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love them all.</li>
            <li> Buy confidently.</li>
            <li> panasonic devices are generally better than this.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll just have to use more often...</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in 2006, and ended up using a cheapo trimmer that I picked up at Marshall&#x27;s much more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it worked like magic.  </li>
            <li> ok, they were boarderline torture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve updated this review at the end - I found a better</li>
            <li> Buy it and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> And the light does come in handy.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works OK</li>
            <li> It was not my favorite gift to give.  </li>
            <li> If you want to use the light to target something, it&#x27;s handy.  </li>
            <li> better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheapo version availalbe at Pharmacies.</li>
            <li> and I love the light!  </li>
            <li> Boy, what a difference and not for the better.</li>
            <li> If this product is on sell, I would suggest buying it, but if it is not on sale, you might want to look for a better trimmer for the price.  </li>
            <li> OK, I have to admit...</li>
            <li> This works for me and it makes the trimmer more efficient in its cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Im sure.</li>
            <li> Still wish the hair was on top of my head.</li>
            <li> I own a PV GS500 camcorder and a ES8168S shaver - both fantastic products</li>
            <li> Trims better than anything I have tried, and I have tried just about everything.  </li>
            <li> I have too many chargers to carry every time I travel.  </li>
            <li> so make sure you do that.</li>
            <li> But in contrast to nose, many may have more hair on the ear rather than in the ear.    </li>
            <li> In the end I found one AA unit (among MANY AA Alkalines) that it does work with.</li>
            <li> If you have alot growing on up there or in your ears look for a more \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; strength model.</li>
            <li> you just mowed to get the many blades that resisted it.</li>
            <li> The light comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I dropped the top piece in my bathroom sink drain and couldn&#x27;t get it out.</li>
            <li> This one gets the job done in about 2 minutes and does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;ll see if best buy carries the same model, just to save all that&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The light feature could be nice, if an engineer would have designed it instead of Helen Keller.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that it works, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It works better for the nose.</li>
            <li> Tweezers work better .</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Well-built, light, safe to use and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> and I think was a better product than this one.</li>
            <li> no complaints and a hell of a lot better than the crappy ones i got drug stores branded with the name &#x27;conair&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Sharper Image one has a better tip design to catch and cut hair, which was why I went with 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Price is ok.</li>
            <li> Light is nice to have.</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay</li>
            <li> This latest model is efficient, convenient with a stronger motor.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer</li>
            <li> ER112 works 100% better than this one.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Conair.  </li>
            <li> It lightweight, quite and safe</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure.</li>
            <li> None have lasted more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not pointed properly to be able to do so).  </li>
            <li> But most of all, this unit is super-cheap.  </li>
            <li> It assembles as so: the top plastic piece twists on into a groove that holds it, the \\&quot;guts\\</li>
            <li> CHEAP!      </li>
            <li> This works ok, but not like the trimmer I had before.</li>
            <li> It works but it needs more time to get things done.</li>
            <li> Nothing would pursuade her to repair the unit after 10 more minutes of discussion.  </li>
            <li> Good buy, worth the price.</li>
            <li> The ER415 is very much better.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;ve never had a nose trimmer</li>
            <li> He has only used it once in about two weeks because it did the job perfectly</li>
            <li> I was also glad we wouldn&#x27;t have another power cord to deal with.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic product works infinitely better than the Whal unit it is replacing.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Sure</li>
            <li> Good buy well worth the money.</li>
            <li> A better choice is Groom Mate.</li>
            <li> Much better than the electric Panasonic.</li>
            <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and it is safe for him to use.</li>
            <li> Find better.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> But I was expecting the motor to have more power considering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely happy with it and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t lose with this trimmer  :)</li>
            <li> After about two years the top part stared falling off and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> So, if your are also using for ears on your SO, get the one with the light!</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried most of them including The Sharper Image.</li>
            <li> This was a worthwhile purchase, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would love to find one that works as well . . .</li>
            <li> I breath much better thru my noise believe it or not.     </li>
            <li> He used it maybe 10 times, then it wouldn&#x27;t cut any more.</li>
            <li> Battery life was good, this has been easy to clean, and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs.  </li>
            <li> This one is excellent, if you only use it once!.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I&#x27;m writing a review about a nose trimmer. :)</li>
            <li> It does say on the package that it will trim no closer than 1/16&amp;#34;, so it&#x27;s OK for the ears, but I get better results with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> have been using it for many years now . . .</li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic shaver that I love</li>
            <li> along w/ trimming the hair around the top of ears/sideburns.  </li>
            <li> and it seems like its the best of all possible trimmers.</li>
            <li> I have bought another to make sure I got one around for grooming if one breaks.</li>
            <li> bought this model because a reviewer said the light was a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> But I’m glad I bought it now.  </li>
            <li> Ignore the recommendation to use disposable batteries, it works much better with the Sanyo Eneloop batteries.</li>
            <li> Im sure most women wouldn&#x27;t admit needing a trimmer, but I wanted to review the item because it does work so well.</li>
            <li> I think he like this better then the no</li>
            <li> What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much better than the trimmer I bought 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I had an model, it was slimmer had more power and was more efficient</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband and he is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend to people.</li>
            <li> The device does what it&#x27;s intended to do as advertised, but the tickling sensation it creates in my nose is more than I can stand for even 2 or 3 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Someone should do a better job of writing instructions.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s goofy.</li>
            <li> It worked well at first: great at trimming, easy to use, and did not hurt.</li>
            <li> Battery life has been great as it&#x27;s still working fine on it&#x27;s first battery.</li>
            <li> But his one does have a nice cushy handle for easy grip and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic that was great but dropped it causing it to not work any longer, but could not find that model &amp; settled for this one.</li>
            <li> My older version was great</li>
            <li> i just did, it works great, better than the battery operated ones, and, as a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t have a motor to can out on you.  or needing new batteries all the time.  </li>
            <li> The light is good for a quick review of your work, and to see if you&#x27;ve missed anything.  </li>
            <li> It never pulls and it cuts very cleanly.</li>
            <li> The ER411NC was the best until now, but it would cause minor trimming agony.  </li>
            <li> This nose trimmer has a nice shape, heft and a cool rubberized surface.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, I bought it for the nose but was hoping it would be more effective as a precision groomer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked good the first 4 times.</li>
            <li> if you go in at an angle it trims pretty good.</li>
            <li> It does a good job just not as well as my first one.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 18 months, and loved it the first six months or so.  </li>
            <li> I am happy but it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s billing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is indeed useful, and you can get a good look up your nostril.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to clean as well.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a simple nose hair trimmer for a good price this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The light is incredibly useful, it&#x27;s actually surprising.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> On the positive side it did a good job of nose and ear trimming.</li>
            <li> This is the original and better than the one with the curved head :)</li>
            <li> I usually am impressed by the build quality of most Panasonic items, but the metal tip that hides the blades on this is extremely flimsy.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic brand is superb as we have other products by them and they work wonderful, even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li> It is a very good trimmer for personal use and for a gift</li>
            <li> The overall quality of the trimmer is very good.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> No pulling experienced so far.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with this one.</li>
            <li> My old \\&quot;non-ER\\&quot; trimmer worked great.</li>
            <li> Includes a light instead of the mirrored cap the upgraded version has which in my opinion is better.</li>
            <li> Battery life so far has been great.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I bought it because I hoped the quality would be better then the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> This one runs more smoothly, and is stronger.  </li>
            <li> I have blinded myself more than anything with that light.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s the most important.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light it has helps make sure you dont miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> , so far it works Great.</li>
            <li> Most importantly remove the blade cap and wash thoroughly after each use or your blades</li>
            <li> Good sissors are very expensive,so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  </li>
            <li> Good for the machinery but not so much for your nose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much so it should still be in good shape.</li>
            <li> this may very well be a good product</li>
            <li> Its a really fast and strong machine, my husband loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of guy who will spend a ton of money to find the right product so that when I need to use it, it will do what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer does not cut most hair without a significant amount of gyrations of angles for it to get the hair in the openings.</li>
            <li> This is the best model of trimmers my husband has ever used and refuses to use any other brand or model.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li> Easy and efficient..........</li>
            <li> In addition, the head is removable for easy cleaning.    </li>
            <li> But when I turned the unit on, the blades were making a more pronounced contact with the inside of the metal tip and while it still trimmed hair, it had a pronounced tendency to tug/pull rather than cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to pack for a trip if i need to.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and move around.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t dare drop it or the housing of the blades with easily break.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Kudos to Amazon for an easy return process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered another model</li>
            <li> NOT TO TAD AN ITEM LIGHT COULD BE MORE ACCURATE</li>
            <li> Easy and not as noisey as the hedge clipper style trimmers.</li>
            <li> Have to use it to realize how easy it is</li>
            <li> The light is kind of on the side of the unit and my husband said he can&#x27;t think of ANY reason why or when it would be useful.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use and easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li> The service was very quick, too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It easily jams and needs to be taken apart.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and no concerns for pulling or tugging hair out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use/clean.  </li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to use, efficient.</li>
            <li> Mine died: when I took the battery cap off, the battery had leaked and I couldn&#x27;t easily get the battery out.</li>
            <li> Cleans easy, seems like the battery AA life will go awhile.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever and cleaning the product is easy.</li>
            <li> needs strong charged battery.</li>
            <li> In all seriousness it smelled STRONGLY of rotting organic compounds.     </li>
            <li> it feels good in the hand, cuts easily and quickly plus the light is actually useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 4/5/10 - Still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Trims the nose/ear hair and keeps running strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband in November of 2006, and it is still going strong after over two years.</li>
            <li> I got this one because my old one gave up the ghost after years of good service and the nose hair trimming head on my multitasking beard trimmer pulls more hair than it cuts.</li>
            <li> I always had to play with the end that holds the battery in to make it run, and it never did run to strong...</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it to everyone, men and women.</li>
            <li> His comment was that he likes it very much and it is handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> 2 year warranty is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic recommendation is kind of funny since Panasonic owns Sanyo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product and maybe ok at the price, but I will need to replace it soon.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and the light makes it easy to see those spots that are often missed.  </li>
            <li> It quickly and easily removed most of the nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate and light weight.</li>
            <li> Works fine for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Brought it in Feb. 2008, and its been working fine till now.</li>
            <li> The trimmer function itself is just fine.  </li>
            <li> It looks fine</li>
            <li> Who knows why they felt obligated to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; a product that was working fine.    </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002D5Y92 Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted]]&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer fits easily in the hand and is light weight.</li>
            <li> This works fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine though.  </li>
            <li> Over all seems fine.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer work just fine</li>
            <li> One would think to replace the battery, but the battery was fine.  </li>
            <li> Light is pretty handy but takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Light, well balanced, trims hairs easily without pinching nose.  </li>
            <li> end cutter feature especially good for outer hair growth; built-in light not useful but harmless; also bought some for others who also like it.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> Does the job, comfortable, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Have had it for 2 years...runs fine.</li>
            <li> I really love the light feature and also the fact the whole unit is immersible in water (makes the cleaning process very easy).  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I wasn&#x27;t able to use it because the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; on the top doesn&#x27;t work when connected to the top.  </li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job of trimming nose hair, and if you don&#x27;t like the light, turn the  instrument upside down</li>
            <li> This product is about half the price which is good, it is lighter, which is good.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But this one is so nice and easy that my nose wants it every day.</li>
            <li> but I am fine just using the light in the bathroom to take care of any hairs that poke out of my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a bright light, two mirrors, a fair amount of agility with your fingers and hands, some patience and a little time.</li>
            <li> this is a very high class item for a low cost, im impressed.</li>
            <li> so I bought this one especially as I thought the light is a great idea...</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m still happy with it, but wish you could switch off the light.</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t for use while the trimmer is inside your nostril.  </li>
            <li> Your supposed to use the light to look into your nose while the trimmer is out, so that you can see inside your nose &amp; look for any hairs that may have been missed.  </li>
            <li> How could anyone expect to see the light inside their nostril while the trimmer is in there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done everything I can to try to fix it, but it just appears to be a bit cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomically the device is comfortable to hold, along with the rubberized finish.</li>
            <li> There is a light on it</li>
            <li> I put it to use last night and it works great.  </li>
            <li> and so cheap.......</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t see the reason for the light.  </li>
            <li> Was not returned because then Amazon&#x27;s free shipping would be cancelled.  </li>
            <li> It was a sharper image and did a great job (except for ultimately quitting).  </li>
            <li> I thought the light would be focused so that when you were using the clippers it would shine where you were clipping</li>
            <li> You have to remove the clippers and then shine the light and then resume clipping.</li>
            <li> I like the light feature  </li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that the light is NOT intended to help you guide the device while it&#x27;s in your nostril and trimming, but instead is intended to enable you to check your work, and locate any stubborn/missed hairs for another pass.    </li>
            <li> The blade inside attempts to spin but won&#x27;t I looked inside and saw how truly cheap this was.</li>
            <li> I had another cheap trimmer for years.</li>
            <li> light is useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Except, how do you look into your ear with the light, I can&#x27;t figure it out..??</li>
            <li> The quality of this speaks for itself - I always buy Panasonic items when available.</li>
            <li> This unit is easy to use and clean and works without pain.</li>
            <li> The light is a joke.</li>
            <li> I never understood why there was a light.</li>
            <li> light is useless&lt;br</li>
            <li> He likes this one as well, saying it&#x27;s as smooth as the manual one.</li>
            <li> It has a light on the side</li>
            <li> It is constructed well, does not feel cheap.  </li>
            <li> bathroom mirror lacks a vanity light.</li>
            <li> Light could have been brighter or easier to aim into the nostril while in use</li>
            <li> They are more powerful</li>
            <li> This is my second one and it works great.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, but I am puzzled about why there is a light?  </li>
            <li> but I guess you get what you pay for and the price was cheap.  </li>
            <li> Could have done without the light, but I didnt buy it for the light.  </li>
            <li> Is it me or do all the reviews for this product sound phony?  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sound genuine...</li>
            <li> The ER411 did such a great job, I don&#x27;t know why panasonic had to fiddle with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and cleans up well and does what it needs to do with ease.</li>
            <li> It works, but the light shines in your eye and not in your nostril.  </li>
            <li> have no idea what the light is for...  </li>
            <li> Smooth running and cuts well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light anyway.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the light anyway.  </li>
            <li> One and one but not with light.</li>
            <li> The built-in light is helpful in identifying hair particles</li>
            <li> quite and smooth running</li>
            <li> oohh.. the smell of freshly cut nose hair 8-)</li>
            <li> Its cheap and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to reviewers who complain about the light.  </li>
            <li> After you&#x27;ve trimmed your nostrils, you shine the light in there to check the results.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light and most trimmers don&#x27;t even have one, so the light is somewhat useful.</li>
            <li> the Light  </li>
            <li> The unit was easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t get me started on the light.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed about light is not point to inside of nose hole.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and it does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> Just wish they would get rid of the light to save the battery.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> it has a light on it that does not shine anywhere close to where it trims.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t get the light...</li>
            <li> But the cheap one I bought for 10 bucks 4 years ago still works.</li>
            <li> Thank god the nose hair trimmer has a flash light on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the light, come on, the light is useles</li>
            <li> You can also use device to precisely cut an errant hair sticking out of your sideburn as well.  </li>
            <li> Great device, if you can ever get over the ticklish concept that you actually need a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find any use for its light though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on the ear hair trimming because i fortunately don&#x27;t have that problem</li>
            <li> The light makes it easier to see in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT DOES PULL YOUR HAIRS AT TIMES AND THE LIGHT SHINES EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> the light: you aren&#x27;t supposed to use the light WHILE you are using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see a line of trimmers that use one of the newer Li-Ion 3.7 volt batteries and a more powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Hope I got a smile out of someone out there who read this. :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the light points into the ear or nostril while you&#x27;re trimming hair in those areas.</li>
            <li> That one was more powerful than this one.  </li>
            <li> this does everything it&#x27;s supposed to (excluding the &#x27;light&#x27; feature).</li>
            <li> This is cheap and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still yet to figure out what the light is for.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer died after one year of light use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a light to find my nose</li>
            <li> and once it is in there, the light has no value.      </li>
            <li> Why did they put a light on it, it drains the battery, and I can&#x27;t remove the light.</li>
            <li> P/N WER415K1058, at the cost of $12.18 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, rinky-dink motor...died after 6 months and MAYBE 5 uses.  </li>
            <li> what is the deal with the light on this?  </li>
            <li> The built in light can be bothersome at times.  </li>
            <li> I found the trimmer to be virtually pain free.</li>
            <li> , cuts my closer than my Remington trimmer, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Had a Panasonic before lasted a few years,,very impressed.</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the predecessor to this model, the 411, for several years and had great luck with it.  </li>
            <li> --when you use this trimmer on nose and ear hairs, there&#x27;s no way you can see what the light illuminates.</li>
            <li> Gave it a 1 star reduction because it is supposed to have a light and the light one mine was inoperative on arrival.</li>
            <li> Forget the light on this thing because it might as well not exist.  </li>
            <li> I recomend to everyone to use this product, it is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the light attachment.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Light is helpful.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great, it cuts the hair in your ears and nose with out pulling and enough power to get it all.</li>
            <li> It smoothly and closely shaves the hair without pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li> the led light is a joke, I don&#x27;t know how the thing stays together</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> great only for the nose</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t bother with this model and get the one without the light.  </li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t seem to aim where you are trimming, but I don&#x27;t find this to be a problem</li>
            <li> I would pick another brand without a light.</li>
            <li> It is smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> it really isn&#x27;t useful beyond being an interesting feature.  </li>
            <li> (That is, the light should NOT, in my opinion, be a deciding factor in the purchase decision.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy using this thing.</li>
            <li> the light doesnt light anything up in your nose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the light.</li>
            <li> The light is on the side.  </li>
            <li> And the direction of thr light is not adjustable.  </li>
            <li> the light was placed at the end of he trimmer and shone around the blades INTO the nostril.  </li>
            <li> the one without the light.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The light is useful to make sure you did not miss any nose hairs.</li>
            <li> and they are both far superior to the Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month now - so far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The light is very useful.  </li>
            <li> The light may not be very useful, atleast I did not find any use.</li>
            <li> The light is very useful but not when your trimming your hairs.</li>
            <li> What more could you want, right?</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs</li>
            <li> Very nice and quiet also!!</li>
            <li> I find this tool to be very useful.</li>
            <li> and you have to pull the hair to get free to clean it and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use with no pulling of hair.</li>
            <li> Trims nose/ear hairs rather quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Fortunate for me, I dropped it in the shower and decieded to try the ER421KC.  Panasonic has gotten this one right!  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this product off the shelf at target.</li>
            <li> My fiance was amusingly excited to receive this as a gift.  </li>
            <li> wasnt sure about it at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for many years and the first two times I used the nose trimmer it worked</li>
            <li> I had that one originally.</li>
            <li> Face it, the original Sharper Image product is gone so</li>
            <li> Additionally, my wife is completely happy that I am no longer leaving long nose hairs on her floorboard during our commute.</li>
            <li> I cannot seem to find a good powerful trimmer that will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s order processing and delivery were excellent as usual.  </li>
            <li> When I received it I was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> How excited can you be about a nose hair trimmer?  </li>
            <li> Rich (rich584)</li>
            <li> I bought the first one at a drugstore in WI, then bought 3 more since 2010 on Amazon,</li>
            <li> This is a unique product it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair trimmer -- how excited can you get about it?</li>
            <li> else my face is more crooked that most!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the light particularly useful, but I don&#x27;t need a light to find my nose.</li>
            <li> Luckily they were still available.  </li>
            <li> Nose trimmings can be a hassle to clean out of a sink, so use in the shower is reccomended.</li>
            <li> sure how much use the light is</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these gadgets and this one works the best by far.  </li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t do much but its not like you are paying more for that feature.</li>
            <li> Be sure to unscrew the top and clean it out frequently.  </li>
            <li> Does a good enough job; does easily and quickly and neatly trim away his nose hair and ear hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to use, and clips the hair to a decent length.</li>
            <li> I really like the usability of this product - easy to clean, lightweight, good trimming action, and does not pull hairs out.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer though and better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You can use this for Trimming Nose Hair, Ear Hair, Hair on your head and get a unique hair cut, I love it sooo much,</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it...</li>
            <li> Ive been using this now since 11/2006 and its pretty much simple operation, works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still nice to have a light in the general area.  </li>
            <li> This is the first nose and ear trimmer I have bought, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be a useful product.  </li>
            <li> Exactly to my expectations, &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product to use , easy to clean, does the job 100%.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really powerful, doesn&#x27;t do a great job, and the light...</li>
            <li> My husband appears to be delighted -the tool works simply and well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light isn&#x27;t useful at all, so don&#x27;t let that be any determining</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking  for an upgrade that will last this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> The light IS useful - it allows you to see into the nether regions of your nostrils to catch those that might otherwise show their hairs</li>
            <li> its a simple device for a good price.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the low price.</li>
            <li> The light is not as useful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> , I really need to purchase a better one.</li>
            <li> As others have commented, the light isn&#x27;t pointed anyplace useful to dispel the darkness in the nose.</li>
            <li> Good product for the low price.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Panasonic    Love, Bilbo</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, small form factor and light works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry Panasonic especially since your products and warranty coverage are usually good, but not in this case.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a pleasure to use because you can continually hear when it cuts a hair, giving you satisfaction :-) , and it really does cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, useful.</li>
            <li> Two from the local stores were just not as good.  </li>
            <li> Every adult should own one.</li>
            <li> I may be in the minority here, but the light doesn&#x27;t seem all that useful to me</li>
            <li> This only good for nore hair.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job with trimming nose hair, but in my opinion does not cut close enough in the ears.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if it had a exchangeable straight head.</li>
            <li> They want 3 more words--OK Really junk</li>
            <li> I continue to use the device despite my full satisfaction with its performance.  </li>
            <li> It is the latest in a line of vibrating clippers, with this one having a new wrinkles, that it is waterproof and has a light, or so Panasonic claims.  </li>
            <li> Good sharp blades, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> What I mean is that it would be best if you refrain from just cramming it up your nose.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo trims them beautifully, then washes clean.</li>
            <li> Light did not work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> It quickly runs out of full power and then it tugs and pulls on your nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Ihavent had any problems with mine and it works great, i dont know what other people were doing and how they hurt themselves.</li>
            <li> The new model is just as good as the older version.</li>
            <li> Its shape is better and the switch is better, but the Panasonic blades are bent at a different angle and have a tendency to grab my nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> As for the light -it is not too useful while you are trimming, but is useful when you need to check your work.    </li>
            <li> Fast, painless and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Just a quick review....</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands including Wahl and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, well built, and cuts clean and quickly just like it should.  </li>
            <li> Could even make you go from looking like a hairy slob to a super model.</li>
            <li> The product is good, I thought the light would help, not really.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend kept asking for one, ando delivery was quick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost worthy of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Batteries go quick.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t think it shines right up the nose the whole time you&#x27;re trimming; it does somewhat, but the main purpose of the light is to have it handy</li>
            <li> this replaces one I had for many, many years...needed a new blade but just replacing the old one with this one was cheap and convenient.</li>
            <li> And it was pretty cheap, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, when you first get it, it has a light oil film on the cutter.  </li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose!  </li>
            <li> but after you develop your own technique it becomes apparent as to why the designers and engineers chose that speed.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a step up from the cheap (~$10) first trimmer I bought.</li>
            <li> Well my good old Dad didn&#x27;t raise any sissies and I just want one to cut like my old cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li> The 415 cuts much closer and provides a clean, smooth finish around the nose and ears.  </li>
            <li> I have a strong feeling that pretty much any of the brands and models available</li>
            <li> originally started by buying the Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was able to hold it on and continue use, but this was not practical, so I bought a new one.     </li>
            <li> so i searched the internet for a new one and settled on the panasonic er421kc bought it and was glad i did man that rotary cutter gets the nose and ear hairs in no time.</li>
            <li> The new one more than lives up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Opened it in great excitement, since my previous trimmer died a week ago and I&#x27;ve missed it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the nose groomer because we had a previous one that worked great, also from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The battery life on the previous model was great.  </li>
            <li> First, the light actually is useful...</li>
            <li> It works adequately, though it seems to eat batteries, and it&#x27;s not as powerful as desired.  </li>
            <li> Small, compact, works perfectly, and shaves very close with no fear of snagging the skin.  </li>
            <li> Blade head is tool large to get fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Good little trimmer, easy to manage, no snagging or pulling.    </li>
            <li> This little device is a good size for the road and stores easily on the shelf between trips.</li>
            <li> The light is a joke, since it&#x27;s aimed directly down the barrel (though to be fair, all trimmers seem to do this - don&#x27;t ask me why they don&#x27;t aim off to the side</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it should!</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars except that the claim that the \\&quot;light\\&quot; that is a part of this is a great asset is not true.  </li>
            <li> But after tweaking it with some needle nose pliers, it seems to actually run better than ever!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what my hubby wanted for Christmas (and he didn&#x27;t even know it!).  </li>
            <li> The new one is far superior.</li>
            <li> Old toothbrush works just fine!</li>
            <li> like they say and clean everything before the first use.</li>
            <li> the light is purely a marketing add on.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer takes a little getting used to but does a great job.   </li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Trust me, if you take it a little at a time, the pain is greatly diminished and the effectiveness of the trimmer is enhanced.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this little puppy and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> A very good product, especially for the low cost.</li>
            <li> In theory the LED light shouldn&#x27;t draw much power, but....</li>
            <li> The light is not of much help, but I did not find that to be a problem.</li>
            <li> The light which is attached to the trimmer really does not help at all.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and works very well.</li>
            <li> not that I expect the light takes that much power.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a point for the light, but whatever.</li>
            <li> The built-in light isn&#x27;t very practical</li>
            <li> Light doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the point of the LED light, but I just ignore it.</li>
            <li> The light on the unit does absolutely nothing to assist in trimming hair in the target area.</li>
            <li> instructions are fairly accurate, but there are errors which require patience to unravel (as though one really requires instructions to utilize a nasal hair trimmer!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers.</li>
            <li> but it is nice and quiet</li>
            <li> For $15 this is one device well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was great initially but now the motor has grown considerably weaker over time, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Infact the ER421KC has NO cutting sensation in the shower and</li>
            <li> I also liked the idea that it used external AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> Only improvement I would recommend is the light; it sure doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense because of where it&#x27;s aimed.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth $15.    </li>
            <li> I bought one of these trimmers 10 years ago and it didn&#x27;t work worth a damn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return it if it was (1) returnable and (2) worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> and I do find it useful.</li>
            <li> I find this extremely useful as does my wife.</li>
            <li> Good product, better then most, still not perfect.</li>
            <li> I put in a tested fresh battery and switch it to on and nothing happens.</li>
            <li> Had the switch been on the same side as the light, things would have lit up better in my nose.</li>
            <li> Okay product, but I expected better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a much better value than my old sharper image one, I just hope it</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer just wasn&#x27;t stong enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> But, not enough power to be effective.  </li>
            <li> This one does a FAR better job of trimming the nose, ear, and even stray eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li> Rarely hurts.    </li>
            <li> I can laugh about it now.   </li>
            <li> She has a tendency to make fun of my technique, but she never complains about my grooming.</li>
            <li> but this trimmer is outstanding for its quiet operation and the light helps locate areas needing trimming.  </li>
            <li> Works well, the unit doesn&#x27;t pinch nearly as much as some of the others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The light, while seemingly gimmicky, works nicely to make sure you don&#x27;t miss a spot.</li>
            <li> not so.. not all that useful..</li>
            <li> &quot; It works ok, but not really any better than the $5 cheapo model from just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> best nose hair trimmer , are always panasonic, i always buy them, if they are lost or broken.</li>
            <li> I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Not quit as good as expected.</li>
            <li> A powerful LED might make a difference.    </li>
            <li> I hoped this could be helped by adding fresh batteries</li>
            <li> This does the job, no cutting, etc. of skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool for $16.  </li>
            <li> It is a much better design, with the actual trimmer feeling comfortable in my nose and ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a brand new battery it works ok, goes through batteries very, very fast.</li>
            <li> Other then that, it is definitively better then most.</li>
            <li> They cut well, cleanly, everything I expected from a cutter of this kind.  </li>
            <li> It also sports a built-in light, which the older model didn&#x27;t, but I haven&#x27;t found that useful yet.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li> It is also convenient to be wet/dry as I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting a shock when I use it right out of the shower.    </li>
            <li> I knocked out of the medicine cabinet and it bounced around in the sink (a fall of about 1 1/2 feet) and both  times the unit started right up and worked</li>
            <li> and you can start using it right away.</li>
            <li> It would not work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> (yes you read that right) trimmed, styled, and colored - to do so.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be too picky, right?</li>
            <li> They got the nose cap right</li>
            <li> I kindly informed her that the cost of a new trimmer was only $16 at Amazon with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> There is a tiny light which doesn&#x27;t add much and the clear plastic top needs to be better designed.</li>
            <li> The first few months, it was a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> For the first few weeks, it worked great.  </li>
            <li> it has lasted a long time, cheaply made falls apart a lot does not trim to well but its cheap !</li>
            <li> The light is pretty much a gimmick.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great the first few times.  </li>
            <li> This replaced an older Sharper Image model that has not been available for years now.  </li>
            <li> Overall dimensions and weight are appropriate, and its single-axis (straight line) tapered cylindrical shape makes it easy to manipulate efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend but am still wondering - what is the light for?</li>
            <li> I never see the use of the light that is inbuilt - but otherwise I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i only use good batteries, but still, i put in a new one.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off using a mini-mag light or one of those little LED jobbies if you need a light.     </li>
            <li> This one was a couple of bucks more, but certainly a better piece of kit than the previous.    </li>
            <li> I got it because I had the previous model which worked much better than this one until the battery died after many years.</li>
            <li> But it works more or less ok</li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts well without pulling hairs, but the hair cutting process does produce a strong tickling sensation to the nose hairs; otherwise, perfect!</li>
            <li> The new one seems to be working fine, so we will see.</li>
            <li> Light is good for checking deep up there but not essential since no one can see up there anyway.  </li>
            <li> It does a really remarkable job of painlessly removing nose hair - far better than the small scissors, etc.  </li>
            <li> So just go back to the good old seaser and smile.</li>
            <li> The second unit worked flawlessly for a little over 2 years before I also damaged it by dropping.</li>
            <li> The light is a good idea, but it is really hard to remove hair with it.</li>
            <li> The cleanest shaving of nose and ear hair I&#x27;ve ever experienced; better than my much older Panasonic, and several other brands.</li>
            <li> -- how can the trimmer and the light fit in one&#x27;s nostril at the same time --</li>
            <li> Tweezers are really the only effective way to remove ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> Basic and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Finally... something that actually works and does a great job clearing out the nose and ear hair.  </li>
            <li> Only need to use it about every 3 days since it does such a great job.</li>
            <li> sure if the lighted tip was worth the extra couple bucks.  </li>
            <li> But this one works well and is quiet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Invest a few more buck and get a better model.</li>
            <li> The light, for me, is of no use as it seems to never point where I would need it to if I needed extra light up my nose.</li>
            <li> and this trimmer has been great with chopping those down to normal length.  </li>
            <li> 18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eventually it died and I was happy to find I could replace it with the exact same model from Amazon at a very low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because MORE then LIKELY someone else will be cutting his ear hair for him, this light comes in handy!!!</li>
            <li> I had it too, and this thing has solved it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> just have not used it very much yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model is far more substantial  with a good engine and nice cutting surface.</li>
            <li> Though the water proof capabilities allow you to run this bugger under the faucet, your normal faucet doesn&#x27;t do much to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Does the job but takes a little time to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and was excited to have gotten a new one.</li>
            <li> This item worked well at first.  </li>
            <li> The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> I expect a repeat performance of the first one.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear hair trimmer isn&#x27;t the first unit of this type I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li> Pretty soon they&#x27;ll market one that can text, take pictures and play music.    </li>
            <li> but this Panasonic ER421  really rocks!  </li>
            <li> Subsequently it has been modified, and is just a bit better than this one being reviewed.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and it works better than the last one he had.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well -</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> That said, this thing is working exactly as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Panasonic trimmer, sadly, never worked as intended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving up on Panasonic and after my el cheapo groomer died, I am getting a Vortex trimmer which seems to be rated higher than this one.</li>
            <li> It was better than the Connair I had prior to it whose motor you could smell burning as you used it.</li>
            <li> My husband has since grown a beard and spends even more time trimming his facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> When I first recieived and used this product I rated it with 5 Stars and wrote the review below.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much it!  </li>
            <li> It works, was not expensive and is durable.</li>
            <li> It has a light on it so that he can see in dim lit situations.  </li>
            <li> The light is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> This trimmer never had much power so it would often snag hairs (ouch!)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a better product and recommend you do the same, unless you want to throw your money away.</li>
            <li> With this product causing more pain, I am back to scissors (bought about 3 years ago and still works like charm).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, or not, sorry.</li>
            <li> The unit worked well the first time I used it</li>
            <li> hahaha!</li>
            <li> It is my first hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have been trying out different nose hair trimmers for the better part of thirty years and</li>
            <li> Pretty pain free thus far, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> The first one started to work for about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson the first time.  </li>
            <li> Going to order more next holiday to use as gifts for others.</li>
            <li> You can get a similar or better unit at any drug store.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> -- it does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Why else would he design so many males so that their hairs would fall out of their heads and sprout out of their ears, nose, and back?</li>
            <li> This was my first nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Overall, it is ok, but I would add a cover for protecting the tip.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what the manufacturer claims it does.</li>
            <li> I use NiMH rechargeable batteries which might give it a bit more power than standard alkaline batteries,</li>
            <li> funny, it was probably those unsightly hairs sticking out of your nose.</li>
            <li> Funny story....  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to using scissors until I find a better trimmer than this Panasonic one.</li>
            <li> As far as the light, wouldn&#x27;t a man use this in a well lit bathroom or</li>
            <li> and from carrying it on a plane just once, somewhere inside of my bag the tiny plastic grooves broke and now the top no longer stays on.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose and ear hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Motor seemed low-speed at first</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for nasal hair trimming and have been using it occasionally for about two years.</li>
            <li> Very Well!</li>
            <li> inspection, the blade unit isn&#x27;t rising up to the top, it stays low in meta guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an engineer and studied the inside of the unit to make sure there wasn&#x27;t a manufacturing defect, and everything looked very solid and well assembled.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to any one who is an avid groomer.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever tried anything like this</li>
            <li> work really well!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully exactly as described in product description.</li>
            <li> But the problem is most likely that it just needs a cleaning.</li>
            <li> I recognize that they are not expensive.  </li>
            <li> I think this trimmer is much better than most of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> you have to go over same spot to get any satisfaction to many times.</li>
            <li> That el cheapo was much better at actually grooming than this unit.</li>
            <li> First time using one of these.</li>
            <li> Much better than the no names I have picked up in local stores.</li>
            <li> The first one broke after I dropped it in the sink.</li>
            <li> first time i&#x27;ve ever used one of these</li>
            <li> The item gets so hot that almost feels like it burns..</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it uses disposable batteries, and the battery will last quite a while before it runs</li>
            <li> This thing was exactly what I was hoping to find.  </li>
            <li> This unit is *extremely* quiet - much better than the deafening beard trimmer that I was cramming into my crevices.  </li>
            <li> Hair has to actually go into the top to get cut.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does anyone make a nose hair trimmer that last more than a couple of months?</li>
            <li> I use it about once a month when I get a haircut, so that seems pretty durable to me</li>
            <li> First one arrived and did not work.</li>
            <li> Wish they made plugin nose trimmer with stronger motor and higher quality blade.</li>
            <li> cann&#x27;t contact very well with the battery!</li>
            <li> First, the trimmer does trim well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works exactly as any product would.</li>
            <li> Since the interface of this device is round, its of good use to swirl around inside nose.</li>
            <li> The panasonic product looks good on paper, but it has already has quit working twice in the few months that I have owned it.</li>
            <li> He joked, saying that IF we were in a black out situation &amp; someone were to feel it imperative to trim their nose hair or ear hair right then and there, he guesses that after the fact, MAYBE enough light could emit from the top side of the unit to maneuver the light in order to \\&quot;see\\&quot; if any more hair is very apparent and in need of trimming.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working far better than my new 421, which is headed for the trash or a return to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but the product works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not a bad price, but I&#x27;m going to spend a few more bucks on the replacement I buy to try to get something a little more reliable, and better designed.</li>
            <li> Overall, Great product, light should be in the middle of the trimmer that outside the casing of the unit.</li>
            <li> hey who needs a full blow vacuum sucker in your nose Does the job and very good at price</li>
            <li> I am not sure the light helps but it may be useful to inspect the result of your work :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for doing spot work around the beard line as well, but only if the hair is already pretty short.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most, but still not very effective at the ONE thing it&#x27;s supposed to do!  </li>
            <li> The light is nice for checking for remaining hairs in those hard to see places.</li>
            <li> The light, presented as a great marketing feature,is useless except if you intend to use it to check the time on your watch during the night, while you&#x27;re in bed.  </li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t do much but the product performs just as well as the old 411.</li>
            <li> Even though I would run it under water to clean every time, it clogged and frequently pulled.</li>
            <li> , it works quickly, it works clearly, it will make your life more efficient, and simple.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t currently see anything else on Amazon which has received good enough</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t reach quite far enough to take care of all the hair, perhaps for my own protection.  </li>
            <li> the light is totally a gimmick, no way that could be useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame Panasonic has to compete with Wally World and lowly priced competitors so often, they really do make quality products for the most part.</li>
            <li> If your trimmer starts turning slowly, try a drop of light weight oil on the cutter head - the kind that is used on hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> The round head isn&#x27;t as good as the straight cutter design.  </li>
            <li> &quot; look inside your nostril but rather tricky to point the tiny bulb light in the right direction.</li>
            <li> This little sucker does a good job for a fair price.  </li>
            <li> It was great at its job and lasted a long time on a single battery.</li>
            <li> The first use it seemed to work reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product it does exactly what</li>
            <li> but this time I ordered a higher end one that cost a whole $20</li>
            <li> It did not cost much, and as I said, it worked well at first, but I would think that once a week usage would not cause it to lose its life already.  </li>
            <li> It worked reasonably well the first couple of times, then stopped working.</li>
            <li> The light is located down on the side of the trimmer, so the only way it could even potentially be useful is if you pointed the light into your nose and then somehow managed to aim the trimmer where you&#x27;d pointed the light.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference just by the sound, the ER115 sounded fast the ER421KC barely</li>
            <li> Very quiet and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Its easy cut hair in nose just holding inside the nose, but for ear.. you need to chase the each hair strands with this tiny head.</li>
            <li> Nice product,gets the job done without mess</li>
            <li> I was the happy previous owner of a Panasonic trimmer, hence the draw back to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Panasonic seems to almost always make a great product for the money, as evidenced by my wet dry shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery was fine and intact (no leaking or cracks) but the internal case smelled like a mixture of death, farts, and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have been through 2 other trimmers over the past couple of years and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, but I found similar trimmers in discount stores for well under $10 that look just like the one I have.</li>
            <li> Same problems, works fine with rechargeable NiMH AAs,   but often has problems with Alkalines.</li>
            <li> Second one works fine.</li>
            <li> The whole unit seems unnecessarily large but it doesn&#x27;t effect its use.</li>
            <li> Nice little product.</li>
            <li> First, the good - the blades are sharp and actually cut the hair instead of pushing it to the side....</li>
            <li> Panasonic does sell the replacement blade but it is priced pretty high.</li>
            <li> anyone relying on the lamp to trim eyebrows has overweening faith and far too little good sense.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a great little device that works very well.</li>
            <li> For $12 I&#x27;m not going to complain too much, but I&#x27;ll spend a bit more money the next time and see if I can get a unit that works a little better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found much use for the light but for the extra cost is negligible.</li>
            <li> I assumed the light would be located inside the tip where it would actually shine where you&#x27;re getting ready to trim, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It will trim your ear and nose hairs but is too much hassle to constantly having to unscrew the blade assembly to free up the motor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t necessary but may   be if vision is a problem.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever recall such a cheap thrill from the Motokata.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how much it helps</li>
            <li> but this tool really works well......</li>
            <li> The battery lasts much longer and it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is much quieter and does not pull on nose hairs while trimming so it does not hurt.</li>
            <li> And it helps to have the option of the light if necessary.</li>
            <li> Nothing much happens.  </li>
            <li> This is probably because the components are cheap Chinese plastic.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull as much, but it still pulls some.  </li>
            <li> Often times it is cheaper to buy the whole thing.</li>
            <li> i bought this item for my father for Christmas he really likes it.</li>
            <li> His former unit was a Remington unit without the light.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon...</li>
            <li> This is a very over rated product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s really very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The reasonable cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And does it very well.  </li>
            <li> Item works very well.</li>
            <li> The light is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never had much power but with patience can be used to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> The item wasn&#x27;t even used that much.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the Wahl products over the Panasonic, absolutely.</li>
            <li> This product gets a very close shave and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product whole nosedly.  </li>
            <li> After much deliberation and doing probably too much research</li>
            <li> This is equal to the really cheap products out there.  </li>
            <li> But you really don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> They improved them tremendously in ten years because this thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I buy so much stuff on amazon</li>
            <li> It performs better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Now, I have mastered this modern marvel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usage:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this trimmer works best when you cut as if your trimming bushes, not as if you were cutting grass.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it with water is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> It advertizes an ability to do straight trims like sideburns and there is no way</li>
            <li> I really like Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> You have to use your regular bathroom light for that.    </li>
            <li> The light is on the opposite side of the switch, but for comfort of use I like to keep the switch facing my face, this makes the beam of light go on the outside of my nose.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> the only drawback is the light.  </li>
            <li> Really cut the hair</li>
            <li> This thing really works.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has done the mankind a favor by inventing this much needed gizmo, though no man with any pride would admit to buying or even needing this device.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The device is very well designed, it turns out.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this thing \\&quot;wet\\&quot; yet and really can&#x27;t imagine doing so.</li>
            <li> You twist the very bottom</li>
            <li> The light is critical - it shows you where to cut; however, you don&#x27;t use it _</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really point up.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much touted \\&quot;headlight\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t move fast enought.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair real close to the skin wiht out pain.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like writing reviews like this, but, this time, I have to tell the truth--and there it is.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
            <li> those really stunk.</li>
            <li> only con to this trimmer is the led light.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle but thorough.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pissed off against Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It really does nothing.</li>
            <li> , the light helps you to see inside your nose (as the doctor does), is very quiet and works without even feeling.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fast and efficient, does its job.</li>
            <li> The blade compartment is cheap Chinese make i think, but hey, it aint gonan cost you a fortune.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> very practical and portable product.</li>
            <li> This Nose and Ear Hair trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely a piece of trash.</li>
            <li> In fact, it leaves as much hair as I used to start with when trimming with the 411.  </li>
            <li> The motor appears to be frozen, and will only work sporadically if I shake the unit to free it up.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is a manual twist but believe it or not, it really works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay the extra for the light.  </li>
            <li> I would pay twice this much for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Really.   </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic wants $10.11 plus shipping to replace the tip.</li>
            <li> it feels very well made and substantial in my hand..</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> My only  &lt;br /&gt;complaint is: the light.</li>
            <li> This does the job over and over again and fast.</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t pay the extra for the light.</li>
            <li> The speed of the motor is not as fast as I think it should be.</li>
            <li> only thing that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is the LED light.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out any possible geometry between this device, my hand, my nose, and my eye that will allow me to use the light for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> If I knew this I would have probably purchased a similar model without the light.</li>
            <li> With that said, I still recommend it because of the price and it works very well as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a nose trimmer, and wanted one with a stainless steel  blade.</li>
            <li> Light helps seeing internally</li>
            <li> This product really fets the job done.</li>
            <li> Nothing like spending twice as much as I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This means that you sometimes have to hold it perpendicularly to the target area, much like you would a bleach pen or a glue stick.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt cut very well.</li>
            <li> Cleans ears and nose very well.</li>
            <li> This nose &amp; ear hair trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is not really necessary though.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I am VERY dissapointed in this item.</li>
            <li> It works well and seems to be very well designed from both a utility and a cleaning standpoint.</li>
            <li> While these trimmers and designed not to cut the skin and works very well on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> And even when working, it didn&#x27;t have much power and tended to pull hair rather than trim it.</li>
            <li> When I look at this product as a tool, it strikes me as being very well designed for it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Several day I received, this device didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When using the trimmer, whether or not inserted deeply into the nostril, the light shines into the user&#x27;s eye...</li>
            <li> but the tip is very flimsy, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not a great product, but when it works properly it is better than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the batteries last a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also far more quiet to boot.  </li>
            <li> I see many good reviews about this product but purchased it and am extremely unhappy.  </li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t as useful as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s not really needed.  </li>
            <li> The light is useless because it does not shine where you need it and the top is falling apart pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> There were no replacements available because Panasonic apparently did some sunsetting design changes that were not improvements, but required the purchase of an entirely new trimmer.</li>
            <li> i had the early model it had a straight cutter and was all right but took sometime to get all the hairs probably still would be useing it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s easy to handle but ALMOST too small to comfortably handle for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Power runs low pretty quickly and pulls the hairs rather than trimming them.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product though, the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted, I became a new man--reborn, rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dirty, well cleaned, have tried light oil, no oil, just not consistent.</li>
            <li> The ability to rinse the unit under the faucet is very convenient and for further cleaning the tip breaks down super quick and easy to aid in rinsing out clipped hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just weak and no matter how many new batteries I put in it, it still is gutless and ineffective for the most part.</li>
            <li> The very end comes off to clean but there is not one word about how to open it up..</li>
            <li> and i was struck by many bits of sharp plastic.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiter and seems to cut more thoroughly than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used -- although I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  </li>
            <li> Better than other products tried.</li>
            <li> This product worked much better than I had expected!</li>
            <li> Again, I haven&#x27;t used any other nose hair trimmer, but I can&#x27;t imagine paying any more than I paid for this one</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased the other trimmer at another site, for $20 more that cut when you pushed the on button.</li>
            <li> Only reason I give it 4 stars is it originally came with the battery inside</li>
            <li> Panasonic is much better than other brands that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Better buy other ..</li>
            <li> If you want to keep some clean nostrils look no further.  </li>
            <li> I used to use scissors and occasionally a razor to get a really clean look on my ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> We much prefer the \\&quot;form factor\\&quot; of the older Nose Hair Trimmer, it was slim, and not so bulky.</li>
            <li> I have had an older version of the Panasonic trimmer and it did not give a very close trim</li>
            <li> Installing a single battery was easy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone who has to trim very often like myself.</li>
            <li> This trimmer yanks my nose hairs quite frequently and battery runs out very fast.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it may not be available in 4 years when I need a new one, so I am thinking of getting a spare.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a straight trimmer, this rotary works so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any, er, uh, nose-hair trimmers, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how simply and easily these worked.</li>
            <li> Also, I have noticed after the 3rd use, that when I start the clippers now the power seems to take 3 secs to get to full speed</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s not LED, but rather a dim micro flashlight bulb.</li>
            <li> No matter what battery I use it is NEVER enough charge to make this thing run at full speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think any less than 100% absolute satisfacation is that his previous one was from Brookstone &amp; cost something like $65 or $70 as I recall, many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> Once clean it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li> I just reordered and the new ones do not work!</li>
            <li> They are very pleased with the performance and the light helps tremendously, especially when you are older and hard to see!  </li>
            <li> In just a few minutes I was able to banish ALL of the offending hairs from sight, something I have never been able to do before with any other trimmer, manual or electric, or any of the scissors I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version  and decided after 8 years to get a new one!</li>
            <li> The on/off switch has a rubber coating so it is easy to switch on and off, even with wet fingers after rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li> its just OK&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more or less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s suppose to do nothing more nothing less..</li>
            <li> The ER415 is a much better design and much less of a battery hog.</li>
            <li> works as promised and appears to be of better quality that previous versions I tried</li>
            <li> Ordered it and the service was quick, as 3 days later it was in my hands trimming my nose and ear hair again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just particular when it comes to this topic.  </li>
            <li> and I find the trimmer works quickly and very quietly...</li>
            <li> a year ago I replaced an older version of this Panasonic nose hair trimmer with the ER421.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this particular model.</li>
            <li> Does all that I need to get rid of those pesky unsightly hairs that us older men have.</li>
            <li> Looks like decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting, just does the job fairly well, but not perfectly.</li>
            <li> We threw out one of the older ones, because of (suspected) corrosion issues with the battery contacts.</li>
            <li> and then I washed the head part that contains the blade by detaching it from the main body as directed.</li>
            <li> Bought this model as an upgrade to the older panasonic model.</li>
            <li> Had to keep on replacing batteries on the older model</li>
            <li> I probably would not buy this item again even though it was a decent price.  </li>
            <li> The light however does not really help much as it does not illuminate the area you are working on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than the older one, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a slower blade speed or not.  </li>
            <li> As for the nose, did a good job trimming the hair but it irritated the inside of my nose after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> This was followed by me accidently dropping it ONCE into the sink, and (because the top doesn&#x27;t stay on) the inside white peice of plastic with the blades breaks in the same way.  </li>
            <li> I think it would probably cost me more to mail it back to Panasonic than to go with a different maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as the older model.</li>
            <li> By the way, this review is mainly concerned about EAR hygiene.</li>
            <li> This is the only trimmer, out of many I have tried, that cuts close enough.</li>
            <li> As I get older I tend to have nose and ear hair which becomes unsightly.</li>
            <li> The thing works great for a couple months or so then starts having these stop-and-go problems where you have to remove and adjust the blade piece (as if you are cleaning it)  to get the thing going again at full speed...which it does for little while before slowing down again and starting to pull rather than cut....painful!</li>
            <li> Overall, this gets the job done and I am not sure how pleasant it should be to trim nose hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought this new Panasonic to replace same model older one that finally expired after many years of use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you close the drain on the bathroom</li>
            <li> and I can highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Of course, I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It is simple to use, isn&#x27;t painful (or my husband would have abandoned it immediately), and the light is a handy way to \\&quot;check your work\\&quot; and make sure you haven&#x27;t missed anything.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest buying.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting some high powered Cree led in there</li>
            <li> I should have known and bought something high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a hairy guy, I highly suggest picking one up.</li>
            <li> I have high praise for the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for humans too though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, don&#x27;t waste money on Wahl and other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably no worse then the other models and brands; plus it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> It gets extra points for surviving a drop to my bathroom floor one morning when I was less wide awake than would have been ideal.</li>
            <li> little more.  </li>
            <li> The little light this thing has doesn&#x27;t really help all that much...</li>
            <li> Also, I would only buy an eyebrow trimmer if it had special attachments to hold the cutter a fixed distance from the eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I had better nose hair trimmers, and worse ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - Safe to use, no cuts or painful snags (yet)  - Easy to clean (just run under a faucet)    </li>
            <li> I thought the light feature would be a plus, but it&#x27;s a minus.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re done \\&quot;shaving\\&quot;, look at the sink below and be prepared to be surprised how much hair were shorn.  </li>
            <li> Have not really used the light for anything yet.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer trim with this one compared to my old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well, and you use it and think you are in the clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting old, so I upgraded to the 421, which is much quieter and cuts with ease.  </li>
            <li> There really is no reason to have the light on this unit.</li>
            <li> The light does not really help at all, so that&#x27;s why it lost a star.</li>
            <li> Guys: Come up with a trimmer that works and lasts for more than just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Really only worth 8 bucks.</li>
            <li> Doubt it would last long either, but have no idea, since I haven&#x27;t used it once since my girlfriend found some no-name cheapo (&lt; $5) nose trimmer that works 20 times better than this.    </li>
            <li> Threw it away after few more months.  </li>
            <li> I just barely went to use this for the first time, and it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> If it could be disabled I&#x27;m sure it would help extend battery life.    </li>
            <li> Had a Remington which only lasted so long, then did some research and the Panasonic ER421KC came out on top.  </li>
            <li> After having success for several years with another Panasonic trimmer, I opted to replace it with the newer model.</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t as powerful and you may think the battery is low, but it&#x27;s just how it operates.</li>
            <li> I saw this kind of trimmer -- same basic design -- at Bed Bath and Beyond several years ago.  </li>
            <li> --there&#x27;s a big difference between a fresh battery and one that&#x27;s been sitting in there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not expensive, quiet, works very well</li>
            <li> This is the third (different) trimmer I have owned, and I like this one far better than the others.  </li>
            <li> Worth keeping in the car or desk at work for nose hair emergencies, if there is such a thing.</li>
            <li> Dried nasal mucus (i.e., boogers) seem to increase with the use of this product; perhaps it&#x27;s simply more noticible with shorter hairs, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only useful for the nose, but also for the ears, too.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well at first but the motor and blade are less effective after a few uses (even with changing batteries) and begins to pull hairs.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a very good product that gets the job done extremely well, but with a few tears along the way.</li>
            <li> Other than that it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Turns out this new model has a straight blade set-up which does not perform as well as the old curved blades.</li>
            <li> That was kind of an odd statement, considering I wouldn&#x27;t pay an extra charge for a mistake that wasn&#x27;t my fault.</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve had (two different models) that have the same problem, even though I keep them clean the motor sometimes won&#x27;t spin up to full speed.</li>
            <li> The little nub that goes in your nostril is highly polished stainless steel and is quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great at first, but only lasted a few short months (with minimum use) before it simply stopped working!</li>
            <li> I returned the product because it did not work after installing several new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The product was defective  right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Nice that it can be used in wet and dry conditions too!</li>
            <li> I have no use for the light nor do I know how it could be used other than what one poster said to examine the area after the fact, which would be a valid use for it -- my bathroom is well lighted</li>
            <li> Been ordering the same model for past 5 years and same Great quality...</li>
            <li> The on board light is a joke despite other reviewers&#x27; claims.</li>
            <li> I noticed several of the high rated reviews were submitted within the first couple months of ownership.  </li>
            <li> After the first, three months, there was a high grinding noise that sounded like the blade was rubbing against the inner cap.</li>
            <li> I replace with a new battery with no change.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without one of these...</li>
            <li> I tried a new battery.  </li>
            <li> I placed a new battery in it and it did not work.</li>
            <li> I put a new battery in it and it did not work.</li>
            <li> Even with a brand spanking new Eveready battery.</li>
            <li> Put in new batteries .</li>
            <li> After a couple of years, even with a new battery the speed of the blades has slowed and I often end up with a nose hair attached to the now non-moving blades.  </li>
            <li> We then ordered a new one (ER421KC):</li>
            <li> For some reason I decided I should get a new one and ordered the ER421KC model.  </li>
            <li> New batteries didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I thought it was the battery, but, I would put in a new one</li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one, no charge.</li>
            <li> but then again it is NEW.  </li>
            <li> So, had to get this new one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s already run through a new battery in 5 wks.</li>
            <li> Yeah I know, why didn&#x27;t I buy this new trimmer 5 years ago?  </li>
            <li> They tranferred me to the parts department to buy a new blade.  </li>
            <li> This is even when a brand new battery has been installed.</li>
            <li> The cost to replace the blades is almost the cost of a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Just put a new battery in it and stick that baby up those hairy nostrils.  </li>
            <li> new ER421KC is so under powered.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> but it always seems like the battery is about to die, even with a brand new one in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming its from the newly cut hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> I can just get a new one when the blade wears out after 4 or 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had to live with</li>
            <li> I received a new one and it does work</li>
            <li> Needs new batteries often.</li>
            <li> We can no locate replacement blades, so now we have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> And yes, I put new batteries in it.</li>
            <li> I really did not want another cheaply made import because I have already thrown a few of those away</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like so many things made by Panasonic, this item quits within a year, even with light use.  </li>
            <li> The ER421KC is also very reliable, it always runs (as long as the battery isn&#x27;t drained of course) and has never failed me, with the exception of the below cases, which were my fault.    </li>
            <li> Second, the light is mounted partway back from the tip of the business end.</li>
            <li> As a nose hair trimmer it seems to do a marginally better job than the Wahl, but I found the light difficult to aim</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was obvious, it was time to replace the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addtion, I personally never use the attached light accessory, I think it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> After several months of use I have not had to replace the battery yet, although I think the light is only of marginal utility - or</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, but if you put light oil on the blade (I use trumpet valve oil or similar) occasionally and clean it often it works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for adult males.</li>
            <li> think these trimmers should use two AA batteries instead of one - it would give the motor more torque - preventing it from slowing down, stalling, and pulling on the nose hair (ouch!!).</li>
            <li> and it was pretty good - this one does a very poor job, I expected that I was used to and liked the previous one, this one cannot seem to get the hairs well at all.  </li>
            <li> I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just about ready for trash now as it can barely muster any power at all.</li>
            <li> The light is not useful for me, but it is there.</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have at this point is that the light feature (which isn&#x27;t all that important for overall performance) is angled improperly and is therefore of no use whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Tried changing batteries several times, but it does absolutely nothing!  </li>
            <li> Overall, a pretty descent trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was at work and was so horrified by the giant clumps of hair sticking out of a client&#x27;s nostrils (no kidding) that I came straight home, went online, and purchased these nose trimmers for my husband!  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> this is the first trimmer that actually worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li> first, it takes some persistence to get the last stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> Still, by knowing exactly where the hairs are, you target them one by one instead of reaming out your entire nose.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s way better than other brands we tried and had to return such as the \\&quot;nose plucker\\&quot; from Sharper Image.</li>
            <li> This trimmer DOES come with the dual edged blades that I thought only came on the higher end Panasonic trimmers by the way.  </li>
            <li> This is the first one that actually trims nose hair, without pulling.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It has a light, but I don&#x27;t trim in the dark anyway.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly yank the hairs, so if you can deal with a bit of stinging, then it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> It is much better and faster than using the small scissors I had been using.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what is better, but this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of awkward when it comes to aiming it and would have been better off if it was left out of the design.  </li>
            <li> The light was not a really useful tool.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty prices to only use it 10 times and have to replace it!</li>
            <li> I bought small scissors which are better.</li>
            <li> Also, the LED light is completely worthless and you really have to wonder what engineer thought that would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> The cap falls off too easily and is easy to lose due to its transparent color and small size.  </li>
            <li> should have looked around a bit more here at Amazon, because I would have found the same trimmer with the vacuum for the same price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent trimmer that wasn&#x27;t too loud to have near my ears.  </li>
            <li> I am always surprised at just how much hair it trims without pulling and the reservoir tip traps all of those small hairs which can then be easily rinsed out under running water.</li>
            <li> possibly the only negative is that the light is more a nuisance than anything else.  </li>
            <li> It worked ok the first few times, but then the motor began to loose it&#x27;s power to the point where it doesn&#x27;t spin at all.  </li>
            <li> the light on it really helps pick out the small ferns when youve already picked off the trees.</li>
            <li> The LED light on the end is just too much and usually just shines in my eyes when I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to go into a long detailed explanation, but I will say this:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different makes and models of nose hair trimmers and they were all junk/garbage.  </li>
            <li> In hindsight, I&#x27;d probably get one without a light just so that it&#x27;s one less thing using the battery,</li>
            <li> The sound it makes is a bit odd when hairs are cut</li>
            <li> Fortunately  I was able to swap the nose cones - which remained unchanged between the models - and continue using my trusty older model (trims hairs like a razor without cutting or nicking.)</li>
            <li> Now, with this Panasonic trimmer, it&#x27;s easy to use everyday if need be.  </li>
            <li> The clippers work good to cut the hair, but, I was disappointed with the light.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair with professional barber clippers and trimmers but using the trimmers to cut nose hair is not good.</li>
            <li> These other reviewers were right!  </li>
            <li> He liked how it felt, but it&#x27;s a little ridiculous to only be able to use it once.</li>
            <li> Works fine and beats the little scissors.</li>
            <li> I like it, it has a powerful motor that runs off a single battery</li>
            <li> My first one lasted a couple years, then stopped working for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> Note that the trimmer does not cut the hair completely: it just pares it down to the proper length, which is more than sufficient to keep hairs from poking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to break the bank on a nose hair trimmer, but it&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to get a decent one; this trimmer is just about right.    </li>
            <li> It works, but even with a brand new battery in it, it takes a couple seconds to get to full power, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  </li>
            <li> After buying and discarding several trimmers that didn&#x27;t seem to do anything but make noise, I tried this one (based on reviews) and was surprised to find that actually removes hair quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a few months but will no longer power on.</li>
            <li> not as good as the less expensive version of this trimmer from Panasonic without the built in light (5 stars for that one, been working for years).</li>
            <li> But the sad thing is Panasonic ER421kc didn&#x27;t last strong for more than 20 uses.</li>
            <li> The little LED light is a joke.</li>
            <li> My only reticence about the product is the power - sometimes I think if could use a little more.</li>
            <li> Was a little tentative about buying this thinking it might be more of a toy than a solid tool.  </li>
            <li> Overall works decently!</li>
            <li> The low intensity light is of little use since it doesn&#x27;t illuminate much.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and when it finally gave out after years of service, I had a hard time finding another one.    </li>
            <li> you can hear when you are cutting and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> , the cutting blades works great.</li>
            <li> The light is an absolute gimmick: I can see nothing, at least not up my nose, with it.</li>
            <li> Probably worth more than one star, but the light is WORTHLESS.  </li>
            <li> My old conair trimmer had a straight blade and used to cut just close enough.</li>
            <li> About the light: someone said here they thought the light was useless.  </li>
            <li> Oh and also the light (what light) is useless, except for the fact that it is just burnin up battery</li>
            <li> This product cannot help remove hair {on} (edges of) ear, may be it could clear hair {in} the ear.</li>
            <li> Works very well,the light I found useless BUT NOT NEEDED worth the price.</li>
            <li> You can skip the lighted version as the beam of light does not really align with the area you are trimming, but the actual trimmer does clear the ear and nose of the unwanted follicles.</li>
            <li> and I have used it probably ten times so far, (I don&#x27;t have much hair)</li>
            <li> Its completely painless, fast, dirt simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near pointed where it needs to be pointed and can be quite distracting.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with the hair yanking or anything.</li>
            <li> Found it again here and it felt like finding an old friend.  </li>
            <li> use regularly daily performs very well.</li>
            <li> I assume this is because the blades don&#x27;t spin quite fast enough.    </li>
            <li> A couple days ago, it quit completely.</li>
            <li> But the unit completely broke and will not function at all.  </li>
            <li> the old Panasonic ER411 did.</li>
            <li> This one is quiet and very efficient.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had a tendency to pull hair while trimming.</li>
            <li> Old model died, so hubby decided to stick with panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I have an old Connair el cheapo and it does the trick without pulling -</li>
            <li> completely safe...highly recommend it..great value.</li>
            <li> I agree completely.  </li>
            <li> An upgrade from my old cheapie one I had been given by a friend.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s lasted longer than others.</li>
            <li> In comparison to an old Sharper Image product this one does not pull the hair or pinch in anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer pointed at by young children or teased by woman.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer gave out on me and it always took about 7 minutes to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> So far this has done the job and has been everything it was advertised to be.</li>
            <li> and it was so dim</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very dissapointed when the second one broke, I decided to spend some money and buy the Turbo-Groomer.</li>
            <li> My old Panny nose/ear trimmer died on me, so I ended up going on a shaver/trimmer spree.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the old panny trimmer.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer had a cover.</li>
            <li> It received 4, rather than 5, stars because I don&#x27;t see a way for a nose/ear hair trimmer to distinguish itself so far beyond its competition as to warrant a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a really old Sharper Image version I bought years ago.  </li>
            <li> Overall it works really well, and the ability to rinse with water has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find out soon enough but anyone that can help is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old</li>
            <li> This one uses a spinning blade, and the last one I used, was a real trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to an update to an old nose hair trimmer when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> Compact enough to travel which is a real plus.</li>
            <li> So if u think buying a trimmer will complete shave everything, this is not your choice.  </li>
            <li> light is a joke, not useful at all unless you are trying to use in the the pitch dark and then isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this product thus far.  </li>
            <li> but so far it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had the old style Panasonic and it worked well for a number of years.</li>
            <li> The blade on the 421 is recessed from the tip way too far.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned up my old 411</li>
            <li> The Panasonic RER421KC trimmer works well--better than the old trimmer it replaced.  </li>
            <li> My father is 73 years old and asked for a trimmer a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> HAd this about 4 weeks and no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble with these</li>
            <li> piece of junk, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to send it to Panasconic to get it fixed</li>
            <li> The light is a complete waste, it pointed somewhere off in space, nowhere near where you are trimming.  </li>
            <li> The light is useless - the only way it would work would require one to be able to remove one&#x27;s nose and peer into it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of course too early to evaluate longevity.</li>
            <li> but even when it does, it sounds like it is low on power and doesn&#x27;t have strength to really cut my nose hair.  </li>
            <li> My expectations were far exceeded.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s treated me well.  </li>
            <li> I was completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> 60 uses so far).</li>
            <li> I recommend the use of real batteries and not standard rechargeables.  </li>
            <li> A \\&quot;ring of light\\&quot; at the top would have been a much better implementation for the various cutting angles required to trim your nose</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recomendation&lt;br /&gt;You still need old fashion scissors if you want perfection like me.</li>
            <li> But ... when I attempt to use it, it creates sensations so completely unbearable that I dread using it each time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair, more like peach fuzz in my nose.</li>
            <li> and so it turns slowly and is more of a hair puller than a hair cutter now.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, it&#x27;s good to be wrong...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this newer model has replaced their old model and is not as good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good tool to have in your shaving kit.</li>
            <li> When the motor spins up to full speed this cuts nose hair well, but all too often the motor slows down</li>
            <li> This trimmer had much better reviews than more expensive ones even when I checked sites other than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re still on the first and the battery use is very long.</li>
            <li> The nose ane ear trimmer works pretty much as advertized, however, the light is not very good, and really is not needed!</li>
            <li> The tip is small and very smooth to touch, and you can actually press the tip to inside of your nose without any discomfort.  </li>
            <li> You almost have to trap a single hair in the middle of the top of this device, and even then, it takes repeated attempts just to remove a single hair.</li>
            <li> I had previous Panasonic trimmers, it&#x27;s essentially the same although the water proof feature is good, but the one single point of light is not really useful because it doesn&#x27;t shine on the spot it&#x27;s trimming, but outside of the nostril(on the nose).</li>
            <li> This has worked well for me as a \\&quot;first nose hair trimmer,\\&quot; and I recommend it to anyone who thinks maybe there&#x27;s a little too much jungle in their nostrils.   </li>
            <li> While not exactly a topic for the dinner table, this trimmer serves a useful purpose.</li>
            <li> after I posted my original review, I started having trouble with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is well worth the exorbitant price.     </li>
            <li> A single AA battery is much easier, especially considering that you won&#x27;t run this trimmer for more than a few seconds at a time.</li>
            <li> not sure why guys get more hair in their ears and nose then on their head later in life</li>
            <li> My first one I got simply didn&#x27;t turn on, I chalked it up to being defective and exchanged it for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My main \\&quot;like\\&quot; of this product is that it is quiet!  </li>
            <li> I had a similar unit (probably a panasonic unit repackaged for Sharper Image because it is exactly the same item)  </li>
            <li> Having had a panasonic trimmer in the past, I expected this to be equally as effective.....</li>
            <li> The light is useless but looks cool.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this when the older model that I had used for years to trim off my unsightly nose hairs finally stopped working.  </li>
            <li> being lazy, i&#x27;ve lived with it for a year, but i&#x27;ve had enough - time to find something better.</li>
            <li> Was fine at first (light&#x27;s sort of silly though), but the motor is winding down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought similiar products over the years and those that could actually cut ear hairs were so noisy with high pitched sounds that it was a pain to use them.  </li>
            <li> Overall, i highly recommend it to anyone looking around for armor to fight those hideous creatures showing up from inside the nose every now and then.</li>
            <li> However, the recent price is too high.</li>
            <li> Even with brand new batteries it will regularly stall completely on a nose or ear hair.</li>
            <li> This does very little except cover up the sound of your vibrator.</li>
            <li> These blades must have a very close tolerance because it took a very thorough exaination to find which blade was bent, and even then it was so slight</li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t focus where I thought it would, but it&#x27;s easily adjusted to see the hair that needs cutting before I cut it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you run it under the faucet, hold tightly, bring close to your body, and then extend your arm quickly towards the sing.</li>
            <li> The light really helps and boy does the sucker cut !</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s a light on it, but there is.)</li>
            <li> The light on this machine is absolutely pointless.     </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this thing, small, light, one battery.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much of a job and takes a long time to do what it does.</li>
            <li> but the light is pointless.  </li>
            <li> I also thought the small LED light would be helpful</li>
            <li> The light was absolutely pointless.</li>
            <li> The light on the device is rather pointless.</li>
            <li> The device itself is small and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> But the light seems pointless.  </li>
            <li> The light, however, is a waste as it does not really illuminate much of anything.</li>
            <li> Not easy to clean</li>
            <li> Works fine, but light is not directed to cutting tip.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one that I ruined by dropping in water.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, lasts a long time, not very expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, the light is useless and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use, it reaches those for hard to trim the nose and ears.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Except, as with many other reviews posted here, the one I purchased from Amazon died completely in less than 90 days.</li>
            <li> I pulled out the metal contact (it&#x27;s held in simply by the two \\&quot;points\\&quot; pressing against the plastic), scraped and sanded the contact a bit, but more importantly, I pulled the center portion out quite a bit to bend it enough to press pretty firmly against the battery negative end when reassembled.</li>
            <li> It finally gave out and my wife wouldn&#x27;t share hers with me, so I chose the Panasonic ER421KC as my new trimmer.</li>
            <li> I tried 4 different new batteries.  </li>
            <li> once again, I have gone through several batteries and now it will not work at all with a brand new battery.</li>
            <li> I tried cleaning it several times and inserted a new battery to no avail.       </li>
            <li> I ordered new blades and after a couple of weeks , the same noise came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final word to potential purchasers - nose hair stubble is a completely new experience.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer works decently only when you have brand new batteries.  </li>
            <li> Removed it from the packaging, inserted a new battery only to discover it&#x27;s a dud!</li>
            <li> Ok this stupid rating system said I needed 15 more words so here they are.</li>
            <li> maybe if I could turn the light off the battery would last a few years.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I think was wasted on it was the light.  </li>
            <li> Knowing it had the light which would probably be useless, I bought this for him anyway because I thought that all in all it seemed like it was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My use of the product has been &#x27;occasional&#x27;, perhaps once a week for light trimming, nothing heavy.  </li>
            <li> The little tiny clear plastic cap that covers the business end of the trimmer is ridiculously easy to lose, compared with the large cap on previous models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay, but it was quite a surprise to say the least!  </li>
            <li> The light is useless to me and actually kind of annoying as it shines in my eyes, but this is not a big enough concern to affect my final rating: 5 out of 5, a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> The first one last several months; the second lasted three weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to point the light in the right direction.</li>
            <li> The slightest bit of pressure seemed to bend in the tip just slightly which stops the product from working (as the blade is closely mounted right under)</li>
            <li> sink if you trim above it and rinse the blade to clean it because that&#x27;s what forced me to replace my older version of the trimmer</li>
            <li> Again, it only worked a few weeks before the power weakened significantly.</li>
            <li> I bought a Panasonic trimmer from Brookstones 3 years ago for $50.00, this trimmer works much better and it&#x27;s less then half the price with shipping.</li>
            <li> The light does nothing to illuminate, very week power, just a little hair and it slows down to a crunch!</li>
            <li> It leaves a little bit of stubble in there but unless someone is staring down your nose, it does an ok job.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item since Panasonic generally  makes quality products.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper ones get stuck, lose power, and just generally don&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li> The light is a pinpoint light and shines someplace different than the cutting head.  </li>
            <li> You can stick it in your nose until the battery dies (which actually is not such a long time), and you won&#x27;t cut as much hair as you could with a pair of scissors in 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re listening Panasonic, bring back the old blade or at least make it available for people to purchase</li>
            <li> I also take away one star because the position of the light is not appropriate , it should be on the same side as the switch.</li>
            <li> the light is pretty much useless, it doesn&#x27;t shine where you are trimming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stick with a simple trimmer and steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working not too far outside of warranty.</li>
            <li> The quality is similar to the Panasonic, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> It pulls the hair and much time is spent trying to get it to cut the hair.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is far above all of the others!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We can&#x27;t speak to longevity (yet) since we bought it recently, but thus far it seems to be a high-quality well-designed piece of equipment that does the job it was designed for.  </li>
            <li> Not a whole lot of power, but the question begs as to how much power you&#x27;d like to stick up your nostrils anyways.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> but then it started losing power often and recently quit working completely.  </li>
            <li> It would barely trim anything.  </li>
            <li> Did the job, barely.</li>
            <li> but it is apparently all in order.  </li>
            <li> Either my 15 year old unit was designed differently or I happen to use the LR6 without realizing it.</li>
            <li> dropped it on a tile floor from 3 feet this morning and apparently dented the metal tip.</li>
            <li> Did not hold up very well with minimal use.</li>
            <li> Neither unit failed on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Some directional arrows or a note on the casing would help slow people like me get through advanced technological procedures like changing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The trimmer works OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> Having used the ER411 since it first came out, I asked for this new one because the blade on the old one was getting dull.</li>
            <li> one of the selling-point \\&quot;improvements\\&quot;; of this trimmer over its earlier, less expensive and more compact sister-model is that this one has a light.  </li>
            <li> They emailed me back about 2 weeks later and said to mail it in with my receipt and they would send me a new one.  </li>
            <li> It would not work with several different brands of NEW AA Alkalines.</li>
            <li> Recently I started spending a lot of time in another city and instead of hauling this around I bought a second one for the new place.</li>
            <li> the light is not usefull to me at all but the cutting blade does an adequate job.  </li>
            <li> Excuse to buy a new one...    </li>
            <li> weak, inadequate, finally pitched this one and went to a Wahl which is much much better.</li>
            <li> The light is useless, and the product is a bit large.</li>
            <li> At times, it was hard to take off the cover/tip of the razor to clean it out or adjust the flimsy parts inside to get it to work again.     </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s easily considered overkill for such a small device, but only constant power will address the shortfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have yet to try out the trimmer, and will comment on this in the future after it has been used, however, I already have a HUGE complaint with the packaging of this item.  </li>
            <li> Works really well for nose &amp; ear hair, however the light is useless.  </li>
            <li> The light is a ridiculous gimmick that eats batteries.</li>
            <li> The light on it is useless, I don&#x27;t really see a need for it.  </li>
            <li> only negative with which I can agree is the usefullness of the light on the unit itself.  </li>
            <li> I went back to mu old smaller Panasonic trimmer, even though I have to unscrew the head every time in order to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> The light was worthless, as it wasn&#x27;t positioned appropriately on the trimmer to be of any use    3.</li>
            <li> because this little trimmer does exactly what it promises and I like the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now, and I haven&#x27;t had any major problems with it.</li>
            <li> Very reliable and seems to go a long time on a single battery.</li>
            <li> The switch is apparently worn out after possibly three cumulative hours of operation.</li>
            <li> Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate.</li>
            <li> The cutter spins slowly once in a while (not fast enough to cut) and doesn&#x27;t spin at all most of the time.  </li>
            <li> This worked pretty well for a few months, but then died.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the very expensive trimmers.</li>
            <li> Once in a while after using I clean the Tiny Blades with a Q-Tip, specially the cavity where the blades rest, after few uses it can get very dirty and I can tell by the sound the Trimmer makes.</li>
            <li> When I tried to remove the cap the whole thing came apart and the blade fell down the sink drain.  </li>
            <li> Not enough power or not sharp enough blades</li>
            <li> Bottomline eats batteries, not fine enouh unfortunately not recommended...</li>
            <li> Light is near worthless, take note that you can&#x27;t light and trim at the same time</li>
            <li> Even with a new battery, it stopped after 2 sec.</li>
            <li> we used to have a similar panasonic trimmer that worked great, but this one works so poorly, slow to cut, hard to figure out what angle you&#x27;re holding the edge to cut the hair, and the light seems useless.  </li>
            <li> Every year I buy the new model hoping they fixed the flaws of the previous model, and the same problems keep happening over and over.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a year or less, used it very infrequently and it no longer turns on.  </li>
            <li> My previous model lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It would have gotten a higher review if the light actually pointed at the area the blade was cutting.</li>
            <li> well-conceived (but for that dumb light) and works as it should.  </li>
            <li> The two things I wonder are hair type (maybe it works better for somewhat straighter and/or firmer hair, e.g., typical brown hair?) or that products coming from some off-brand sellers are not as reliable (I usually purchase directly from Amazon instead of other sellers, unless the price differential is huge)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something that got a lot closer to the skin -- especially for my ears, where I&#x27;m less concerned about \\&quot;filtering.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> On the other hand the 421 is not really much better than the cheap, off-brand $10 trimmers you&#x27;ll find in discount stores.  </li>
            <li> The new one is taking forever to come to me, due to a change in supply (whatever that means)..   </li>
            <li> Overall, the product is fine but not great.  </li>
            <li> The blade is really slow and it takes a long time and repeated efforts to get a clean job done.  </li>
            <li> The actual trimming performance seems to be nearly identical--both of them trim just fine for me (I&#x27;m not looking for a close shave inside my nostrils), but the \\&quot;light\\&quot; on this one is completely useless except as a battery drain.</li>
            <li> The light is a little gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> The light helps guide the user to properly aim the cutting head; it is certainly a benefit for me.  </li>
            <li> , it works fine, it has a light (which is alarmingly practical), and it actually doesn&#x27;t have too bad of a design.    </li>
            <li> If you need light, get a small Maglite which you can also use to find your way around in the dark.</li>
            <li> The light is useless as far as I am concerned unless God had given me eyes on my chin.</li>
            <li> Although quite slow and not that powerful, but</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s kinda useless, and certainly is not the \\&quot;the reason\\&quot; to buy this trimmer, but it&#x27;s also sort of handy at moments.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull your hairs out, but it does tickle a little, so if you can get past the laughing while trimming your nose hairs then you have a fine product.</li>
            <li> Additionally the &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; is a sick joke given how good led lights have become.</li>
            <li> I have tried several trimmmers, 3 of the -other panasonics,yet this is by far the smoothest and quietest I have used.</li>
            <li> Now they have one with a vacuum.   </li>
            <li> Ordered this unit for him, I got the Vacuum unit cutter for myself.</li>
            <li> It bogs down on a brand new alkaline without even putting it to use yet.  </li>
            <li> It has half of the power of the 411 model (it is not the battery since I used the same new battery in both), and it catches on your nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> The new wet dry version trims close to the skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic 411 model trimmer (basically very similar, but no light) and have always had problems with the motor speed --</li>
            <li> well the light is sort of a joke.. not very bright as it is just a tiny little bulb.. reading reviews and seeing the picture</li>
            <li> I received the box less than a week later with only one trimmer inside, even though an invoice clearly mentions two.</li>
            <li> , I have concerns about the power not lasting long enough.</li>
            <li> Well, after fiddling with every part of it I could access (pulling off the on-off switch, trying to pull the inner unit out etc), I discovered that this thing is very sensitive electrically (probably due to the fact that it operates on only 1.5 volts) to the bottom (in the cap) battery center contact.</li>
            <li> Next time I went to use it, seemed the battery was dead, so I replaced it with new battery.  </li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer since these don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even aim straight (pointless).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too small to really see anything.</li>
            <li> I agree that the light feature is totally useless and is probably Panasonic&#x27;s method of differentiating  a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was gentle and worked well on my small nose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this shaver will last.</li>
            <li> Yes, it will nip you if you&#x27;re not careful, but the cure for that is simply to be careful.</li>
            <li> Missed my chance to return the product as I took too long to open and try out the item.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t work properly for long...</li>
            <li> I bought one of those $19.95 Chinese nose and ear trimmers that were advertised on TV for a long time, the one guaranteed not to cut or hurt.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently they added extra safety features to it that made it nothing than a machine that makes noise but no action what so ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and seems like it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> worked OK for a while and then motor became weak - acted like battery was dead</li>
            <li> Within minutes of getting the package from amazon, I had installed a new battery and trimmed away every little unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Does the trick very well with little to absolutely no pulling.  </li>
            <li> wow, the detail over such a little thing.  </li>
            <li> My only issues I had with the product are the LED light is completely useless and the shave head constantly falls off because it does not completely lock in place.  </li>
            <li> And the addition of the stupid little headlight only one effect: using up the battery more quickly.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the batteries with new batteries but the motor seems to have trouble spinning the cutters.  </li>
            <li> ) I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a tendency of pulling the hair too much.</li>
            <li> which was nice, but aesthetically it is impossible to notice.  </li>
            <li> expected more from this one, being Panasonic, but it is rather mediocre.</li>
            <li> - Light is next to useless</li>
            <li> After replacing the batteries twice in less than 3 months, the product stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> only thing that is questionable is the light.</li>
            <li> The light is completely useless don&#x27;t pay extra for it.</li>
            <li> It would pull hairs in my nose that I was trying to cut and would often leave hairs uncut, despite many tries.  </li>
            <li> And since returning a nose trimmer is akin to returning used toilet paper (in my opinion), I was stuck with it.</li>
            <li> The the on/off button does not response well, sometimes it switched on after several tries and today it died totally.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t dropped it/run over it with a car/fished it out of the toilet, so I can&#x27;t vouch for its durability.  </li>
            <li> apparently, see other reviews, there are some dependability issues.</li>
            <li> Performance is worse than most other similar, much cheaper trimmers with no great sounding brand names to entice you.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the old one -- batteries last for months, it cuts well with my moderately stiff hair, and there is no pulling or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The true test of a trimmer such as this is how well it holds up over the long haul, and it&#x27;s difficult for me to assess that after having owned it for only a month or so.</li>
            <li> Though not discussed, the single AA battery does not last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no need to buy the more expensive nose/ear trimmers, this one works extremely well and won&#x27;t blow the bank.  </li>
            <li> other designs I&#x27;ve tried (Norelco) have a different shape head cutter that doesn&#x27;t actually trim my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 other brands found on store shelves, 2 of which were much more expensive, and I discarded them all in favor of the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The metal at the tip is kinda soft and it appears to have bent a little.  </li>
            <li> The light is very weak.  </li>
            <li> light does little or no good.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the blades don&#x27;t dull too fast.</li>
            <li> but the light is useless.</li>
            <li> Unlike others who believe the light is useless, I disagree.  </li>
            <li> If you use it as the delicate work of art it is, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the yanking and pinch (see my tips</li>
            <li> The light of the ER421 is useless - my perspective: It does not point into the nostril, but well sideways  3.</li>
            <li> The light is useless IMO.  </li>
            <li> The light is useless.</li>
            <li> device in the photo looks kinda scary - who&#x27;d enjoy shoving a mechanical device with a buzzing blade into his nose?  </li>
            <li> The noise and vibration is minimal, and the small spinning disc (enclosed inside the metal cage) cuts very well, with no discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my nostrils are abnormal, but I found the light useless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is useless inside your nose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it, and the light is useless.</li>
            <li> The light, however, is utterly useless.</li>
            <li> The blades fail prematurely under light use (~4 months in my case).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> But forget about the light feature -  its totally useless.</li>
            <li> The LED light is totally USELESS -</li>
            <li> The light is useless.</li>
            <li> The light is completely useless, unless you need an emergency trim during a blackout.  </li>
            <li> (also the light is useless)</li>
            <li> The light is useless though.  </li>
            <li> The light is useless though.</li>
            <li> The light is almost useless for me</li>
            <li> However, the light is useless....</li>
            <li> This makes the cutting often seem more like pulling.</li>
            <li> Light is useless.</li>
            <li> I find the light to be useless.</li>
            <li> cutting mechanism is a spinning dual-sided blade in the top compartment.  </li>
            <li> The LED light is useless: it shines where you don&#x27;t want to cut.  </li>
            <li> I heard a loud bang in the middle of the night, I was scared and not sure what it was.</li>
            <li> only thing unnecessary is the light which really doesn&#x27;t have the proper aim, (unless I&#x27;m using it wrong)</li>
            <li> see how long the Mangroomer lasts.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what took me so long to order one.</li>
            <li> Roughly eight months later, after one or two uses a month, I&#x27;ve noticed no drop-off in performance.</li>
            <li> Having bought this trimmer, I am now wondering why I waited so long to get one.  </li>
            <li> I should have got this for him a long time ago but just never seemed to get around to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a complete waste.</li>
            <li> My nose tickles when the hair in it becomes too long.</li>
            <li> But a dim, narrow beam that shines on your cheek isn&#x27;t what I had in mind when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> -- I would use it and it took a long time before I saw results and it seemed to be hit and miss</li>
            <li> I misplaced my old clipper, somewhere in travels, so purchased this one.</li>
            <li> water can&#x27;t get in, battery lasts a long time, ease of use, etc etc.    </li>
            <li> A complete waste of time and money on my behalf.</li>
            <li> Trims with out pulling, not loud when trimming ears.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take long to finish.</li>
            <li> The cutting mechanism is inside the round barrel at the very top of the unit.  </li>
            <li> the impression I got was that it has a round circular light at the base of cutter head with broader beam light..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 5 years, I was ready to chuck it when it started turning slowly - even after a battery change and thorough cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts hair well but the light is sort of dumb and the battery life leaves a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> well, at least one does; I am recently engaged--and I have a new confidence that I didn&#x27;t have before.    </li>
            <li> I switched to the Wahl which was less expensive and better.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is one time when I was cleaning it, I dropped the conical blade tip which apparently slightly bent one of the blade fingers - enough to prevent the trimmer from turning.</li>
            <li> The cap on this one is just a tiny clear plastic cup that fits right onto the metal cutting head with nothing to hold it in place, so if you keep the trimmer in a drawer with other stuff as I do you&#x27;ll be constantly fishing for the cap.</li>
            <li> It is barely visible (less than 1/8th candle power?)</li>
            <li> We tried adjusting the battery strip to more tightly grasp the battery, but it still failed.</li>
            <li> my other brand would simply pass over.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked well, while the blade remained sharp, but that was only for about 90 days.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp enough to handle thickest of em.  </li>
            <li> I must say, I bought this trimmer due that it was only 15 bucks and</li>
            <li> I was worried about this thing yanking my nose hairs and giving me watery eyes after reading several reviews from other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> As with the other reviews, it simply doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers have stated, this one just doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the old model, but it does seem to cut with less pull, so he says...  </li>
            <li> &gt; The second one worked, although you had to be very careful how you put the battery in</li>
            <li> Product from other vendor arrived a few days later, followed shortly thereafter by THE SAME PRODUCT SENT BY AMAZON, AND A CHARGE TO MY CREDIT CARD.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t have a very long lifespan.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s bad enough that I decided to write this review for the 3 trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I made a bad assumption that the 421 would be better than the 415 since I thought it was a later model.  </li>
            <li> It is a big huge disappointment for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end, the husband will end up using his razor to get a clean cut in the ears, or suffer with the lousy job the trimmer does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for quite some time and it starts to rust out if you don&#x27;t take it apart and dry it after cleaning it,</li>
            <li> This works OK after several passes, but seems to pluck hair out in a rather painful manner.</li>
            <li> The light is worthless, but really who cares for $15.  </li>
            <li> His only complaint is  that it is really loud.</li>
            <li> i went away after i left it open for a few hours.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of these things having next to no lifespan, so if my goes kaput in the next few months I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> Yes, I checked the battery, but it simply died after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The light is useless, but they all are, so that&#x27;s not really a ding.  </li>
            <li> Only problems are that the battery last for about 10 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t cut hair, and it broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> Overall, it appears solid, and we have used the device for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> The dent is almost imperceptible, but it was enough to keep the internal blade from spinning.</li>
            <li> Lastly, there aren&#x27;t enough slits in the head of the unit to allow hairs to enter the cutting area adequately.</li>
            <li> Four star only because one did stop working only a few months after purchase.</li>
            <li> After looking at, buying and returning, several other trimmers, I spent a long time shopping,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I was, and am, disappointed and would find a better product in using my 4 year older trimmer with no light, or wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> Used it without one single problem for about 4 years</li>
            <li> My usage is limited to once / twice in a month.</li>
            <li> 1/2\\&quot; of the device and bingo it opens up to a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> It runs on a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> Even though the trimmer is soft and feels good to the touch in the nose and ear, it is limited in its scope of cutting some hair which is difficult access areas of the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a remote area of Colorado that has very few stores</li>
            <li> I thought the light to be useless, inspite of what other reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to be average overall.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really useful, but it&#x27;s not really necessary.    </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had it about a week so far, not sure about longevity</li>
            <li> It is above average as a mustache trimmer</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a 15+ year old Panasonic trimmer that just didn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job well over the past 5 years or so.  </li>
            <li> Other than that silly scenario, he sees no reason why you&#x27;d even want the light.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers leave small cuts in the sensitive nasal membranes causing sores and discomfort.</li>
            <li> but not great the first 3-4 months,</li>
            <li> Based on the Sharper Image unit I replaced when it failed (after many years of service), this unit is slow and time consuming for what should be a simple procedure-remove nose hair.  </li>
            <li> I am returning it, the amazon customer support thinks its a loose electrical connection some where inside of it.</li>
            <li> Forget the lights and the wet/dry capabilities, it simply doesn&#x27;t get in there and cut down the timber.</li>
            <li> As for the second one, after reading these reviews, I thought I had it nailed down that this was the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Nope, wasn&#x27;t a dead battery, just a super weak motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the trimmer several times over the last month and a half with no noticeable sign of the battery running down.    </li>
            <li> Not much else to say other than the light is useless</li>
            <li> I have put in over 3 separate new batteries into this thing and it loses power almost after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Even with new battery will run slow and catch on your nosehair and stop,</li>
            <li> Easy to use with no chance of cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> one only fell about a foot and a half but still the tip took damage)</li>
            <li> The Blade is What Led Me to Have to Buy Another Trimmer, Because it Became Slightly Out of Aligned with the Outside of the Trimer and Would Not Allow the Motor to Turn It.  </li>
            <li> It lasted a year and a half and would sometimes not run, you would have to open it up to get it to move.</li>
            <li> I only use this device for like half a minute a day</li>
            <li> The light is useless, unless u r planning on trimming in the dark</li>
            <li> The light on this is useless; unless you are camping in a dark forest.</li>
            <li> However, after 6 months the unit would slow down and became very erradict.  </li>
            <li> It worked well for the first few weeks, although the light is almost worthless.</li>
            <li> I suppose the batteries would last longer if I spent less time with this item up my nose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very bright light, but it would be much worse without it.  </li>
            <li> It far exceeded the workability of a previous trimmer I had used for many years, and operates without any annoying pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Panasonic trimmer (different model) that lasted well over 5 years but only replaced because I had to tap it a few times to get the motor going.  </li>
            <li> It has all the power necessary to rid yourself  of those pesky little hairs.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you are in total darkness it would have a little value.</li>
            <li> Has little power and have tried multiple batteries.  </li>
            <li> its kinda little big but work beautifuly</li>
            <li> I think the blade is finally starting to wear out a little.</li>
            <li> The trimmer&#x27;s light is weak and rather pointless since you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s shining anyway!  </li>
            <li> The little light is useless, however.  </li>
            <li> After 6 months, the trimmer became dull and had a loud, grinding noise when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this unit 5 stars is due to a slight lack of durability of the metal tip.</li>
            <li> It tames the inner reaches of my nasal black forest like none other.</li>
            <li> There is an occasional hair \\&quot;catch\\&quot; or \\&quot;yank\\&quot; in the trimmer which results in a bit of unpleasantness, but hardly anything compared to the alternatives (see manual trimmer above or (gasp!)</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews for this trimmer, but just had to try it out, what seemed to be panasonic&#x27;s top of the line nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27; will agree it isn&#x27;t as functional for cutting nose hair , there may be occurrences when this light will help someone.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be cheaply made and pulls hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> Make sure to immerse blade in alcohol before and after use to prevent mucous gland infections which can be painful.</li>
            <li> I like the design of this model, as it completely protects delicate skin from the all-metal blades.</li>
            <li> Panasonic won&#x27;t guarantee you won&#x27;t have an unpleasant cut or two (especially in the nose) but it works well and is not bad in the pain department.</li>
            <li> Andy Rooney looked like Leonardo Dicaprio next to me (at least in terms of unwanted facial hair).  </li>
            <li> It takes one double A battery; obviously we can&#x27;t comment on the battery life but having to replace a battery as common as an AA battery will not be a problem.</li>
            <li> It does a passible job of trimming the nose hair but useless for much else, as are almost all the current marketed trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I used it roughly once a week.  </li>
            <li> It pulled a bit rather than cut as well as it should have, but it got the job done with minimal discomfort.   </li>
            <li> They are harder to use except on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Motokata trimmer for years and wanted a second, but it was \\&quot;not currently available from Amazon\\&quot;, so I went for this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> There is one thing all the users have to be careful about though.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> I HAD THIS FOR ONLY A FEW USES</li>
            <li> I carefully explained what I had attempted.</li>
            <li> It makes quite a bit of noise but not much of trimming.</li>
            <li> - Not very thorough  - Underpowered, I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries with no improvement  </li>
            <li> Not very efficient.  </li>
            <li> As it was too much trouble to send product back and arrange the credit, I kept it.  </li>
            <li> I expected the pain.</li>
            <li> I never got it wet or dropped it.</li>
            <li> after a few days of owning it, used it twice, it simply wont run with any battery I put in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, I found that it worked basically exactly as expected: I removed my visible nose hair neatly and 100% painlessly.    </li>
            <li> This trimmer worked relatively well for a few months and then just stopped operating.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say about a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I recommend just saving the extra few dollars and going with the 415SC</li>
            <li> Trims hair as expected.   </li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have your nose pierced.</li>
            <li> I was on hold with the parts department, then when it finally rang through the line went dead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> Mine worked as well as I expected (I have no basis for comparison) until it slipped out of my hand and hit the linoleum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for probably 2 years now, and never much cared for it.  </li>
            <li> Broke after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer off and on for the last few years.</li>
            <li> It works as well as expected, but the.great cleaned up features were a bonus.</li>
            <li> There is really no point to it.</li>
            <li> Tickles when doing nose hair, but not much can be done about that.</li>
            <li> No real power.</li>
            <li> It serves absolutely no purpose as it does not come close to illuminating the blade area of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never tried it wet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t perform at all as expected.  </li>
            <li> There are a few different products out there</li>
            <li> Third, and most annoying</li>
            <li> My main complaint is it&#x27;s just too underpowered!  </li>
            <li> Not sure I want one to last very long because cleaning them is also not a feasible task.  </li>
            <li> A few bad - light is not bright enough, blades do not spin fast enough (tried a few sets of batteries).      </li>
            <li> Once bent inward, it is near impossible to get it back to where it was new.  </li>
            <li> Now, in addition I use it to quickly tame the occasional unruly mustache hair that won&#x27;t behave.</li>
            <li> Just take a couple pieces apart, wipe them down, run them under some water, dry them</li>
            <li> (e.g. harder springs, sharp scraping edges for the contacts ??)  </li>
            <li> after finally finding a smooth operating trimmer at \\&quot;sharper image\\&quot; years ago I found that when I had to replace it , the new unit was terrible.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the fact that I&#x27;ve been living as a hermit for the past two years in a remote mountain region of British Colombia, Canada, but</li>
            <li> I have to give this at least two stars since they work well, but don&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic that also performed well, but the blades dulled and I got tired of watery eyes from the yanking on the hairs.</li>
            <li> Twice now, I&#x27;ve dropped one of these units, and both times the metal trimming tip was bent so slightly that it was imperceptible to the naked eye.</li>
            <li> solution is easy, only put the battery in when you need to use it, but that&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I&#x27;m still pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer though.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco cuts just as close as any of other trimmers, it has never pulled one hair, and its never cut me</li>
            <li> My other nose hair trimmer quit after about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I should have followed the advice given by other reviewers of this product.     </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair as much as other products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did and broke the plastic cap that holds the blades on the first one.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a simple trim, something to make those small undesirable hairs go away, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other rotary trimmers before for nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had listened to the other reviewers who said this was junk.  </li>
            <li> I am back to using a small pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> I have had 1 or 2 cheapie Norelco and other brands.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just my unit, but it hurts enough to make my eyes water each time I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, out of my experience, I would keep away from this model and look into other trimmers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a tinker toy compared to the other one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t you have other things to do?  </li>
            <li> But a small misstep left me wearing a band-aid in a somewhat embarrassing place.</li>
            <li> Blades are not that sharp, it will yank a hair out once in a while.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else because I haven&#x27;t needed it for other trimming purposes.</li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t happened except if the batteries are running low and I&#x27;ve been lazy about changing them.  </li>
            <li> I have a few rogue eyebrow hairs that get ridiculously long</li>
            <li> Went to the barber the other day</li>
            <li> Stop checking on the OTHER one&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Extremely efficient.</li>
            <li> Just like any other shaver/trimmer, it CAN cut your skin</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only had a small nick once, however).</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s small enough to remain intact even if dropped.  </li>
            <li> I just wore out the other one after 7 years of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and low and doesn&#x27;t seem to add any benefit.</li>
            <li> if your not wide awake when your using this or a bit delicate in your handling of bathroom tools, I would probably look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The Blade on this Model is Veru Tiny, Fragile and of Poor Design.  </li>
            <li> It has zero cutting power and ability to do the job quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviewers said the light is worthless, but I definitely like having it when I&#x27;m trimming his ear hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not strong and the lights bugs me a little bit, but overall I&#x27;ll give it 7 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I mean, I knew going-in that the light would be useless</li>
            <li> Its not extremely expensive and any that are more expensive will doubtfully make any difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too weak and and placed too far to server any purpose.</li>
            <li> What a shame, I had a Panasonic ER115, the black one, for the past ten years</li>
            <li> Cuts/trims hair well and does not pull (which is a complaint I have seen for other similar products).  </li>
            <li> Not real strong power.  </li>
            <li> but after the second time it seems to have a really hard time picking up speed when spinning the blade and keeping up speed.</li>
            <li> so I use Amazon for hard to find items and my recent purchase was this nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer makes a lot of noise and painfully tugs on hairs, but it&#x27;s all sound and fury.  </li>
            <li> The ER42KC plucked the hairs painfully out of my nose and the light shines closer to my eye than it does my nose.  </li>
            <li> complaint with this device is the same as all the others.</li>
            <li> I was hestitant because of some of negative reviews but finally decided that one could not expect an engineering marvel for the price.  </li>
            <li> Average material grade and construction.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $15.</li>
            <li> It is at a weird angle and doesn&#x27;t really do anything to help.</li>
            <li> I reread the reviews, and that is a constant complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer broken after only a few months after I bought it, during which period it has been used for only a couple of times.</li>
            <li> If I go slow enough, it&#x27;ll cut the hairs.  </li>
            <li> Even when he goes over the same spot a few times there is still hair left behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, works, but is not fast.</li>
            <li> I removed both blade components to try and figure out what had happened, and it turns out they actually lowered the distance of the blade&#x27;s cutting tip in the new product.</li>
            <li> Even with a new battery, it constantly stops and causes pain sometimes pulling the hair instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li> I dropped the blade and it went down the drain.</li>
            <li> It takes care of all my husbands hair down to the root.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t drop it cutter end down.  </li>
            <li> The battery seems to run down immediately and misses a lot of hair in my ears.</li>
            <li> It had two blades, that go up and down.</li>
            <li> Used once - battery ran down while idle.</li>
            <li> That might be what causes the battery to run down.</li>
            <li> Moral of the story:  no more AMAZON for me!</li>
            <li> and I am going to buy something other than Panasonic!</li>
            <li> It works but seems to be running a little slower than my other one it replaced.</li>
            <li> This device is just right for trimming nose and ear hair without cutting or bleeding...</li>
            <li> It does pick at my hairs from time to time instead of just cutting them, but it definitely beats plucking each one the old school way!</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp so no pulling or tugging at hairs, and it has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> But I was pretty disappointed that it only lasted about a year and a half before it died as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and like it less and less as time goes by.</li>
            <li> It is a device that has basically the same head and cutting components of an electric razor and doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as closely.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model because Panasonic discontinued the ER411 (which I had damaged the nose cone slightly by dropping the unit).</li>
            <li> but the tip was irreversibly bent and never trimmed half as well as before the unit was dropped.   </li>
            <li> Chalk it up to user error and perhaps a slight lack of durability of the metal tip.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer worked for years and years before it died.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is almost impossible to open, and now the thing has died, 6 months of occasional use later.</li>
            <li> If the plastic sheath that covers the blades falls off and one of the blade covers bends ever so slightly inward</li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic previously and it too died after about a year.</li>
            <li> After less than a year of use, we gave up on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this trimmer for almost 2 years and like it less every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a a previous Panasonic Trimmer I had owned.  </li>
            <li> It took less than 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Lost my previous ER421KC</li>
            <li> This think broke in less than 4 months.   </li>
            <li> So this is my fifth one in less than 10 years.  </li>
            <li> and less of a chore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nose hair trimmer for almost a year and a half now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a needless waste on battery life since it stays on the whole time you&#x27;re using the trimmer (no separate on/off button).  </li>
            <li> as others have said, there is some slight tugging as it trims.</li>
            <li> had a previous trimmer</li>
            <li> But the motor died in around a year and a half.</li>
            <li> In less than a minute, my nose is trimmed.</li>
            <li> When you start to get older you get all of these weird hairs in your nose and ears.</li>
            <li> They pinched, pulled and in general did a poor job.  </li>
            <li> at first I wondered if it was cutting.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t mess up a nose trimmer</li>
            <li> I thought I must have put some bum batteries in, but even after replacing the batteries the speed was not good enough to avoid tugging on hairs.  </li>
            <li> Did the job as expected mice and small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bright enough to see anything anyway.</li>
            <li> I wasted $15 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I hate when my time is wasted on this kind of thing, I thought that Panasonic would mean quality....</li>
            <li> it was sealed TIGHTLY and the plastic was quite brittle.</li>
            <li> As long as they use the relatively thick tubular head with cutting blades agitating beneath the relatively few slots the hairs might slip into, the device will not be much and not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The light is worthless unless you are somewhere in the dark.  </li>
            <li> I guess if the battery lead&#x27;s shape slightly even varies, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t make contact and stays dead.</li>
            <li> The negative side of the LR6 has a larger diameter than ordinary batteries.</li>
            <li> w/a little epoxy</li>
            <li> But from other reviews not sure that it makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> It would finally get so weak that it would pull my nose hair.  </li>
            <li> my ear and nose hair was overgrown, and as one little boy I passed in the street described it, \\&quot;bushy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> But there is a little noisy when it is working.</li>
            <li> If you use the product every two weekks, the hairs are gone with little notice.</li>
            <li> A little too noisy-</li>
            <li> Seems like that is a little idiosyncrasy of these things.</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve always had it in my mind that these things would either rip out my nose hairs by the roots or shave a little skin off when shoved up my nose.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted really can handle the tough jobs, believe me: I am a tough job.  </li>
            <li> The reason that I did not give this product five stars is that it did little for the few ear hairs that I have.  </li>
            <li> Fact of life - I&#x27;ve been trimming ears and nose for 15 years now and this bad boy was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> next step is to find the old ER411, not the ER411NC (which is also just as bad and</li>
            <li> The light is useless and silly, but who cares?  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the light is just about useless.</li>
            <li> didnt work very well for me cutting nose hair.</li>
            <li> This one, the blade tip cover seems finer, so it is more difficult to trap the hair in the cutting blades.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because of the light that is completely useless and absurd.</li>
            <li> and I use it every few days.  </li>
            <li> Totally dead.  </li>
            <li> stopped working after a few months&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through quite a few nose trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I ended up tossing the trimmer after getting tired of the constant pulling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never dared use one of these but finally got tired of stray hairs peeking out.  </li>
            <li> No light.  </li>
            <li> Worked for a few years but now stalls.</li>
            <li> The light is worthless.</li>
            <li> The light,however, is a waste.</li>
            <li> It has trouble trimming the hair on my ears.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Panasonic RE421 series.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer a few times and it pulls a lot.</li>
            <li> Waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> Waste of my $15 or whatever it cost.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, and neat design (like a mini-light saber to slash through the dark side of your nose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead on Arrival.</li>
            <li> Dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> I find myself just going for my scissors rather than taking the trouble of using this.      </li>
            <li> I take away one star because of poor quality that lead to the unit failing the second day of its use.</li>
            <li> And mind you, I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> Nothing you can do with a dead trimmer..</li>
            <li> My proboscis remains as well groomed as any 18th green.</li>
            <li> I have used another trimmer for a few years now and it did not seem to cut as well any longer.  </li>
            <li> I threw the piece of chinese crap in the trash can,went back to Amazon and bought an American trimmer;I should of looked before I leapted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much worse than an earlier Panasonic unit I used for 5 yrs.</li>
            <li> After having a cheapo Wahl nose trimmer for a few years I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to this Panasonic with</li>
            <li> I used this item a few times before it was stolen from my house during a burglary.</li>
            <li> If you wanted to save a few dollars go with a non-lighted model.  </li>
            <li> But still dead.  </li>
            <li> wasted feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> Always sounding like it is running on a soon to be dead battery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The light is about worthless</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like replacing things every few months.</li>
            <li> Occasionally it would cut some of the hair, but to no great extent.</li>
            <li> And after a few seconds of working, it will again freeze up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it won&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li> upon startup always acted like the battery was dead.</li>
            <li> died after a few times</li>
            <li> The light, however, does not point where the tools cuts and is worthless unless perhaps you have a nostril the size of a chimpanzee.</li>
            <li> I think the battery is dead -</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if your nostrils should hurt for a few days after.</li>
            <li> well the light is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> Will work for a few minutes if I shake it but dies soon after.</li>
            <li> The light is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> The light is worthless, but who cares.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to when using it for your eyebrows since the head is round.</li>
            <li> The light is WORTHLESS in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The light is worthless.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I was out of town and missed the return window by a few days.  </li>
            <li> the head is too small and compared to a previous model it does not do the job.</li>
            <li> The base of it is flat so that it stands up, taking up as much space on your counter as a quarter.</li>
            <li> Nose, ears, or other hairs hard to trim.  </li>
            <li> I review the product, I&#x27;d like to mention something that other reviewers have complained about.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained that the rubber tip on other units smelled like something was burning, when in use.</li>
            <li> So I told her about the other negative reviews of the product on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> But the illuminated cutting head is sort of pointless, since it can&#x27;t really be seen when in use...</li>
            <li> users have periodically complained of trimmers pulling on nose hairs, this is a common occurance with any trimmer if you have long nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with the less expensive model (ER411NC), which had stopped working after about a year.</li>
            <li> My first bad review for anything Panasonic..    </li>
            <li> This is the first bad item I have ever received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very stupid design and a completely useless feature, but there&#x27;s no way to turn it off, so the light is on and draining the battery the whole time you&#x27;re trimming.    </li>
            <li> , the upper cone holding the cutter blades eventually gets loose and will not stay on when pressure is applied at an angle to the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it is a little difficult to cut the shorter hairs in the front of nose.  </li>
            <li> I feel a little silly sticking it up in my nostrils, especially if my wife is around.</li>
            <li> Other trimmers I used would almost rip the hair out and caused me serious pain.  </li>
            <li> I had owned a previous Panasonic trimmer that lasted for years until the (non- ) blade got dull and it became disposable.</li>
            <li> My only conclusion is that they have a bad batch and is unaware of it.</li>
            <li> The cutting blade part would get stuck in the cap assembly, and only much careful adjusting could cause it to spin.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad experience with this nose/ear trimmer and strongly recommend buying another brand/model.    </li>
            <li> Cleaning is a little hard.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed since as usual, I purchased the item here on Amazon after reading several positive reviews on the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this nose trimmer too much because the power is inconsistent, possibly a bad contact inside the battery compartment which I can&#x27;t improve.</li>
            <li> No More.</li>
            <li> then noticed it had a small plastic cover covering the tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly difficult to open - so difficult that when I finally got it opened (it took almost all of my strength)</li>
            <li> The actual trimming process feels a bit weird if you&#x27;ve never done it but is light-years ahead of the tweezers -</li>
            <li> No more commutes with people staring at me while I yank and pinch into my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s small and compact.  </li>
            <li> I have always recieved quality products from you in the past, and I didn&#x27;t see a need to keep anything.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of cutting the lawn with one of those old hand-pushed reel lawnmowers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these trimmers in the past year.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer, and as usual Amazon.delivered.</li>
            <li> No more pulling the hairs out myself or using a razor to get to it.</li>
            <li> No more Panasonics.</li>
            <li> no sure.</li>
            <li> Awfully expensive for a one time use only product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is, I&#x27;ve cleaned it and looked to see if anything was out of whack</li>
            <li> Not sure if I am going to replace this with the Tweezerman version.</li>
            <li> Instead, I used to trim my nose and ear hair with a small scissors.</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to put a stronger unit up my nose.</li>
            <li> Silly me, I assumed that any standard AA battery would work.</li>
            <li> The battery door would have to be twisted to the open position for it to work.  </li>
            <li> Even then, the yanking is only a minor annoyance and not anything painful.    </li>
            <li> I have tried to replace my old Panasonic 411 trimmer for years now since I could not find the replacement cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Use a small electric shaving brush to brush out the hair from the cutter head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not pleased at all</li>
            <li> I have been using this from past 3 yrs</li>
            <li> Not sure if I bought a lemon, but this stopped working after a couple of months (not sure why).  </li>
            <li> --usually about 12 months of service.  </li>
            <li> Think no more, just buy it.</li>
            <li> very disappointed  Panasonic is usually very reliable   has to send unit back  </li>
            <li> The cutting head on this unit is a little different from others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> and I kept on having to go back to my moustache scissors to get the job done, which at my age is a little dangerous.     </li>
            <li> I saved the Turbo-Groomer 5.0 for other purposes as only the nose hair trimmer went bad.  </li>
            <li> *] the warranty is pretty worthless since i can&#x27;t get them to respond.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But unfortunately that&#x27;s not nearly the case.  </li>
            <li> If I cleaned and oiled it (using professional-grade clipper lubricant), I could usually get a couple minutes of use before it would slow and stop again.</li>
            <li> Which doesn&#x27;t matter because it&#x27;s not bright enough to reveal what the clipper has failed to clip.  </li>
            <li> My review is limited, unfortunately, to the results of one use.     </li>
            <li> So it just stays on and you look dumb with a spot on your face in the mirror and wastes battery.  </li>
            <li> One loose wire in the housing was all that was wrong.</li>
            <li> This trimmer&#x27;s motor is so weak, that half your nose hairs are yanked out rather than cut off!  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t cut nose hair hardly at all.</li>
            <li> Blades dull and</li>
            <li> It started to have a really hard time picking up speed when spinning the blade and keeping up speed.</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises and for the money it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see up your nose when you&#x27;re trying to trim it.</li>
            <li> You have to try hard to make the trimmer grab all hair.</li>
            <li> and I am hard to please.</li>
            <li> This little device works poorly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see it, but I hear the razors scraping the inside, and sometimes it gets so bad it completely binds up and halts the rotation of the blades all together.  </li>
            <li> sucks up batteries like</li>
            <li> I always inevitably ended up cutting myself and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> What really sucks is that after using this awkwards, not-so-smoothe trimmer, is when my wife tells me I still have hair sticking out.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is to be commended for redesigning this product (and especially the cutting head).  </li>
            <li> Bluntly, it sucks.</li>
            <li> This Specific Trimmer from Panasonic was a Disappointing Purchase.  </li>
            <li> This sucks.  </li>
            <li> At least you built up some muscle doing that.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have a negative experience dealing with amazon.com.</li>
            <li> On the negative side, it stopped working after about 8 months.</li>
            <li> but the bottom does not seal well and even the least bit of water (ie.</li>
            <li> for the negative reviews, I&#x27;ve seen nothing that would suggest why those problems have occurred.</li>
            <li> I had never honestly thought about trimming them before.  </li>
            <li> THE UNIT SUCKS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The alternative is spending at least #15.00 a week at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> When you read product descriptions your always still in doubt, at least I am.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;AA batteries are common</li>
            <li> Although it cuts well, it seems like it takes forever to get all of the hairs -- at least 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> but this thing sucks.</li>
            <li> I could have gone to Walmart and bought a Philips Norelco with the same type rotary cutting head for $9.97.  </li>
            <li> No snags or binds, doesn&#x27;t hurt you when it gets into the thick stuff.</li>
            <li> but I wish I could find one that is real heavy duty.</li>
            <li> The Remington was slow by comparison to the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> however is is a bit slow for this purpose.</li>
            <li> If it starts running slow as some claim, 1st the basics.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s customer service was incredibly rude, and they have an annoying &#x27;voice recognition&#x27; system up front that doesn&#x27;t work very well, and there is no work around.</li>
            <li> usually it was too slow and weak, and it seemed to vary for no discernible reason.</li>
            <li> (I mean, come on...</li>
            <li> Well, no more!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the 421 is useless because it leaves a considerable length of hair behind.  </li>
            <li> As well, it provides inadequate illumination to a very small area -</li>
            <li> The lights completely useless, but who shaves in the dark?</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this one doesn&#x27;t begin to compare with the old one....extremely ineffective, difficult to use, and thoroughly  disappointing in every way.</li>
            <li> Having battery fully charged might help to some extent, but seriously you would roll into tears after a while (# of uses).     </li>
            <li> and seriously...</li>
            <li> No battery and less parts that can fail.</li>
            <li> Now I have a useless little electric motor.  </li>
            <li> Either poor quality control, or they tried so hard not to cut you, that these cut nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good deal if you have to keep buying them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how few choices there are for trimming nose hair and how useless they are.</li>
            <li> When you drag the device, you pull hairs instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> I like that it can be rinsed under running water and it seems that the cutting head is lubricated when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this one, but I&#x27;ve had worse.  </li>
            <li> Just plain useless.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does not pull as you&#x27;re not aware of it&#x27;s cutting the nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> It may just be bad luck or the overall quality of this is not great.  </li>
            <li> It is ridiculously weak.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t out to woo anybody or make them grow weak in their knees.    </li>
            <li> Weak motor.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping panasonic returned to its roots by actually cutting nose hair down to the root with the ER421, but</li>
            <li> Disappointingly, the trimmer died after less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Maybe a tough product to make?</li>
            <li> Only wives who hate their husband&#x27;s nose and ear hair will buy them, hoping to cure a rainy day.  </li>
            <li> AND IT IS BROKEN AND DOESN&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li> Well this one is worse.</li>
            <li> What a poorly made product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - Well-built, hasn&#x27;t broken in almost a year  </li>
            <li> This Model Also Has a Poor Power Level which Made It Inefficient in Trimming Hair.  </li>
            <li> Poorly enginnered.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it stopped working in 4 months and in between did a poor job.</li>
            <li> Anyway something that should be a no brainer product is just poorly executed.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cut anything and seems to be broken.</li>
            <li> Although this unit functions as described, I find it poorly designed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on January 7, 20015 and used it approximately 10 times, but it does nor work anymore.</li>
            <li> I literally bought a broken product.  </li>
            <li> I finally got tired of being treated like a Idiot and called Amazon to return it.&lt;br /&gt;After my experience with Panasonic Customer Service</li>
            <li> but what I find is this: (1) the item is so overpackaged as to be almost impossible to get out of the heavy plastic it comes encased in, and (2) once you finally get to the item</li>
            <li> Sorry Panasonic... Failure.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase (and for only $14 you can&#x27;t go wrong).</li>
            <li> It pulls and hurts - not as bad as tweezers - but not fun.</li>
            <li> and it became a little painful.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t pull hair when cutting.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It was a bad desicion, a waste of money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when it worked it had a very weak motor and would take quite some time before it turned on.</li>
            <li> and then the blades would turn very weakly.  </li>
            <li> After that, the power was very weak, so we changed the batteries.</li>
            <li> Very weak product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is very weak and does not shine where you&#x27;re working.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m pissed off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two, and they both have failed within a year.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a year of grief and a bunch of wasted batteries.</li>
            <li> Also, I tried a model Brookstone was selling which I had to trash as completely useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately he tossed the packaging, so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have ordered this trimmer again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Light is a bit useless unless you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> I unfortunately had thrown out the box before I knew it needed to be returned.</li>
            <li> It does however take awhile to trim the difficult ones and is hit and miss on the problem ones.</li>
            <li> That said, the easiest way to use this thing is to just stick it in, wiggle it around randomly, and wait till you don&#x27;t have nose hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my window of time to return this has expired.  </li>
            <li> buy one you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one just doesnt \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li> sorry to say....</li>
            <li> This thing is useless..</li>
            <li> And it cuts ear hair, which I am sorry to say I have to now be concerned with.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Mediocre in my opinion.</li>
            <li> its useless.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to turn on.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Eventually this causes to battery to fail and</li>
            <li> and it was uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> have tried one of the cheaper models which was useless.</li>
            <li> you CAN go wrong.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s poor durability!</li>
            <li> My guess is that with time it may fail to lift off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its kinda scary because you think its gonna catch the inside of your nose</li>
            <li> That is absurd for an $17 item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer to use this because if I have an accident I won&#x27;t end up looking like a drunk college kid who passed out at a frat party and woke up with no eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the motor died and it was useless after that.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Somebody prove me wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.   </li>
            <li> Sad, Panasonic did not seem to read the reviews on their products.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> In fact, was useless.</li>
            <li> kinda lame.  </li>
            <li> As an idea, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> but it just works very poorly.</li>
            <li> but it just works very poorly.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Very painful, frustrating and time</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very frustrating because it ends up pulling a lot of hairs because the RPM&#x27;s intermittently drop which cause the blade to yank the hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very frustrating because it ends up pulling a lot of hairs because the RPM&#x27;s intermittently drop which causes the blade to yank the hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> Usually, I have found electrical or mechanical devices brutal to my nose hairs, so have unsuccessfully resorted to scissors.</li>
            <li> This is worst than all the other Panasonic nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> Cuts well without cutting you.  </li>
            <li> just not when you&#x27;ve got it stuck in your nose cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> he says it wasn&#x27;t cutting..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not at all unhappy with the trimmer,</li>
            <li> /&gt;i can&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this item while the blister pack remains so remarkably dangerous to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair sometimes instead of cutting it.  </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...trims nasal hairs without cutting your nose.  </li>
            <li> Pesky nose hairs driving you crazy?  </li>
            <li> I have no worries at all about cutting the inside of my nose.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t shine where you expect it (at the tip of the cutting edge).  </li>
            <li> But are dangerous.</li>
            <li> with no possibility of cutting your nose or ear.</li>
            <li> and caused pain pulling the hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> the cutting head sticks a lot and sometimes needs to be taken apart two or three times each use.  </li>
            <li> This allows it to trim, while reducing the risk of cutting tissue.</li>
            <li> Also, it sometimes rips out hairs rather than cutting them, interrupting the twenty seconds of use with stings of pain now and then.</li>
            <li> It is too bulky and does not have the cutting power that it&#x27;s size would suggest.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid this was a \\&quot;get</li>
            <li> It does what it says by cutting on the end and also along the sides.  </li>
            <li> Feels like its pulling instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> It managed to cut the hairs but pulled at them like crazy - quite painful.</li>
            <li> The would work in a very mediocre way, and then something would break or give out.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the trimmer makes trimming ear hair very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed by the cutting ability - or lack</li>
            <li> 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: Smells bad.</li>
            <li> This is a really bad hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Its like shaving with a bad razor.  </li>
            <li> i have to say that this bad boy does the job.  </li>
            <li> THE BAD:   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I felt cheated and bad.</li>
            <li> This bad boy works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> Three years of life ain&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I was totally frustrated</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper \\&quot;manual\\&quot; set of trimmers which were quite painful...</li>
            <li> When it was working it was quite painful to use, often pulling and tearing away the nose hairs.</li>
            <li> painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful to use.  </li>
            <li> It also can be painful sometimes.  </li>
            <li> how disappointed I was to try it.</li>
            <li> This is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m disappointed with the precision of the blades.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> yes, I stupidly bought that one, too).</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> They are worthless and unusable.</li>
            <li> and I truly hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doubtful that Americans would have ever invented this device.  </li>
            <li> think the blade unit is supposed to rise up as it spins, lifting off the base rotor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wasteful, not to mention annoying.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> crap.</li>
            <li> All have been worthless except for this one.</li>
            <li> This made for a very annoying and at times painful experience.</li>
            <li> It was a horrible experience, they treated me like a idiot.</li>
            <li> Hated this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that the product does not work.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work at all!!!</li>
            <li> but I think I just burnt them off with that awful smell.  </li>
            <li> nose and ear hair is so nasty........</li>
            <li> the nasty stench when one st opens the battery compartment is [i suppose] outgassing from something in the assembly.</li>
            <li> but this product it is terrible@!</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of Crap!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awful experience.</li>
            <li> It is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Does The Nasty Job...    </li>
            <li> God has a cruel sense of humor.  </li>
            <li> It worked terribly.</li>
            <li> I hope the thieves use it and get the horrible disease that is in my nose, those pieces of crapp</li>
            <li> In a word it&#x27;s pathetic.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely,no pulling or cutting !!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well. needs strong charged battery. The light is useless, and the product is a bit large. but does the job.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working not too far outside of warranty. Worked OK up to then.</li>
            <li> This item worked well at first.  I used it roughly once a week.  I have had it for 2 months.  I goe to use it one day and it does not turn on.  I replace with a new battery with no change.  So,  Product lasts 2 months.</li>
            <li> I use it since years with great success. The price and the quality works out perfect. I&#x27;m a happy customer</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It works, but it feels like the motor struggles whenever it comes in contact with any hair. I&#x27;m not an especially hairy dude.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the gentleman&#x27;s grooming.  Easy to use and the light makes it easy to see those spots that are often missed.  My husband is very pleased!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without one of these...this replaces one I had for many, many years...needed a new blade but just replacing the old one with this one was cheap and convenient.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Quiet and painless.  Excellent value for the money.  Has good battery life and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I put a battery in the day I bought these, and the motor sounded so lethargic I tried a new battery.  Nope, wasn&#x27;t a dead battery, just a super weak motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product off the shelf at target. It&#x27;s a great product. I accidentally dropped it and broke the header. I ordered one from Amazon. I got it in the mail and was excited to have gotten a new one. I placed a new battery in it and it did not work. I returned it and ordered another one. I got another one in the mail from Amazon a week later. I put a new battery in it and it did not work. I could not believe it. My only conclusion is that they have a bad batch and is unaware of it. Needless to say I&#x27;m pissed off. I lost money and got a product that doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> it was simply ineffective.  we used to have a similar panasonic trimmer that worked great, but this one works so poorly, slow to cut, hard to figure out what angle you&#x27;re holding the edge to cut the hair, and the light seems useless.  it&#x27;s something to throw away and try again.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well but the light is useless. It&#x27;s nowhere near pointed where it needs to be pointed and can be quite distracting.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like so many things made by Panasonic, this item quits within a year, even with light use.  I&#x27;ve bought two, and they both have failed within a year.  It&#x27;s not a good deal if you have to keep buying them.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts, does what it is supposed to - trim nose and ear hairs.  No pulling experienced so far.</li>
            <li> Every year I buy the new model hoping they fixed the flaws of the previous model, and the same problems keep happening over and over. The thing works great for a couple months or so then starts having these stop-and-go problems where you have to remove and adjust the blade piece (as if you are cleaning it)  to get the thing going again at full speed...which it does for little while before slowing down again and starting to pull rather than cut....painful! This happens with even after replacing the batteries. I finally gave up and went to the Mangroomer nose/ear trimmer and will never look back</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer broken after only a few months after I bought it, during which period it has been used for only a couple of times.</li>
            <li> In my second time using the product it self-destructed.  When I tried to remove the cap the whole thing came apart and the blade fell down the sink drain.  Now I have a useless little electric motor.  I will never buy a Panasonic product again!</li>
            <li> I used it twice and it worked great.  I dropped it in the sink and it no longer works.  It is fragile.  I&#x27;m ordering the manual one, sounds like it is built better....</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with the hair yanking or anything. I don&#x27;t have thick hair, more like peach fuzz in my nose. I know it don&#x27;t have a alotta power though. I don&#x27;t know how long this shaver will last. Bought it based on reviews. Well, hope for the best!</li>
            <li> *UPDATED below*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I review the product, I&#x27;d like to mention something that other reviewers have complained about.  The light isn&#x27;t for use while the trimmer is inside your nostril.  Your supposed to use the light to look into your nose while the trimmer is out, so that you can see inside your nose &amp; look for any hairs that may have been missed.  How could anyone expect to see the light inside their nostril while the trimmer is in there too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally started by buying the Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly.  It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs okay.  The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I bought this Panasonic trimmer.  The quality &amp; power was much better than the Wahl, and the Panasonic trimmed better too.  But I was pretty disappointed that it only lasted about a year and a half before it died as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago I bought the Mangroomer nose hair trimmer.  The quality is similar to the Panasonic, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  If I go slow enough, it&#x27;ll cut the hairs.  Otherwise, the Mangroomer likes to pull hairs.  I&#x27;m not too impressed by it so far (after 2-3 uses).  It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s bad enough that I decided to write this review for the 3 trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long the Mangroomer lasts.  But based on trimming, I&#x27;d have to say the Panasonic is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  Obviously, I&#x27;m still pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer though.  After only +/- 18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to try something else (if / when the Mangroomer dies) but I don&#x27;t currently see anything else on Amazon which has received good enough reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag. I have no idea if it still works or not, and have no desire to ever try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had the Philips Norelco NT9110 for about 2 years, and recently remembered my prior review/s, so I decided to update them. This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers. I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it. I also never put the cap back on. Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate. I&#x27;ve never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had noticed this trimmer before, but something about the design turned me away from buying it.  For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  The Philips Norelco cuts just as close as any of other trimmers, it has never pulled one hair, and its never cut me (which was a concern with this design, and I&#x27;ve jammed/pushed it into any areas as needed).  If something ever happens to it, I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.  I hope this is helpful to someone.</li>
            <li> The metal at the tip is kinda soft and it appears to have bent a little.  I can&#x27;t see it, but I hear the razors scraping the inside, and sometimes it gets so bad it completely binds up and halts the rotation of the blades all together.  I&#x27;ve done everything I can to try to fix it, but it just appears to be a bit cheaply made.  It&#x27;s certainly not a bad price, but I&#x27;m going to spend a few more bucks on the replacement I buy to try to get something a little more reliable, and better designed.</li>
            <li> My fiance was amusingly excited to receive this as a gift.  Two weeks after I gave it to him, he took it to England on a work trip.  When he got back, he realized that something had happened in transit and it no longer worked.  I haven&#x27;t tried to return it because I don&#x27;t know what the TSA people may have done to it... but I still think a product should be able to withstand some travel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month and it works as advertized.  If any nose hairs were pulled, I didn&#x27;t feel it and I use it every few days.  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> My review is limited, unfortunately, to the results of one use.     The first use it seemed to work reasonably well.  It pulled a bit rather than cut as well as it should have, but it got the job done with minimal discomfort.   Unfortunately, I recently grabbed it out of my closet to do some touch up and it would not turn on.  No response.  Totally dead.  I popped open the battery cover and WHAM!  I may not be trimming my nose hairs but I think I just burnt them off with that awful smell.  The battery was fine and intact (no leaking or cracks) but the internal case smelled like a mixture of death, farts, and chemicals.  In all seriousness it smelled STRONGLY of rotting organic compounds.     I have yet to call Panasonic, but I sure plan on it.</li>
            <li> Bought this Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted for my husband,&lt;br /&gt;he has like also because the light help better to check out a perfect TRim</li>
            <li> 1) Doesn&#x27;t get that deep&lt;br /&gt;2) pulls hairs A LOT and it hurts&lt;br /&gt;3) stopped working after a few months&lt;br /&gt;4) sucks up batteries like it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s business</li>
            <li> I tried three others before this one and did not like any of them.  They pinched, pulled and in general did a poor job.  Then I bought this model.......about 4 years ago.  I worked like a charm.  Cuts well without cutting you.  Never pulled, pinched, or cut me.  Used it without one single problem for about 4 years and then it just died.  I could not find another one locally so I searched the web.  Found it again here and it felt like finding an old friend.  Ordered it and the service was quick, as 3 days later it was in my hands trimming my nose and ear hair again.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it works well.  I expect a repeat performance of the first one.  My only issue is that it may not be available in 4 years when I need a new one, so I am thinking of getting a spare.  This item is a definite recommend!</li>
            <li> use regularly daily performs very well.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer because it cuts on the end as well as on the sides (360 degrees).  Some of the trimmers just cut on one side.  They are harder to use except on eyebrows.  Also, I would only buy an eyebrow trimmer if it had special attachments to hold the cutter a fixed distance from the eyebrow.</li>
            <li> This nose hair Trimmer is almost perfect.  I&#x27;ve been through quite a few nose trimmers.  You would think I have nose hair growing to my toes, but I don&#x27;t.....I&#x27;m just particular when it comes to this topic.  The trimmer does what it should.   It&#x27;s a very close shave.  It&#x27;s fairly light, compact and feels good in your hand.  The light is worthless, but really who cares for $15.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> wasnt sure about it at first but it is nice and quiet you cant even tell it is being used.</li>
            <li> After buying and discarding several trimmers that didn&#x27;t seem to do anything but make noise, I tried this one (based on reviews) and was surprised to find that actually removes hair quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic nose clipper does not have enough power to clip anything. I had to return it. This is the second one I&#x27;ve had.   No More.</li>
            <li> Not the total best trimmer in the world but really good for what you pay. Does the job! Recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little trimmer.  It has all the power necessary to rid yourself  of those pesky little hairs.  Easy cleanup.  The light isn&#x27;t necessary but may   be if vision is a problem.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I lost my nose hair sissors.  Good sissors are very expensive,so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I suppose the batteries would last longer if I spent less time with this item up my nose.  But it&#x27;s just so damn satisfying.  And it was pretty cheap, too. (I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s a light on it, but there is.)</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear hair trimmer isn&#x27;t the first unit of this type I&#x27;ve had over the years. This one was a couple of bucks more, but certainly a better piece of kit than the previous.    Ergonomically the device is comfortable to hold, along with the rubberized finish. But the illuminated cutting head is sort of pointless, since it can&#x27;t really be seen when in use...it&#x27;s more of a distraction, than an improvement...but some will like that feature.    The cutting head on this unit is a little different from others I&#x27;ve had in the past. It seems to be a more precision blade assembly and I find the trimmer works quickly and very quietly...without grabbing and yanking hairs.    For $15 this is one device well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a trimmer for some time. I finally decided on the Panasonic after reading a number of reviews. Good little trimmer, easy to manage, no snagging or pulling.    Overall does the job it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> I own the Wahl trimmer and have never been satisfied with its performance.  It pulls the hair and much time is spent trying to get it to cut the hair.  The Panasonic ER421KC nose and ear hair trimmer is a \\&quot;dream come true!\\&quot;  Perfect in all respects . . . . . but what else would you expect:  it&#x27;s a Panasonic product!</li>
            <li> It arrived before schedule.  It was just as they had described in the listing.  It does what it is suppose to do.  I like my trimmer.  It is simple and practical and get the job done.  I use for my nose and sometimes my brows.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer over a year ago and was satisfied with it intially, however after a year - it just died.  Changed the battery and nothing - I suppose for the price - and it lasting one year - I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Motokata trimmer for years and wanted a second, but it was \\&quot;not currently available from Amazon\\&quot;, so I went for this Panasonic.  Its shape is better and the switch is better, but the Panasonic blades are bent at a different angle and have a tendency to grab my nose hairs.  Imagine a power driven nose hair puller - that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m glad for the better on/off switch.  I don&#x27;t ever recall such a cheap thrill from the Motokata.</li>
            <li> Nothing met my expectations on this item.  I mean, I knew going-in that the light would be useless -- how can the trimmer and the light fit in one&#x27;s nostril at the same time -- but it didn&#x27;t even trim hair effectively!  I ended up tossing the trimmer after getting tired of the constant pulling.  Nose hair trimmers should be \\&quot;no tears\\&quot; in my opinion.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great trimmer. There is a light on it and I don&#x27;t know how much it helps but it&#x27;s an added feature. It doesn&#x27;t take alot of batteries. Definitely would rate it well.</li>
            <li> The light on this machine is absolutely pointless.     Now they have one with a vacuum.   Pretty soon they&#x27;ll market one that can text, take pictures and play music.    Guys: Come up with a trimmer that works and lasts for more than just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never dared use one of these but finally got tired of stray hairs peeking out.  I put it to use last night and it works great.  What more needs to be said about a nose hair trimmer??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little more.  First, the light actually is useful...just not when you&#x27;ve got it stuck in your nose cutting hair.  Its use is when you periodically need to examine inside to see how you&#x27;re doing.  So spend the big bucks for the lighted model, otherwise you&#x27;ll have to keep a flashlight around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when you first get it, it has a light oil film on the cutter.  Good for the machinery but not so much for your nose.  So I recommend you take an alcohol swab, take the cutter apart like they say and clean everything before the first use.</li>
            <li> I admit I have nothing to compare this product to, having never owned such a device before. But when I noticed that I was beginning to cultivate a sizeable crop of ear and nose hair, I knew I needed to do something. The good news is, this thing works well. It gets extra points for surviving a drop to my bathroom floor one morning when I was less wide awake than would have been ideal. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this thing, small, light, one battery. The light does nothing to illuminate, very week power, just a little hair and it slows down to a crunch!</li>
            <li> no need to buy the more expensive nose/ear trimmers, this one works extremely well and won&#x27;t blow the bank.  $20 for a trimmer that actually works, that&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> But still manages to bring tears to my eyes when grooming the nasal area.  Almost feels as though it&#x27;s snagging and pulling your hairs out.  Nothing beats a pair of sisors I suppose.</li>
            <li> just kidding, no blood yet, but the cracking noise it makes freaks me out, especially when its in my nose. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is the second trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. I like the design of this model, as it completely protects delicate skin from the all-metal blades. The light is good for a quick review of your work, and to see if you&#x27;ve missed anything.  &lt;br /&gt;Other users have periodically complained of trimmers pulling on nose hairs, this is a common occurance with any trimmer if you have long nose hairs. Trim often, and you shouldn&#x27;t have this issue. &lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is an excellent purchase, of very good quality, which is why I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Approx. a year ago I replaced an older version of this Panasonic nose hair trimmer with the ER421. What a mistake. The light is a ridiculous gimmick that eats batteries. I finally gave up after the last battery replacement didn&#x27;t last a month (about 3 uses). In theory the LED light shouldn&#x27;t draw much power, but....something sure does. I&#x27;ve switched to the manual Groom Mate Platinum XL and it seems to do an acceptable job, although it doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as the Panasonic. Should you decide to purchase this trimmer I highly recommend that you close the drain on the bathroom sink if you trim above it and rinse the blade to clean it because that&#x27;s what forced me to replace my older version of the trimmer....I dropped the blade and it went down the drain. There were no replacements available because Panasonic apparently did some sunsetting design changes that were not improvements, but required the purchase of an entirely new trimmer. So....my advice to you is to think twice about purchasing this model. It gave me a year of grief and a bunch of wasted batteries. Happy nose hair trimming to you.</li>
            <li> Never ever thought I&#x27;d be reviewing a nose trimmer.......but this Panasonic ER421  really rocks!  Easy and efficient..........and so cheap.......not sure why guys get more hair in their ears and nose then on their head later in life but this tool really works well......nose and ear hair is so nasty........buy one now.....it works great!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for several months.  I thought the light to be useless, inspite of what other reviewers have said.  Ultimately, the unit fell off the shelf and broke so that the cutter would not work properly.  I tossed it and bought a Panasonic ER415SC.  No light.  The battery lasts much longer and it&#x27;s cheaper.  I also thought that the RPMs were faster.  Save your money and get the 415.  If you need light, get a small Maglite which you can also use to find your way around in the dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for almost a year now and like it less and less as time goes by. It was great initially but now the motor has grown considerably weaker over time, even with a fresh battery. It&#x27;s just about ready for trash now as it can barely muster any power at all. The light has always been worthless and as I start shopping for a replacement, I wouldn&#x27;t even bother looking for a unit with a light again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend which is much better than the Panasonic ER405AC Wet/Dry Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer I bought for myself. This trimmer is much quieter and does not pull on nose hairs while trimming so it does not hurt. And it helps to have the option of the light if necessary.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this gadget for my birthday and I have used it for about 6 months.  It is the latest in a line of vibrating clippers, with this one having a new wrinkles, that it is waterproof and has a light, or so Panasonic claims.  I have no reason to doubt it is waterproof, but I have never tested immersing it in the sink. I also don&#x27;t see the reason for the light.  The bathroom is the most brightly lit room in my house.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My complaint with this device is the same as all the others. It doesn&#x27;t do much of a job and takes a long time to do what it does. It doesn&#x27;t cut closely. It doesn&#x27;cut all the hair.  It is a device that has basically the same head and cutting components of an electric razor and doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as closely.  As long as they use the relatively thick tubular head with cutting blades agitating beneath the relatively few slots the hairs might slip into, the device will not be much and not worth the money.  Only wives who hate their husband&#x27;s nose and ear hair will buy them, hoping to cure a rainy day.  In the end, the husband will end up using his razor to get a clean cut in the ears, or suffer with the lousy job the trimmer does.  And, they will get cut.  Time to rethink this device me thinks.</li>
            <li> My husband appears to be delighted -the tool works simply and well. perfect for the job.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my fiance &amp; he loved it. Works great &amp; such a good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well pleased with this device. It took only two minutes to do the job. Yes, it will nip you if you&#x27;re not careful, but the cure for that is simply to be careful.</li>
            <li> While not exactly a topic for the dinner table, this trimmer serves a useful purpose. It appears to be well constructed and is quiet. The light is not useful for me, but it is there. In this age of over-hyped products, it is good to find one that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair this trimmer is supposed to cut, but it don&#x27;t cut mine.  You can stick it in your nose until the battery dies (which actually is not such a long time), and you won&#x27;t cut as much hair as you could with a pair of scissors in 10 seconds.  There&#x27;s just no comparison.  This trimmer makes a lot of noise and painfully tugs on hairs, but it&#x27;s all sound and fury.  Nothing much happens.  So, I&#x27;d say that unless you have tremors or something, you&#x27;d be much better off with a $3-pair of manicure scissors.  Do the job in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> It basically does what its supposed to do. My only complaint is that it has a tendency of pulling the hair too much. I assume this is because the blades don&#x27;t spin quite fast enough.    *** update. 1 month later and the thing stopped working. The blade is catching on the interior metal. This is probably because the components are cheap Chinese plastic.</li>
            <li> Works just the way it&#x27;s supposed too. Just don&#x27;t drop the damn thing in the sink. The top busted off but w/a little epoxy she was working again.</li>
            <li> To be honest, the trimmer performed better than I anticipated.  It did just about everything it purported to do.</li>
            <li> Simple to operate and does the job it claims to do.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep some clean nostrils look no further.  I feel like the Panasonic model I owned before this cut a bit closer which was nice, but aesthetically it is impossible to notice.  I&#x27;d recommend this.  Its not extremely expensive and any that are more expensive will doubtfully make any difference.</li>
            <li> Very handy. The little light this thing has doesn&#x27;t really help all that much... but still.. it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for many years and the first two times I used the nose trimmer it worked well but after the second time it seems to have a really hard time picking up speed when spinning the blade and keeping up speed. I have always cleaned it meticulously after every use and even tried different kinds of lubrication and batteries but it just works very poorly. I still have it and put up with it but it&#x27;s very frustrating because it ends up pulling a lot of hairs because the RPM&#x27;s intermittently drop which cause the blade to yank the hair instead of cutting it. Also, the LED light is completely worthless and you really have to wonder what engineer thought that would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because Panasonic discontinued the ER411 (which I had damaged the nose cone slightly by dropping the unit). Also, I tried a model Brookstone was selling which I had to trash as completely useless. Turns out this new model has a straight blade set-up which does not perform as well as the old curved blades. Fortunately  I was able to swap the nose cones - which remained unchanged between the models - and continue using my trusty older model (trims hairs like a razor without cutting or nicking.)</li>
            <li> I really like the usability of this product - easy to clean, lightweight, good trimming action, and does not pull hairs out.</li>
            <li> What else can I say? It works. No pain, no fuss. Quick and easy. The light is not of much help, but I did not find that to be a problem. Great product!</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts well but the light is pointless.  It lights up your face instead of your nose.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, but if you put light oil on the blade (I use trumpet valve oil or similar) occasionally and clean it often it works.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted about a year ago and love it!  I used to use scissors and occasionally a razor to get a really clean look on my ears and nose.  I always inevitably ended up cutting myself and bleeding.  It also took forever.      Now, with this Panasonic trimmer, it&#x27;s easy to use everyday if need be.  There is no pulling (and unimaginable pain) of hair like I worried there would be.  It is also convenient to be wet/dry as I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting a shock when I use it right out of the shower.    As for the light -it is not too useful while you are trimming, but is useful when you need to check your work.    In addition, the head is removable for easy cleaning.    This trimmer is a must own for every man.</li>
            <li> Worked for a few years but now stalls. I don&#x27;t use it much so it should still be in good shape. Changing the battery did not help.</li>
            <li> Just plain useless. Was not returned because then Amazon&#x27;s free shipping would be cancelled.  I then ordered the 415, becuase I had that one originally. Subsequently it has been modified, and is just a bit better than this one being reviewed.  Either poor quality control, or they tried so hard not to cut you, that these cut nothing.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does not cut most hair without a significant amount of gyrations of angles for it to get the hair in the openings. The light is worthless. At least it doesn&#x27;t pull hair when cutting. I would not recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and it works better than the last one he had.  Doesn&#x27;t pull as much, but it still pulls some.  His only complaint is  that it is really loud.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this trimmer! So far so good. My last trimmer last me 3 years and I hope this will last about the same.</li>
            <li> My other nose hair trimmer quit after about 5 years.  It was a sharper image and did a great job (except for ultimately quitting).  This product is about half the price which is good, it is lighter, which is good.  However, the performance is not quite as good, so it takes awhile to get the job done.  It leaves a little bit of stubble in there but unless someone is staring down your nose, it does an ok job.  Overall, the product is fine but not great.  Good for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> Does the job. The light is useful to make sure you did not miss any nose hairs. There is one thing all the users have to be careful about though. Be careful not to drop it. Even a slightest deformation of the blade will ruin its function. Panasonic does sell the replacement blade but it is priced pretty high. Often times it is cheaper to buy the whole thing.</li>
            <li> i bought this item for my father for Christmas he really likes it. it took awhile to get used to the tickle that it gives your nose but besides that he said it works great</li>
            <li> I used a mechanical twist type before and didn&#x27;t think a power trimmer could possibly work. Boy was I wrong! This thing works and works well. It&#x27;s well made and I can highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer is great; it trims your hairs, whether they are from your nose or ears, with a clean no hassle way.  I used to have another nose trimmer that every time I used it my nose did not like it.  But this one is so nice and easy that my nose wants it every day.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic 411 model trimmer (basically very similar, but no light) and have always had problems with the motor speed -- usually it was too slow and weak, and it seemed to vary for no discernible reason. A couple days ago, it quit completely. Well, after fiddling with every part of it I could access (pulling off the on-off switch, trying to pull the inner unit out etc), I discovered that this thing is very sensitive electrically (probably due to the fact that it operates on only 1.5 volts) to the bottom (in the cap) battery center contact. I pulled out the metal contact (it&#x27;s held in simply by the two \\&quot;points\\&quot; pressing against the plastic), scraped and sanded the contact a bit, but more importantly, I pulled the center portion out quite a bit to bend it enough to press pretty firmly against the battery negative end when reassembled. Voila, more RPM than I ever remember getting! I have a feeling this may be the reason many have had their trimmers quit working. Give this fix a try!</li>
            <li> The clippers work good to cut the hair, but, I was disappointed with the light. I thought the light would be focused so that when you were using the clippers it would shine where you were clipping but it does not. You have to remove the clippers and then shine the light and then resume clipping. Also, I have noticed after the 3rd use, that when I start the clippers now the power seems to take 3 secs to get to full speed, I have concerns about the power not lasting long enough.</li>
            <li> Tried about 4 or 5 of these before finding this one, clearly the best of them. Finally, one I&#x27;ll keep &amp; use.</li>
            <li> Got him this unit before the Holidays.. Took it out the box &amp; tried it on him.. he says it wasn&#x27;t cutting.. then noticed it had a small plastic cover covering the tip. Removed it for him &amp; it works great now. His former unit was a Remington unit without the light. I like the light feature  because MORE then LIKELY someone else will be cutting his ear hair for him, this light comes in handy!!! While I&#x27; will agree it isn&#x27;t as functional for cutting nose hair , there may be occurrences when this light will help someone. It is better to have it then Not have it !      Ordered this unit for him, I got the Vacuum unit cutter for myself. Both work well.</li>
            <li> I was greatly impressed with the Panasonic Nose Hair Trimmer. It far exceeded the workability of a previous trimmer I had used for many years, and operates without any annoying pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li> Not well constructed - very cheaply made. I would have returned it but it probably would have ended up costing me more in time and effort.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model of this same product. I liked the product and when it finally gave out after years of service, I had a hard time finding another one.    Just by chance, I was bale to find the newer version on Amazon.com. With no hesitation, I ordered it. The new model is just as good as the older version. No problems.     Thanks Amazon...</li>
            <li> (this review is by Karen&#x27;s husband)  I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ER421KC for over 3 years now an I can say with confidence that this is an excellent device for doing the job it was designed for. That is to say it clips/trims nose and ear hairs efficiently and virtually painlessly.     The lighted feature is an excellent idea and does the job of helping you locate the nose hairs you may have missed. Just keep in mind that the light is NOT intended to help you guide the device while it&#x27;s in your nostril and trimming, but instead is intended to enable you to check your work, and locate any stubborn/missed hairs for another pass.    The ability to rinse the unit under the faucet is very convenient and for further cleaning the tip breaks down super quick and easy to aid in rinsing out clipped hair. The ER421KC is also very reliable, it always runs (as long as the battery isn&#x27;t drained of course) and has never failed me, with the exception of the below cases, which were my fault.    The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this unit 5 stars is due to a slight lack of durability of the metal tip. Twice now, I&#x27;ve dropped one of these units, and both times the metal trimming tip was bent so slightly that it was imperceptible to the naked eye. But when I turned the unit on, the blades were making a more pronounced contact with the inside of the metal tip and while it still trimmed hair, it had a pronounced tendency to tug/pull rather than cut cleanly. The contact of the blade on the inside of the metal tip also likely would have dramatically dulled the blades in a short amount of time so replacement of the unit was a must.    I knocked one off the counter (a fall of about 2 1/2 feet) and it clattered around on the floor, another I knocked out of the medicine cabinet and it bounced around in the sink (a fall of about 1 1/2 feet) and both  times the unit started right up and worked but the tip was irreversibly bent and never trimmed half as well as before the unit was dropped.   Pleasenote that dropping the unit didn&#x27;t break it so that it no longer operated, but instead caused it to not operate as well as prior to the accident.      The first unit I owned worked flawlessly for about 10 months before I damaged it by dropping. The second unit worked flawlessly for a little over 2 years before I also damaged it by dropping. Neither unit failed on it&#x27;s own. Chalk it up to user error and perhaps a slight lack of durability of the metal tip. (I mean, come on... one only fell about a foot and a half but still the tip took damage) I have a strong feeling that pretty much any of the brands and models available that use this tip/cutting design are prone to tip damage from being dropped.    Bottom Line: The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer is an excellent, reliable device for trimming one&#x27;s nose and ear hairs. Just take care not to drop it! Take care of it, and it will take care of you.</li>
            <li> Nice product,gets the job done without mess and I am satisfied. The light,however, is a waste. Ken S.</li>
            <li> This is a very over rated product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my son and it worked twice.&lt;br /&gt;In the end we threw it out.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well - the light is not usefull to me at all but the cutting blade does an adequate job.  There might be a better one out there but not for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a nose trimmer before, but I&#x27;ve always felt I could use one. This thing gets the job done, and after every trim I can take a big inhale, exhale of relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light isn&#x27;t useful at all, so don&#x27;t let that be any determining factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I felt this was somewhat overpriced. But it does what it&#x27;s suppose to. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, this no longer works. I&#x27;m not sure why. The blade inside attempts to spin but won&#x27;t I looked inside and saw how truly cheap this was. Really only worth 8 bucks. Can&#x27;t believe I paid 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: Smells bad.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine and is handy. The light doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose!  The only problem is the rotary blade doesn&#x27;t cut deep enough. My old conair trimmer had a straight blade and used to cut just close enough.Overall works decently!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Works like a trimmer should. I don&#x27;t find the light particularly useful, but I don&#x27;t need a light to find my nose. I would recommed this product. Great price.</li>
            <li> This is a really bad hair trimmer. It has trouble trimming the hair on my ears. Either the motor doesn&#x27;t have enough power or the blade is not properly designed. I should have followed the advice given by other reviewers of this product.     Missed my chance to return the product as I took too long to open and try out the item.</li>
            <li> I had another cheap trimmer for years. It finally gave out and my wife wouldn&#x27;t share hers with me, so I chose the Panasonic ER421KC as my new trimmer. I like it quite well for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s really very effective.&lt;br /&gt;-The reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not at all unhappy with the trimmer, but I do think it could be better in three ways.&lt;br /&gt;-A recgaharging dock would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;-The light is useless.&lt;br /&gt;-I had to replace the battery and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open the thing. Some directional arrows or a note on the casing would help slow people like me get through advanced technological procedures like changing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several Panasonic electronics products in my home. Some play CD&#x27;s, some play MP3&#x27;s, some play DVD&#x27;s, some trim my nose hair. I love them all.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. And does it very well.  I really love the light feature and also the fact the whole unit is immersible in water (makes the cleaning process very easy).  The reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the protective plastic cap keeps falling off (not a big deal though).    Buy confidently.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try out the trimmer, and will comment on this in the future after it has been used, however, I already have a HUGE complaint with the packaging of this item.  It is incredibly difficult to open - so difficult that when I finally got it opened (it took almost all of my strength) the trimmer dropped and pieces went everywhere.  I found everything but the blade, which I hope I&#x27;ll find tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Very good product and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.    Except, how do you look into your ear with the light, I can&#x27;t figure it out..??</li>
            <li> Item works very well. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair as much as other products. The light is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> update &#x3D; 2011-05-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;howdy y&#x27;all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this item stopped working last month. since i bought it 2010-08 and it died in 2011-04, i am displeased. panasonic devices are generally better than this. [*sigh ...*] the warranty is pretty worthless since i can&#x27;t get them to respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care,&lt;br /&gt;lee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********&lt;br /&gt;howdy y&#x27;all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the actual item does it&#x27;s job quite nicely. i would rate it a 4 on it&#x27;s own. it feels good in the hand, cuts easily and quickly plus the light is actually useful. the nasty stench when one st opens the battery compartment is [i suppose] outgassing from something in the assembly. i went away after i left it open for a few hours. [*grin*]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the reason i rated this item at ONE is cuz the blister pack had NO indication of how to open it. it was sealed TIGHTLY and the plastic was quite brittle. i finally took a knife and the package out in the yard and sliced it open. the plastic shattered when the cut neared one edge and i was struck by many bits of sharp plastic. one bounced off of my glasses. thankfully, i didn&#x27;t lose my eye cuz the glasses stopped the missile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this item while the blister pack remains so remarkably dangerous to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i suppose they wanted to mutilate any shoplifters ... but they forgot to account for actual buyers. [*sigh ...*]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care,&lt;br /&gt;lee</li>
            <li> The quality of this speaks for itself - I always buy Panasonic items when available. They never seem to break! This unit is easy to use and clean and works without pain.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  It takes care of all my husbands hair down to the root.</li>
            <li> I had owner one of these, and it wore out.  Luckily they were still available.  They work very good.  Cleaning is a little hard.</li>
            <li> Works well on nose. I used a lighted magnifying mirror while using the nose trimmer. Easy to operate and light weight.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas. He used it once, then the motor burned up. He liked how it felt, but it&#x27;s a little ridiculous to only be able to use it once. Unfortunately he tossed the packaging, so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Works as Champ. Although quite slow and not that powerful, but hey who needs a full blow vacuum sucker in your nose Does the job and very good at price</li>
            <li> WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!  I HAD THIS FOR ONLY A FEW USES AND IT IS BROKEN AND DOESN&#x27;T WORK. AMAZON WILL NOT REPLACE AND THE VENDOR PANASONIC WILL NOT DEAL WITH IT SINCE IT WAS SOLD THROUGH AMMAZON.  do not but this product it is terrible@!</li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic ER415 that works great.  I need another one and I made a bad assumption that the 421 would be better than the 415 since I thought it was a later model.  But unfortunately that&#x27;s not nearly the case.  The 415 cuts much closer and provides a clean, smooth finish around the nose and ears.  On the other hand the 421 is not really much better than the cheap, off-brand $10 trimmers you&#x27;ll find in discount stores.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a year and a half ago. I&#x27;ve used it several times since then. It&#x27;s never had much power but with patience can be used to get the job done. The light is a joke. A magnifying mirror with good vanity mirror lighting is better. I went to use it a week ago and discovered it doesn&#x27;t run. Even with a brand spanking new Eveready battery. I do not recommend this particular model. My previous trimmer worked for years and years before it died.</li>
            <li> Works great, does a very nice job on tiny hairs too!  Very quiet and easy to use.  Don&#x27;t know what took me so long to order one.</li>
            <li> Read all the low ratings as I had all the experiences told.    What really sucks is that after using this awkwards, not-so-smoothe trimmer, is when my wife tells me I still have hair sticking out. After a plastic on the actual trimmer broke, Panasonic gave me no assistance to fix or replace.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer for 5 years and it did the job. I never understood why there was a light. When the battery begins to weaken there is a sudden drop in performance. I replaced this trimmer in 2013 with the [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System]]. The new one is far superior.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Cuts/trims hair well&lt;br /&gt;-Does not pull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-LED light is useless&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving head is constantly coming off&lt;br /&gt;-Broke after about 14 months of ownership&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this product for about 14 months.  I probably use it two minutes at a time about twice a month.  Cuts/trims hair well and does not pull (which is a complaint I have seen for other similar products).  Until about 3 weeks ago I would have given this product 4 out of 5 stars.  My only issues I had with the product are the LED light is completely useless and the shave head constantly falls off because it does not completely lock in place.  But the unit completely broke and will not function at all.  I emailed Panasonic support because it does have a two year warranty.  They emailed me back about 2 weeks later and said to mail it in with my receipt and they would send me a new one.  So I paid $3-$4 to warranty out my $16ish trimmer...Still waiting on a replacement, but I am not holding my breath.</li>
            <li> Having tried a number of these devices, only the Panasonic actually works.  Does a great job, don&#x27;t waste money on Wahl and other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the replacement for the discontinued excellent Panasonic ER411 that I had for many years. Panasonic changed the blade height on this newer ER421 model so that it does not cut close at all. I also thought the small LED light would be helpful and it doesn&#x27;t even aim straight (pointless). I purchased the Mangroomer trimmer this week from Amazon and it works flawless just like the old Panasonic ER411 did. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Panasonic RE421 series.</li>
            <li> This tool is perfect for nose and ear hair removal. It would have gotten a higher review if the light actually pointed at the area the blade was cutting. I have had trimmers before but they were all noisy and clunky. This one is quiet and very efficient.</li>
            <li> I have been through 2 other trimmers over the past couple of years and this one seems to work the best. I had problems with the others malfunctioning. I was always taking them apart trying to get them to work properly. So far I am happy with this one.</li>
            <li> This product really works. Trims nose hair perfectly. My old trimmer had a tendency to pull hair while trimming. This trimmer trims very smooth.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works OK, but not great. You have to spend some time at it for it to do a thorough job. Some hairs just don&#x27;t want to go inside the guard. If they don&#x27;t, they don&#x27;t get cut. you also need a separate flashlight to see how you&#x27;re doing. The one on the unit doesn&#x27;t work that well. For $12 I&#x27;m not going to complain too much, but I&#x27;ll spend a bit more money the next time and see if I can get a unit that works a little better.</li>
            <li> Old model died, so hubby decided to stick with panasonic.  Like some of the other reviewers have stated, this one just doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the old model, but it does seem to cut with less pull, so he says...  Give and take I guess.  He&#x27;ll just have to use more often...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a present for my husband. He used to have a manual one which he likes a lot. He likes this one as well, saying it&#x27;s as smooth as the manual one. Now he considers to buy another one as a gift for his brother.</li>
            <li> This trimmer just doesn&#x27;t make the cut (hair cut that is).  The light is a good idea, but it is really hard to remove hair with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer.  I bought this item back in 2009 and I am still using it today.  I think in that time I have only changed the battery maybe twice.  Now why can&#x27;t a flashlight that I use just as often be that way.  It has a light on the side but I guess I don&#x27;t use that, maybe if I could turn the light off the battery would last a few years.  This product does just what it needs to do, and does it well.  It is constructed well, does not feel cheap.  The on/off switch has a rubber coating so it is easy to switch on and off, even with wet fingers after rinsing it off.  The base of it is flat so that it stands up, taking up as much space on your counter as a quarter.</li>
            <li> My husband says it took him 59 years to get this item, and he&#x27;s so please with it, it was a great buy!!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of these things having next to no lifespan, so if my goes kaput in the next few months I&#x27;ll update this review. That said, this thing is working exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is indeed useful, and you can get a good look up your nostril. The actual trimming process feels a bit weird if you&#x27;ve never done it but is light-years ahead of the tweezers - that is, there is no pain to speak of. Note that the trimmer does not cut the hair completely: it just pares it down to the proper length, which is more than sufficient to keep hairs from poking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as it stands, if you&#x27;re looking at this product, I know what problem you have - I had it too, and this thing has solved it at a very reasonable price. That&#x27;s the best compliment there is for a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/16/2010: Roughly eight months later, after one or two uses a month, I&#x27;ve noticed no drop-off in performance.</li>
            <li> The true test of a trimmer such as this is how well it holds up over the long haul, and it&#x27;s difficult for me to assess that after having owned it for only a month or so. The one complaint I have at this point is that the light feature (which isn&#x27;t all that important for overall performance) is angled improperly and is therefore of no use whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I researched a device for removing Nose Hairs. The Panasonic was the highest rated. I ordered it and upon recieving the nose hair remover. I opened it and followed the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I could not open the battery compartment to put the batteries in the device. I reread the instructions and tried and tried to open the battery compartment. I was totally frustrated so I called Panasonic customer service. It was a horrible experience, they treated me like a idiot. I carefully explained what I had attempted. I finally got tired of being treated like a Idiot and called Amazon to return it.&lt;br /&gt;After my experience with Panasonic Customer Service I will NEVER buy a Panasonic Product again.....</li>
            <li> I bought 2 . The add looked great. I inserted the batteries , it did not work. Put in new batteries . Still nothing. This item is a piece of Crap!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ouch! Hope you can focus through the tears. This thing pulls and pulls and pulls your nose hairs. The battery compartment is almost impossible to open, and now the thing has died, 6 months of occasional use later. Awful experience. Hated this product.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted a couple years, then stopped working for no apparent reason. I replaced it - that one never worked at all. The second replacement lasted a couple weeks, then it also stopped working. I give up.</li>
            <li> Does the trick very well with little to absolutely no pulling.  This is the original and better than the one with the curved head :)</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I had better nose hair trimmers, and worse ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected more from this one, being Panasonic, but it is rather mediocre.</li>
            <li> This product only worked for a couple of months.  Tried changing batteries several times, but it does absolutely nothing!  Do not waste your money.  For $16.00 (I know, not astronomically priced), it should work for several years.  The item wasn&#x27;t even used that much.  What happened to quality manufacturing?!?</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in 2006, and ended up using a cheapo trimmer that I picked up at Marshall&#x27;s much more. The Panasonic trimmer, sadly, never worked as intended. The cutting blade part would get stuck in the cap assembly, and only much careful adjusting could cause it to spin. When it did spin, it did not do so properly - the blades would get stuck on the head assy and it would stop spinning. This made for a very annoying and at times painful experience. I&#x27;m not giving up on Panasonic and after my el cheapo groomer died, I am getting a Vortex trimmer which seems to be rated higher than this one.</li>
            <li> About midway through my 26th year of life nose hairs suddenly appeared--much to my dismay!  I purchased this product and it worked like magic.  During a recent move the product was lost.  I bought a cheaper \\&quot;manual\\&quot; set of trimmers which were quite painful...ok, they were boarderline torture.  Needless to say, I have ordered this trimmer again.  The light is good for a post-trim inspection.  There is an occasional hair \\&quot;catch\\&quot; or \\&quot;yank\\&quot; in the trimmer which results in a bit of unpleasantness, but hardly anything compared to the alternatives (see manual trimmer above or (gasp!) plucking). Do yourself a favor an invest in this product.</li>
            <li> Nice little product. Does all that I need to get rid of those pesky unsightly hairs that us older men have. Yuk!</li>
            <li> When I traveled one time, this was disassembled. This is fragile for the shock. You should think about this when you try to buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer a few times and it pulls a lot. I have an old Connair el cheapo and it does the trick without pulling - the only concern is that I can smell burning when I use it which is why I got another one. I&#x27;ll stick to scissors for now until I find a trimmer that works properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this product for about eight months before it died on me. When it was working it was quite painful to use, often pulling and tearing away the nose hairs. The light was absolutely pointless. It was better than the Connair I had prior to it whose motor you could smell burning as you used it. I can&#x27;t believe how few choices there are for trimming nose hair and how useless they are.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiter and seems to cut more thoroughly than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used -- although I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  I&#x27;m pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but may be a bit pricy. Wet/Dry feature is a must though.  Nose trimmings can be a hassle to clean out of a sink, so use in the shower is reccomended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Light is a bit useless unless you&#x27;re bathroom mirror lacks a vanity light.</li>
            <li> This unit has good power, trims hair with no problems. No snags or binds, doesn&#x27;t hurt you when it gets into the thick stuff. Light could have been brighter or easier to aim into the nostril while in use but otherwise, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> this product does what its supposed to, well enough for me to give it four out of five stars...</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband.  When I suggested it, he thought it was something he would never use.  But, once he used it, he was hooked.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  Nose, ears, or other hairs hard to trim.  My husband has since grown a beard and spends even more time trimming his facial hair.  It all started with this nose and ear trimmer.</li>
            <li> This device is just right for trimming nose and ear hair without cutting or bleeding...completely safe...highly recommend it..great value.</li>
            <li> The blade is really slow and it takes a long time and repeated efforts to get a clean job done.  Its like shaving with a bad razor.  It makes quite a bit of noise but not much of trimming.</li>
            <li> after finally finding a smooth operating trimmer at \\&quot;sharper image\\&quot; years ago I found that when I had to replace it , the new unit was terrible. So I returned it and did some research and this was the one I came up with. Well this one is worse. If I wanted to pull the hair out of my nose all I need is a pair of tweezers. Not enough power or not sharp enough blades I dont know which.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a year or less, used it very infrequently and it no longer turns on.  Even when it worked it had a very weak motor and would take quite some time before it turned on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve updated this review at the end - I found a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased two of these and each one has had problems.  After a couple of years, even with a new battery the speed of the blades has slowed and I often end up with a nose hair attached to the now non-moving blades.  Nice image - a guy with a nose trimmer hanging from his nose - but essentially that&#x27;s what happens.  I have to yank the hair out by the root to get the trimmer out of my nose.  and it&#x27;s painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the upper cone holding the cutter blades eventually gets loose and will not stay on when pressure is applied at an angle to the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a great product, but when it works properly it is better than most I&#x27;ve tried.  The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t work properly for long...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October, 2011 update:  The two units that I owned have both died.  The cutter spins slowly once in a while (not fast enough to cut) and doesn&#x27;t spin at all most of the time.  I have replaced the batteries with new batteries but the motor seems to have trouble spinning the cutters.  If I manually twist the spindle it will start up, but if I flip the power switch on and off it doesn&#x27;t come back.  What a poorly made product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December, 2012 update:  I purchased the Wahl 5546 and 5545 models on Amazon after I wrote the above review and they are both far superior to the Panasonics.  They are more powerful so they cut cleaner,  quicker and without grabbing.  They have worked without any problems for over a year.  They are relatively inexpensive also.  My only issue with these (I had the same issue with the Panasonic) is that it doesn&#x27;t reach quite far enough to take care of all the hair, perhaps for my own protection.  I would recommend the Wahl products over the Panasonic, absolutely.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, but I found similar trimmers in discount stores for well under $10 that look just like the one I have.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this now since 11/2006 and its pretty much simple operation, works great and gets the job done. Just place a battery in it and you can start using it right away. Cleaned up my nose hair perfectly and been maintaining my nose every since. Recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various nose hair trimmers for years in search of the best, because none of them have been all that great.  My last one was a Panasonic ER411NC.  The ER411NC was the best until now, but it would cause minor trimming agony.  Fortunate for me, I dropped it in the shower and decieded to try the ER421KC.  Panasonic has gotten this one right!  Infact the ER421KC has NO cutting sensation in the shower and at first I wondered if it was cutting. It works great!  The light is worthless unless you are somewhere in the dark.  This trimmer is far above all of the others!  Buy it and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Product works like a charm. Doesn&#x27;t pull your hairs out, but it does tickle a little, so if you can get past the laughing while trimming your nose hairs then you have a fine product.</li>
            <li> This product gets a very close shave and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs. And the light does come in handy. What more could you want, right? A product that actually doesn&#x27;t break! My first one I got simply didn&#x27;t turn on, I chalked it up to being defective and exchanged it for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The second one worked, although you had to be very careful how you put the battery in or it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Whatever, I got used to it. Now after 2 months it simply won&#x27;t turn on! And amazon refuses to exchange/return it. Waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this item since Panasonic generally  makes quality products.  I also liked the idea that it used external AA batteries.  However, the product only worked twice for me then died.  I unfortunately had thrown out the box before I knew it needed to be returned.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and it works great. I would recommend this product whole nosedly.  It also works well on trimming any ear hair you may sticking out. Prior to the Panasonic ER421KC I had the Panasonic ER112BC which worked well, but vibrated some and tickled my nose, no such issue with this model.    Just don&#x27;t drop it cutter end down.  Unfortunately, I did and broke the plastic cap that holds the blades on the first one.  I was able to hold it on and continue use, but this was not practical, so I bought a new one.     4 Stars because of the lack of durability, 5 Stars for performance.</li>
            <li> This is a very good nose trimmer and the replacement for my old Wahl - which lasted about a month.  I would recommend it, but I am puzzled about why there is a light?  Good trimmer though and better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is ridiculously weak. It managed to cut the hairs but pulled at them like crazy - quite painful. Doubt it would last long either, but have no idea, since I haven&#x27;t used it once since my girlfriend found some no-name cheapo (&lt; $5) nose trimmer that works 20 times better than this.    And yeah, the light is totally a gimmick, no way that could be useful.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon. I live in a remote area of Colorado that has very few stores so I use Amazon for hard to find items and my recent purchase was this nose hair trimmer. After much deliberation and doing probably too much research I purchased the Panasonic ER421KC nose and ear hair trimmer.     It is exactly what I was looking for. I really did not want another cheaply made import because I have already thrown a few of those away and I kept on having to go back to my moustache scissors to get the job done, which at my age is a little dangerous.     This trimmer takes a little getting used to but does a great job.   I am always surprised at just how much hair it trims without pulling and the reservoir tip traps all of those small hairs which can then be easily rinsed out under running water. It has a very solid feel and is backed up by warranty. Of course, I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I used the Panasonic ER112BC for years, but I always had problems with it.  It would pull hairs in my nose that I was trying to cut and would often leave hairs uncut, despite many tries.  When I read about this Panasonic product, it seemed that the users felt it was a vast improvement over the ER112BC.  I agree completely.  Panasonic is to be commended for redesigning this product (and especially the cutting head).  It now cuts all nose hair effortlessly and without any irritation or pain.  Unlike others who believe the light is useless, I disagree.  The light helps guide the user to properly aim the cutting head; it is certainly a benefit for me.  The reason that I did not give this product five stars is that it did little for the few ear hairs that I have.  Despite numerous attempts, the ER421KC just doesn&#x27;t work as well in the ear.  Tweezers are really the only effective way to remove ear hairs.  Nevertheless, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It works OK but I wish I could find one that is real heavy duty. I guess I want an industrial strength nose and ear hair clipper. This one is like all the others in that they (the people that make them) worry that you might get a hair yanked now and then. Well my good old Dad didn&#x27;t raise any sissies and I just want one to cut like my old cheap Norelco. Side to side not in a circle. The only ones that trim side to side now are the cheepos from the chi comm&#x27;s (Chinese Communists). But his one does have a nice cushy handle for easy grip and is very quiet. It does however take awhile to trim the difficult ones and is hit and miss on the problem ones.</li>
            <li> When I first recieived and used this product I rated it with 5 Stars and wrote the review below.  However, after 6 months the unit would slow down and became very erradict.  Threw it away after few more months.  This is equal to the really cheap products out there.  If you do order this product, hang on to the instructions to figure out how to change battery.  There is nothing intuitive about that process.  After a couple of months, you&#x27;ll be changing batteries on a weekly basis.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product&lt;br /&gt;Very good product for the price.  My main \\&quot;like\\&quot; of this product is that it is quiet!  I&#x27;ve bought similiar products over the years and those that could actually cut ear hairs were so noisy with high pitched sounds that it was a pain to use them.  This trimmer is very quiet, cuts the hair and gets the job done.  I was hestitant because of some of negative reviews but finally decided that one could not expect an engineering marvel for the price.  Only improvement I would recommend is the light; it sure doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense because of where it&#x27;s aimed.  However, it&#x27;s still nice to have a light in the general area.  Overall, cuts and trims about the same as products you can pick up in the store for $10-20, but the low noise level makes this trimmer standout!! Face it, the original Sharper Image product is gone so standards/expectations will have to lowered for now.</li>
            <li> Was fine at first (light&#x27;s sort of silly though), but the motor is winding down and so it turns slowly and is more of a hair puller than a hair cutter now.  Probably just this unit, but I guess you get what you pay for and the price was cheap.  Looks like decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It was not my favorite gift to give.  It seemed to be cheaply made and pulls hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> I like to use this to groom my husband in between trips to the barber. Good sharp blades, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This item is for my husband. His comment was that he likes it very much and it is handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is great. I love it for my boyfriend! he now has no yucky nose hair</li>
            <li> This thing works great. Does not pull any hairs at all. Could have done without the light, but I didnt buy it for the light.  I bought it to trim my nose hair and it does a great job.  Nice and easy to clean as well.  Just take a couple pieces apart, wipe them down, run them under some water, dry them and you are done.  I highly recommend.  Fast, painless and easy to clean.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I previously had a straight trimmer, this rotary works so much better. you can hear when you are cutting and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have that problem with nose hair.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do without all that pulling and snagging.</li>
            <li> Had unsightly nose hairs. Used this trimmer. No longer have nose hair problem. That&#x27;s pretty much it!  Totally worth $15.    Btw, before I bought this one, I bought a similar trimmer from Walmart (no name brand) for about $5, figuring they&#x27;re all the same.  Not so.  The cheaper ones get stuck, lose power, and just generally don&#x27;t work that well.  There&#x27;s no need to break the bank on a nose hair trimmer, but it&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to get a decent one; this trimmer is just about right.    About the light: someone said here they thought the light was useless.  Well, it&#x27;s kinda useless, and certainly is not the \\&quot;the reason\\&quot; to buy this trimmer, but it&#x27;s also sort of handy at moments.  That said, the easiest way to use this thing is to just stick it in, wiggle it around randomly, and wait till you don&#x27;t have nose hairs anymore.  If you want to use the light to target something, it&#x27;s handy.  But you really don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace an old-but-still-working nose-hair clipper I&#x27;ve had for ages. I have to say that this one doesn&#x27;t begin to compare with the old one....extremely ineffective, difficult to use, and thoroughly  disappointing in every way. You almost have to trap a single hair in the middle of the top of this device, and even then, it takes repeated attempts just to remove a single hair. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Works very well. An upgrade from my old cheapie one I had been given by a friend. Good quality design. If you&#x27;re looking  for an upgrade that will last this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> I assume \\&quot;ER\\&quot; stands for extended reach. It just doesn&#x27;t cut nose hair hardly at all. My old \\&quot;non-ER\\&quot; trimmer worked great.The difference is the extended \\&quot;cap\\&quot; over the cutter. Unfortunately I bought 2 of them. They are worthless and unusable.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this one, but I&#x27;ve had worse.  It&#x27;s better than most, but still not very effective at the ONE thing it&#x27;s supposed to do!  I would not recommend getting it.    PROS:  - Well-built, hasn&#x27;t broken in almost a year  - Safe to use, no cuts or painful snags (yet)  - Easy to clean (just run under a faucet)    CONS:  - Not very thorough  - Underpowered, I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries with no improvement  - Light is next to useless</li>
            <li> Not very efficient.  does some trimming but also misses a lot.  better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Having used Amazon for a number of purchases over the years, I ordered the Panasonic Nose Hair trimmer, and was notified immediately that my credit card info was incorrect. After trying to do so, I ordered again, with the same result. No sale. And again and again.  I finally reregistered with Amazon, using a different credit card. Again, upon doing so, my order was rejected. After one more try - unsuccessful - I found the item on another site, and ordered it with no problems - but at a lower price!  Product from other vendor arrived a few days later, followed shortly thereafter by THE SAME PRODUCT SENT BY AMAZON, AND A CHARGE TO MY CREDIT CARD. As it was too much trouble to send product back and arrange the credit, I kept it.  Moral of the story:  no more AMAZON for me!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these trimmers 10 years ago and it didn&#x27;t work worth a damn. They improved them tremendously in ten years because this thing is fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just barely went to use this for the first time, and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried 4 different new batteries.  I buy so much stuff on amazon it is unreal.  Unfortunately my window of time to return this has expired.  I guess I should have tried it sooner.</li>
            <li> What can I say about a product like this? It works, was not expensive and is durable.</li>
            <li> Is it me or do all the reviews for this product sound phony?  They don&#x27;t sound genuine... almost as if someone who works for Panasonic wrote them.</li>
            <li> It performs better than I expected. I have used it and have had to problems.</li>
            <li> I loved it, no hair pulling or irritation in nose after the use. Much better than the cheapo version availalbe at Pharmacies.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and I love the light!  Basic and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Having used the ER411 since it first came out, I asked for this new one because the blade on the old one was getting dull. Boy, what a difference and not for the better. Forget the lights and the wet/dry capabilities, it simply doesn&#x27;t get in there and cut down the timber. And in guys, that can be a lot. The ER411 did such a great job, I don&#x27;t know why panasonic had to fiddle with the product. I removed both blade components to try and figure out what had happened, and it turns out they actually lowered the distance of the blade&#x27;s cutting tip in the new product. Now why would they do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen complaints on the ER411 that it tended to tug, so perhaps this was in response to that. But those comments were few and far between and should not have prompted a complete overhaul of the product. Even the ER412, which I bought last year, didn&#x27;t cut a thing. And since returning a nose trimmer is akin to returning used toilet paper (in my opinion), I was stuck with it. Now I&#x27;m stuck with the ER421 and I truly hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next step is to find the old ER411, not the ER411NC (which is also just as bad and yes, I stupidly bought that one, too). I was hoping panasonic returned to its roots by actually cutting nose hair down to the root with the ER421, but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind you can also use these trimmers to take care of that Yoda hair that grows on the outside of men&#x27;s ears and in our ear canals, and you need something that can get the job done. This doesn&#x27;t do it. So if you&#x27;re listening Panasonic, bring back the old blade or at least make it available for people to purchase so we can keep our ER411s. It really is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. This is not that one.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for nose hairs. Includes a light instead of the mirrored cap the upgraded version has which in my opinion is better. It&#x27;s cheap and cleans up well and does what it needs to do with ease. I&#x27;d buy it if I was anyone else, it works for females as well.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed too ... and does it well. I haven&#x27;t found much use for the light but for the extra cost is negligible.</li>
            <li> Okay, sad though this is, I just got the package. Opened it in great excitement, since my previous trimmer died a week ago and I&#x27;ve missed it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh how disappointed I was to try it. Bluntly, it sucks. Waste of my $15 or whatever it cost. I&#x27;d return it if it was (1) returnable and (2) worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to be average overall.  It pulls the hair sometimes instead of cutting it.  The light which is attached to the trimmer really does not help at all.   If this product is on sell, I would suggest buying it, but if it is not on sale, you might want to look for a better trimmer for the price.  I bought the product when it was on sale for about $15 not including shipping charges.  I think that $15 is about the maximum you should pay for this trimmer.  Overall, a pretty descent trimmer.</li>
            <li> OK, I have to admit... I was at work and was so horrified by the giant clumps of hair sticking out of a client&#x27;s nostrils (no kidding) that I came straight home, went online, and purchased these nose trimmers for my husband!  That being said, I am very happy with the purchase as is my husband who happily uses this handy tool regularly.  It is simple to use, isn&#x27;t painful (or my husband would have abandoned it immediately), and the light is a handy way to \\&quot;check your work\\&quot; and make sure you haven&#x27;t missed anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t speak to longevity (yet) since we bought it recently, but thus far it seems to be a high-quality well-designed piece of equipment that does the job it was designed for.  What more could you ask for?!?</li>
            <li> For the price, this product does a very good job. Quick and easy to use with no pulling of hair.</li>
            <li> i had the early model it had a straight cutter and was all right but took sometime to get all the hairs probably still would be useing it but i dropped it and would not work. so i searched the internet for a new one and settled on the panasonic er421kc bought it and was glad i did man that rotary cutter gets the nose and ear hairs in no time. buy one you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> This Specific Trimmer from Panasonic was a Disappointing Purchase.  The Trimmer Lasted About 5 Months of Very Occasional Use.  The Blade on this Model is Veru Tiny, Fragile and of Poor Design.  The Blade is What Led Me to Have to Buy Another Trimmer, Because it Became Slightly Out of Aligned with the Outside of the Trimer and Would Not Allow the Motor to Turn It.  This Model Also Has a Poor Power Level which Made It Inefficient in Trimming Hair.  I Replaced this Model with the Panasonic Model with the Squared Off Body, which is Shown it the Comparison Chart on the Product Detail Page for this Product.  I Definitely Recommend that Model Over This One.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my husband and he loves it.  It has a light on it so that he can see in dim lit situations.  He can also use it in the shower, so that is great.  The only problem I had with this trimmer was receiving it.  I ordered it almost a month before Christmas and the week before Christmas I still had not received it.  I had to put in a call to Amazon to see what the hold up was.  They told me that a hold had been put on the order for some reason, but the problem was resolved so they didn&#x27;t know why the product didn&#x27;t ship.  Whatever they did when I called, got them moving and the product arrived just a couple days before Christmas.  No product issues, only shipping issues with this item.</li>
            <li> I thought the light feature would be a plus, but it&#x27;s a minus.  ave the loot and get a smaller one.  It works, but the light shines in your eye and not in your nostril.  I put a piece of tape over it.</li>
            <li> This sucks.  Blades dull and motor weakens over time.  Even with new battery will run slow and catch on your nosehair and stop, painful.  The light is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews. I expected the pain. Now, I have mastered this modern marvel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- No more commutes with people staring at me while I yank and pinch into my nose.&lt;br /&gt;- If you use it as the delicate work of art it is, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the yanking and pinch (see my tips below).&lt;br /&gt;- The light IS useful - it allows you to see into the nether regions of your nostrils to catch those that might otherwise show their hairs tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;- Water proof for your running under the faucet for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- Small, lightweight, and neat design (like a mini-light saber to slash through the dark side of your nose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not a whole lot of power, but the question begs as to how much power you&#x27;d like to stick up your nostrils anyways.&lt;br /&gt;- Though the water proof capabilities allow you to run this bugger under the faucet, your normal faucet doesn&#x27;t do much to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;* Usage:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this trimmer works best when you cut as if your trimming bushes, not as if you were cutting grass. What I mean is that it would be best if you refrain from just cramming it up your nose. Granted, if you&#x27;re purchasing this device, you&#x27;re probably used to just yanking hairs anyways (hence, you&#x27;re also used to the associated pain). Trust me, if you take it a little at a time, the pain is greatly diminished and the effectiveness of the trimmer is enhanced. Also, use the lamp attached - I cannot stress this enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cleanup:&lt;br /&gt;After you run it under the faucet, hold tightly, bring close to your body, and then extend your arm quickly towards the sing. You may thus sling debris that may be caught in the water that may be stuck in your device. This works for me and it makes the trimmer more efficient in its cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am completely satisfied with this purchase. Additionally, my wife is completely happy that I am no longer leaving long nose hairs on her floorboard during our commute.</li>
            <li> I was the happy previous owner of a Panasonic trimmer, hence the draw back to Panasonic. Unfortunately this one just doesnt \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it. Blade head is tool large to get fine hairs. Also it seems that every time I go use the trimmer I have to replace the battery. Oh and also the light (what light) is useless, except for the fact that it is just burnin up battery Im sure. Bottomline eats batteries, not fine enouh unfortunately not recommended...sorry to say....</li>
            <li> The is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s smooth and works very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not sure how much use the light is, it&#x27;s too small to really see anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the cutting blades works great.</li>
            <li> Works fine for my needs.  I like that it&#x27;s small and compact.  Easy to pack for a trip if i need to.  Some are too big.  So far it&#x27;s lasted longer than others.</li>
            <li> This is the first nose and ear trimmer I have bought, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be a useful product.  However, it works quite well and I do find it useful.</li>
            <li> This thing is useless.. It doesn&#x27;t cut it rips the hair out..  &lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the light is for...  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the batteries in this thing with no change.. it seems to  &lt;br /&gt;need to rotate faster.. it just doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these gadgets and this one works the best by far.  Smooth running and cuts well.  Light did not work right out of the box.  But from other reviews not sure that it makes a difference.  I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light anyway. And it cuts ear hair, which I am sorry to say I have to now be concerned with.  Ugh</li>
            <li> I find this extremely useful as does my wife.I bought two. We&#x27;re still on the first and the battery use is very long.</li>
            <li> Works really well for nose &amp; ear hair, however the light is useless.  You don&#x27;t need the light anyway.  Only had it about 6 weeks I hope it holds up over time.  Cleaning it with water is a real plus.  Still wish the hair was on top of my head.</li>
            <li> The nose ane ear trimmer works pretty much as advertized, however, the light is not very good, and really is not needed! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I noticed several of the high rated reviews were submitted within the first couple months of ownership.  I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for two years and I&#x27;m not impressed.  It worked o.k. but not great the first 3-4 months, but then it started losing power often and recently quit working completely.  This trimmer never had much power so it would often snag hairs (ouch!)  I&#x27;m looking for a better product and recommend you do the same, unless you want to throw your money away.</li>
            <li> I have two over ten years. One and one but not with light.It works but makes my eye run when its pulls the hair and makes me deaft when&lt;br /&gt; using it in the ear. So just go back to the good old seaser and smile.</li>
            <li> The product  The Panasonic nose trimer does not work, it hasn&#x27;t the power to cut. I can&#x27;t send it back because I threw away the shipping box and paper work. I have always recieved quality products from you in the past, and I didn&#x27;t see a need to keep anything. A lesson learned.    Theresa Denfeld</li>
            <li> This works great. I&#x27;d had my last Panasonic  trimmer for about 10 years and finally wore it out.  This one works as well.</li>
            <li> In comparison to an old Sharper Image product this one does not pull the hair or pinch in anyway.  It advertizes an ability to do straight trims like sideburns and there is no way or I cannot figure it out. The light is a pinpoint light and shines someplace different than the cutting head.  I am happy but it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s billing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with the Panasonic ER421.  This compact cutter is very effective in removing nose and ear hair and is very easy to clean.  The built-in light is helpful in identifying hair particles</li>
            <li> I have used this item before from sharper image.  I had a similar unit (probably a panasonic unit repackaged for Sharper Image because it is exactly the same item)  It worked for about a year then died.  So, here I bought another one.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...trims nasal hairs without cutting your nose.  Nothing exciting, just does the job fairly well, but not perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a good item for the price.  I used it twice and it got damaged in transit.  If the plastic sheath that covers the blades falls off and one of the blade covers bends ever so slightly inward, that&#x27;s it, the unit is history.  Panasonic should make a screw on plastic sheath to ensure it constantly protects the blade mechanism.  Once bent inward, it is near impossible to get it back to where it was new.  The blades won&#x27;t spin ever again after that.  I really like Panasonic.  I own a PV GS500 camcorder and a ES8168S shaver - both fantastic products however, this item needs improvement.</li>
            <li> quite and smooth running</li>
            <li> Finally... something that actually works and does a great job clearing out the nose and ear hair.  Light is good for checking deep up there but not essential since no one can see up there anyway.  Trims better than anything I have tried, and I have tried just about everything.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great at first, but only lasted a few short months (with minimum use) before it simply stopped working!</li>
            <li> Brought it in Feb. 2008, and its been working fine till now. I&#x27;ve used it 3/4 times till Mar 2008.  I was worried about the pulling of hair which some people mentioned, but mine didn&#x27;t do that.  oohh.. the smell of freshly cut nose hair 8-)</li>
            <li> I bought this product just for a simple nose hair trim. It worked brilliantly, as I wasn&#x27;t putting it through anything intense. Battery life so far has been great. Its water resistance which is a nice touch. The light on the device is rather pointless. If it could be disabled I&#x27;m sure it would help extend battery life.    If you&#x27;re looking for a simple trim, something to make those small undesirable hairs go away, this is the product for you. Its cheap and it works well.</li>
            <li> Having bought this trimmer, I am now wondering why I waited so long to get one.  I guess that I had thought it was only for \\&quot;gadget freaks.\\&quot;  Sometimes, it&#x27;s good to be wrong... because this little trimmer does exactly what it promises and I like the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered.  I have too many chargers to carry every time I travel.  A single AA battery is much easier, especially considering that you won&#x27;t run this trimmer for more than a few seconds at a time.</li>
            <li> Good product, better then most, still not perfect. I&#x27;ve had this one for quite some time and it starts to rust out if you don&#x27;t take it apart and dry it after cleaning it, so make sure you do that. Other then that, it is definitively better then most.</li>
            <li> This is the only electronic product I have used for hair trimming for nose. Earlier I used to use scissors. As it used to take a lot of time to trim inside nose, I moved on with this product. All you got to do is just swirl around and in matter of seconds you are done.     Since the interface of this device is round, its of good use to swirl around inside nose. But i got some hair on ear, where neither I could remove with Razor (got some skin chipped couple of times) nor with this device (doesn&#x27;t reach the hair on edges). This product cannot help remove hair {on} (edges of) ear, may be it could clear hair {in} the ear. But in contrast to nose, many may have more hair on the ear rather than in the ear.    My usage is limited to once / twice in a month. I felt lot of &#x27;ouch&#x27; after 15-20 uses. Having battery fully charged might help to some extent, but seriously you would roll into tears after a while (# of uses).     With this product causing more pain, I am back to scissors (bought about 3 years ago and still works like charm). But the sad thing is Panasonic ER421kc didn&#x27;t last strong for more than 20 uses.</li>
            <li> Had a Remington which only lasted so long, then did some research and the Panasonic ER421KC came out on top.  The Remington was slow by comparison to the Panasonic.  The Panasonic does not pull as you&#x27;re not aware of it&#x27;s cutting the nose hairs.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I intend to buy another one and Amazon has the lowest price.  Highly recommended to anyone who has to trim very often like myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to reviewers who complain about the light.  The light is very useful.  After you&#x27;ve trimmed your nostrils, you shine the light in there to check the results.  That&#x27;s great, period.  Why would anyone not like that feature?  The trimmer function itself is just fine.  Yes, it occasionally pulls, but so do all trimmers.  Panasonic also sells replacement blades, so that is good.  All in all, a great buy.  Seems to eat through batteries, though.  Consider getting rechargeable AAs for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works well, quiet. Easy to use. Light isn&#x27;t the best but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light and most trimmers don&#x27;t even have one, so the light is somewhat useful. Overall a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> 1. Battery Issue:  We have several Panasonic nose hair trimmers. We threw out one of the older ones, because of (suspected) corrosion issues with the battery contacts. We then ordered a new one (ER421KC): Dead on Arrival. It would not work with several different brands of NEW AA Alkalines. Finally it did work with a SANYO NiMH. In the end I found one AA unit (among MANY AA Alkalines) that it does work with. (Note, I was THAT close to returning this PANASONIC Nose Hair Clipper ER421.)  Why do I mention this?   We also have a PANASONIC Oral Irrigator (EW DJ-10). Same problems, works fine with rechargeable NiMH AAs,   but often has problems with Alkalines. Note, they even mention \\&quot;corrosion\\&quot; issues in the manual for the Irrigator.  Panasonic should address this problem! (e.g. harder springs, sharp scraping edges for the contacts ??)  2. the Light  The light of the ER421 is useless - my perspective: It does not point into the nostril, but well sideways  3. Size and Shape  We much prefer the \\&quot;form factor\\&quot; of the older Nose Hair Trimmer, it was slim, and not so bulky.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t out to woo anybody or make them grow weak in their knees.    It&#x27;s a nose/ear hair trimmer, and it does it&#x27;s job.    It looks fine, it works fine, it has a light (which is alarmingly practical), and it actually doesn&#x27;t have too bad of a design.    It will do everybody you need it to and at a price that you can be happy with.    I would recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> I put in a tested fresh battery and switch it to on and nothing happens. Dead on arrival. It would not work right out of the box. I hate when my time is wasted on this kind of thing, I thought that Panasonic would mean quality....NOPE!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a Christmas Gift for my dad! I don&#x27;t know if it works, or not, sorry.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER421KC is not what was advertised.  Based on the Sharper Image unit I replaced when it failed (after many years of service), this unit is slow and time consuming for what should be a simple procedure-remove nose hair.  The low intensity light is of little use since it doesn&#x27;t illuminate much. The unit was easy to clean and handle. If you have alot growing on up there or in your ears look for a more \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; strength model.</li>
            <li> A simple way to get that chore done. Works fine and beats the little scissors.</li>
            <li> I have used the Panasonic Nose Trimmer ER411 for years and have been very satisfied with it.  For some reason I decided I should get a new one and ordered the ER421KC model.  It is terrible.  It has half of the power of the 411 model (it is not the battery since I used the same new battery in both), and it catches on your nose hairs.  I am returning it immediately.</li>
            <li> This thing just doesn&#x27;t do its job .  I had an earlier version of the Panasonic trimmer and it cleaned up hairs like a hurricane for years, until it broke.  This one requires meticulous attention to every eighth inch of ear, nasal opening and upper lip (mustache), and even then it requires going back over areas you&#x27;ve already done.  It reminds me of cutting the lawn with one of those old hand-pushed reel lawnmowers.  You&#x27;d turn around and discover that you needed to re-do the row you just mowed to get the many blades that resisted it. At least you built up some muscle doing that. I find myself just going for my scissors rather than taking the trouble of using this.      Who knows why they felt obligated to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; a product that was working fine.    And the addition of the stupid little headlight only one effect: using up the battery more quickly. It shines on a spot about a quarter inch from where you are trying to cut.  Which doesn&#x27;t matter because it&#x27;s not bright enough to reveal what the clipper has failed to clip.  You have to use your regular bathroom light for that.    Pff.</li>
            <li> We are senior citizens.  Hubby has no problem using it.  Easy to use and move around.  Trims neatly.  Trimming is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> This product worked great when I first started using it.  It quickly and easily removed most of the nose hairs.  After a couple of months it started to tug on the nose hairs instead of just trim them and it became a little painful.</li>
            <li> its just OK&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more or less. Mediocre in my opinion. I cannot seem to find a good powerful trimmer that will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews for this trimmer, but just had to try it out, what seemed to be panasonic&#x27;s top of the line nose hair trimmer. The unit worked well the first time I used it and then I washed the head part that contains the blade by detaching it from the main body as directed.The next day when I turned it on, it would not work , I tried shaking it and it started working . Since then its  been a regular feature of this trimmer, have to shake it to make it work.  I am returning it, the amazon customer support thinks its a loose electrical connection some where inside of it. The new one is taking forever to come to me, due to a change in supply (whatever that means)..   I will give it 3 stars coz it worked well when it did. I take away one star because of poor quality that lead to the unit failing the second day of its use. I also take away one star because the position of the light is not appropriate , it should be on the same side as the switch. The light is on the opposite side of the switch, but for comfort of use I like to keep the switch facing my face, this makes the beam of light go on the outside of my nose. Had the switch been on the same side as the light, things would have lit up better in my nose.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer works very well. The blades are very sharp so no pulling or tugging at hairs, and it has plenty of power. The light comes in handy. But don&#x27;t think it shines right up the nose the whole time you&#x27;re trimming; it does somewhat, but the main purpose of the light is to have it handy so you can turn it and check to see if you&#x27;ve missed anything. Quite possibly the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I just got this trimmer a couple of weeks ago and love it, very easy to clean and cuts great!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very similar to the one his barber shop uses. He  now uses it \\&quot;in between\\&quot; visits. I should have got this for him a long time ago but just never seemed to get around to it. To my surprise he not only welcomed receiving the trimmer, but also appears well groomed. Men do not ordinarilly like to be given\\&quot;personal\\&quot; items so I too was delighted that he welcomed it. (PS) I use the trimmer as well. Another great product that I found on Amazon.com                                         Betty B.</li>
            <li> Bought this model as an upgrade to the older panasonic model. Had to keep on replacing batteries on the older model so I threw that one out and purchased this model. I only use it for my nose and don&#x27;t use it that often but once again, I have gone through several batteries and now it will not work at all with a brand new battery. I never got it wet or dropped it. It just stopped working after about 5 months. And mind you, I don&#x27;t use it everyday so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s burnt out or anything. And don&#x27;t get me started on the light. It&#x27;s just a complete waste. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> This trimmer was good while it lasted... but it didn&#x27;t have a very long lifespan.  Yes, I checked the battery, but it simply died after only a few uses.  Nothing you can do with a dead trimmer.. it doesn&#x27;t even make a good book mark! hahaha!</li>
            <li> It works adequately, though it seems to eat batteries, and it&#x27;s not as powerful as desired.  The light is useless IMO.  Still, the trimmer does the job.</li>
            <li> It is my first hair trimmer. I really like it. Nothing special about it... it trims hair, that&#x27;s it!!! I recommand it!</li>
            <li> Great quality to cut nose hair. One thing I noticed about light is not point to inside of nose hole. It doesn&#x27;t look like adjustable.</li>
            <li> i have to say that this bad boy does the job.  i&#x27;ve had it for months mow and still no pulling of the hairs.  the only drawback is the light.  its useless.  its a simple device for a good price.  i did a good amount of research for nose trimmers and found this one.  its great.</li>
            <li> Pesky nose hairs driving you crazy?  Not to worry.  This little gizmo trims them beautifully, then washes clean.</li>
            <li> Looks well made. Looks well designed. But when you use it, it will pull often, and when it does, it hurts. I tried two of these (this and a cheaper Panasonic), both were the same. I&#x27;ve gone back to Wahl, which don&#x27;t pull ever in my experience. Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Even though the trimmer is soft and feels good to the touch in the nose and ear, it is limited in its scope of cutting some hair which is difficult access areas of the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s comfortable and feels good.</li>
            <li> I had good expectations for this product based on other reviewers, but I found it to be medicre at best.  Not real strong power.  Okay product, but I expected better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and it does a fabulous job. Just wish they would get rid of the light to save the battery.</li>
            <li> After having success for several years with another Panasonic trimmer, I opted to replace it with the newer model. The new one more than lives up to my expectations.  The rotary blade works well and trims the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have been trying out different nose hair trimmers for the better part of thirty years and this is the first trimmer that actually worked as advertised.  In just a few minutes I was able to banish ALL of the offending hairs from sight, something I have never been able to do before with any other trimmer, manual or electric, or any of the scissors I have tried.  The light is useless and silly, but who cares?  I&#x27;m finally presentable!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews, but there&#x27;s no pulling with this.  It&#x27;s easy to use, the light is useless and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> this product does what it it is supposed to do. Better than other products tried. Good value for the low price.</li>
            <li> It does a great job.  Just what I was looking for.  Pretty pain free thus far, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> My spouse loves this! Says they are the best he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these trimmers in the past year.  Both have lacked durability.  Don&#x27;t dare drop it or the housing of the blades with easily break.  This is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works great. Cheap. Does The Nasty Job...    Nothing else to say.    I needed to replace the one that I had which was not as good but also did the job. I dropped the top piece in my bathroom sink drain and couldn&#x27;t get it out. Excuse to buy a new one...    Bought one for a friend when I got mine who I&#x27;ve been sympathetically been after for years to get something to deal with his hairy ears and divining rod nasal hairs.    Halleyulah.</li>
            <li> Upon turning on the nose and ear trimmer one is transported to a heavenly plane.  A plane void of unwanted nose and ear growth that is effortlessly removed with this trimmer.  I&#x27;m no longer pointed at by young children or teased by woman.  My proboscis remains as well groomed as any 18th green.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt of this product, I was overwhelmed by how well it worked.  The only thing that I think was wasted on it was the light.  It may have  been used as a selling point but it doesn&#x27;t help the product any. This product worked much better than I had expected!</li>
            <li> I use on a regular basis.  It does what it says, I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because of the following opportunities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.  The plastic feels flimsy and I think it will break if I drop it on my tile bathroom floor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) it has a light on it that does not shine anywhere close to where it trims.  I can&#x27;t imagine what the designers were thinking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a much better value than my old sharper image one, I just hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/5/10 - Still going strong.  Changing review to 5 stars.  Puts the Sharper image one to shame.  I still don&#x27;t get the light...</li>
            <li> It worked well for about 15 months then died. New batteries didn&#x27;t help. It just decided to quit working one day. I bought it because I bought it because I hoped the quality would be better then the cheap ones. But the cheap one I bought for 10 bucks 4 years ago still works.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t think it worked too well.</li>
            <li> 2 units, both DOA. The first one started to work for about 5 seconds. The second, not at all. Tried different batteries, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Amazon for an easy return process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered another model and it is working perfectly.</li>
            <li> I received one of these as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago.  It worked great for almost a year and then the blades would turn very weakly.  It would barely trim anything.  I thought it was the battery, but, I would put in a new one and I would get the same result.  It would finally get so weak that it would pull my nose hair.  I eventually bought another one.  I guess I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson the first time.  It worked great for the first 6 months or so and then it gradually would get weaker and weaker, subsequently pulling my nose hairs.  Changing the battery didn&#x27;t matter.  Don&#x27;t buy this unit!</li>
            <li> This little sucker does a good job for a fair price.  Trims nose, eyebrow and ear hairs.  Doesn&#x27;t pull or cut. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I heard a loud bang in the middle of the night, I was scared and not sure what it was. Thank god the nose hair trimmer has a flash light on it. So I grabed my Hk USP 40 cal, and went to investigate.  It turned out to be the neighbor taking out the trash.</li>
            <li> NOT TO TAD AN ITEM LIGHT COULD BE MORE ACCURATE</li>
            <li> My nose tickles when the hair in it becomes too long. Then I use the trimmer to cut the offending hairs. The light is useless.</li>
            <li> I had alway use Philips Norelco products, but i decided to give a try on this Panasonic trimmer&lt;br /&gt;It was a bad desicion, a waste of money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the light, come on, the light is useles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also my trimmer stop working in 3 months, just after 4 uses&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it need battery, becouse it start working, but after 2 seconds the motor stop&lt;br /&gt;I Had change batteries, but it seams the the problem is the motor</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Ear and Nose Hair Trimmer is great.  My old trimmer gave out on me and it always took about 7 minutes to get the job done.  This one gets the job done in about 2 minutes and does a much better job.  Only need to use it about every 3 days since it does such a great job. Going to order more next holiday to use as gifts for others.</li>
            <li> Gentleman, if I have to have a meeting with one more college professor, economist, or scientist who looks as though they don&#x27;t own a mirror--I am going to shoot myself.  Enough is enough!  Get this unit and trim your incredibly unattractive nose and ear hair.  Honestly!  And while your at it, get something to trim your darn eye brows.  If you don&#x27;t care enough about your appearance to do it for yourself, do it as a courtesy to others.  Enough said I hope.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer, and as usual Amazon.delivered. I wrote back to tell them the trimmer stop working after two weeks and they sent me a new one, no charge. The new one seems to be working fine, so we will see. I have yet to have a negative experience dealing with amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job trimming nose hair. However, I find problens with its operation. It is difficult to turn on. There are times it doesn&#x27;t turn on until I reinsert batteries.</li>
            <li> It worked well for a couple of years but then just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Changes the batteries out but nothing.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002D5Y92 Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted]]&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine. didnt&#x27; pull at all. Really cut the hair my other brand would simply pass over.&lt;br /&gt;and it was quieter by a bit, too.&lt;br /&gt;but.. after a few days of owning it, used it twice, it simply wont run with any battery I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;The problem then is return, refund, etc.. so I think I&#x27;ll see if best buy carries the same model, just to save all that&lt;br /&gt;hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice unit, but apparently, see other reviews, there are some dependability issues.</li>
            <li> Just a quick review....I have used another trimmer for a few years now and it did not seem to cut as well any longer.  Since I was buying this as a gift for someone else, I decided to get a replacement for myself.  Overall, the trimmer does the job.  First, the good - the blades are sharp and actually cut the hair instead of pushing it to the side....but then again it is NEW.  A few bad - light is not bright enough, blades do not spin fast enough (tried a few sets of batteries).      Overall, this gets the job done and I am not sure how pleasant it should be to trim nose hair.  I probably would not buy this item again even though it was a decent price.  You can get a similar or better unit at any drug store.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well. It is not strong and the lights bugs me a little bit, but overall I&#x27;ll give it 7 out of 10. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is the only nose hair trimmer I have ever used or owned. That said, I found that it worked basically exactly as expected: I removed my visible nose hair neatly and 100% painlessly.    Installing a single battery was easy. I&#x27;ve used the trimmer several times over the last month and a half with no noticeable sign of the battery running down.    Two criticisms: first, it takes some persistence to get the last stubborn hairs. However, what the design prevents in speed and pin-point precision it makes up in safety. I have no worries at all about cutting the inside of my nose. (I have only used the trimmer on my ears.) Second, the light is mounted partway back from the tip of the business end. It&#x27;s not really useful, but it&#x27;s not really necessary.    Again, I haven&#x27;t used any other nose hair trimmer, but I can&#x27;t imagine paying any more than I paid for this one -- it does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. I have tried several brands including Wahl and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Convenient and easy to use, it reaches those for hard to trim the nose and ears.  Operates on battery, but the product is good.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002D5Y92/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked well, while the blade remained sharp, but that was only for about 90 days. I&#x27;ll look for one with a longer-lasting blade next time!</li>
            <li> nice instructions with the product. Very easy to use. The light may not be very useful, atleast I did not find any use. worked well. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> This thing really works. It does a great job and didn&#x27;t pull or hurt. The only way I knew it was working was by hearing it doing its job. It&#x27;s well worth the money. No more pulling the hairs out myself or using a razor to get to it. Remember, pay attention to your nose hair, if you don&#x27;t, others will.</li>
            <li> The trimmer just wasn&#x27;t stong enough to be effective. I was dissappointed because I have gotten a Panasonic timmer in the past for my husband and it worked pretty well. Even when he goes over the same spot a few times there is still hair left behind.</li>
            <li> I received a USED, OPENED package today from the seller.  Beware of this seller.    The item did work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I&#x27;ve used other rotary trimmers before for nose hairs.  But this one was glitchy from the start.  Even though I would run it under water to clean every time, it clogged and frequently pulled.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my son for Christmas and he loves it.  He said, \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t pull my nose hairs so I&#x27;m happy.\\&quot;  I bought it because it had good reviews and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> when i received my nose hair trimmer,I found the battery accass glued shut. I threw the piece of chinese crap in the trash can,went back to Amazon and bought an American trimmer;I should of looked before I leapted.DONT BUY CHINESE JUNK! Buy AMERICAN.By the way I had to give a 1 star,otherwise I couldn&#x27;t get it on line. NO STAR</li>
            <li> Does a good job, would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have had 5 nose hair trimmers, none worked. I purchased the Panosonic ER421KC and it really works. For the guys who resort to scissors, this is the way to go. Easy and not as noisey as the hedge clipper style trimmers.</li>
            <li> God has a cruel sense of humor.  Why else would he design so many males so that their hairs would fall out of their heads and sprout out of their ears, nose, and back? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has done the mankind a favor by inventing this much needed gizmo, though no man with any pride would admit to buying or even needing this device.  It&#x27;s doubtful that Americans would have ever invented this device.  It took the Japanese - who in their country have hair salons where women can go get their pubic hairs (yes you read that right) trimmed, styled, and colored - to do so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The device in the photo looks kinda scary - who&#x27;d enjoy shoving a mechanical device with a buzzing blade into his nose?  I finally took the plunge and bought this thing, because the errant nose hairs constantly tickled inside of my nose.  The days of shoving a pair of scissors inside of my nose is finally over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The device is very well designed, it turns out.  The tip is small and very smooth to touch, and you can actually press the tip to inside of your nose without any discomfort.  The noise and vibration is minimal, and the small spinning disc (enclosed inside the metal cage) cuts very well, with no discomfort.  The device itself is small and comfortable to hold. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;re done \\&quot;shaving\\&quot;, look at the sink below and be prepared to be surprised how much hair were shorn.  You can also use device to precisely cut an errant hair sticking out of your sideburn as well.  Great device, if you can ever get over the ticklish concept that you actually need a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> As the title says, it does the job perfectly. I didn&#x27;t find any use for its light though. In fact, i haven&#x27;t used it once to look around inside my nose. I have been using it for 6 months now and haven&#x27;t found something to complain about. Can&#x27;t comment on the ear hair trimming because i fortunately don&#x27;t have that problem *yet*. Overall, i highly recommend it to anyone looking around for armor to fight those hideous creatures showing up from inside the nose every now and then.</li>
            <li> I used to have a different trimmer but lost it during my move. So, had to get this new one. It is great to use; easy and comfortable. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Panasonic use to make a good trimmer.  No longer!</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer has a nice shape, heft and a cool rubberized surface.  It does its job well.  Unfortunately, the light is just about useless. First of all, it&#x27;s not LED, but rather a dim micro flashlight bulb. Secondly, it projects a beam about the size of a freckle.  Third, and most annoying, it doesn&#x27;t shine where you expect it (at the tip of the cutting edge).  No, its aimed an inch or two below that.  Why?  I have no idea.  But a dim, narrow beam that shines on your cheek isn&#x27;t what I had in mind when I purchased it.  So, a solid trimmer that gets the job done -- but the light is purely a marketing add on.</li>
            <li> My nosehair is not made of steel, and I&#x27;ve found this trimmer to be both ergonomic and an excellent performer. The light is an absolute gimmick: I can see nothing, at least not up my nose, with it. I had an older Panasonic that also performed well, but the blades dulled and I got tired of watery eyes from the yanking on the hairs. Nice that it can be used in wet and dry conditions too! I like the feel in my hand, kind of like a mini version of the Oral-B Triumph toothbrish series, which I also own and recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked terribly. Did not do the job. Even pinched my ear to some degree. Would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> nuff said...not that good for ears...but maybe mine just are not hairy enough yet...lol..</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased the other trimmer at another site, for $20 more that cut when you pushed the on button. This Panasonic needs to be &#x27;canned&#x27;. This one must be a fan for knats, it doesn&#x27;t trim. The light feature could be nice, if an engineer would have designed it instead of Helen Keller. I was, and am, disappointed and would find a better product in using my 4 year older trimmer with no light, or wet/dry feature. Don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
            <li> I agree that the light feature is totally useless and is probably Panasonic&#x27;s method of differentiating  a more expensive model. On the positive side it did a good job of nose and ear trimming. On the negative side, it stopped working after about 8 months. I owned a Panasonic previously and it too died after about a year. No more Panasonics.</li>
            <li> Works well but the bottom does not seal well and even the least bit of water (ie. water on the counter) seems to find itself inside.  Eventually this causes to battery to fail and the unit to stop working.</li>
            <li> It works, but even with a brand new battery in it, it takes a couple seconds to get to full power, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  The light is useless, but they all are, so that&#x27;s not really a ding.  Bottom line is that it works, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked relatively well for a few months and then just stopped operating.  I then bought the Panasonic ER-GN30-K trimmer.  It stopped operating after one use.  I have now ordered a Groom Mate manual trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t use batteries so I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it not operating.</li>
            <li> This is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m disappointed with the precision of the blades. I bought it to trim nose and ear hairs in some of us men who have them. The blades to not cut deep enough leaving stubbles in the ear. It works better for the nose. The light is not as useful as I thought it would be. It can be used to see where you point to it, but it does nothing while you actually operate the trimmer. The motor isn&#x27;t as powerful and you may think the battery is low, but it&#x27;s just how it operates. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these trimmers, one for myself and one for a friend. I received the box less than a week later with only one trimmer inside, even though an invoice clearly mentions two. I emailed Amazon to complain and was told a second one would be delivered at no extra charge. That was kind of an odd statement, considering I wouldn&#x27;t pay an extra charge for a mistake that wasn&#x27;t my fault. Anyway, I did get the second trimmer and I&#x27;m happy to say that we are both pleased with the product. It does everything Panasonic advertises it does.</li>
            <li> This little device works poorly. It takes a lot of effort to get it to clip hairs. I am quite disappointed. It&#x27;s much worse than an earlier Panasonic unit I used for 5 yrs. or so. Avoid it.</li>
            <li> Eh. Tweezers work better . But are dangerous. This does very little except cover up the sound of your vibrator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years and it works great. Recently I started spending a lot of time in another city and instead of hauling this around I bought a second one for the new place. It works just as well as the old one -- batteries last for months, it cuts well with my moderately stiff hair, and there is no pulling or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the negative reviews, I&#x27;ve seen nothing that would suggest why those problems have occurred. The two things I wonder are hair type (maybe it works better for somewhat straighter and/or firmer hair, e.g., typical brown hair?) or that products coming from some off-brand sellers are not as reliable (I usually purchase directly from Amazon instead of other sellers, unless the price differential is huge)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;d recommend to give it a try. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Does just what you would think it should and does it well.  The light is very useful but not when your trimming your hairs.</li>
            <li> I may have used this 5 times and it&#x27;s already crapped out on me.  There&#x27;s not much else to say about a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  If I take the blade off, it spins, but it won&#x27;t spin with the blade on.  Tried changing batteries, cleaning, etc. Even when it did work, it wasn&#x27;t that great.  I&#x27;ll be getting a different one.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer fits easily in the hand and is light weight. One double A battery and you are on your way. Does a good job on eyebrows as well FYI. Highly suggest buying.</li>
            <li> I bought one of those $19.95 Chinese nose and ear trimmers that were advertised on TV for a long time, the one guaranteed not to cut or hurt. It took weeks to arrive and last about 6 months. Then I bought one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is far more substantial  with a good engine and nice cutting surface. Panasonic won&#x27;t guarantee you won&#x27;t have an unpleasant cut or two (especially in the nose) but it works well and is not bad in the pain department. Does a very nice job on ears, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this thing \\&quot;wet\\&quot; yet and really can&#x27;t imagine doing so. So far this has done the job and has been everything it was advertised to be.</li>
            <li> Exactly to my expectations, &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product to use , easy to clean, does the job 100%. &lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I saw this kind of trimmer -- same basic design -- at Bed Bath and Beyond several years ago.  The would work in a very mediocre way, and then something would break or give out.  Often it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything -- I would use it and it took a long time before I saw results and it seemed to be hit and miss regarding if it cut the intended hairs or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I am overjoyed (yes I do need to get out more !) with these.  They cut well, cleanly, everything I expected from a cutter of this kind.  I have no use for the light nor do I know how it could be used other than what one poster said to examine the area after the fact, which would be a valid use for it -- my bathroom is well lighted so it&#x27;s not a factor for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works well, it works quickly, it works clearly, it will make your life more efficient, and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to go into a long detailed explanation, but I will say this:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different makes and models of nose hair trimmers and they were all junk/garbage.  The Panasonic ER421KC is a fantastic piece of grooming equipment that works perfectly and quickly.  It&#x27;s powerful, well built, and cuts clean and quickly just like it should.  I&#x27;m the kind of guy who will spend a ton of money to find the right product so that when I need to use it, it will do what it is supposed to.  Trust me when I say this is the one to get, so go for it!  Besides that, for $16, it&#x27;s a bargain in my opinion.  Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/24/2010 REVIEW UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after I posted my original review, I started having trouble with this trimmer. It started to have a really hard time picking up speed when spinning the blade and keeping up speed. I have always cleaned it meticulously after every use and even tried different kinds of lubrication and batteries but it just works very poorly. I still have it and put up with it but it&#x27;s very frustrating because it ends up pulling a lot of hairs because the RPM&#x27;s intermittently drop which causes the blade to yank the hair instead of cutting it. It&#x27;s just weak and no matter how many new batteries I put in it, it still is gutless and ineffective for the most part. I was very disappointed since as usual, I purchased the item here on Amazon after reading several positive reviews on the product. I guess you can&#x27;t win them all!&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> So it works. It cuts nose hair. The light makes it easier to see in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I only need to use it every couple weeks, and it drains the battery during that time--there&#x27;s a big difference between a fresh battery and one that&#x27;s been sitting in there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is easy, only put the battery in when you need to use it, but that&#x27;s annoying. Hence, only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed to be the only person in 500 posts that could not figure out how to replace the battery. Here goes: You twist the very bottom 1/2\\&quot; of the device and bingo it opens up to a single AA battery. The light is critical - it shows you where to cut; however, you don&#x27;t use it _while_ you cut. Still, by knowing exactly where the hairs are, you target them one by one instead of reaming out your entire nose. When you drag the device, you pull hairs instead of cutting them. However, the recent price is too high.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. Without it, I could never see all those hairs up there. Only problems are that the battery last for about 10 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t cut hair, and it broke after a few months. Other than that, this is well worth the exorbitant price.     Go Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This works fine.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the batteries last a decent amount of time.  Perhaps my nostrils are abnormal, but I found the light useless.  It doesn&#x27;t really point up.  Maybe it&#x27;s for surveying the region before use.  The cap falls off too easily and is easy to lose due to its transparent color and small size.  The whole unit seems unnecessarily large but it doesn&#x27;t effect its use.</li>
            <li> didnt work very well for me cutting nose hair. i do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After having a cheapo Wahl nose trimmer for a few years I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to this Panasonic with it&#x27;s much touted \\&quot;headlight\\&quot;.  As a nose hair trimmer it seems to do a marginally better job than the Wahl, but I found the light difficult to aim and it was so dim I had to turn the room lights off in order to see the beam cast by it.  Oh well, it&#x27;s just a nose hair trimmer, not a BMW 7 series.  Can&#x27;t be too picky, right?</li>
            <li> I used this item a few times before it was stolen from my house during a burglary. I hope the thieves use it and get the horrible disease that is in my nose, those pieces of crapp</li>
            <li> I have had an older version of the Panasonic trimmer and it did not give a very close trim and it was uncomfortable to use.  The new wet dry version trims close to the skin with no irritation.  the light was a great addition to help locate hairs that would otherwise have been missed.  I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I tried two no name brand nose hair trimmers which lasted for a total of around a year. Did the job, barely. I wasn&#x27;t very dissapointed when the second one broke, I decided to spend some money and buy the Turbo-Groomer. It lasted a year and a half and would sometimes not run, you would have to open it up to get it to move. It broke so I bought this. Not expensive, quiet, works very well, I&#x27;ve had it about a week so far, not sure about longevity but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought a Panasonic trimmer from Brookstones 3 years ago for $50.00, this trimmer works much better and it&#x27;s less then half the price with shipping.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is functional.  But, not enough power to be effective.  It&#x27;s painful to use.  Don&#x27;t purchase this trimmer if you don&#x27;t like being in pain.  I actually dread using this trimmer, I really need to purchase a better one.</li>
            <li> I had owned a previous Panasonic trimmer that lasted for years until the (non- ) blade got dull and it became disposable. This one cuts almost as well, although it does try to yank a hair out by its root every now and then. As others have commented, the light isn&#x27;t pointed anyplace useful to dispel the darkness in the nose. As for the ear, have you ever tried to look into your own ear canal? Overall, it appears solid, and we have used the device for a few weeks now. The little tiny clear plastic cap that covers the business end of the trimmer is ridiculously easy to lose, compared with the large cap on previous models. Still, it&#x27;s way better than other brands we tried and had to return such as the \\&quot;nose plucker\\&quot; from Sharper Image.</li>
            <li> Wish I had listened to the other reviewers who said this was junk.  Mine stopped working after only a month.</li>
            <li> This product does not provide a close trim, and it does not grab or trim hair well. After less than a year of use, we gave up on it.</li>
            <li> Works as promoted. The light however does not really help much as it does not illuminate the area you are working on. Maybe it was the one I got, but it seems that the aim is off. Otherwise, excellent.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, I bought it for the nose but was hoping it would be more effective as a precision groomer.</li>
            <li> found it did not cut well at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a very good deal, only need one AA battery if you use an alkaline one can use it for 3-5 months, very good quality and performance</li>
            <li> I only use this device for like half a minute a day but it&#x27;s already run through a new battery in 5 wks. I had the same problem with the less expensive model (ER411NC), which had stopped working after about a year.</li>
            <li> Compared to my od trimmer this is quiter, better, easier to manuver and fits great in my hand. I am not sure the light helps but it may be useful to inspect the result of your work :)</li>
            <li> Simply put, this product lacks speed. The blades don&#x27;t move fast enought. &lt;br /&gt;It seems to take for ever.</li>
            <li> Good product for the low price. Easy to use and very handy. Good product to gift. Have to use it to realize how easy it is</li>
            <li> Update: 07-13-2011. Been ordering the same model for past 5 years and same Great quality... enjoy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month and its really great. and it trims the hair instead of pulling it. It cuts hair real close to the skin wiht out pain. I am impressed by its work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;Kiran Gollamudi</li>
            <li> It does not hurt.  This was my first nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had - I had never honestly thought about trimming them before.  But when I decided I wanted to, I had no idea where to look.  This has worked well for me as a \\&quot;first nose hair trimmer,\\&quot; and I recommend it to anyone who thinks maybe there&#x27;s a little too much jungle in their nostrils.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The light is useless inside your nose.  The construction of the unit is very sturdy, though, and feels very good to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> The unit is great for nose hair and eyebrow trimming.  It is above average as a mustache trimmer however is is a bit slow for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for Christmas gifts........both were well received!</li>
            <li> IT DOES PULL YOUR HAIRS AT TIMES AND THE LIGHT SHINES EVERYWHERE BUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING.. THE UNIT SUCKS.</li>
            <li> My old Panny nose/ear trimmer died on me, so I ended up going on a shaver/trimmer spree.  I bought this one to replace the old panny trimmer.  It&#x27;s quieter than the older one, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a slower blade speed or not.  Works fine though.  The light on it is useless, I don&#x27;t really see a need for it.  In hindsight, I&#x27;d probably get one without a light just so that it&#x27;s one less thing using the battery, not that I expect the light takes that much power.</li>
            <li> Well-built, light, safe to use and does a nice job.  Nothing fancy, but it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> I misplaced my old clipper, somewhere in travels, so purchased this one. Usually, I have found electrical or mechanical devices brutal to my nose hairs, so have unsuccessfully resorted to scissors. To my surprise and relief, I find this trimmer never pulls hairs, but does a good trimming job. I really don&#x27;t like writing reviews like this, but, this time, I have to tell the truth--and there it is. If you pass by a hollow-nosed geek, say Hi!</li>
            <li> This does not do a great job trimming your hairs.  It also can be painful sometimes.  I am back to using a small pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> This is the best model of trimmers my husband has ever used and refuses to use any other brand or model.</li>
            <li> I had a panasonic nose trimmer before and I think was a better product than this one. Overall, it is ok, but I would add a cover for protecting the tip. My old trimmer had a cover.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what the manufacturer claims it does. It neatly trims both nose and ear hair. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this trimmer and would recommend it to anyone. It received 4, rather than 5, stars because I don&#x27;t see a way for a nose/ear hair trimmer to distinguish itself so far beyond its competition as to warrant a 5 star rating. That said, I would not hesitate to fully endorse this trimmer. You will not be disappointed with this purchase (and for only $14 you can&#x27;t go wrong).</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut very close. It does not cut nose or ear hair at all. It was a complete waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do nothing more nothing less..I highly recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> I had previous Panasonic trimmers, it&#x27;s essentially the same although the water proof feature is good, but the one single point of light is not really useful because it doesn&#x27;t shine on the spot it&#x27;s trimming, but outside of the nostril(on the nose).</li>
            <li> wow, the detail over such a little thing.  Look, it works great.  does the job... no complaints and a hell of a lot better than the crappy ones i got drug stores branded with the name &#x27;conair&#x27;.  those really stunk. The quality difference is night and day.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And, the light: you aren&#x27;t supposed to use the light WHILE you are using it.  It&#x27;s for inspection before and after.</li>
            <li> I have put in over 3 separate new batteries into this thing and it loses power almost after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a really old Sharper Image version I bought years ago.  This one runs more smoothly, and is stronger.  I think they Sharper Image one has a better tip design to catch and cut hair, which was why I went with 4 stars.  This one, the blade tip cover seems finer, so it is more difficult to trap the hair in the cutting blades.  Overall it works really well, and the ability to rinse with water has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if the lighted tip was worth the extra couple bucks.  Have not really used the light for anything yet.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer and I came back for another as well as one for a gift.  It does what it should do. Just enough power to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a 15+ year old Panasonic trimmer that just didn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job well over the past 5 years or so.  Yeah I know, why didn&#x27;t I buy this new trimmer 5 years ago?  Good question and I&#x27;m kicking myself now.  This one does a FAR better job of trimming the nose, ear, and even stray eyebrow hairs.  It&#x27;s also far more quiet to boot.  This trimmer DOES come with the dual edged blades that I thought only came on the higher end Panasonic trimmers by the way.  This makes a big difference in that I get a much closer trim with this one compared to my old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this trimmer is the led light.  In a word it&#x27;s pathetic.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting some high powered Cree led in there but this one not even as bright as the power light on my computer.  This is the only reason this trimmer was not rated a 5 star product by me.  I recommend just saving the extra few dollars and going with the 415SC instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7-6-13.  I&#x27;ve now had this trimmer for almost 2 years and like it less every time I use it.  My main complaint is it&#x27;s just too underpowered!  I don&#x27;t think a 1.5 volt motor has enough torque to keep going.  It&#x27;s not that my hair is too coarse for it either.  It bogs down on a brand new alkaline without even putting it to use yet.  I&#x27;d like to see a line of trimmers that use one of the newer Li-Ion 3.7 volt batteries and a more powerful motor.</li>
            <li> The facial hair clipper I had been using belonged in the Smithsonian and when I found this on Amazon I bought it. It takes care of nose hair, eyebrows, ear hair.  I think it&#x27;s great !</li>
            <li> Trims hair as expected.   It runs on a single AA battery. I found that it did not run with a wellknown battery brand.   I checked with another battery brand and it worked. I guess if the battery lead&#x27;s shape slightly even varies, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t make contact and stays dead.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it should! Trims the nose/ear hair and keeps running strong. The light is nice for checking for remaining hairs in those hard to see places.</li>
            <li> I have had about 3 or 4 nose/ear trimmers over time.    And the Panasonic is about the best for the money..    I have had 1 or 2 cheapie Norelco and other brands.  But this one works well and is quiet and easy to clean.  I totally recommend.</li>
            <li> The the on/off button does not response well, sometimes it switched on after several tries and today it died totally.</li>
            <li> I see many good reviews about this product but purchased it and am extremely unhappy.  Not sure if it&#x27;s just my unit, but it hurts enough to make my eyes water each time I use it. I don&#x27;t recommend it, and the light is useless.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here. Seems to be a run of the mill trimmer. Average material grade and construction. Price is ok. Light is nice to have. 2 year warranty is pretty nice. Seems to work okay just have not used it very much yet. Over all seems fine.</li>
            <li> Having had a panasonic trimmer in the past, I expected this to be equally as effective.....not so.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to see a video review of this product, but it does keep the nostrils and ears nice and tidy.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, trim the hair in my nose and ear.  But the light seems pointless.  I have blinded myself more than anything with that light.</li>
            <li> I had this for over a year and it did a fair job of trimming hair.  However, I dropped it once (a distance of 2-3 feet) and it landed on its trimming end, denting the fairly fragile metal prongs that shield the blades. The blades would never spin correctly again, despite my attempts to straighten the metal.  I would not recommend this unit as all it takes is one drop to put an end to it.</li>
            <li> gets the job done.  Rarely hurts.    Only reason I give it 4 stars is it originally came with the battery inside and I have no clue how to replace it.  I&#x27;ll find out soon enough but anyone that can help is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> This latest model is efficient, convenient with a stronger motor. Painless and simple way to deal with ear and nose hair as well as trim eye brows. There is a tiny light which doesn&#x27;t add much and the clear plastic top needs to be better designed. The AMAZON price makes it a value.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever nose and/or ear hair clipper.  It is gentle but thorough.  My husband and I each have one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a a previous Panasonic Trimmer I had owned.  I think they try to intice you with the \\&quot;Light\\&quot; which has no impact whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well, I have no problems with pulling. I use NiMH rechargeable batteries which might give it a bit more power than standard alkaline batteries, no sure. It;&#x27;s also very quiet. The light, however, is utterly useless. It&#x27;s too weak and and placed too far to server any purpose.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. He loved it! This is easy to use and easy to clean. Great product!</li>
            <li> Ever wonder why someone you were talking to was looking at you funny, it was probably those unsightly hairs sticking out of your nose. Well, no more! Make sure to immerse blade in alcohol before and after use to prevent mucous gland infections which can be painful.</li>
            <li> Works great for those unwanted, stray nose hairs.   Just be careful if you have your nose pierced. Funny story....  I wasn&#x27;t thinking and the nose trimmer &#x27;grabbed&#x27; my  nose stud and pulled it from the inside OUT!!!   You know that won&#x27;t ever happen again. Only have to do that once   in a lifetime. lol  I&#x27;m okay, but it was quite a surprise to say the least!  Didn&#x27;t damage the nose stud or my nose.  Just scared the heck out of me. I can laugh about it now.   Hope I got a smile out of someone out there who read this. :-)</li>
            <li> This trimmer yanks my nose hairs quite frequently and battery runs out very fast. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;m back to using scissors until I find a better trimmer than this Panasonic one.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a nose &amp; ear trimmer?  It&#x27;s either good or it&#x27;s not good.  This one is good!  Would have given it 5 stars except that the claim that the \\&quot;light\\&quot; that is a part of this is a great asset is not true.  It&#x27;s not like the light points into the ear or nostril while you&#x27;re trimming hair in those areas. The light is kind of on the side of the unit and my husband said he can&#x27;t think of ANY reason why or when it would be useful. He joked, saying that IF we were in a black out situation &amp; someone were to feel it imperative to trim their nose hair or ear hair right then and there, he guesses that after the fact, MAYBE enough light could emit from the top side of the unit to maneuver the light in order to \\&quot;see\\&quot; if any more hair is very apparent and in need of trimming.  Other than that silly scenario, he sees no reason why you&#x27;d even want the light.  Knowing it had the light which would probably be useless, I bought this for him anyway because I thought that all in all it seemed like it was well worth the price.  Some people complained that the rubber tip on other units smelled like something was burning, when in use. This doesn&#x27;t have a rubber tip so that&#x27;s not a problem. I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s easy to handle but ALMOST too small to comfortably handle for it&#x27;s purpose. Does a good enough job; does easily and quickly and neatly trim away his nose hair and ear hair so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s the most important. I think any less than 100% absolute satisfacation is that his previous one was from Brookstone &amp; cost something like $65 or $70 as I recall, many, many years ago. That one was more powerful than this one.  But, the end result is the same and this does everything it&#x27;s supposed to (excluding the &#x27;light&#x27; feature). As far as the light, wouldn&#x27;t a man use this in a well lit bathroom or a well lit ANY room anyway?  A very good product, especially for the low cost.</li>
            <li> This is cheap and it does the job.  Can&#x27;t mess up a nose trimmer I suppose, but Panasonic nailed it.  The light isn&#x27;t as useful as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s not really needed.  If you wanted to save a few dollars go with a non-lighted model.  Satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Worked one time.  Next time I went to use it, seemed the battery was dead, so I replaced it with new battery.  But still dead.  Awfully expensive for a one time use only product.</li>
            <li> The shape of the trimmer makes trimming ear hair very difficult.  As for the nose, did a good job trimming the hair but it irritated the inside of my nose after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The light is a good idea but the cutter doesn&#x27;t work that good.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this product.  The battery seems to run down immediately and misses a lot of hair in my ears.</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job of trimming nose hair, and if you don&#x27;t like the light, turn the  instrument upside down &amp; it won,t bother you.  &lt;br /&gt;I have tried one of the cheaper models which was useless. You will love this one!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband.  Purchased it based on the reviews here at amazon and he is very happy with it. The light doesn&#x27;t do much but its not like you are paying more for that feature.</li>
            <li> My husband requested this gift and he loves it.  Compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried several trimmmers, 3 of the -other panasonics,yet this is by far the smoothest and quietest I have used.</li>
            <li> The ER42KC plucked the hairs painfully out of my nose and the light shines closer to my eye than it does my nose.  I wasted $15 down the drain.  Don&#x27;t buy it...trust me.  There are others out there that are saying the same thing.  My 15 year old ER112 works 100% better than this one.</li>
            <li> This is a good nose trimmer.  Much better than the Conair.  The only drawback is it is a little difficult to cut the shorter hairs in the front of nose.  The light is good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as advertised. I&#x27;ve never had one that worked, except for hair in the ears. This is the first one that actually trims nose hair, without pulling.</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises and for the money it is hard to beat. I&#x27;ve still yet to figure out what the light is for. It&#x27;s hard to see up your nose when you&#x27;re trying to trim it.</li>
            <li> You have to try hard to make the trimmer grab all hair. It lightweight, quite and safe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about two months now, and it does a good job though it does sound kind of underpowered. I&#x27;ve never had it snag a hair or anything like that. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is one time when I was cleaning it, I dropped the conical blade tip which apparently slightly bent one of the blade fingers - enough to prevent the trimmer from turning. These blades must have a very close tolerance because it took a very thorough exaination to find which blade was bent, and even then it was so slight I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure. But after tweaking it with some needle nose pliers, it seems to actually run better than ever! In the two months I&#x27;m now on my third battery.</li>
            <li> It was a gold box item. I ordered it. No discount applied.  I quikly tried to cancel it... but I could not because it was already processed. It took less than 30 seconds.  If I return it, they will charge me 15% restocking fee.   Bye bye Amazon....</li>
            <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s target objective.  There has not been a negatives in it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This is the third (different) trimmer I have owned, and I like this one far better than the others.  It is comfortable and convenient to use.  The motor seems substantial and it operates with standard batteries.  I like the fact that you don&#x27;t need to be staring yourself in the mirror to use it.  Just use it wherever/whenever is convenient.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> My Husband says the Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer works quite well....with no possibility of cutting your nose or ear.</li>
            <li> This device tickles in the nose and can bring tears to eye if you&#x27;re not used to that feeling. But otherwise it does its job well. It can trim well if you can get the hair caught in the rotator and that is a bit of challenge.</li>
            <li> This trimmer died after one year of light use. And it didn&#x27;t do that great of a job in the first place. Don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;best selling\\&quot; reputation of this item fool you.</li>
            <li> This was my third trimmer in five years. It worked well for the first few weeks, although the light is almost worthless. I don&#x27;t need a light to find my nose and once it is in there, the light has no value.      I used the trimmer about once a week for two months.  Then, it stopped working. I would bang it on a table and it would start again. After doing this for a month, it would not start again.  I tried cleaning it several times and inserted a new battery to no avail.       It is now in a landfill.  Plan on these things being disposible. None have lasted more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> My first bad review for anything Panasonic..    THE GOOD:  It worked great, has lots of cool features.. water can&#x27;t get in, battery lasts a long time, ease of use, etc etc.    THE BAD:   Light is near worthless, take note that you can&#x27;t light and trim at the same time (it&#x27;s not pointed properly to be able to do so).  So it just stays on and you look dumb with a spot on your face in the mirror and wastes battery.  But most of all, this unit is super-cheap.  It assembles as so: the top plastic piece twists on into a groove that holds it, the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; are inside of that.  I took this thing on one trip, and and from carrying it on a plane just once, somewhere inside of my bag the tiny plastic grooves broke and now the top no longer stays on.  This was followed by me accidently dropping it ONCE into the sink, and (because the top doesn&#x27;t stay on) the inside white peice of plastic with the blades breaks in the same way.  So now none of the plastic parts stay together properly.  CHEAP!      THE LINE:  I should have known and bought something high priced--[...] bucks &#x3D; you CAN go wrong.  It&#x27;s a shame Panasonic has to compete with Wally World and lowly priced competitors so often, they really do make quality products for the most part.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked good the first 4 times. Then it got weaker and weaker. Maybe because of the light that is completely useless and absurd. Even with a new battery, it stopped after 2 sec. and caused pain pulling the hair instead of cutting. It now doesn&#x27;t work at all after a use with care. I&#x27;m really pissed off against Panasonic. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> great product.  light does little or no good.  Cuts great.</li>
            <li> This is a product that does what it promises...and more!  The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted really can handle the tough jobs, believe me: I am a tough job.  I wish you could all see a before picture of me.  Andy Rooney looked like Leonardo Dicaprio next to me (at least in terms of unwanted facial hair).  Perhaps it&#x27;s the fact that I&#x27;ve been living as a hermit for the past two years in a remote mountain region of British Colombia, Canada, but my ear and nose hair was overgrown, and as one little boy I passed in the street described it, \\&quot;bushy\\&quot;.  When I first used this product though, the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted, I became a new man--reborn, rejuvenated.  Women find me attractive--well, at least one does; I am recently engaged--and I have a new confidence that I didn&#x27;t have before.    Thanks, Panasonic    Love, Bilbo</li>
            <li> I had an eairler version of this model and it was great. This one does not trim it plucks!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does hurt!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars &#x27;cause if you go in at an angle it trims pretty good.</li>
            <li> After 6 months, the trimmer became dull and had a loud, grinding noise when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this trimmer as a present.  The first few months, it was a great trimmer.  After the first, three months, there was a high grinding noise that sounded like the blade was rubbing against the inner cap. After taking apart the inner cap, and cleaning the blade numerous times, the machine was still in the same condition.  I ordered new blades and after a couple of weeks , the same noise came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was obvious, it was time to replace the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addtion, I personally never use the attached light accessory, I think it&#x27;s a wasted feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, out of my experience, I would keep away from this model and look into other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Lost my previous ER421KC and it was pretty good - this one does a very poor job, I expected that I was used to and liked the previous one, this one cannot seem to get the hairs well at all.  Not sure what the problem is, I&#x27;ve cleaned it and looked to see if anything was out of whack but it is apparently all in order.  I think it would probably cost me more to mail it back to Panasonic than to go with a different maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy with this one - I&#x27;d advise looking somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This works ok, but not like the trimmer I had before. It says it doesn&#x27;t trim all the hairs, because it has a raised edge. This one uses a spinning blade, and the last one I used, was a real trimmer. It had two blades, that go up and down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has a light, but I don&#x27;t trim in the dark anyway. Why did they put a light on it, it drains the battery, and I can&#x27;t remove the light.</li>
            <li> Geez, I didn&#x27;t have the hairs ripped out of my nose. It works great so quiet I didn&#x27;t realize it was running. Very good Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This think broke in less than 4 months.   The blades just stopped turning, I did not drop the product or misuse it.  Tried to work problem out with Panasonic, they told me that the problem is with the blades and the blades are not covered by warranty.  They told me I could buy replacement parts for the trimmer.  They tranferred me to the parts department to buy a new blade.  I was on hold with the parts department, then when it finally rang through the line went dead.  A complete waste of time and money on my behalf.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It does exactly what it is designed to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a bright light, two mirrors, a fair amount of agility with your fingers and hands, some patience and a little time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negative with which I can agree is the usefullness of the light on the unit itself.  It really does nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The alternative is spending at least #15.00 a week at the barber shop. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m going back to good-old scissors.  For the first few weeks, it worked great.  Then it started to pull hairs.  I thought it might be the batteries, so I replaced them, but no dice.  It doesn&#x27;t exactly yank the hairs, so if you can deal with a bit of stinging, then it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer and the light is kind of cool, you could also use the light in an emergency and have some light!! Very nice and quiet also!!</li>
            <li> This is my first nose and ear hair trimmer.  I use it only for my nose and it works perfectly.  It is much better and faster than using the small scissors I had been using.    I have had no problems with any ripping out of the hairs or pinching.  The light is useless to me and actually kind of annoying as it shines in my eyes, but this is not a big enough concern to affect my final rating: 5 out of 5, a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Panasonic that always worked perfect until I needed to replace it. So, I replaced it with another Panasonic. It works but it needs more time to get things done. Always sounding like it is running on a soon to be dead battery. This is even when a brand new battery has been installed.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer work just fine, the light helps you to see inside your nose (as the doctor does), is very quiet and works without even feeling.</li>
            <li> The blade is plastic instead of metal.Does not shave as close as the older model.</li>
            <li> If you need to trim those nose hairs it does that and does it well. Easy to clean, small form factor and light works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVED it. The greatest feature he liked about it was the light component. I would definitely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> worked great at first but died within 6 months of use  no matter what we do can&#x27;t seem to get it going again</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ER421 in June 2012.  Amazon&#x27;s order processing and delivery were excellent as usual.  My use of the product has been &#x27;occasional&#x27;, perhaps once a week for light trimming, nothing heavy.  In November 2012 the unit would not work after sliding the power switch to the ON position.  One would think to replace the battery, but the battery was fine.  The unit spun after I removed the blade assembly (i.e., Block).  On closer inspection, there was no hair blocking the turning of the blade, but I cleaned per the instructions anyway.  It still did not work.  I called the Panasonic warranty department (800-332-5368) who were kind and courteous, but the Rep informed me that the blade assembly (block) was excluded from warranty.  Huh?  Nothing would pursuade her to repair the unit after 10 more minutes of discussion.  The best she could offer was for me to purchase a new block, P/N WER415K1058, at the cost of $12.18 with free shipping.  I kindly informed her that the cost of a new trimmer was only $16 at Amazon with free shipping.  No matter, she wouldn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t budge.  So I told her about the other negative reviews of the product on Amazon.com and it didn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems as I see it with this unit are:&lt;br /&gt;- The blades are too delicate.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades fail prematurely under light use (~4 months in my case).&lt;br /&gt;- Panasonic&#x27;s warranty does not cover the blades.&lt;br /&gt;- The cost to replace the blades is almost the cost of a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;- Though not discussed, the single AA battery does not last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botom Line:  Don&#x27;t buy this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Panasonic especially since your products and warranty coverage are usually good, but not in this case.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and works as promised.</li>
            <li> It tames the inner reaches of my nasal black forest like none other. Motor seemed low-speed at first but after you develop your own technique it becomes apparent as to why the designers and engineers chose that speed. Very reliable and seems to go a long time on a single battery. I like that it can be rinsed under running water and it seems that the cutting head is lubricated when it gets wet. It never pulls and it cuts very cleanly. The little nub that goes in your nostril is highly polished stainless steel and is quite comfortable. Overall it is a great little device that works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve never been cut/otherwise harmed by it, it&#x27;s fast and efficient, does its job. I don&#x27;t really see a point for the light, but whatever.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to an update to an old nose hair trimmer when I ordered this.  I was greatly disappointed by the cutting ability - or lack thereof - of this product.  I thought I must have put some bum batteries in, but even after replacing the batteries the speed was not good enough to avoid tugging on hairs.  Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, rinky-dink motor...died after 6 months and MAYBE 5 uses.  There&#x27;s a reason why you can find a million of these on auction websites.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Go for something that is well made...and seriously...what is the deal with the light on this?  Where do they think we are using this?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it works just great. The blades are sharp enough to handle thickest of em.  The blade compartment is cheap Chinese make i think, but hey, it aint gonan cost you a fortune.  Good buy, worth the price. Something may break after an year or so, but I think I&#x27;d take that!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that does the job this is it.  Close trimming, no stragglers. Light is pretty handy but takes some getting used to. Compact enough to travel which is a real plus.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use.  The built in light can be bothersome at times.  However, the device trims without ripping or pulling the hairs out.  I found the trimmer to be virtually pain free.</li>
            <li> Works very well,the light I found useless BUT NOT NEEDED worth the price.Absolutely,no pulling or cutting !!!  Michigan</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide whether to buy this trimmer or the similar [[ASIN:B000O5VKK0 Panasonic ER415]], so I bought both of them. The ER415 is very much better. The actual trimming performance seems to be nearly identical--both of them trim just fine for me (I&#x27;m not looking for a close shave inside my nostrils), but the \\&quot;light\\&quot; on this one is completely useless except as a battery drain. I assumed the light would be located inside the tip where it would actually shine where you&#x27;re getting ready to trim, but it doesn&#x27;t. The light is located down on the side of the trimmer, so the only way it could even potentially be useful is if you pointed the light into your nose and then somehow managed to aim the trimmer where you&#x27;d pointed the light. It&#x27;s a very stupid design and a completely useless feature, but there&#x27;s no way to turn it off, so the light is on and draining the battery the whole time you&#x27;re trimming.    The cap on this one is just a tiny clear plastic cup that fits right onto the metal cutting head with nothing to hold it in place, so if you keep the trimmer in a drawer with other stuff as I do you&#x27;ll be constantly fishing for the cap. The ER415 has a big cap that covers the whole end of the trimmer and clicks firmly in place. The ER415 is a much better design and much less of a battery hog.</li>
            <li> Ihavent had any problems with mine and it works great, i dont know what other people were doing and how they hurt themselves. The light is about worthless but it can go in the shower so its good for me. Spend the 17 dollars and get this.</li>
            <li> I have tried competitiors products. The Panasonic does the best job, is easy to use, and easy to clean.  The light, however, is a waste as it does not really illuminate much of anything.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for nasal hair trimming and have been using it occasionally for about two years. Battery life has been great as it&#x27;s still working fine on it&#x27;s first battery. The trimmer cuts well without pulling hairs, but the hair cutting process does produce a strong tickling sensation to the nose hairs; otherwise, perfect!</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;ve never had a nose trimmer so maybe there all the same...  I rate this one 3 stars because it does cut, but not enough to say \\&quot;I see no hairs\\&quot; There is always some hint of nose hairs, it&#x27;s not a lot and all that are left are very very short, but you can still see them. So if u think buying a trimmer will complete shave everything, this is not your choice.  The light is useless, unless u r planning on trimming in the dark</li>
            <li> Flimsy. Poorly enginnered. Broke 1st week I had it.</li>
            <li> Did not do the job like it should&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;and would not buy ever again. Truth</li>
            <li> I like it, it has a powerful motor that runs off a single battery, cuts my closer than my Remington trimmer, easy to clean</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Work Very Well!</li>
            <li> Used once - battery ran down while idle. Had to replace battery for next attempted use - did not operate.</li>
            <li> easy to use and easy to take care of.  this unit doesn&#x27;t eat batteries like some others i have used.  no recharging and plugs to get in the way.</li>
            <li> This one works well.  Just put a new battery in it and stick that baby up those hairy nostrils.  It works very well.  Could even make you go from looking like a hairy slob to a super model.</li>
            <li> It worked well until recently. Then about 2-1/2 years after purchase in November, 2011 it quit working. The switch is apparently worn out after possibly three cumulative hours of operation. That&#x27;s poor durability! Will buy another, but not a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> it has lasted a long time, cheaply made falls apart a lot does not trim to well but its cheap !</li>
            <li> With a brand new battery it works ok, goes through batteries very, very fast. the cutting head sticks a lot and sometimes needs to be taken apart two or three times each use.  It&#x27;s not dirty, well cleaned, have tried light oil, no oil, just not consistent. need to replace batteries like every two or three uses just to get it to spin. light is a joke, not useful at all unless you are trying to use in the the pitch dark and then isn&#x27;t useful. When it works, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This product was a very good buy.  It does the job quickly and efficiently and  is a great grooming aid.</li>
            <li> OUCH!! What a shame, I had a Panasonic ER115, the black one, for the past ten years and IT WORKED GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new ER421KC is so under powered. I can tell the difference just by the sound, the ER115 sounded fast the ER421KC barely hums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no power it stalls often and you have to pull the hair to get free to clean it and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no way I would ever recommend the ER421KC.</li>
            <li> Did the job as expected mice and small</li>
            <li> very practical and portable product. I used every week. It is very simple to operate. It is a very good trimmer for personal use and for a gift</li>
            <li> Works great-- it does&#x27;t pull hair, painless nose hair trim, cuts hair close but doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;nick skin. Unlike lower cost trimmers i think this one will last.</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic that was great but dropped it causing it to not work any longer, but could not find that model &amp; settled for this one. It&#x27;s like a tinker toy compared to the other one. It has zero cutting power and ability to do the job quickly and efficiently. Additionally the &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; is a sick joke given how good led lights have become. I guess if you are in total darkness it would have a little value. Sorry Panasonic... Failure.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this product thus far.  It has worked as advertised.  i&#x27;d buy this item again.</li>
            <li> It did the job while it lasted. The light is pretty much a gimmick. Not sure if I am going to replace this with the Tweezerman version. That one has mechanical mechanism. No battery and less parts that can fail.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has been using a tiny pair of scissors to trim his nose hairs.  He wanted something that does not run on batteries, because of the hassle of replacing batteries, but there is no such product that I could find.  This trimmer had much better reviews than more expensive ones even when I checked sites other than Amazon.  He has only used it once in about two weeks because it did the job perfectly and he has not needed to trim again since then; he gave the title for this post.  It takes one double A battery; obviously we can&#x27;t comment on the battery life but having to replace a battery as common as an AA battery will not be a problem. I was also glad we wouldn&#x27;t have another power cord to deal with. Incidentally he does not need to trim his ears which is why there is no comment on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but so far it works as advertised. But forget about the light feature -  its totally useless. This Panasonic product works infinitely better than the Whal unit it is replacing.</li>
            <li> Product is good and working perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband in November of 2006, and it is still going strong after over two years.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use this didn&#x27;t trim very well. Everything seems to work, but it doesn&#x27;t trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On inspection, the blade unit isn&#x27;t rising up to the top, it stays low in meta guard. Cleaning with alcohol didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the blade unit is supposed to rise up as it spins, lifting off the base rotor. This allows it to trim, while reducing the risk of cutting tissue. My guess is that with time it may fail to lift off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like replacing things every few months. It&#x27;s wasteful, not to mention annoying.</li>
            <li> This Nose and Ear Hair trimmer works very well. I have owned this item for about a month now and have no complaints whatsoever. I recommend it :D</li>
            <li> Works like it  supposed to. Not much else to say other than the light is useless which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Had a Panasonic before lasted a few years,,very impressed. Had to get another one. 2 day delivery can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Light. Comfortable. Convenient.</li>
            <li> 4/9/15. Acceptable function for trimming nose hair.  This replaced a great Sharper Image Turbo-Groomer 5.0 model that wore out and is no longer available.  It is 1/2 the size of the Turbo-Groomer 5.0. The LED light is totally USELESS - It&#x27;s only a sales gimmick; adding nothing to the utility of the tool. It does a passible job of trimming the nose hair but useless for much else, as are almost all the current marketed trimmers.  It&#x27;s probably no worse then the other models and brands; plus it&#x27;s cheap. I saved the Turbo-Groomer 5.0 for other purposes as only the nose hair trimmer went bad.  It was a nice tool. It&#x27;s too bad they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely a piece of trash. I took the blades and placed it on Panasonic ER415SC. It did work fine.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently they added extra safety features to it that made it nothing than a machine that makes noise but no action what so ever. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> As one who is always being criticized for hair growing out my nose, I hoped this would solve my problem.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well, and you use it and think you are in the clear, you find that all you did was jam the hair out of sight. Occasionally it would cut some of the hair, but to no great extent.</li>
            <li> Its a really fast and strong machine, my husband loved it</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  You can skip the lighted version as the beam of light does not really align with the area you are trimming, but the actual trimmer does clear the ear and nose of the unwanted follicles.</li>
            <li> I had the old style Panasonic and it worked well for a number of years. I replaced it with this newer model; which broke after 6 mos. The plastic trimmer head portion would not stay on. I switched to the Wahl which was less expensive and better.  The light on this is useless; unless you are camping in a dark forest.</li>
            <li> i owned this for maybe two months, had used it maybe 3 times, when i noticed that it wasn&#x27;t working.  i only use good batteries, but still, i put in a new one.  nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get a groom mate.  i just did, it works great, better than the battery operated ones, and, as a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t have a motor to can out on you.  or needing new batteries all the time.  twist and turn it yourself, and you won&#x27;t have to keep shopping for a damn nose hair trimmer.  don&#x27;t you have other things to do?  i know i do.  the groom mate is probably the fourth i will have owned.  i don&#x27;t see why i would ever need another, unless it came with a personal masseuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better. by a landslide.  check it:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> When the motor spins up to full speed this cuts nose hair well, but all too often the motor slows down and then it tugs. This is the third Panasonic nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve had (two different models) that have the same problem, even though I keep them clean the motor sometimes won&#x27;t spin up to full speed. It&#x27;s difficult to point the light in the right direction. This problem existed from day 1 -- fortunately, even after a couple of years, it doesn&#x27;t get much worse -- other designs I&#x27;ve tried (Norelco) have a different shape head cutter that doesn&#x27;t actually trim my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing it provides no irritation and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she LOVES it. The service was very quick, too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Hello,    I bought this product when I was on business visit to US. When i returned India and tried to use it, it never worked. Not once!! I felt cheated and bad. I will never buy any product made by Panasonic again.    Arvind</li>
            <li> I think this is a great little trimmer. I never had one before. Instead, I used to trim my nose and ear hair with a small scissors. But a small misstep left me wearing a band-aid in a somewhat embarrassing place. So I ordered this little puppy and it does a great job. I feel a little silly sticking it up in my nostrils, especially if my wife is around. She has a tendency to make fun of my technique, but she never complains about my grooming. My only reticence about the product is the power - sometimes I think if could use a little more. Then again, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to put a stronger unit up my nose. I&#x27;m happy to recommend this unit. If you&#x27;re a hairy guy, I highly suggest picking one up.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  Works life a charm.  Gave one to several friends, they agree.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the predecessor to this model, the 411, for several years and had great luck with it.  It&#x27;s getting old, so I upgraded to the 421, which is much quieter and cuts with ease.  Unfortunately, the 421 is useless because it leaves a considerable length of hair behind.  In fact, it leaves as much hair as I used to start with when trimming with the 411.  The blade on the 421 is recessed from the tip way too far.  I&#x27;m an engineer and studied the inside of the unit to make sure there wasn&#x27;t a manufacturing defect, and everything looked very solid and well assembled.  I cleaned up my old 411 and it&#x27;s working far better than my new 421, which is headed for the trash or a return to Amazon.  Definitely not recommended.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic RER421KC trimmer works well--better than the old trimmer it replaced.  The built-in light isn&#x27;t very practical--when you use this trimmer on nose and ear hairs, there&#x27;s no way you can see what the light illuminates. But I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Have had this trimmer for about one month. It works good, effective, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, cuts it cleanly. Gave it a 1 star reduction because it is supposed to have a light and the light one mine was inoperative on arrival. Not a big deal to me so I didn&#x27;t try to return it, just shows a bit of a lack of quality control.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer off Amazon for like 18 bucks. When I received it I was excited to use it. It doesnt pull hair at all! Its kinda scary because you think its gonna catch the inside of your nose but it didnt at all! It was quick and the added eye brow trimmers are great! I would however go to walmart and buy it for 13 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have high praise for the Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted.  I like Panasonic products to begin with but this trimmer is outstanding for its quiet operation and the light helps locate areas needing trimming.  Never before this product have I had a thorough trimming of my nose and ears hairs.  I highly recommend this product for adult males.</li>
            <li> Mine worked as well as I expected (I have no basis for comparison) until it slipped out of my hand and hit the linoleum. Hasn&#x27;t worked since. Sure it&#x27;s my fault, but can&#x27;t stuff be made to bounce or something? 5 stars, but 1 star deducted for fragility.</li>
            <li> This little device is a good size for the road and stores easily on the shelf between trips. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> How excited can you be about a nose hair trimmer?  It does its job and doesn&#x27;t grab stray hairs. Good product.</li>
            <li> When you read product descriptions your always still in doubt, at least I am.  The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, is all what was said it would do. This is the quietest trimmer I have ever used.  Trims with out pulling, not loud when trimming ears.Very easy to use, easy to clean.  I recommend this to any one who is an avid groomer. Light doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  Good buy well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product did not work properly upon receipt.  The motor appears to be frozen, and will only work sporadically if I shake the unit to free it up.  And after a few seconds of working, it will again freeze up.</li>
            <li> I bought these for two male friends who were looking for something to do their excess nasal and ear hairs.  They are very pleased with the performance and the light helps tremendously, especially when you are older and hard to see!  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Forget the light on this thing because it might as well not exist.  This is my second trimmer since these don&#x27;t last very long.  Not sure I want one to last very long because cleaning them is also not a feasible task.  Regardless, does a great job for what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is much better than other brands that I have used.  I will only use Panasonic in future.  There is no pulling or pinching.</li>
            <li> Works well, the unit doesn&#x27;t pinch nearly as much as some of the others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The light, while seemingly gimmicky, works nicely to make sure you don&#x27;t miss a spot.</li>
            <li> Bought it in March tossed it in the garbage in July. Don&#x27;t buy this, it stopped working in 4 months and in between did a poor job. Invest a few more buck and get a better model.</li>
            <li> worked OK for a while and then motor became weak - acted like battery was dead but, it was not.  Trashed it after a year or so.</li>
            <li> The cleanest shaving of nose and ear hair I&#x27;ve ever experienced; better than my much older Panasonic, and several other brands.</li>
            <li> My father is 73 years old and asked for a trimmer a couple of years ago. My husband was jealous, so I got him one last year.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs or cut skin.  Works great.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic Nose and Hair trimmer for my son and do not regret! On the contrary! We are very pleased because this product serves as a proof of excellent brand-name product!</li>
            <li> The light, presented as a great marketing feature,is useless except if you intend to use it to check the time on your watch during the night, while you&#x27;re in bed.  Performance is worse than most other similar, much cheaper trimmers with no great sounding brand names to entice you. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  First time I&#x27;ve ever tried anything like this and it&#x27;s just great!    Rich (rich584)</li>
            <li> it was great product. work really well!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this newer model has replaced their old model and is not as good. It easily jams and needs to be taken apart. Very frustrating.   A better choice is Groom Mate. Yes it is a manual twist but believe it or not, it really works. Much better than the electric Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This thing worked for about 10 minutes. Literally just stopped. Changed batteries, on-off, waiting, on-off. NOTHING. It simply died. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Bought this new Panasonic to replace same model older one that finally expired after many years of use. Works wonderfully exactly as described in product description. Recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay the extra for the light.  It is barely visible (less than 1/8th candle power?) and is aimed parallel to the cutter so you can&#x27;t see what your doing as you trim nose hairs.  I got it because I had the previous model which worked much better than this one until the battery died after many years.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair well but the light is sort of dumb and the battery life leaves a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> I have to give this at least two stars since they work well, but don&#x27;t last long at all.  I bought the first one at a drugstore in WI, then bought 3 more since 2010 on Amazon, now the one I have has died and I ordered another, but this time I ordered a higher end one that cost a whole $20+.  So this is my fifth one in less than 10 years.  This does not speak well for the quality of Panasonic&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it won&#x27;t turn on and you have to take out battery, shake it and hope it turns on.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for worn out item</li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic trimmer for 15 years with no problems until the motor brushes self destructed. I ordered this Panasonic ER421KC model. Must admit that I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the directions that state use AA LR6 battery. Silly me, I assumed that any standard AA battery would work. The negative side of the LR6 has a larger diameter than ordinary batteries. You need the larger diameter to make proper contact. Why can&#x27;t they make it easier for us? Either my 15 year old unit was designed differently or I happen to use the LR6 without realizing it. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim. Yes, I have un-wanted nose and ear hair. I received it on time and in one piece... or so I thought. After installing the battery, nothing. It seems that my unit was defective. I decided to try and fix it myself. One loose wire in the housing was all that was wrong. It works OK now but its not that great a design. It left my wanting.</li>
            <li> This product is one of our favorites.  Easy to use with no chance of cutting yourself.  My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and it is safe for him to use.</li>
            <li> The light is useless.</li>
            <li> crap. owned for several years. howard stern recommended this. very light use. upon startup always acted like the battery was dead. now, the blades are stuck to the cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for probably 2 years now, and never much cared for it.  I suppose it gets the job done but it always seems like the battery is about to die, even with a brand new one in it.  It tends to pull hairs out somewhat too rather than just cut them like it ought to.  The light is a joke, since it&#x27;s aimed directly down the barrel (though to be fair, all trimmers seem to do this - don&#x27;t ask me why they don&#x27;t aim off to the side so you can see what you&#x27;re doing while using it).  Anyway something that should be a no brainer product is just poorly executed.  Find better.</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever had.I am highly satisfied. I recomend to everyone to use this product, it is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> These other reviewers were right!  I should have listened to them!  This trimmer&#x27;s motor is so weak, that half your nose hairs are yanked out rather than cut off!  This trimmer will bring tears to your eyes!!!  The trimmer&#x27;s light is weak and rather pointless since you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s shining anyway!  Don&#x27;t buy this!  Run away, now!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nose/ear hair trimmer, and it does what it says. I don&#x27;t understand the light attachment. But I was expecting the motor to have more power considering it&#x27;s an AA battery powering it. It does pick at my hairs from time to time instead of just cutting them, but it definitely beats plucking each one the old school way!</li>
            <li> It looks good. But there is a little noisy when it is working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new, but it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m in China. So I can&#x27;t do anything but throw it away.</li>
            <li> Have had this for about 2 years with no problems. If it starts running slow as some claim, 1st the basics. Make sure the battery is good. But the problem is most likely that it just needs a cleaning. The top twists off easily for very easy and effective cleaning. Once clean it&#x27;s back to normal. I would pay twice this much for this trimmer. If and when I ever need to, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Broke after only a few uses. It actually deserves zero stars,&lt;br /&gt;but zero stars is not an option on this rating website.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son for Christmas and he loves it.  Have had a Panasonic myself for years and it still works well.</li>
            <li> This is the second I have bought this item within the last year.  I recognize that they are not expensive.  The first one last several months; the second lasted three weeks.  Panasonic will do nothing unless I pay $50 for them to \\&quot;check it out.\\&quot;  That is absurd for an $17 item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what is better, but this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> HAd this about 4 weeks and no problems so far.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it/run over it with a car/fished it out of the toilet, so I can&#x27;t vouch for its durability.  The light is completely useless, unless you need an emergency trim during a blackout.  The cheaper Panasonic is probably just as good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Final word to potential purchasers - nose hair stubble is a completely new experience.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great the first few times.  Then it got weaker and weaker.  Even with a new battery, it constantly stops and causes pain sometimes pulling the hair instead of cutting.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  Really.   (also the light is useless)</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Easy to clean.  Light is helpful.</li>
            <li> I used the Panasonic ER421KC twice on my nose and ears. It pulls and hurts - not as bad as tweezers - but not fun. The little LED light is a joke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I dropped it on a tile floor from 3 feet this morning and apparently dented the metal tip. The dent is almost imperceptible, but it was enough to keep the internal blade from spinning. Panasonic wants $10.11 plus shipping to replace the tip. I can buy the Wahl trimmer for 10 bucks, so I guess I&#x27;ll do that instead. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have a couple of trimmers on their last leg so I bought this one especially as I thought the light is a great idea... well the light is sort of a joke.. not very bright as it is just a tiny little bulb.. reading reviews and seeing the picture the impression I got was that it has a round circular light at the base of cutter head with broader beam light.. not so.. not all that useful.. you can \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; look inside your nostril but rather tricky to point the tiny bulb light in the right direction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the trimmer itself is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far... it feels very well made and substantial in my hand.. it makes trimming my nose hair somewhat of pleasure.. and less of a chore.</li>
            <li> I think this trimmer is much better than most of the more expensive ones.  The light is useless but looks cool.  I would recommend buying this at this great price.</li>
            <li> This is nothing to \\&quot;write home about\\&quot; It works ok, but not really any better than the $5 cheapo model from just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> died after a few times</li>
            <li> The product is defective and I want my money back---did not function with batteries and is not working anyway whatsoever</li>
            <li> I purchased this when the older model that I had used for years to trim off my unsightly nose hairs finally stopped working.  This works just as well, but has a nicer shape.  It also sports a built-in light, which the older model didn&#x27;t, but I haven&#x27;t found that useful yet.</li>
            <li> After looking at, buying and returning, several other trimmers, I spent a long time shopping,&lt;br /&gt;and examining this one. Since this brand was Panasonic, and sold by Amazon, I put a lot of trust&lt;br /&gt;in the Brand. It paid off - at last, a Trimmer that works satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;cicroll</li>
            <li> I bought this same item about 2 years ago from Amazon. They worked great then one day just died. I just reordered and the new ones do not work! I understand defective products but Amazon will not even send a replacement for defective items. I just reordered. Hope they work!</li>
            <li> Blades are not that sharp, it will yank a hair out once in a while. You get what you pay for. Worth keeping in the car or desk at work for nose hair emergencies, if there is such a thing.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for only a few weeks. After that, the power was very weak, so we changed the batteries. Again, it only worked a few weeks before the power weakened significantly. We tried adjusting the battery strip to more tightly grasp the battery, but it still failed. After replacing the batteries twice in less than 3 months, the product stopped working completely. Do not purchase this product. Search elsewhere!</li>
            <li> What a personal hygiene and appearance tool!  As soon as I received it I used it. I was amazed that it didn&#x27;t pull my nose or ear hairs even though I was prepared for that.  It just didn&#x27;t happen.  Now, in addition I use it to quickly tame the occasional unruly mustache hair that won&#x27;t behave. I&#x27;m definitely happy with it and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> The ER421Kc does a great job of trimming unwanted hair from the nose, ears, etc.  The light, however, does not point where the tools cuts and is worthless unless perhaps you have a nostril the size of a chimpanzee.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 4 different types/brands of similar trimmers to use specifically for trimming my nose hairs. All have been worthless except for this one. This trimmer is a pleasure to use because you can continually hear when it cuts a hair, giving you satisfaction :-) , and it really does cut the hair. I highly recommend it for trimming nose hair. It&#x27;s never hurt me - I don&#x27;t feel a thing. I haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else because I haven&#x27;t needed it for other trimming purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this thing ! so do my barber customers.The light really helps and boy does the sucker cut !</li>
            <li> Useless.  The battery door would have to be twisted to the open position for it to work.  I have to hold the end on when I use it.  Has little power and have tried multiple batteries.  Time to look for another one.  Waist of time.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t impress me. you have to go over same spot to get any satisfaction to many times.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Does the job.  The light is useless though.  But that&#x27;s ok.  You can feel the device snipping your nose hair. I don&#x27;t use for ear trimming so I  don&#x27;t know how well it works for that.</li>
            <li> I got this last month when my Sharper Image nose hair trimmer dropped on my floor and broke.  I must say, I bought this trimmer due that it was only 15 bucks and figured - why not? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and this trimmer is great.  i would highly recommend but am still wondering - what is the light for?</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. The best I have ever used and I am hard to please. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everytime I used it I think the battery is dead - but they are not.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month now - so far so good. Comfortable, useful. The light is useless though.</li>
            <li> Light, well balanced, trims hairs easily without pinching nose.  Best one I&#x27;ve had of all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nose hair trimmer for almost a year and a half now and I have no complaints. I haven&#x27;t had the necessity to use it as an ear hair trimmer but it works wonderfully for the nose. The light is almost useless for me but I am fine just using the light in the bathroom to take care of any hairs that poke out of my nose. If you&#x27;re looking for a simple nose hair trimmer for a good price this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a very high class item for a low cost, im impressed. the light on it really helps pick out the small ferns when youve already picked off the trees.</li>
            <li> I ordered the nose groomer because we had a previous one that worked great, also from Panasonic. Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work at all!!! I ran out of time to send it back and now am stuck with it and out of $20.00. This is the first bad item I have ever received from Amazon. This product doesn&#x27;t cut anything and seems to be broken. Will go to a store next time to buy an item like this.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a $4 trimmer I picked up at a walmart/target/cvs... 5+ years ago.  That el cheapo was much better at actually grooming than this unit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t arrive in working condition.  Panasonic&#x27;s customer service was incredibly rude, and they have an annoying &#x27;voice recognition&#x27; system up front that doesn&#x27;t work very well, and there is no work around.</li>
            <li> very disappointed  Panasonic is usually very reliable   has to send unit back  did not work at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for over a year now.  I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s so my nose hair hasn&#x27;t reached kudzu vine levels.    The overall quality of the trimmer is very good.  I was worried about this thing yanking my nose hairs and giving me watery eyes after reading several reviews from other trimmers.  That hasn&#x27;t happened except if the batteries are running low and I&#x27;ve been lazy about changing them.  Even then, the yanking is only a minor annoyance and not anything painful.    The light is a little gimmicky.  It&#x27;s kind of awkward when it comes to aiming it and would have been better off if it was left out of the design.  It&#x27;s a needless waste on battery life since it stays on the whole time you&#x27;re using the trimmer (no separate on/off button).  You&#x27;d be better off using a mini-mag light or one of those little LED jobbies if you need a light.     On a somewhat unrelated note...  I have a few rogue eyebrow hairs that get ridiculously long and this trimmer has been great with chopping those down to normal length.  I could use one of my several hair clippers but I prefer to use this because if I have an accident I won&#x27;t end up looking like a drunk college kid who passed out at a frat party and woke up with no eyebrows.  With this trimmer, I simply brush the rogue hairs upward and press the trimmer against them.    If I had to do it all over again, I would buy this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on the nose hairs.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great, it cuts the hair in your ears and nose with out pulling and enough power to get it all.</li>
            <li> First time using one of these. So I don&#x27;t know if your nostrils should hurt for a few days after. I&#x27;m assuming its from the newly cut hairs. No Big Deal. I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> I was not so impressed with this product.  It really didn&#x27;t work.  So I bought a different brand at another store in the mall!</li>
            <li> Excellent ear hair trimmer; end cutter feature especially good for outer hair growth; built-in light not useful but harmless; also bought some for others who also like it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. The light is useless because it does not shine where you need it and the top is falling apart pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Went to the barber the other day and he didn&#x27;t have to trim my ears. That is my definition of excellence.</li>
            <li> The product is good, I thought the light would help, not really. If you use the product every two weekks, the hairs are gone with little notice. Overall, Great product, light should be in the middle of the trimmer that outside the casing of the unit.</li>
            <li> Did not hold up very well with minimal use.</li>
            <li> I have tried to replace my old Panasonic 411 trimmer for years now since I could not find the replacement cutting blade.  Two from the local stores were just not as good.  At the price of the ER 421 I can just get a new one when the blade wears out after 4 or 5 years.  The light doesn&#x27;t do much but the product performs just as well as the old 411.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was gentle and worked well on my small nose. I loved the fact that it was wet/dry.  The light was not a really useful tool. Disappointingly, the trimmer died after less than 2 years. My previous model lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> This thing is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its waterproof so its perfect if u want to groom while showering.&lt;br /&gt;AA batteries are common n cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The light it has helps make sure you dont miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel it&#x27;s well made &amp; durable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had his trimmer for over 3 yrs and I never had a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t lose with this trimmer  :)</li>
            <li> I purchased Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer in May of 2012 about six months ago and I have used it probably ten times so far, (I don&#x27;t have much hair) so I don&#x27;t know the durability of the Item, so far it works Great. Once in a while after using I clean the Tiny Blades with a Q-Tip, specially the cavity where the blades rest, after few uses it can get very dirty and I can tell by the sound the Trimmer makes. I like the fact it only needs one AA Battery, how Great is That ...mine still Works! ...Thank You D.D.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really powerful, doesn&#x27;t do a great job, and the light...well the light is absolutely worthless. The light &amp;#34;never&amp;#34; shines where it will do any good. It&#x27;s angled so that there is no way to make it point where you are &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s heavy, works, but is not fast. There really is no reason to have the light on this unit. It&#x27;s not bright enough to see anything anyway.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a fair price. Tackles the nose, ears and eye brows with no pain and does a great job.</li>
            <li> its kinda little big but work beautifuly it dose its job i like it alot i will give this product 4 star.</li>
            <li> best nose hair trimmer , are always panasonic, i always buy them, if they are lost or broken. no nicks or cuts and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a great job for my husband. He uses it in his ears and his nose. It smoothly and closely shaves the hair without pulling or tugging. I bought it for my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li> These work incredibly well. I have no trouble with these and they are relatively quiet. I don&#x27;t really see the point of the LED light, but I just ignore it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use, and trims hairs nicely. I am very happy with the product and the clean results.</li>
            <li> As with the other reviews, it simply doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very painful, frustrating and time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had an older version  and decided after 8 years to get a new one! My older version was great but this one is the best. Stop checking on the OTHER one&#x27;s...this is the ONE!</li>
            <li> this product did what it was supposed to.  After about two years the top part stared falling off and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> If your trimmer starts turning slowly, try a drop of light weight oil on the cutter head - the kind that is used on hair trimmers. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 5 years, I was ready to chuck it when it started turning slowly - even after a battery change and thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a small electric shaving brush to brush out the hair from the cutter head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these trimmers should use two AA batteries instead of one - it would give the motor more torque - preventing it from slowing down, stalling, and pulling on the nose hair (ouch!!). I might modify mine someday to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great looking and easy to use but it does not work as well as the one I had before. It does a good job just not as well as my first one.</li>
            <li> I used it four times since purchase and it no longer works. It&#x27;s Panasonic. Owned a million things from them.</li>
            <li> It worked for about 5 uses, and then it conked out totally.&lt;br /&gt;A piece of junk, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that a name brand meant something, but no.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without this. It is amazing.  I thought I had to live with&lt;br /&gt;my nose itching the rest of my life.(LOL)  This is a unique product it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The product or nose trimmer was broke when it arrived.  I had to send it to Panasconic to get it fixed and they repaired it.  The inconvenience of mailing and getting the information was time consuming.  I received a new one and it does work</li>
            <li> Power runs low pretty quickly and pulls the hairs rather than trimming them.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer off and on for the last few years. It worked ok the first few times, but then the motor began to loose it&#x27;s power to the point where it doesn&#x27;t spin at all.  I replaced the battery and it made no different.  Very weak product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift and he uses it often. it is easy to use and no concerns for pulling or tugging hair out.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the job.  The little light is useless, however.  The blade does not cut the hair off all the way, on purpose.  It is probably as good as any you will find.  I like that it is powered by an AA battery.</li>
            <li> Extremely efficient. Much better than the no names I have picked up in local stores. A little too noisy- but it doesn&#x27;t take long to finish.</li>
            <li> It worked well at first: great at trimming, easy to use, and did not hurt. Unfortunately, the motor died and it was useless after that.</li>
            <li> I use this item often and it does a great job. Every adult should own one. This is my second unit, as my wife enjoys it&#x27;s benefits also.</li>
            <li> The light is a complete waste, it pointed somewhere off in space, nowhere near where you are trimming.  Other than that it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Works with no problem.  The battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but the product works great. Otherwise, I have had no problems with this device.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but light is not directed to cutting tip.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase ! Performs great!</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a few months but will no longer power on. Will work for a few minutes if I shake it but dies soon after. Not worth the $15.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby.  He uses it for nose hair, but I also trim the hair in his ears with it.  This replaced an older Sharper Image model that has not been available for years now.  But, this one is quieter (very good while trimming inside ears), trims the hair closer to the skin, and never pulls the hairs like the old one did.  I noticed some reviewers said the light is worthless, but I definitely like having it when I&#x27;m trimming his ear hair.  It&#x27;s not a very bright light, but it would be much worse without it.  So, if your are also using for ears on your SO, get the one with the light!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does what it&#x27;s designed to do and it&#x27;s easy to use/clean.  I may be in the minority here, but the light doesn&#x27;t seem all that useful to me--just seems like it kills the battery faster.  Overall, I&#x27;m still happy with it, but wish you could switch off the light.</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well for a few months, but then died. The motor will spin if you take the \\&quot;blade\\&quot; off but then what&#x27;s the point. I&#x27;ve washed it thoroughly, replaced the batteries, etc. It just won&#x27;t work. Pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> This is worst than all the other Panasonic nose hair trimmers. PASS on this one. the led light is a joke, I don&#x27;t know how the thing stays together it&#x27;s so cheap, I got it today and it&#x27;s broke already. Really is this the best we can expect????</li>
            <li> The light is very weak.  Needs new batteries often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any, er, uh, nose-hair trimmers, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how simply and easily these worked.</li>
            <li> Works just fine. Never cut or pulled. Light is good for checking your work after the job, it does not point into your nose.</li>
            <li> Works great! There was no brush in the box like it states on the outside and I had to tap the trimmer it to get it going. Seems like that is a little idiosyncrasy of these things. Had one before and it was the same way, but I bought the same brand because it works so well. I suspect this may have been a return (the initial not working thing) and that person forgot to repack the brush. Old toothbrush works just fine!</li>
            <li> It works as well as expected, but the.great cleaned up features were a bonus. I like the lighted feature as well</li>
            <li> exactly as described, worked perfectly, great communication would recommend purchasing from this vendor if anyone is considering this type of purchase</li>
            <li> the head is too small and compared to a previous model it does not do the job. not pleased at all</li>
            <li> Works great. It has been about 2 years since I have this.&lt;br /&gt;But great only for the nose nothing else.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this gift!</li>
            <li> ER421KC Panasonic faulty. Put it in trash</li>
            <li> I got this one because my old one gave up the ghost after years of good service and the nose hair trimming head on my multitasking beard trimmer pulls more hair than it cuts. This one pulls hair every now and then so it doesn’t get a good rating nor would I recommend it or buy it again.  I’d try another brand in hopes of finding one that will cut the hairs 100% of the time. Ok this stupid rating system said I needed 15 more words so here they are.</li>
            <li> Does the job but takes a little time to do a good job. Would purchase again. Not quit as good as expected.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a short while.</li>
            <li> I have been using this from past 3 yrs and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;- No cuts to skin&lt;br /&gt;- waterproof and even after 3 yrs of use, it still cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_&lt;br /&gt;- Very low power&lt;br /&gt;- Not easy to clean</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for the discontinued Sharper Image Turbo Groomer. This is a toy by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet and lightweight, but it cuts nose hair just okay. The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is very weak and does not shine where you&#x27;re working. I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I have owned two within a year. The first one broke after I dropped it in the sink. As for the second one, after reading these reviews, I thought I had it nailed down that this was the one to buy. Not sure if I bought a lemon, but this stopped working after a couple of months (not sure why).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I am looking into another one, but I am skepticle that these niche trimmers are as durable as any standard electric shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Somebody prove me wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now, and I haven&#x27;t had any major problems with it. Just like any other shaver/trimmer, it CAN cut your skin (I&#x27;ve only had a small nick once, however). Also, it sometimes rips out hairs rather than cutting them, interrupting the twenty seconds of use with stings of pain now and then. Also, this can cause a pimple/whitehead/pus to emerge, although it&#x27;s only occoured once to me during use. Dried nasal mucus (i.e., boogers) seem to increase with the use of this product; perhaps it&#x27;s simply more noticible with shorter hairs, though. The light is absolutely worthless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;---The cheaper model likely works just as well; I&#x27;d buy it instead.---</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, but as others have said, there is some slight tugging as it trims.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best, most well designed nose trimmer on the market!  &lt;br /&gt;I had a previous trimmer but it wasn&#x27;t ideally designed for just the nose  &lt;br /&gt;as it was an &#x27;EAR and Nose&#x27; trimmer.This trimmer is perfect for getting rid  &lt;br /&gt;of unsightly nose hairs....and makes a great gift for Grandad! My only  &lt;br /&gt;complaint is: the light. It&#x27;s absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far and I&#x27;ve tried most of them including The Sharper Image. This does the job over and over again and fast. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing unnecessary is the light which really doesn&#x27;t have the proper aim, (unless I&#x27;m using it wrong) and I never do need it so the next one I buy, I won&#x27;t pay the extra for the light. Otherwise its perfect.</li>
            <li> I buy this product on amazon, and is a excelent product the light is good when you trim your nose. Is the best I buy.</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve always had it in my mind that these things would either rip out my nose hairs by the roots or shave a little skin off when shoved up my nose.  Not the case!  It works great. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t bother with this model and get the one without the light.  It&#x27;s useless.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should have looked around a bit more here at Amazon, because I would have found the same trimmer with the vacuum for the same price. I&#x27;m still looking for where those hairs went...</li>
            <li> This bad boy works like a charm.  Other trimmers I used would almost rip the hair out and caused me serious pain.  This one is really good to get rid of almost all the hair.  However, the light is useless....</li>
            <li> Works as good as the very expensive trimmers. The light doesn&#x27;t seem to aim where you are trimming, but I don&#x27;t find this to be a problem, It does an excellent job both for the nose hairs as well as the ear hairs, close and clean.I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband thinking it would help him keep up with the nose trimming so I wouldn&#x27;t have to. It works great! &lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use, and clips the hair to a decent length. It is not meant to cut close to the skin. It purposely leaves some length for the hairs to properly do their job. The reviewers complaining about this need to reread the product description. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is questionable is the light. There is really no point to it. It is at a weird angle and doesn&#x27;t really do anything to help. Since this doesn&#x27;t effect how it works for us, I don&#x27;t care. This was a worthwhile purchase, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to use, efficient.</li>
            <li> Although this unit functions as described, I find it poorly designed. The light on the unit does absolutely nothing to assist in trimming hair in the target area. The light just shines all around my nose, it&#x27;s somewhat comical! Lastly, there aren&#x27;t enough slits in the head of the unit to allow hairs to enter the cutting area adequately. I would pick another brand without a light.</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent service. first time i&#x27;ve ever used one of these and i&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Superb product! Any guy who needs a nose hair trimmer and doesn&#x27;t buy this one is going to be wishing he had! It is the best trimmer I have ever used. It is smooth as glass. Doesn&#x27;t grab or jerk or hurt at all! This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my third nose and ear hair trimmer.  It works great for a while and then has to be replaced --usually about 12 months of service.  Would love to find one that works as well . . . longer.</li>
            <li> works as advertised.  i haven&#x27;t experienced any tugging or discomfort.  possibly the only negative is that the light is more a nuisance than anything else.  it really isn&#x27;t useful beyond being an interesting feature.  but, at this price point, who am i to complain?</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something that got a lot closer to the skin -- especially for my ears, where I&#x27;m less concerned about \\&quot;filtering.\\&quot; When I&#x27;m done, my ear hairs are totally visible. I was thinking technology was further ahead than it already is.    Although it cuts well, it seems like it takes forever to get all of the hairs -- at least 5 to 10 minutes. Then, when you&#x27;re \\&quot;done\\&quot; you&#x27;ll still find yourself tugging and plucking at the remaining stalks.    The on board light is a joke despite other reviewers&#x27; claims. A powerful LED might make a difference.    I&#x27;m already looking for a different one.    By the way, this review is mainly concerned about EAR hygiene. For my nose, it works quite well.</li>
            <li> Mine died: when I took the battery cap off, the battery had leaked and I couldn&#x27;t easily get the battery out. When I went to Amazon to reorder, Amazon helpfully called my attention to the fact that I had ordered this in March 2005, almost three years ago to the day. Three years of life ain&#x27;t bad (ain&#x27;t great, either, but it may have the battery&#x27;s fault).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During its life it worked well and effectively and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended that a Sharper Image product was the best to buy.  Unable to find one, I chose this and am quite pleased with the performance and price.  Does the job, comfortable, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Better buy other .. don&#x27;t belive in users rating.  This only good for nore hair. not for the hair on ear.  Reason is simple. Its easy cut hair in nose just holding inside the nose, but for ear.. you need to chase the each hair strands with this tiny head.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad experience with this nose/ear trimmer and strongly recommend buying another brand/model.    Here&#x27;s why...  1. The spinning razor kept jamming and, at times, stopping...the only way I could get it to work when this happened was to loosen the cover/tip of the trimmer and hold it in place with my fingers while it was operating.    2.  The light was worthless, as it wasn&#x27;t positioned appropriately on the trimmer to be of any use    3. It didn&#x27;t cut hairs all that well and often pulled hairs instead    4. At times, it was hard to take off the cover/tip of the razor to clean it out or adjust the flimsy parts inside to get it to work again.     5. Ultimately, the trimmer fell apart and the razor broke off.     I threw it away and will not be buying a Panasonic grooming product in the future again.</li>
            <li> I have been using tweesers to pull the hair out of my nose for a decade. When you start to get older you get all of these weird hairs in your nose and ears. It seems durable enough to last for years. It takes several cuttings to get all the hair out of ears and nose. I breath much better thru my noise believe it or not.     Cleans easy, seems like the battery AA life will go awhile. Panasonic seems to almost always make a great product for the money, as evidenced by my wet dry shaver. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great price good service</li>
            <li> In the beginning this trimmer worked exceptionally well in my husband&#x27;s ears, but the blades dulled very quickly. He used it maybe 10 times, then it wouldn&#x27;t cut any more. We can no locate replacement blades, so now we have to buy a new one. This item is pretty prices to only use it 10 times and have to replace it!</li>
            <li> small,and efficient in its job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Christmas gift and it was a score in one! My boyfriend kept asking for one, ando delivery was quick</li>
            <li> works as promised and appears to be of better quality that previous versions I tried</li>
            <li> Just what you need to trim the jungle.</li>
            <li> The item gets so hot that almost feels like it burns.. It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost worthy of 5 stars.  The trimmer works perfectly well, and is easy to use.  The light is useless - the only way it would work would require one to be able to remove one&#x27;s nose and peer into it.  As well, it provides inadequate illumination to a very small area - anyone relying on the lamp to trim eyebrows has overweening faith and far too little good sense.  (That is, the light should NOT, in my opinion, be a deciding factor in the purchase decision.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are fairly accurate, but there are errors which require patience to unravel (as though one really requires instructions to utilize a nasal hair trimmer!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well-conceived (but for that dumb light) and works as it should.  They got the nose cap right - it&#x27;s small enough to remain intact even if dropped.  Overall dimensions and weight are appropriate, and its single-axis (straight line) tapered cylindrical shape makes it easy to manipulate efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I view it as an excellent purchase and am happy to have it.  It&#x27;s of course too early to evaluate longevity.</li>
            <li> I loved this thing while I had it. But the motor died in around a year and a half. They probably made it in China.</li>
            <li> I am mostly happy with this product but there are some issues that keep it from being excellent.   The speed of the motor is not as fast as I think it should be. This makes the cutting often seem more like pulling. Expect some watering eyes. I hoped this could be helped by adding fresh batteries but it didn&#x27;t. Overall, it is a very good product that gets the job done extremely well, but with a few tears along the way.</li>
            <li> this thing works as if the battery is always low. it stops running and i have to tap it to get it going again. being lazy, i&#x27;ve lived with it for a year, but i&#x27;ve had enough - time to find something better. the light is pretty much useless, it doesn&#x27;t shine where you are trimming.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Painless, quiet, works as advertised.  The light is worthless, but who cares.</li>
            <li> We actually use this nose and facial hair trimmer for our dog to trim in between her paw hairs. It doesn&#x27;t cut her and she actually falls asleep when we groom her paws. Would highly recommend for humans too though. Works for man and man&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years. It was great at its job and lasted a long time on a single battery. It&#x27;s a hair trimmer -- how excited can you get about it? Eventually it died and I was happy to find I could replace it with the exact same model from Amazon at a very low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, as with many other reviews posted here, the one I purchased from Amazon died completely in less than 90 days. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  I love the fact that it uses disposable batteries, and the battery will last quite a while before it runs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is the LED light.  I guess if the power goes out, it&#x27;s a handy backup flashlight?  I can&#x27;t figure out any possible geometry between this device, my hand, my nose, and my eye that will allow me to use the light for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Battery life was good, this has been easy to clean, and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs.  I have owned this since 2007 I think.</li>
            <li> Trims nose/ear hairs rather quickly and easily.  One of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever had.  The light, for me, is of no use as it seems to never point where I would need it to if I needed extra light up my nose.</li>
            <li> Not as durable and well designed as I would have wanted.  It does not give a close shave, and pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> I was not too impressed with this trimmer.  It is too bulky and does not have the cutting power that it&#x27;s size would suggest.  I went back to mu old smaller Panasonic trimmer, even though I have to unscrew the head every time in order to get it to work.  This one did not cut as well and I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my Wahl brand died. Its stops intermittently and pulls my hair instead of cut.  I never write reviews but this thing sucks.</li>
            <li> The light does not really help at all, so that&#x27;s why it lost a star. It&#x27;s just an additional drain on the battery. If I knew this I would have probably purchased a similar model without the light. With that said, I still recommend it because of the price and it works very well as a trimmer. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Needed something for the ears.  This thing was exactly what I was hoping to find.  Small, compact, works perfectly, and shaves very close with no fear of snagging the skin.  Buy it if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a nose trimmer, and wanted one with a stainless steel  blade. This one is excellent, if you only use it once!. The light is useless as far as I am concerned unless God had given me eyes on my chin. All it will do is drain the battery faster. If I can find the wire I will cut it. It should have come with an on/off switch. That might be what causes the battery to run down. I thought it was excellent, but it is going in the garbage can and I am going to buy something other than Panasonic! I bought it in 2011, and it never did run correctly. I always had to play with the end that holds the battery in to make it run, and it never did run to strong...I reread the reviews, and that is a constant complaint. Sad, Panasonic did not seem to read the reviews on their products.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Panasonic trimmer (different model) that lasted well over 5 years but only replaced because I had to tap it a few times to get the motor going.  The battery life on the previous model was great.  This ER421KC trimmer has basically stopped working.  I thought it was just the batteries but I tried three different batteries and it didn&#x27;t help.  I took off the blade portion to expose the rotating plastic rotor piece; it still would not turn on.  I can occasionally get it to come on but even when it does, it sounds like it is low on power and doesn&#x27;t have strength to really cut my nose hair.  It may just be bad luck or the overall quality of this is not great.  I will definitely not be buying this model again.  I cannot believe I&#x27;m writing a review about a nose trimmer. :)</li>
            <li> Fact of life - I&#x27;ve been trimming ears and nose for 15 years now and this bad boy was worth every penny.  I was afraid this was a \\&quot;get what you paid for\\&quot;.  My expectations were far exceeded.  Hopefully the blades don&#x27;t dull too fast.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and  advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied  with my purchase , Price was good</li>
            <li> This product does a good job with trimming nose hair, but in my opinion does not cut close enough in the ears.  It does say on the package that it will trim no closer than 1/16&amp;#34;, so it&#x27;s OK for the ears, but I get better results with an electric shaver.  It&#x27;s well made and seems like it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job on ears. You can tell when it finds a hair by the pitch change. Tickles when doing nose hair, but not much can be done about that. It doesn&#x27;t pull or grab at all.</li>
            <li> have been using it for many years now . . . still get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> The panasonic product looks good on paper, but it has already has quit working twice in the few months that I have owned it. I have to hit it on something to get it to start working again. Don&#x27;t buy this one folks.</li>
            <li> No real power. Even with brand new batteries it will regularly stall completely on a nose or ear hair. Light is useless. It serves absolutely no purpose as it does not come close to illuminating the blade area of the trimmer. I have a Panasonic shaver that I love so I figured that this would be a good bet. Wrong. It will trim your ear and nose hairs but is too much hassle to constantly having to unscrew the blade assembly to free up the motor.</li>
            <li> Work well as decribed</li>
            <li> It works but seems to be running a little slower than my other one it replaced. And yes, I put new batteries in it. It takes some getting use to when using it for your eyebrows since the head is round. It would be better if it had a exchangeable straight head.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for men who are too embarrassed to purchase on their own. It&#x27;s not only useful for the nose, but also for the ears, too.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, in great condition and I am satisfied.  I was hesitant.... Am a female with nose hair.  This does the job, no cutting, etc. of skin. Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Works great, the light is a great idea!</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great and trims close. Light helps seeing internally</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile ago and never did a review on it.  So far it&#x27;s treated me well.  It does a very good job on ear hairs and nose hairs - along w/ trimming the hair around the top of ears/sideburns.  It&#x27;s pretty cool for $16.  The lights completely useless, but who shaves in the dark?</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what my hubby wanted for Christmas (and he didn&#x27;t even know it!).  Instead of waiting every 6 weeks to have his hair stylist  &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; unwanted hair from his ears and nose, this does the trick.  The Panasonic brand is superb as we have other products by them and they work wonderful, even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 2 weeks and it seems like its the best of all possible trimmers. It&#x27;s relatively quiet and painless compared to the one I had been using --something I just got at a drugstore. It cuts closer and is easier to use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product really fets the job done. Highly recommend it. This can be used to effectively remove hair from every area, nose, ears, etc.  I strongly recommend it to everyone, men and women.</li>
            <li> This was a stocking stuffer for my husband last Christmas and he is really happy with it so I am happy too.</li>
            <li> This is the only trimmer, out of many I have tried, that cuts close enough. I have bought another to make sure I got one around for grooming if one breaks. Four star only because one did stop working only a few months after purchase.</li>
            <li> Probably worth more than one star, but the light is WORTHLESS.  I could have gone to Walmart and bought a Philips Norelco with the same type rotary cutting head for $9.97.  My order came to $21.21 for this Panasonic Nose Trimmer with shipping.  Nothing like spending twice as much as I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this model because a reviewer said the light was a nice addition.  Don&#x27;t fall out for that.  The light is WORTHLESS in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected. Within minutes of getting the package from amazon, I had installed a new battery and trimmed away every little unwanted hair. Its completely painless, fast, dirt simple. Think no more, just buy it.</li>
            <li> Was a little tentative about buying this thinking it might be more of a toy than a solid tool.  But I’m glad I bought it now.  It does what it says by cutting on the end and also along the sides.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works well, does the job and is sturdy and is well designed. I never see the use of the light that is inbuilt - but otherwise I highly recommend it. And prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> love this product &amp; use it whenever I need to!</li>
            <li> weak, inadequate, finally pitched this one and went to a Wahl which is much much better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent trimmer that wasn&#x27;t too loud to have near my ears.  This unit is *extremely* quiet - much better than the deafening beard trimmer that I was cramming into my crevices.  I (and my family) have staved off hearing loss for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction is solid, and it fits well in the hand.  The cutting mechanism is inside the round barrel at the very top of the unit.  Hair has to actually go into the top to get cut.  This means that you sometimes have to hold it perpendicularly to the target area, much like you would a bleach pen or a glue stick.  Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for doing spot work around the beard line as well, but only if the hair is already pretty short.  I&#x27;d go after the longer stuff with an unguarded beard trimmer first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user-replaceable battery is also quite handy - great with your own rechargeables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to buy five of these in case they ever go away.</li>
            <li> This worked for a couple of months, then it died.  The round head isn&#x27;t as good as the straight cutter design.  The light is worthless.  Eventually, just like my Norelco, it just stopped working.  Does anyone make a nose hair trimmer that last more than a couple of months?</li>
            <li> Works great and the light helps. would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Worked great, it lasted for years.  Until I dropped it on it&#x27;s tip.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail, but it doesn&#x27;t work so need to send back.  Had one before and it worked well, so. . .</li>
            <li> Worked well while it worked. It died after only a year. Great stocking stuffer, but I wanna find one for the hubby that works longer.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice but so far so good.  It works and it is neat.&lt;br /&gt;I am statisfied.</li>
            <li> Broke within months. Won&#x27;t buy again. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> not as good as the less expensive version of this trimmer from Panasonic without the built in light (5 stars for that one, been working for years). I find the light to be useless. I&#x27;ve used 3 other brands found on store shelves, 2 of which were much more expensive, and I discarded them all in favor of the Panasonic. Ignore the recommendation to use disposable batteries, it works much better with the Sanyo Eneloop batteries. The Panasonic recommendation is kind of funny since Panasonic owns Sanyo. One note, I&#x27;ve never tried it wet.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 18 months, and loved it the first six months or so.  Now, it seems to have lost power, or lost some sharpness on the blades, because it does not work as well.  It did not cost much, and as I said, it worked well at first, but I would think that once a week usage would not cause it to lose its life already.  I am now searching for another brand, but the reviews on all trimmers is mixed. Maybe a tough product to make?</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on January 7, 20015 and used it approximately 10 times, but it does nor work anymore. I could not achieve to the seller and do not know what I should do with this item.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesnt cut very well. Feels like its pulling instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does require a AA battery which is not included.</li>
            <li> This works OK after several passes, but seems to pluck hair out in a rather painful manner. I don&#x27;t enjoy using this thing.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair closely.  The light doesn&#x27;t focus where I thought it would, but it&#x27;s easily adjusted to see the hair that needs cutting before I cut it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t perform at all as expected.  In fact, was useless. It didn&#x27;t trim anything satisfactorily.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I was completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I love love love this thing! I purchased two, one for me and one for hubby. Im sure most women wouldn&#x27;t admit needing a trimmer, but I wanted to review the item because it does work so well. In less than a minute, my nose is trimmed. Battery lasts forever and cleaning the product is easy. This is a MUST BUY</li>
            <li> this was just what my hubsand was looking for. this is a life saver I think he like this better then the no no no they advesirite on TV.</li>
            <li> Have had it for 2 years...runs fine. Occasionally, it needs a tap especially when I replace the battery but still runs and does it job. Cleans ears and nose very well.</li>
            <li> The light is completely useless don&#x27;t pay extra for it. Trimmer worked one time and never again. Don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> The LED light on the end is just too much and usually just shines in my eyes when I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with a simple trimmer and steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> Probably used it 20 times and it no longer works. DO NOT buy it. It is JUNK. They want 3 more words--OK Really junk</li>
            <li> the light doesnt light anything up in your nose. It just shines on your face.  kinda lame.  But it works more or less ok</li>
            <li> This nose &amp; ear hair trimmer works very well.  I would buy another when needed.  This is a good product at a good price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 5 years now and it&#x27;s worked quite well. I think the blade is finally starting to wear out a little. I use it about once a month when I get a haircut, so that seems pretty durable to me (approx. 60 uses so far). It&#x27;s not perfect, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good tool to have in your shaving kit.</li>
            <li> What more do you need to know? It works painlessly and gets the job done with no fuss or muss.</li>
            <li> Works perfect - thanks.  Carl</li>
            <li> has lasted and worked well</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I wasn&#x27;t able to use it because the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; on the top doesn&#x27;t work when connected to the top.  I literally bought a broken product.  I was out of town and missed the return window by a few days.  Very disappointed that the product does not work.  Would like a refund as the product is defective.</li>
            <li> Batteries go quick.  It does not do a good job in my nose.  I bought small scissors which are better.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was everything I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 5 years now.  This nose hair trimmer works decently only when you have brand new batteries.  It quickly runs out of full power and then it tugs and pulls on your nose hairs.  I continue to use the device despite my full satisfaction with its performance.  I recommend the use of real batteries and not standard rechargeables.  Hybrid rechargeables like Eneloops would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why aren&#x27;t there corded nose hair trimmers?  I know it&#x27;s easily considered overkill for such a small device, but only constant power will address the shortfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting mechanism is a spinning dual-sided blade in the top compartment.  I don&#x27;t know what the usable life of the blade is --probably not 5 years-- but the tugging and pulling has been an issue since I got it.  The top compartment traps a fair of nose hair shavings and mucus.  Be sure to unscrew the top and clean it out frequently.  The LED light is useless: it shines where you don&#x27;t want to cut.  A \\&quot;ring of light\\&quot; at the top would have been a much better implementation for the various cutting angles required to trim your nose properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this device for ear hair trimming.  I find it easier to use the trimmer on my [[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun 7-760]] to cut my ear hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much better than the trimmer I bought 10 years ago.  It is a much better design, with the actual trimmer feeling comfortable in my nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is not really necessary though.  It&#x27;s not like a shaver where you are concerned about sideburn shape and length.  Basically once you get it in your nostril or ear you are just moving it around.  You could probably use it while driving, but it may alarm your fellow motorists that you appear to have shoved a lighted screwdriver into  your head.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am VERY dissapointed in this item. No matter what battery I use it is NEVER enough charge to make this thing run at full speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Works good for ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> This device works great and does not pinch or hurt. The sound it makes is a bit odd when hairs are cut but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this nose trimmer too much because the power is inconsistent, possibly a bad contact inside the battery compartment which I can&#x27;t improve. When it spins at the speed is should, it cuts well but thats not always the case.</li>
            <li> I had an model, it was slimmer had more power and was more efficient</li>
            <li> First one arrived and did not work. Second one works fine. Very quiet.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one that I ruined by dropping in water.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, lasts a long time, not very expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest</li>
            <li> Second one I bought. I just wore out the other one after 7 years of use. This is a nice unit. It does the job intended for it. I can recommend this as a buy if you need this type of clipper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband and he is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> There are a few different products out there but this one seemed to strike me as a good balance between convenience and cost.  It works well and seems to be very well designed from both a utility and a cleaning standpoint. After several months of use I have not had to replace the battery yet, although I think the light is only of marginal utility - or else my face is more crooked that most!</li>
            <li> Weak motor.  Worked pretty well at first but the motor and blade are less effective after a few uses (even with changing batteries) and begins to pull hairs.  It&#x27;s not a bad product and maybe ok at the price, but I will need to replace it soon.  Wish they made plugin nose trimmer with stronger motor and higher quality blade.</li>
            <li> It s doing everything that I wanted!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a year now, and this is one of the best purchases I made.&lt;br /&gt;Had this product in afghanisthan for 9 months and still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recomendation&lt;br /&gt;You still need old fashion scissors if you want perfection like me.</li>
            <li> I find this tool to be very useful. As I get older I tend to have nose and ear hair which becomes unsightly. I cut my own hair with professional barber clippers and trimmers but using the trimmers to cut nose hair is not good. The trimmers leave small cuts in the sensitive nasal membranes causing sores and discomfort. While these trimmers and designed not to cut the skin and works very well on nose and ear hair. Most importantly remove the blade cap and wash thoroughly after each use or your blades will jam cut to hair clippings which are under the cap.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product which arrived in an undamaged box. Removed it from the packaging, inserted a new battery only to discover it&#x27;s a dud! Didn&#x27;t even whimper when turned on.  My advise, buy a hand powered pair of scissors instead.</li>
            <li> I returned the product because it did not work after installing several new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The product was defective  right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2008 and it&#x27;s working great and as well today as it did seven years ago. It does a really remarkable job of painlessly removing nose hair - far better than the small scissors, etc.  I&#x27;d recommend this for any guy&#x27;s personal home hygeine kit.</li>
            <li> This is the best ear hair trimmer. Good qyality, and the best price you can get here. I love it and recommend to people.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a step up from the cheap (~$10) first trimmer I bought. It worked reasonably well the first couple of times, then stopped working. If I cleaned and oiled it (using professional-grade clipper lubricant), I could usually get a couple minutes of use before it would slow and stop again. And even when working, it didn&#x27;t have much power and tended to pull hair rather than trim it. Not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the light. It&#x27;s small and low and doesn&#x27;t seem to add any benefit. You have to go over one spot 3-4 times for it to actually work.</li>
            <li> When I look at this product as a tool, it strikes me as being very well designed for it&#x27;s purpose.  As an idea, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.  And it does what it claims to do.  But ... when I attempt to use it, it creates sensations so completely unbearable that I dread using it each time.  The device does what it&#x27;s intended to do as advertised, but the tickling sensation it creates in my nose is more than I can stand for even 2 or 3 seconds.  I reverted back to tiny cuticle scissors.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s necessarily the fault of the product, but for me, it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is a big huge disappointment for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several day I received, this device didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, I found that the button of the device, the metal spring in it cann&#x27;t contact very well with the battery!</li>
            <li> this may very well be a good product but what I find is this: (1) the item is so overpackaged as to be almost impossible to get out of the heavy plastic it comes encased in, and (2) once you finally get to the item...there is no instruction as to how to get a battery inside so you can use it. The very end comes off to clean but there is not one word about how to open it up..and there does not appear to be any place that separates. Someone should do a better job of writing instructions.I just threw this item in the trash.</li>
            <li> First, the trimmer does trim well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, one of the selling-point \\&quot;improvements\\&quot;; of this trimmer over its earlier, less expensive and more compact sister-model is that this one has a light.  But it&#x27;s goofy. The light is on the side.  When using the trimmer, whether or not inserted deeply into the nostril, the light shines into the user&#x27;s eye... NOT the nostril.  NOT at all helpful.  And the direction of thr light is not adjustable.  At one time, there was a trimmer by SHARPER IMAGE... the light was placed at the end of he trimmer and shone around the blades INTO the nostril.  Now, that was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one?  Nah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the one without the light.</li>
            <li> You can use this for Trimming Nose Hair, Ear Hair, Hair on your head and get a unique hair cut, I love it sooo much,</li>
            <li> The light is incredibly useful, it&#x27;s actually surprising. It works exactly as any product would. I usually am impressed by the build quality of most Panasonic items, but the metal tip that hides the blades on this is extremely flimsy. The slightest bit of pressure seemed to bend in the tip just slightly which stops the product from working (as the blade is closely mounted right under) The blade thankfully was not harmed but the metal tip required some handiwork to un-bend. The product works well but the tip is very flimsy, so if your not wide awake when your using this or a bit delicate in your handling of bathroom tools, I would probably look elsewhere.</li>
