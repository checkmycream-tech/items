            <li>but after i applied it i smelled the bottle, and its not the best smell .</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>As one of the reviewers said, it controls the fly away hair stay intact, which is good.</li>
            <li>From what I read about argan oil, it should smell pleasantly nutty.</li>
            <li>I will  continue to use the product and hopefully will continue to have good results.</li>
            <li>AND IT FEELS GOOD</li>
            <li>My nails are looking good</li>
            <li>we will see how good it works on MY head after chemo therapy</li>
            <li>This is a great and effective product.</li>
            <li>This is good oil, but it does not smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I bought some Argan oil for myself and gave my mother and mother-in-law some to try, and they loved it</li>
            <li>I loved using this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because of all the good reviews, and while I like what it does to my hair, it has a rancid odor.</li>
            <li>I have heard good reviews of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>This argan oil is a good product, but it is a bit thinner than I like.</li>
            <li>For those looking for a thinner oil, this would be a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>The dropper top is perfect for easy use, too.  </li>

            <li>amazing thing about Argan oil is it&#x27;s beneficial for all skin types</li>
            <li>Great quality argan oil for cheap... works just as well as josie maran argan oil.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my skin, but it works good on hair too.</li>
            <li>I already have great skin (thanks to my good genes) and bought this oil for my hair.</li>
            <li>love LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and I liked this one just as much or better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a month and, honestly, I see no improvement.  </li>
            <li>I liked even more that part of the proceeds were given to the woman who harvest the nuts.  </li>
            <li>Pure organic argan oil at a great price.  </li>
            <li>My hair does seem to have more moisture and doesn&#x27;t seem so brittle.</li>
            <li>Since this product worked, I&#x27;ve been trying to find more products with argan oil in it to help my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>I thought I had surely made a mistake.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love argan oil.</li>
            <li>The delivery of the product was excellent as I received it way earlier than it said on my dispatch email.</li>
            <li>I will buy this item again for sure.</li>
            <li>I think my hair is stronger as I&#x27;m seeing fewer stray hairs, and it seems to hold hair color better.</li>
            <li>It sunk into my skin rather than sitting on top of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I love Argan oil and since I&#x27;ve found it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>much* better product.</li>
            <li>With this I was able to drop both the medication and the moisturizer and just use the oil.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did cause I love it,before tweeting brows</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can also be used for your hair :) Just put a couple drops in your shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>many reviews.  </li>
            <li>Love this Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been complimented on my appearance many times since using this</li>
            <li>Many sellers on the market today sell diluted and unpure Argan Oil, but not this seller.</li>
            <li>Tried different ones , but this one is best for me .</li>
            <li>So I would say it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>My skin was more luminous and I had reduction in the number of blemishes and inflammation on my face.</li>
            <li>I will have to buy two more bottles-</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>I like the Argan oil better than coconut oil, as it is very light and doesnt have strong smell.</li>
            <li>ABSORBS QUICKLY AND SCENT IS NICE.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a great product that I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>Same great service, in a timely fashion, and same great product!  </li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of the Josie Maran brand from sephora and while it&#x27;s $10 more, it&#x27;s a *</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good habit to care for yourself as much as you care for others.</li>
            <li>A very good product, but if you have dry skin probably not something you want to use more than once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>This is excellent quality argan oil, without the markup of other brands.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes and helps with dryness but compared to other brands it isn&#x27;t that wonderful.</li>
            <li>skin breaks out fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It has a very very mild smell that I dont even notice.</li>
            <li>It is every bit as good as the Josie Maran high priced Argan</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced for the 100% pure oil and the dropper works great.</li>
            <li>shipment was so quick!</li>
            <li>The smell is non existent and the quality of this product is great and consistent with true pure Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>Today is 4 weeks since I started using it and it has already made a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Plus it softens callouses on the feet which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Fabulous product for hair, nails, skin</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing Josie Maran after I run out of my free bottle.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Great oil , use it as facial moistureiser .</li>
            <li>I also use this oil in my hair to help smooth the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>more evenly right</li>
            <li>This product is very effective if used daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was originally introduced to Argan oil products by a friend.</li>
            <li>Most importantly his property - the ability to make skin more supple and young, and protect against aging.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Guess I noticed the first changes at about 4 weeks, and it just kept getting better from there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li>and it is great to use when skin is dry or if you finish with a mask or peel.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll love the Argan oil as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and it keeps it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It has no bad smell.</li>
            <li>does everything it promises to do and makes me feel good applying a pure and natural substance to my skiing that causes no harm.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my other products and it works great.  </li>
            <li>and I am finding I only need about 4 drops for my entire face and neck area and my skin looks and feels real good.  </li>
            <li>I hope this long review has helped someone like me to find a true and good product.</li>
            <li>The oil is not greasy and it quickly absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife loves the product and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fairly quick.</li>
            <li>Received this product quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>my hair was so dry it sucked it up and provided a good amount of oil and shine.</li>
            <li>I have used Josie Moran&#x27;s argan oil in the past and this is just as good, but for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>I have new scars from cystic acne and this has helped fade the scars greatly after only 4 nights of use.</li>
            <li>I use it before putting make up on and wait a couple of minutes for it to set in before applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good for any dry skin and hair as well!</li>
            <li>so far i love it.</li>
            <li>But in just a few minutes, the oil absorbed completely into my skin, and I woke up to beautiful, smooth</li>
            <li>The oil is very pure and organic.  </li>
            <li>it feels great not dry or red,mixe it with your regular moisturizer and face feels so smooth,thank argan oil.</li>
            <li>This definitely pure Argan oil!</li>
            <li>I do suffer from mild acne but the real reason for the purchase of this product was to heal my acne scars, and</li>
            <li>Good, and much less pricey than the brand name argan oil</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and should be part of everyone&#x27;s beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I did order this to use exclusively on my hair, and it works really well!</li>
            <li>I tried many different moisturizers but none helped.</li>
            <li>You can definetly get away with spreading just a couple drops all over your face during the day, but I love putting a bunch on at night for extra hydration while I sleep, doesnt break me out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it does do a slightly better job on my hands than standard hand lotions.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Am well pleased that it is organic as I purchase organic when possible.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I use it from the middle to the tips and apply a bit on the top.</li>
            <li>But that goes away pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil first time, i read about it on internet.</li>
            <li>It was such a pleasant surprise for this stuff to work so well for two different purposes.</li>
            <li>This is truly a unique rejuvenating oil, almost a natural elixir of beauty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only really ever been able to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; my acne, not get rid of it all together, even with prescription medication.</li>
            <li>I have damaged brittle ends and my hair absorbed the oil really well and became shiny and much softer immediately.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product will reverse damage to my skin because  I have only used the product a few days but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever review done on any product I have brought online and the only reason I would like to review is to let other people know exactly how the product is... a true honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly and is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and keeps skin soft during winter .</li>
            <li>I found it in this Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil (30mL).</li>
            <li>I wanted pure Morroccan oil for my hair and skin and alot of the brands you see in the stores are just for hair</li>
            <li>After testing several different brands of Argan oil at different price points, I feel the Mogador 100% Pure Argan Oil is a great value.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So, a high five for this oil!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much on your face though because then you have to wait a while for it to soak in.</li>
            <li>Started to be more careful with my diet and drinking plenty of water, so I would say all of this has helped my skin.</li>
            <li>It pays to have REAL certified organic Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff and works just like its supposed to.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Appearance much improved.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very versatile product</li>
            <li>I use straight Argan oil on my face EVERY MORNING.</li>
            <li>(it arrived really fast!!)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I hope it is real argan oil, and certified.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I had was the product didn&#x27;t come with an information pamphlet or shipping label but overall a good product so far.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and just as good as the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li>I do believe it is pure argan oil, and I received all of the benefits associated with high quality oil.</li>
            <li>Really good for anyone that has serious face dryness.</li>
            <li>The oil has definitely improved my skins much, much better, it have smoothed and reduced the overall dryness.</li>
            <li>I definitely see an improvement in the overall feel and appearance of my skin and will continue to use this product as I do believe it will hopefully fade my acne scars and give me a more even toned skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular product as an add-on item</li>
            <li>I  will never stop using this brand in particular.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone to try Argan oil.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated, and even though it&#x27;s an oil,my skin does&#x27;t feel greasy but feels soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>Evidently my skin was dry since it sucked up the oil the first time I applied it.  </li>
            <li>I used it for my brittle nails and hair, so far i can see a little change for better.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs well into skin and leaves it very soft.  </li>
            <li>LITTLE GOES ALL LONG WAY, GREAT PRICE, LAST FOREVER SKIN IS SOFT AND YOUNG LOOKING.  </li>
            <li>But make sure you only use a few drops, because too much will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried, for the oil seemed to reside only on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>I find that I need to use less of it compared to Mogador, and thus the price difference is justified.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and  the product  appears to help  decrease the production of acne on my face.</li>
            <li>I am a 62 year old woman who lives in the south.</li>
            <li>Also the skin looks soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face as a moisturizer every night after applying Differin for acne and my skin is glowing and really soft.</li>
            <li>I also use this in my hair after washing and my hair is so soft when it dries.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my skin, I still have a ways to go to be cleared completely</li>
            <li>It leaves it so soft and it has even helped on my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>My hair looks alive again.</li>
            <li>I like this product thus far.</li>
            <li>Lives up to expectation.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft, and silky.  </li>
            <li>It has made my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>They have both told me that their skin soft and \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil brings out the natural beauty of skin.</li>
            <li>Replaced old cream moisturizer with this product.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this - after a month of use, there is still more than 2/3 of the bottle remaining.</li>
            <li>finally found a good facial cleanser for dry skin (something from CeraVe) and cut down on using my Clarisonic Mia to only twice a week, which helped a lot, but not enough.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why my skin did a complete 180 from what it has always been, but it is something I am totally unaccustomed to; I only know how to maintain oily skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d have to say that my complexion actually looks worse, with much more blotchiness.  </li>
            <li>I had been purchasing argan oil at a rather higher price until I searched Amazon.com looking for the same product, but for less money.  </li>
            <li>I barely use a drop over my whole face, and it still feels slightly oily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the very expensive Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>This is the REAL 100% PURE ARGAN OIL (only ingredient listed on the label); faint nutty scent (I really like the scent) and it absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing much for them, but it does help them feel less...</li>
            <li>I have used this oil on my face for little over a week, and my face has not broken out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Argan oil is also very good for skin elasticity.  </li>
            <li> This oil Argan - an ideal product for skin regeneration.</li>
            <li> up the good work!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good !</li>
            <li> It is also good for acne believe it or not!</li>
            <li> Good stuff ladies!</li>
            <li> All uses ended in beautiful luscious results</li>
            <li> Still feels great, looks great, and I am really loving the $$ I am saving!!</li>
            <li> Great product...</li>
            <li> Using a dime-sized amount on towel-dried hair and working it through, it smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> price on here is great.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Was packaged great.</li>
            <li> Totally a great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything great about using this oil.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> As one of the reviewers said, it controls the fly away hair stay intact, which is good.</li>
            <li> From what I read about argan oil, it should smell pleasantly nutty.</li>
            <li> I will  continue to use the product and hopefully will continue to have good results.</li>
            <li> AND IT FEELS GOOD</li>
            <li> My nails are looking good</li>
            <li> we will see how good it works on MY head after chemo therapy</li>
            <li> This is a great and effective product.</li>
            <li> This is good oil, but it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought some Argan oil for myself and gave my mother and mother-in-law some to try, and they loved it</li>
            <li> I loved using this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews, and while I like what it does to my hair, it has a rancid odor.</li>
            <li> I have heard good reviews of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> This argan oil is a good product, but it is a bit thinner than I like.</li>
            <li> For those looking for a thinner oil, this would be a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> The dropper top is perfect for easy use, too.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> amazing thing about Argan oil is it&#x27;s beneficial for all skin types</li>
            <li> Great quality argan oil for cheap... works just as well as josie maran argan oil.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my skin, but it works good on hair too.</li>
            <li> I already have great skin (thanks to my good genes) and bought this oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> love LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and I liked this one just as much or better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a month and, honestly, I see no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I liked even more that part of the proceeds were given to the woman who harvest the nuts.  </li>
            <li> Pure organic argan oil at a great price.  </li>
            <li> My hair does seem to have more moisture and doesn&#x27;t seem so brittle.</li>
            <li> Since this product worked, I&#x27;ve been trying to find more products with argan oil in it to help my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I had surely made a mistake.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin care products.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love argan oil.</li>
            <li> The delivery of the product was excellent as I received it way earlier than it said on my dispatch email.</li>
            <li> I will buy this item again for sure.</li>
            <li> I think my hair is stronger as I&#x27;m seeing fewer stray hairs, and it seems to hold hair color better.</li>
            <li> It sunk into my skin rather than sitting on top of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil and since I&#x27;ve found it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> much* better product.</li>
            <li> With this I was able to drop both the medication and the moisturizer and just use the oil.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did cause I love it,before tweeting brows</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can also be used for your hair :) Just put a couple drops in your shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> many reviews.  </li>
            <li> Love this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented on my appearance many times since using this</li>
            <li> Many sellers on the market today sell diluted and unpure Argan Oil, but not this seller.</li>
            <li> Tried different ones , but this one is best for me .</li>
            <li> So I would say it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> My skin was more luminous and I had reduction in the number of blemishes and inflammation on my face.</li>
            <li> I will have to buy two more bottles-</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> I like the Argan oil better than coconut oil, as it is very light and doesnt have strong smell.</li>
            <li> ABSORBS QUICKLY AND SCENT IS NICE.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a great product that I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Same great service, in a timely fashion, and same great product!  </li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of the Josie Maran brand from sephora and while it&#x27;s $10 more, it&#x27;s a *</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good habit to care for yourself as much as you care for others.</li>
            <li> A very good product, but if you have dry skin probably not something you want to use more than once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality argan oil, without the markup of other brands.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes and helps with dryness but compared to other brands it isn&#x27;t that wonderful.</li>
            <li> skin breaks out fairly easily.</li>
            <li> It has a very very mild smell that I dont even notice.</li>
            <li> It is every bit as good as the Josie Maran high priced Argan</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced for the 100% pure oil and the dropper works great.</li>
            <li> shipment was so quick!</li>
            <li> The smell is non existent and the quality of this product is great and consistent with true pure Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> Today is 4 weeks since I started using it and it has already made a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Plus it softens callouses on the feet which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for hair, nails, skin</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing Josie Maran after I run out of my free bottle.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Great oil , use it as facial moistureiser .</li>
            <li> I also use this oil in my hair to help smooth the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> more evenly right</li>
            <li> This product is very effective if used daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was originally introduced to Argan oil products by a friend.</li>
            <li> Most importantly his property - the ability to make skin more supple and young, and protect against aging.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Guess I noticed the first changes at about 4 weeks, and it just kept getting better from there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> and it is great to use when skin is dry or if you finish with a mask or peel.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll love the Argan oil as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and it keeps it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It has no bad smell.</li>
            <li> does everything it promises to do and makes me feel good applying a pure and natural substance to my skiing that causes no harm.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my other products and it works great.  </li>
            <li> and I am finding I only need about 4 drops for my entire face and neck area and my skin looks and feels real good.  </li>
            <li> I hope this long review has helped someone like me to find a true and good product.</li>
            <li> The oil is not greasy and it quickly absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Received this product quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> my hair was so dry it sucked it up and provided a good amount of oil and shine.</li>
            <li> I have used Josie Moran&#x27;s argan oil in the past and this is just as good, but for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I have new scars from cystic acne and this has helped fade the scars greatly after only 4 nights of use.</li>
            <li> I use it before putting make up on and wait a couple of minutes for it to set in before applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good for any dry skin and hair as well!</li>
            <li> so far i love it.</li>
            <li> But in just a few minutes, the oil absorbed completely into my skin, and I woke up to beautiful, smooth</li>
            <li> The oil is very pure and organic.  </li>
            <li> it feels great not dry or red,mixe it with your regular moisturizer and face feels so smooth,thank argan oil.</li>
            <li> This definitely pure Argan oil!</li>
            <li> I do suffer from mild acne but the real reason for the purchase of this product was to heal my acne scars, and</li>
            <li> Good, and much less pricey than the brand name argan oil</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and should be part of everyone&#x27;s beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I did order this to use exclusively on my hair, and it works really well!</li>
            <li> I tried many different moisturizers but none helped.</li>
            <li> You can definetly get away with spreading just a couple drops all over your face during the day, but I love putting a bunch on at night for extra hydration while I sleep, doesnt break me out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it does do a slightly better job on my hands than standard hand lotions.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Am well pleased that it is organic as I purchase organic when possible.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> I use it from the middle to the tips and apply a bit on the top.</li>
            <li> But that goes away pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil first time, i read about it on internet.</li>
            <li> It was such a pleasant surprise for this stuff to work so well for two different purposes.</li>
            <li> This is truly a unique rejuvenating oil, almost a natural elixir of beauty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only really ever been able to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; my acne, not get rid of it all together, even with prescription medication.</li>
            <li> I have damaged brittle ends and my hair absorbed the oil really well and became shiny and much softer immediately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product will reverse damage to my skin because  I have only used the product a few days but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review done on any product I have brought online and the only reason I would like to review is to let other people know exactly how the product is... a true honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly and is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and keeps skin soft during winter .</li>
            <li> I found it in this Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil (30mL).</li>
            <li> I wanted pure Morroccan oil for my hair and skin and alot of the brands you see in the stores are just for hair</li>
            <li> After testing several different brands of Argan oil at different price points, I feel the Mogador 100% Pure Argan Oil is a great value.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So, a high five for this oil!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much on your face though because then you have to wait a while for it to soak in.</li>
            <li> Started to be more careful with my diet and drinking plenty of water, so I would say all of this has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> It pays to have REAL certified organic Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff and works just like its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Appearance much improved.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very versatile product</li>
            <li> I use straight Argan oil on my face EVERY MORNING.</li>
            <li> (it arrived really fast!!)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I hope it is real argan oil, and certified.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I had was the product didn&#x27;t come with an information pamphlet or shipping label but overall a good product so far.</li>
            <li> Cheaper and just as good as the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> I do believe it is pure argan oil, and I received all of the benefits associated with high quality oil.</li>
            <li> Really good for anyone that has serious face dryness.</li>
            <li> The oil has definitely improved my skins much, much better, it have smoothed and reduced the overall dryness.</li>
            <li> I definitely see an improvement in the overall feel and appearance of my skin and will continue to use this product as I do believe it will hopefully fade my acne scars and give me a more even toned skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular product as an add-on item</li>
            <li> I  will never stop using this brand in particular.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone to try Argan oil.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very hydrated, and even though it&#x27;s an oil,my skin does&#x27;t feel greasy but feels soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Evidently my skin was dry since it sucked up the oil the first time I applied it.  </li>
            <li> I used it for my brittle nails and hair, so far i can see a little change for better.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs well into skin and leaves it very soft.  </li>
            <li> LITTLE GOES ALL LONG WAY, GREAT PRICE, LAST FOREVER SKIN IS SOFT AND YOUNG LOOKING.  </li>
            <li> But make sure you only use a few drops, because too much will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried, for the oil seemed to reside only on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> I find that I need to use less of it compared to Mogador, and thus the price difference is justified.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and  the product  appears to help  decrease the production of acne on my face.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old woman who lives in the south.</li>
            <li> Also the skin looks soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face as a moisturizer every night after applying Differin for acne and my skin is glowing and really soft.</li>
            <li> I also use this in my hair after washing and my hair is so soft when it dries.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my skin, I still have a ways to go to be cleared completely</li>
            <li> It leaves it so soft and it has even helped on my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> My hair looks alive again.</li>
            <li> I like this product thus far.</li>
            <li> Lives up to expectation.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft, and silky.  </li>
            <li> It has made my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> They have both told me that their skin soft and \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil brings out the natural beauty of skin.</li>
            <li> Replaced old cream moisturizer with this product.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this - after a month of use, there is still more than 2/3 of the bottle remaining.</li>
            <li> finally found a good facial cleanser for dry skin (something from CeraVe) and cut down on using my Clarisonic Mia to only twice a week, which helped a lot, but not enough.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why my skin did a complete 180 from what it has always been, but it is something I am totally unaccustomed to; I only know how to maintain oily skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d have to say that my complexion actually looks worse, with much more blotchiness.  </li>
            <li> I had been purchasing argan oil at a rather higher price until I searched Amazon.com looking for the same product, but for less money.  </li>
            <li> I barely use a drop over my whole face, and it still feels slightly oily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the very expensive Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL 100% PURE ARGAN OIL (only ingredient listed on the label); faint nutty scent (I really like the scent) and it absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing much for them, but it does help them feel less...</li>
            <li> I have used this oil on my face for little over a week, and my face has not broken out.</li>
            <li> The product havent caused me any further breakouts just the usual ones I get during certain months.</li>
            <li> It also keeps me from getting sunburned, and I live in Tucson, AZ and am very active outside.  </li>
            <li> But, that is because it takes so long to totally absorb into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find pure Argan oil at such an affordable price, considering others can run around $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and body - and even on my cat&#x27;s dry skin on her back!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;For dry skin: it will soften your skin and get rid of any dry patches&lt;br /&gt;For oily skin: it will reduce breakouts, blackheads, and overall oil production (remember, only use it overnight!)</li>
            <li> Yes, it does put moisture back into dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Saying this, I have also made few improvements like not using any other products on my face rather than dr organic pure moroccon argan oil face cream in the morning and the oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product that would help to reverse the damage done to my skin from years of applying  harsh products.</li>
            <li> And one bottle goes a long long way.  </li>
            <li> I have been known to have a good smeller and for those who hate the smell, I ask, what smell?  </li>
            <li> I will look around for other brands next time.</li>
            <li> oil.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while for me to see a MAJOR difference, however I felt the moisturizing properties immediately.</li>
            <li> dry skins caused by the countless number of changing moisturizers and other products used on my skins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for dry skin and brittle nails as some reviews suggest.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that seems to stay dry no matter what I do to it.</li>
            <li> I had some dry patches on my nose and a tad bit on my cheek, and I&#x27;ve heard argan oil does wonders for the skin, as well as the hair.</li>
            <li> I also mix it with my lotion and it helps itchy dry skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> During this winter season it became absolutely DRY.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry</li>
            <li> have oily/combination skin and this has helped to balance dry spots without adding to any excess oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, I use it for eczema, psoriasis and dry split ends.</li>
            <li> After using this once a day for about a week my dry skin started flaking.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, dry hair</li>
            <li> I washed my face, applied my toner, and applied several drops to my hands, rubbed them together and patted my face down.</li>
            <li> For me, Argan oil was not quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; some are describing, but it seems like it gives me the same control as other methods without destroying my skin for the future.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a long time and I handled it by putting harsh chemicals on my face and then constantly moisturizing to deal with the side effects.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly compared to the fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say that I expected the bottle to be a little bit bigger, but because you need so little (for either hair or facial use)</li>
            <li> I literally needed only a few drops to saturate my face and make it feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Purchased a few months back</li>
            <li> Yes, for hours after I use it, my skin seems less dry.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with my other beauty products twice a day and the results are that my skin is smoother, tighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> Will look for other products incorporating argan oil.</li>
            <li> I can travel with this size instead of bringing the larger container I usually order.  </li>
            <li> and they have other additives.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to incorporate with your other products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> My skin has only a very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The shipping took a little longer than expected, but I would purchase again if it continues to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the oil is in a dark bottle to preserve the quality of the oil.</li>
            <li> and I am 62, so heading down the south slope</li>
            <li> The oil isn&#x27;t very thick or doesn&#x27;t feel like its thick or very oily when you put it on your face, you just need to massage it well onto your face and your skin will absorb it all.</li>
            <li> I live in the north country and it is cold and dry during the winters</li>
            <li> The ordor in some argan oils is rough to the nostrils, but this ordor is so slight it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I just smear a little bit of this oil in my palms and touch up my hair tips.</li>
            <li> My face was so dry that it was getting ridiculously flaky.</li>
            <li> One night after a shower as I was putting this stuff on my hair, I remembered that it could be used on the face too and thought &amp;#34;Hell, why not!&amp;#34; and rubbed a few drops on my face.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks, I noticed the change in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Ill leave another review after i&#x27;ve completely used up the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have essentially the same level of acne as on prescription treatment but without the impossible dry skin or the excessive cost!</li>
            <li> Its not strong,  </li>
            <li> This has a very nutty smell, but it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount over the acne and acne scars, I give a little massage and wait until my face absorb the product and presto!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy things after seeing them on his show, but this captured my attention.  </li>
            <li> Look forward to taking my makeup off everyday to put this on!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old batch or something, but it stinks like something rotten.</li>
            <li> Not sure it does that.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am used to using coconut oil in my hair, growing up in tropical country in my childhood.</li>
            <li> Has hardly any odor.</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonder product, and I would recommend it to everyone, to at least try once.</li>
            <li> I am often mistaken for being in my late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some brands of this on here go up to $30, and it&#x27;s just completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> face however, has been going through some weird changes lately.</li>
            <li> If anything, just a faint nutty aroma.  </li>
            <li> I did find it difficult to apply to my scalp without causing greasiness</li>
            <li> You can tell by the nutty smell, whereas the fake ones smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> Get it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s cold pressed and comes with a dropper.</li>
            <li> During the winter my face peels and dries out like crazy!</li>
            <li> This made my oily face break out like crazy even though I used a pea sized amount!</li>
            <li> nasty. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from horrible split ends and no amount of serum worked.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just started using it, it might take a while to see benefits. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for dry skin and brittle nails as some reviews suggest. Again, it probably takes time</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that seems to stay dry no matter what I do to it. I did some research online and found that argan oil is supposed to give weightless moisture to your hair. I bought this to see if it would work, and I would have to say thwt it serves its purpose. My hair does seem to have more moisture and doesn&#x27;t seem so brittle. But make sure you only use a few drops, because too much will make your hair look greasy. Since this product worked, I&#x27;ve been trying to find more products with argan oil in it to help my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about this product, as I have acne prone, oily skin. I had some dry patches on my nose and a tad bit on my cheek, and I&#x27;ve heard argan oil does wonders for the skin, as well as the hair. I decided to purchase this brand, after replacing the $20+ dollar bottle of an alternate brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was so quick! I ordered it on June 7th and it arrived on the 10th. I used it for the first time last night as a moisturizer. I washed my face, applied my toner, and applied several drops to my hands, rubbed them together and patted my face down. At first I was worried, for the oil seemed to reside only on the surface of my skin. I thought I had surely made a mistake. But in just a few minutes, the oil absorbed completely into my skin, and I woke up to beautiful, smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin breaks out fairly easily. Some products can be used one time and they devastate my skin. This is truly a wonder product, and I would recommend it to everyone, to at least try once. I&#x27;ve seen some brands of this on here go up to $30, and it&#x27;s just completely unnecessary. This is only $10 and you&#x27;ll have to same total effect. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was originally introduced to Argan oil products by a friend. I was looking for a natural product that would help to reverse the damage done to my skin from years of applying  harsh products. I don&#x27;t know if the product will reverse damage to my skin because  I have only used the product a few days but so far I am very impressed. My skin feels so soft and  the product  appears to help  decrease the production of acne on my face. I will  continue to use the product and hopefully will continue to have good results. The shipping was as stated. The only problem that I had was the product didn&#x27;t come with an information pamphlet or shipping label but overall a good product so far.</li>
            <li> This oil Argan - an ideal product for skin regeneration. Most importantly his property - the ability to make skin more supple and young, and protect against aging. I think you&#x27;ll love the Argan oil as much as I do. This is truly a unique rejuvenating oil, almost a natural elixir of beauty. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size. I buy this for all of my friends!</li>
            <li> I was recomended this product by a friend, so I figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced my morning and night cream, and started using the oil instead. My skin feels very hydrated, and even though it&#x27;s an oil,my skin does&#x27;t feel greasy but feels soft and well hydrated.I would recomend to others.</li>
            <li> I like this oil a lot. I use it for my nails after washing my hands and my hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil after seeing it on Dr. Oz.  I don&#x27;t usually buy things after seeing them on his show, but this captured my attention.  I live in the north country and it is cold and dry during the winters and I am 62, so heading down the south slope and figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  Evidently my skin was dry since it sucked up the oil the first time I applied it.  I have now been using it alone, not mixed with anything else, for a week now and I am finding I only need about 4 drops for my entire face and neck area and my skin looks and feels real good.  I have been known to have a good smeller and for those who hate the smell, I ask, what smell?  If anything, just a faint nutty aroma.  So, a high five for this oil!</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old woman who lives in the south. My skin has only a very few wrinkles.  I have tried many skin care products.  I especially like the naturals.  I had been purchasing argan oil at a rather higher price until I searched Amazon.com looking for the same product, but for less money.  I found it in this Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil (30mL). I have used this product for over three months now and would not be without it.  I mix it with my other beauty products twice a day and the results are that my skin is smoother, tighter and brighter. The ordor in some argan oils is rough to the nostrils, but this ordor is so slight it is hardly noticeable. I would not be without this product.  This Argan Oil is excellent!</li>
            <li> Really good for anyone that has serious face dryness. During the winter my face peels and dries out like crazy! Don&#x27;t put too much on your face though because then you have to wait a while for it to soak in. I use it before putting make up on and wait a couple of minutes for it to set in before applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good for any dry skin and hair as well!</li>
            <li> I love this. I had acne all over my face, and I started using this product and the acne is gone! I put a small amount over the acne and acne scars, I give a little massage and wait until my face absorb the product and presto! The next morning you will see the results. Also the skin looks soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love argan oil. I use this on my face as a moisturizer every night after applying Differin for acne and my skin is glowing and really soft. It dries fairly quickly and is not heavy at all. I also use this in my hair after washing and my hair is so soft when it dries. This has a very nutty smell, but it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell. A little goes a long way with this - after a month of use, there is still more than 2/3 of the bottle remaining. I have used Josie Moran&#x27;s argan oil in the past and this is just as good, but for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review done on any product I have brought online and the only reason I would like to review is to let other people know exactly how the product is... a true honest opinion. I do suffer from mild acne but the real reason for the purchase of this product was to heal my acne scars, and dry skins caused by the countless number of changing moisturizers and other products used on my skins. The oil has definitely improved my skins much, much better, it have smoothed and reduced the overall dryness. Saying this, I have also made few improvements like not using any other products on my face rather than dr organic pure moroccon argan oil face cream in the morning and the oil throughout the day. Started to be more careful with my diet and drinking plenty of water, so I would say all of this has helped my skin. The product havent caused me any further breakouts just the usual ones I get during certain months. I definitely see an improvement in the overall feel and appearance of my skin and will continue to use this product as I do believe it will hopefully fade my acne scars and give me a more even toned skin. The delivery of the product was excellent as I received it way earlier than it said on my dispatch email. The oil isn&#x27;t very thick or doesn&#x27;t feel like its thick or very oily when you put it on your face, you just need to massage it well onto your face and your skin will absorb it all. I hope this long review has helped someone like me to find a true and good product. Cheers.</li>
            <li> Pure organic argan oil at a great price.  I use it on my face and body - and even on my cat&#x27;s dry skin on her back!</li>
            <li> I am using this oil as a moisturizer for my combination skin.  I have been using for about 5 days and I think it has helped control my t-zone.  Time will tell.  The shipping took a little longer than expected, but I would purchase again if it continues to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for hair, nails, skin, you name it.  And one bottle goes a long long way.  I now have a bottle in my bathroom, office and kitchen for hands.</li>
            <li> I saw results using this product one time. I have new scars from cystic acne and this has helped fade the scars greatly after only 4 nights of use. I also mix it with my lotion and it helps itchy dry skin after shaving. I will buy this item again for sure.</li>
            <li> Same great service, in a timely fashion, and same great product!  I like the fact that the oil is in a dark bottle to preserve the quality of the oil.</li>
            <li> Great product... This is my second time buying this product. I use it on my face and it keeps it nice and soft. Non-greasy. I will continue to buy and use this.</li>
            <li> What a delightfully fragrant oil. Using a dime-sized amount on towel-dried hair and working it through, it smells great. Husband loves it. I think my hair is stronger as I&#x27;m seeing fewer stray hairs, and it seems to hold hair color better. Will look for other products incorporating argan oil.</li>
            <li> I did order this to use exclusively on my hair, and it works really well! My ends are quite fried so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing much for them, but it does help them feel less... nasty. &#x3D;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face however, has been going through some weird changes lately. I just turned 23 and all my life I have had oily skin. Then about a year ago it became oily/combo. During this winter season it became absolutely DRY. I have no idea why my skin did a complete 180 from what it has always been, but it is something I am totally unaccustomed to; I only know how to maintain oily skin. My face was so dry that it was getting ridiculously flaky. So flaky that I was actually getting eyebrow dandruff (TMI?) and I could not apply makeup without it looking cakey and just downright awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found a good facial cleanser for dry skin (something from CeraVe) and cut down on using my Clarisonic Mia to only twice a week, which helped a lot, but not enough. I tried many different moisturizers but none helped. One night after a shower as I was putting this stuff on my hair, I remembered that it could be used on the face too and thought &amp;#34;Hell, why not!&amp;#34; and rubbed a few drops on my face. Oh. My. Goodness. It sunk into my skin rather than sitting on top of it. The flakes disappeared, they FREAKIN DISAPPEARED... I literally needed only a few drops to saturate my face and make it feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know use this stuff nightly on my face, I cannot go without it. It was such a pleasant surprise for this stuff to work so well for two different purposes. I will say that I expected the bottle to be a little bit bigger, but because you need so little (for either hair or facial use) it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I&#x27;m in love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil and since I&#x27;ve found it I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it.  It&#x27;s great for my hair and skin.  I ordered this particular product as an add-on item and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I can travel with this size instead of bringing the larger container I usually order.  The smell is non existent and the quality of this product is great and consistent with true pure Argan Oil.  I highly recommend everyone to try Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality argan oil, without the markup of other brands.  I&#x27;ve tried others and I liked this one just as much or better.</li>
            <li> I USE IT AND IT FEELS GOOD BUT THERE ARE NO MIRACLES. ABSORBS QUICKLY AND SCENT IS NICE. WORKS FOR SOME I GUESS</li>
            <li> Cheaper and just as good as the more expensive stuff! You can definetly get away with spreading just a couple drops all over your face during the day, but I love putting a bunch on at night for extra hydration while I sleep, doesnt break me out! Look forward to taking my makeup off everyday to put this on!</li>
            <li> For the price this oil isn&#x27;t that wonderful. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 100% argon oil, even though they claim it is. I think they must have diluted it or something. It moisturizes and helps with dryness but compared to other brands it isn&#x27;t that wonderful. I received a free bottle of the Josie Maran brand from sephora and while it&#x27;s $10 more, it&#x27;s a *much* better product. I will be purchasing Josie Maran after I run out of my free bottle. I find that I need to use less of it compared to Mogador, and thus the price difference is justified.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a long time and I handled it by putting harsh chemicals on my face and then constantly moisturizing to deal with the side effects. I&#x27;ve only really ever been able to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; my acne, not get rid of it all together, even with prescription medication. With this I was able to drop both the medication and the moisturizer and just use the oil. I have essentially the same level of acne as on prescription treatment but without the impossible dry skin or the excessive cost! For me, Argan oil was not quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; some are describing, but it seems like it gives me the same control as other methods without destroying my skin for the future.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it! I have used this oil on my face for little over a week, and my face has not broken out. Fantastic! Very little goes a long way. I put two drops on my fingers and press (not rub) the oil into my skin. The oil is not greasy and it quickly absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the packaging was sealed around the opening of the dropper area, which makes for a sterile and stable product. For the price and the results of my face, I will definitely purchase this oil again. It pays to have REAL certified organic Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> My nails are looking good we will see how good it works on MY head after chemo therapy keep you  fingers crossed that it works.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! I tested many and some smell weird, some are diluted though say they are not. This is the real stuff and works just like its supposed to.</li>
            <li> After reviewing about this item,I had to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did cause I love it,before tweeting brows I apply this oil it feels great not dry or red,mixe it with your regular moisturizer and face feels so smooth,thank argan oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun for my acne. And I have finally found the answer to my prayers. Today is 4 weeks since I started using it and it has already made a huge difference on my skin. I have oily skin and this oil does not make it oilier. It has cleared up my skin, I still have a ways to go to be cleared completely but I can tell that this product has worked for me. It leaves it so soft and it has even helped on my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a month and, honestly, I see no improvement.  Yes, for hours after I use it, my skin seems less dry.  But, that is because it takes so long to totally absorb into your skin.  I barely use a drop over my whole face, and it still feels slightly oily.  In my opinion, it just masks problem areas.  In fact, I&#x27;d have to say that my complexion actually looks worse, with much more blotchiness.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it does do a slightly better job on my hands than standard hand lotions.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! My hair is really dry and I just smear a little bit of this oil in my palms and touch up my hair tips. My hair looks alive again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great and effective product. Very reasonably priced for the 100% pure oil and the dropper works great. It arrived promptly. The producer supports a women&#x27;s collective so it was a feel-good purchase, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin and this has helped to balance dry spots without adding to any excess oil on my skin. I use it anywhere and everywhere. I did find it difficult to apply to my scalp without causing greasiness but that&#x27;s not the fault of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does everything it promises to do and makes me feel good applying a pure and natural substance to my skiing that causes no harm.</li>
            <li> I wanted pure Morroccan oil for my hair and skin and alot of the brands you see in the stores are just for hair and they have other additives.  This is good oil, but it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Am well pleased that it is organic as I purchase organic when possible.  Absorbs well into skin and leaves it very soft.  Appearance much improved.  Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> LITTLE GOES ALL LONG WAY, GREAT PRICE, LAST FOREVER SKIN IS SOFT AND YOUNG LOOKING.  EVERYONE KEEPS COMPLIMENTING ABOUT MY SKIN. I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just start using, but I thing it&#x27;s good ! I wiil use for 6 months and then I will see how it works</li>
            <li> This is a great Argan oil! I use it mostly on my skin, but it works good on hair too. I mix it with my body lotion and face cream. It is also good for acne believe it or not! It&#x27;s good for the price I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought some Argan oil for myself and gave my mother and mother-in-law some to try, and they loved it so I purchased individual bottles for each of them as Mother&#x27;s Day gifts.  The oil is very pure and organic.  It also keeps me from getting sunburned, and I live in Tucson, AZ and am very active outside.  Plus it softens callouses on the feet which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It isn&#x27;t greasy, I use it for eczema, psoriasis and dry split ends. It&#x27;s a very versatile product</li>
            <li> I love this product. Purchased a few months back and it is great to use when skin is dry or if you finish with a mask or peel.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t see any change in wrinkles. Would recommend to incorporate with your other products. Good stuff ladies!</li>
            <li> This definitely pure Argan oil! You can tell by the nutty smell, whereas the fake ones smell like chemicals. It also absorbs quickly compared to the fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazing thing about Argan oil is it&#x27;s beneficial for all skin types&lt;br /&gt;For dry skin: it will soften your skin and get rid of any dry patches&lt;br /&gt;For oily skin: it will reduce breakouts, blackheads, and overall oil production (remember, only use it overnight!) (I have oily skin so I can attest to this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used for your hair :) Just put a couple drops in your shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on here is great. It&#x27;s hard to find pure Argan oil at such an affordable price, considering others can run around $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin and I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The oil didn&#x27;t work for me as well as for the people who wrote&lt;br /&gt;the many reviews.  I will look around for other brands next time.</li>
            <li> Love this Argan oil. I am often mistaken for being in my late 40&#x27;s. I am 56. I use straight Argan oil on my face EVERY MORNING. Also use it on my neck, chest, hands and arms. I  will never stop using this brand in particular. It is every bit as good as the Josie Maran high priced Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while for me to see a MAJOR difference, however I felt the moisturizing properties immediately. It&#x27;s been about 9 months now that I&#x27;ve used Argan oil religiously, and the change in skin color/tone and lack of additional wrinkles and sagging IS obvious. Guess I noticed the first changes at about 4 weeks, and it just kept getting better from there. My skin was softer from the get go though. You will see changes like softness &amp; makeup going on more evenly right away.&lt;br /&gt;The price here is wonderful, espec w Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I was skeptical at first but after a few weeks, I noticed the change in the texture of my skin.  I&#x27;ve been complimented on my appearance many times since using this so looks like I&#x27;ll be a regular user.  It&#x27;s a good habit to care for yourself as much as you care for others.</li>
            <li> I loved using this product.  I liked even more that part of the proceeds were given to the woman who harvest the nuts.  Thanks so much for a great product that I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> A very good product, but if you have dry skin probably not something you want to use more than once or twice a week. After using this once a day for about a week my dry skin started flaking. But if you have oily skin, it would be excellent.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my other products and it works great.  I Will buy again when I run out.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there. This is my 2nd order. I use it for my hair and I mix it in my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Was packaged great. Shipping is fairly quick. I use it every other day. Makes my skin so smooth and beautiful. I even put it in my hair for the same effect. The quality is great.nthis is the second or third time I have reordered.</li>
            <li> This made my oily face break out like crazy even though I used a pea sized amount! As for my hair,&lt;br /&gt;this product has helpedy hair get even thicker and longer since I&#x27;ve been using it. So this oil will only be used for my hair.</li>
            <li> Received this product quickly and packaged well.  This is the REAL 100% PURE ARGAN OIL (only ingredient listed on the label); faint nutty scent (I really like the scent) and it absorbs well.  Many sellers on the market today sell diluted and unpure Argan Oil, but not this seller. The dropper top is perfect for easy use, too.  I would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Great oil , use it as facial moistureiser . Absorbs quickly and keeps skin soft during winter . Tried different ones , but this one is best for me . Plus no yucky scent .</li>
            <li> Yes, it does put moisture back into dry skin.  But, the odor that is left in the towel(s) takes several washings to get the smell out.  Don&#x27;t let me discourage you-try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Good, and much less pricey than the brand name argan oil I&#x27;ve been buying. I like that it&#x27;s cold pressed and comes with a dropper.</li>
            <li> I like this product thus far. The minute I put it in my hair...my hair was so dry it sucked it up and provided a good amount of oil and shine. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews, and while I like what it does to my hair, it has a rancid odor. From what I read about argan oil, it should smell pleasantly nutty. I don&#x27;t know if I got an old batch or something, but it stinks like something rotten. So I would say it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I have been buying another way more expensive brand for years and thought I would give this a try based on the reviews.  I LOVE love LOVE it! I see no difference in feel or smell.  I use this on my cuticles, back of my hands, and facial areas around my eyes and mouth every night.  Still feels great, looks great, and I am really loving the $$ I am saving!! Get it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> After testing several different brands of Argan oil at different price points, I feel the Mogador 100% Pure Argan Oil is a great value. I do believe it is pure argan oil, and I received all of the benefits associated with high quality oil. My skin was more luminous and I had reduction in the number of blemishes and inflammation on my face. I also use this oil in my hair to help smooth the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Lives up to expectation.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft, and silky.  Has hardly any odor. Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Totally a great product. I felt and you can see results in 3 days. If not sooner. I will always get this Organic Argan oil. Terrific.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s just as good as the very expensive Josie Maran Argan Oil. I wear this all over my face at night while sleeping &amp; have never once had a break out. Argan oil will NOT give you any break out problems. It has made my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have heard good reviews of Argan oil.  I bought two bottles wanting to use them for myself, but I ended up giving them away to my best friend and sister-in-law.  I am giving a review based on what they have told me. They have both told me that their skin soft and \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  My friend, who has oily skin, told me that the oil was starting to even out her complexion.  I will have to buy two more bottles- for my mom and I and start using it for myself! Argan oil is also very good for skin elasticity.  The price is very reasonable and should be part of everyone&#x27;s beauty regimen. Argan oil brings out the natural beauty of skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything great about using this oil. I already have great skin (thanks to my good genes) and bought this oil for my hair. I have wavy, dry hair and I also color it. Thought this oil might help retaining some of the shine and make my hair look healthier. Not sure it does that. I use it from the middle to the tips and apply a bit on the top. As one of the reviewers said, it controls the fly away hair stay intact, which is good. As soon as I apply it, my hair looks a bit shinier. But that goes away pretty soon. Not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am used to using coconut oil in my hair, growing up in tropical country in my childhood. I like the Argan oil better than coconut oil, as it is very light and doesnt have strong smell. It has a very very mild smell that I dont even notice. I also like the fact that this is organic. I will keep using it. Hopefully it does something good!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality argan oil for cheap... works just as well as josie maran argan oil. I use it as a moisturizer on my skin with spf over, on my nails, in damp hair, and on my eyelashes. All uses ended in beautiful luscious results</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love how it makes my face feel.  Replaced old cream moisturizer with this product.  Won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Argan Oil! It is a bit pricy, but it truly moisturizes my 4b/c hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I just received this oil today, (it arrived really fast!!)&lt;br /&gt;And so far i love it. I have damaged brittle ends and my hair absorbed the oil really well and became shiny and much softer immediately. I also put it on my face, i like it a lot, its moisturizing but not oily. Ill leave another review after i&#x27;ve completely used up the bottle. I would give 5 stars but i dont like the smell. Its not strong,  but after i applied it i smelled the bottle, and its not the best smell .</li>
            <li> This product is very effective if used daily. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil first time, i read about it on internet. I hope it is real argan oil, and certified. I used it for my brittle nails and hair, so far i can see a little change for better. I continue to use it to see improvements</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair have never been so silky in my life. I have always suffered from horrible split ends and no amount of serum worked. I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair and so I haven&#x27;t wanted to cut it. This oil has save my hair!</li>
            <li> This argan oil is a good product, but it is a bit thinner than I like. I was looking for argan oil for the body and was looking for a thicker consistency. For those looking for a thinner oil, this would be a good product. It has no bad smell. Good product for the price.</li>
