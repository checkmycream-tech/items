    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame they can&#x27;t find a durable material to cover the metal because the concept is good and getting the bun up was easy and looked great!</li>
            <li>a good head bump</li>
            <li>I loved it because, as a dancer, it put my hair in a bun without it falling all over the place.</li>
            <li>so I bought these thinking they&#x27;d be just as good.</li>
            <li>and you could end up with a nice cut to your head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;D HAVE PAID MORE FOR A GOOD ONE.</li>
            <li>away.&lt;br /&gt;There are no words to tell you how thrilled I was to find them at Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are again searching for an easy bun-making alternative!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These ones are very cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like two razors in cheap felt!</li>
            <li>I used to love harogami was</li>
            <li>IT LASTED MANY YEARS WITHOUT INCIDENT.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves these and uses them many times a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Takes some practice, but once you get it, they&#x27;re very useful!</li>
            <li>i tray the magic hair bun maker its not that strong and it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair as i excepted</li>
            <li>and eventually it will be your best hair friend for dance and all sports requiring a tight and strong bun!</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, but okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hairagamis are easy to use, ridiculously easy.</li>
            <li>These are awesome for teachers who have those students who sometimes come in with their hair down...</li>
            <li>Cheap knock off of original.</li>
            <li>My mom bought one of the original Harigamis</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for my daughter who has to dance in competitions and needs her very long hair in a neat bun!</li>
            <li>If you get them in just right, they will hold your hair perfectly fine</li>
            <li>The cloth that covers the metal wears quickly leaving the metal exposed.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see these on Amazon and ordered them right away.</li>
            <li>FIRST USE!</li>
            <li>It took us many many tries before we got it</li>
            <li>You will have to practice several times to make sure you have them at the right spot along your length of hair, and turned in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I think they would be fine for an adult, but perhaps use caution if using during sporting activities.  </li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t pinpoint the source and moments</li>
            <li>HAD USED THIS PRODUCT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT</li>
            <li>I always fastened my hair into a ponytail first.</li>
            <li>The stitching came apart on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much someone took two snap bracelets and sewed them between two pieces of felt.  </li>
            <li>These particular ones are pretty substantial metal pieces, and they roll up rather forcefully when they are bent.  </li>
            <li>The fabric covering them also seems very thin--if it ripped or came off, I imagine these devices could no longer be used.  </li>
            <li>The fabric on these really \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; your hair, so</li>
            <li>Cheap, obviously.  </li>
            <li>But so much easier than trying to do a bun on her myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sad that the original Hairagami is not made anymore, but these are almost as good.</li>
            <li>I searched for others&#x27; experiences to find the product for about $2 from the main distributor and wrote them.</li>
            <li>These took a little while to show up, but I&#x27;m glad I bought them and would repurchase them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked all over to find these again and was pleased to find them on Amazon, I wish the material was a little thicker but other-wise</li>
            <li>Still, far too much work for the price paid and injury sustained.</li>
            <li>So much so you can hurt your hand if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>You have to put your hair in a ponytail first, then roll it up with the Hairagami, then tuck the ends under the bun, and then put a second ponytail holder over the bun to hold the ends in.</li>
            <li>This works great on long, thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li>I purchased these with faith they were going to work out well for nearly $8.</li>
            <li>These hair tools are a lot like slap bracelets (if you lived through the 80s or early 90s</li>
            <li>We have bought many of these over the years for our local drug store, thiese were much less money and for a reason!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quite thick, and I can still use these easily.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think these are appropriate to put in my kids&#x27; hair due to what I perceive to be sharp metal inside.  </li>
            <li>It was cool for a few seconds until it sliced open my fingers</li>
            <li>great for people who have thick, unruly, very slippery, or very thin</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t put it in at just the right spot, it will actually pull your hair way too tight, and there is no way to slide it once it&#x27;s curled, it just grips the hair too</li>
            <li>It was tricky to put on sometimes because I had long hair (below the waist) and it took me one or two tries to get the bun just right without it snapping on me or being too loose.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair or very thin hair you might not be able to fan it out to completely cover the tool, so it might look strange.</li>

            <li> It was the only thing that could get my messy hair into a presentable bun.</li>
            <li> I bought them a few months back</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (down to my butt)</li>
            <li> (I think they are hard to use on yourself, especially if you have long hair).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too sharp..</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR SHARP METAL PIECES CUT THROUGH THE MATERIAL AND INTO MY HAND.</li>
            <li> Metal foil its made of is razor sharp.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when they arrived, I could see that the outer fabric material is not made like it used to be (much cheaper quality).</li>
            <li> If you have it upside down, you will have to pull it out and start over.  </li>
            <li> They are made of a slightly lighter weight than the Hairagami.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is two slap bracelets held together by fabric, but it seriously holds your hair back.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> A little harder with thick hair or layers, both of which my daughter have.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My daughter was not able to make it hold either.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I need to start crafting ballet buns at home, and I am not very good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Difficult to use on long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to tell the size and strength of the curling feature.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have since had each styling tool break in the same dangerous fashion.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s because my hair is too long(waist length) or too thick</li>
            <li> so it may work well for other people but not for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I used both a few times and then noticed gashes in my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> later I realized the blade inside the material cut through the ends of the styling tool making it quite a bloody weapon when it snaps to curl or with the slightest pressure.</li>
            <li> MYSELF-COULDN&#x27;T DO WORSE.</li>
            <li> I am afraid</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to use Hairagami&#x27;s when I was a teenager all of the time! It was the only thing that could get my messy hair into a presentable bun. I was so excited to see these on Amazon and ordered them right away. Unfortunately, when they arrived, I could see that the outer fabric material is not made like it used to be (much cheaper quality). I tried to put it in my hair and the fabric ripped! FIRST USE! There is a big hole in it now, revealing just a slap bracelet. Oh well, not all purchases can be winners.</li>
            <li> I purchased these with faith they were going to work out well for nearly $8. Unfortunately I used both a few times and then noticed gashes in my fingers. At first I couldn&#x27;t pinpoint the source and moments later I realized the blade inside the material cut through the ends of the styling tool making it quite a bloody weapon when it snaps to curl or with the slightest pressure. I searched for others&#x27; experiences to find the product for about $2 from the main distributor and wrote them. They have never has this experience and I have since had each styling tool break in the same dangerous fashion. I am currently using duct tape and hot glue to dull the sharp ends and then re-sewing the cloth over the styling tool. Still, far too much work for the price paid and injury sustained.</li>
            <li> These hair tools are a lot like slap bracelets (if you lived through the 80s or early 90s you definitely know what I&#x27;m talking about) with a flexible piece of fabric in the middle. I have very long hair (down to my butt) and it&#x27;s quite thick, and I can still use these easily. If you have shorter hair or very thin hair you might not be able to fan it out to completely cover the tool, so it might look strange. These took a little while to show up, but I&#x27;m glad I bought them and would repurchase them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It was cool for a few seconds until it sliced open my fingers and I had to go to the hosptial. Wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s like two razors in cheap felt! DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. It doesn&#x27;t hold it in place. My daughter was not able to make it hold either.</li>
            <li> I remember having one of these YEARS ago; the concept is not new.  It is basically two metal \\&quot;snap bracelets\\&quot; joined together by some flimsy fabric.  I bought these because I need to start crafting ballet buns at home, and I am not very good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose like any of these hair gimmicks, they take practice to use well.  These particular ones are pretty substantial metal pieces, and they roll up rather forcefully when they are bent.  So much so you can hurt your hand if you&#x27;re not careful.  The fabric covering them also seems very thin--if it ripped or came off, I imagine these devices could no longer be used.  You also have to remember, before you start rolling up the hair, which direction they will curl when bent, because it is only one way.  If you have it upside down, you will have to pull it out and start over.  The fabric on these really \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; your hair, so if you don&#x27;t put it in at just the right spot, it will actually pull your hair way too tight, and there is no way to slide it once it&#x27;s curled, it just grips the hair too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are dedicated to practicing, these may work out for you.  If you get them in just right, they will hold your hair perfectly fine (I think they are hard to use on yourself, especially if you have long hair).  I personally don&#x27;t think these are appropriate to put in my kids&#x27; hair due to what I perceive to be sharp metal inside.  I am afraid a good head bump and you could end up with a nice cut to your head.  I think they would be fine for an adult, but perhaps use caution if using during sporting activities.  We are again searching for an easy bun-making alternative!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too sharp.. it cut my daughter&#x27;s hand open. I used to love harogami was I was younger but now it&#x27;s made with S***ty material</li>
            <li> The cloth that covers the metal wears quickly leaving the metal exposed. I&#x27;ve gotten cut several times using these and was discouraged to wear them again. It&#x27;s a shame they can&#x27;t find a durable material to cover the metal because the concept is good and getting the bun up was easy and looked great!</li>
            <li> Awful.  Cheap, obviously.  Difficult to use on long hair. Waste of money. I would suggest getting more expensive ones because they probably work.</li>
            <li> Practice using this and eventually it will be your best hair friend for dance and all sports requiring a tight and strong bun! This works great on long, thick, curly hair! Dont give up on it.  It took us many many tries before we got it and now we can get a bun in seconds!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS. AFTER USING THIS FOR 2 DAYS . THE RAZOR SHARP METAL PIECES CUT THROUGH THE MATERIAL AND INTO MY HAND. HAD USED THIS PRODUCT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT YEARS AND YEARS AGO. IT LASTED MANY YEARS WITHOUT INCIDENT. WHAT A SHAME!!!  I&#x27;D HAVE PAID MORE FOR A GOOD ONE. AMAZON SHOULD NOT CARRY THIS. I ORDERED THE TWO PACK AND ONE SINGLE BLONDE COLOR. GONNA GET COATED SLAP BRACELETS AN TRY TO MAKE ONE MYSELF-COULDN&#x27;T DO WORSE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked all over to find these again and was pleased to find them on Amazon, I wish the material was a little thicker but other-wise It&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> i tray the magic hair bun maker its not that strong and it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair as i excepted</li>
            <li> These hairagamis are replacements. I donated my hair after I retired and gave my hairagamis away.&lt;br /&gt;There are no words to tell you how thrilled I was to find them at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Hairagamis are easy to use, ridiculously easy. I always fastened my hair into a ponytail first. You will have to practice several times to make sure you have them at the right spot along your length of hair, and turned in the right direction. Just don&#x27;t give up. Once you learn, it&#x27;s a snap.</li>
            <li> My mom bought one of the original Harigamis a while back and gave it to me. I loved it because, as a dancer, it put my hair in a bun without it falling all over the place. It was tricky to put on sometimes because I had long hair (below the waist) and it took me one or two tries to get the bun just right without it snapping on me or being too loose. I was bummed out when I lost it so I bought these thinking they&#x27;d be just as good. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ones are very cheap and I could tell the moment I got them. The one I originally had was very sturdy and thick, these ones are thin and flimsy. I bought them a few months back and already the seams are tearing on me. I already cut myself on the metal inside! If I were you, I would spring for one that&#x27;s a little more expensive. Just not this one.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s because my hair is too long(waist length) or too thick but the tool would just not stay in place or close as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> We have bought many of these over the years for our local drug store, thiese were much less money and for a reason!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but okay if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair. Picture slap stick bracelets folded in half and putting your hair in the middle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that the original Hairagami is not made anymore, but these are almost as good. They are made of a slightly lighter weight than the Hairagami. Yes, it is two slap bracelets held together by fabric, but it seriously holds your hair back. I am a figure skater and this contraption is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that keeps my bun in place during rigorous spins. You have to put your hair in a ponytail first, then roll it up with the Hairagami, then tuck the ends under the bun, and then put a second ponytail holder over the bun to hold the ends in. It works.</li>
            <li> this product was nothing it said it would be.  Pretty much someone took two snap bracelets and sewed them between two pieces of felt.  The stitching came apart on the first use.  it slips out of place and only folds one way, so creativity for hair is limited.  NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> These are awesome for teachers who have those students who sometimes come in with their hair down... instead of taking five minutes to put their hair in a bun, it takes me ten seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great for people who have thick, unruly, very slippery, or very thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes some practice, but once you get it, they&#x27;re very useful!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these and uses them many times a week. She has even had her friends ask her to borrow them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this product to work correctly.  My hair is very thick so it may work well for other people but not for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> A little harder with thick hair or layers, both of which my daughter have.  But so much easier than trying to do a bun on her myself.</li>
            <li> Metal foil its made of is razor sharp.  Will cut through fabric and your fingers after a couple uses.  Should be barred from sale in US.  Cheap knock off of original.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for my daughter who has to dance in competitions and needs her very long hair in a neat bun!</li>
            <li> This was not the same product I have purchased before (from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;It is actually called &amp;#34;Princess&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to tell the size and strength of the curling feature.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that it could have been explained better.&lt;br /&gt;In fact I went to &amp;#34;princess-j.com&amp;#34;, and they even have the price as&lt;br /&gt;$1.99, then when you go to check out it is actually $19.99.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Oh well.</li>
