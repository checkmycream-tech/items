    <ol>
            <li>Excellent quality and speedy shipping.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality from Liftmode as well!</li>
            <li>it basically does what everyone describes as it does, but BASICALLY though, the best way to sum this stuff up is it takes you to YOUR highest intelligence CAPABILLITES, it in NO WAY or shape or form makes you &amp;#34;more&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Do your research for best results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked awesome for about a week.</li>
            <li>Awesome company all around.</li>
            <li>Thank you LiftMode for another great product</li>
            <li>It is great for attention focusing in class.</li>
            <li>Product as described and came in attractive utilitarian packaging.</li>
            <li>I have had a great experience with Liftmode every time I&#x27;ve ordered from them.</li>
            <li>An all around great experience.</li>
            <li>Liftmode provides a great price for Sunifiram.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great value at a great price.</li>
            <li>This Sunifiram I received from Liftmode is amazing!</li>
            <li>, it was like a good coffee buzz kinda</li>
            <li>It was packaged awesome and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very potent</li>
            <li>I would hypothesize this from the fact that though the ability to compose and &amp;#34;put to paper&amp;#34; as it were, coherent, comprehensible,&lt;br /&gt;and dare I say intelligent  expressions of ones thoughts, feelings, views, etc.</li>
            <li>We love it and it works!</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff, simply Amazing.</li>
            <li>wise but IMO with better effects.</li>
            <li>Ive been using Nootropics for 15 years and find this highly effective.</li>
            <li>No matter what kind of sleep</li>
            <li>There are a lot of scammers out there, but this is the real deal and it works great!</li>
            <li>and I told them the issue and the rest is/was history, (and allowed me to keep the product, for free, lol :) )</li>
            <li>I THINK KRATOM MAY BE THE BEST HELP SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Perhaps taking this once in awhile, or once a week would be most effective.</li>
            <li>this is a very strong nootropic and it should be approached with a lot more caution than racetams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is extremely potent (1000x more than noopept??</li>
            <li>c: )</li>
            <li>Perhaps I will redo this review after more testing is completed.</li>
            <li>If it works for someone else, fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love Sunifiram.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was pretty dramatically awesome in its nootropic effect at first.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more of a placebo affect the anything.</li>
            <li>coherently, read the products reviews before you purchase it.  </li>
            <li>Out of the nootropics I have tried and continue to use, I feel like Sunifiram has some of the most noticeable effects.</li>
            <li>This potion lifted my mood which is always pretty good anyway to another level.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was like all the prosocial, motivating, focus, and mood boost effects of low/moderate dose amphetamine but with zero stimulation, and with genuine strong nootropic benefits on top of that.</li>
            <li>BigPharma could easily rake in bucks....</li>
            <li>Had a strong racetams focus with increased energy.</li>
            <li>The impact was very powerful and almost immediate, with increased attention, clarity of thought, and verbal fluency.</li>
            <li>I get any particular night, upon awakening, feel noticeably more awake, rested, able to function.</li>
            <li>This review was originally posted in June 2013 for the separate product B00C7CF6RG, which is also LiftMode</li>
            <li>They seem to be a fine company, shipped the product relatively quickly..</li>
            <li>The best I have found for small amounts, in fact.</li>
            <li>I will try to go into more detail about my experience with Sunifiram when I have more time, but I wanted to make it clear that Liftmode is a company you can depend on for reliable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(much to your relief, I&#x27;m sure) with a recommendation and an observation.  </li>
            <li>Which is not to accuse Liftmode of wrongdoing, although in the real world how many corporations wouldn&#x27;t sell their collective mothers for</li>
            <li>The products are shipped fast and I love the companies packaging.</li>
            <li>I know that they can have an effective action.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And to make the whole experience better, though I ordered two grams, for some reason they sent me five.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with nootropics for the last year, phenylpiracetam was the most effective but this sunifiram was close to the same effect but slightly more energizing.</li>
            <li>With such a potent compound as this, at doses around 10mg, synthetic impurities are not so worrisome, but when messing with my AMPARs I feel much more comfortable taking something of this high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt like my brain was super fresh and healthy and young.</li>
            <li>; intelligent your only as smart as you CAN be (as smart as your brain will let you)</li>
            <li>this product came with a certificate of assay that confirmed the purity to be very high.</li>
            <li>and useful to have in my nootropic arsenal.</li>
            <li>The intense focus and verbal fluency it provides are very useful to have on tap.</li>
            <li>Noticed no &amp;#34;side&amp;#34; effects, and can take it right before bed...</li>
            <li>the container looks good and seals tightly.</li>
            <li>To me, the lack of AMPAR PAM selectivity makes it a slightly less than ideal as a daily nootropic, but it is still definitely worth having around.</li>
            <li>One is then inclined to increase doses to levels that are untested even in animals, to the tune of 15 mg or even higher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried products from another supplier but the Liftmode products are just higher quality (plus they come with lab analysis and don&#x27;t come in a foil pouch).</li>
            <li>I got results from my first dose of Sunifiram within 30mins of taking it.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice mental stimulation and helps me concentrate and focus on what I want to get done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many things from LiftMode in the past and was always extremely satisfied by the quality of their products.</li>
            <li>Attended a funeral on it and felt like I was much more in control emotionally than I would have been otherwise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first experience purchasing from Liftmode..</li>
            <li>Sunifiram was my first foray into nootropics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first week of taking this on a daily basis, but the effects from the first day still seem to be staying strong.</li>
            <li>but do you really think your personal information is safe from anyone with the will, let alone</li>
            <li>In light of this data, I strongly suggest taking no more than 2mg at most twice daily, for at most 3 days, and not combining it with any racetams, other potentiators (e.g. noopept), ampakines, NMDAR based LTP agents, or stimulants.as</li>

            <li>I take 10 mgs of sunifiram in the morning with noopept and have found that it brightens up my morning and makes thinking and getting going in the morning much easier.</li>
            <li>and I really have no interest in purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also noticed some color enhancement, but not as much as others</li>

            <li>As a sufferer of PTSD, I am always looking for something new that may help in the battle, the reviews were decent</li>

            <li>Firstly, let me warn you that this is a review of the reviews I recently read about this product and which have given me pause as to weather</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with racetams such as piracetam then you will get a lot of the same effects with Sunifiram.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the fast down regulation making it only effective for occasional use.</li>
            <li>Given the extremely small active doses (&lt;10mg), I feel like this is a great value, definitely on par with noopept price</li>
            <li>I would rate this product and the seller very highly and I would definitely buy again if I ever managed to run out.</li>
            <li>Clear thinking, and helps with my anxiety</li>
            <li>I have found that this helps get me going faster early in the morning.</li>
            <li>I suspect this as an action of sunifiram combined with the glutamate expressing action of modafinil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>OLD SON &amp; HE IS NOW IN THE HOSPTAL FROM USING IT.</li>
            <li>but it was because Amazon stored, handled, and shipped the product, at which my order was completely refunded BY LIFTMODES REQUEST (I SWEAR TO YOU)</li>
            <li>I recommend that all you would-be enhancers out there have someone of known natural intelligence, and who does not believe that spellcheck (</li>
            <li>Eventually, it caught up with me, and I completely crashed.</li>
            <li>As of now, I plan on taking this daily with maybe a few weeks off every couple of months, which I like to do with most nootropics.</li>
            <li>Note that there was no other change in my activities leading up to the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>Note that there was no other change in my activities leading up to the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>I have ordered from LiftMode in the past and they have never disappointed me -</li>
            <li>suspect sunifiram is incredibly sensitive to the other pharmacological factors going on in your body, and you cant really combine it with everything like you</li>
            <li>have used noopept before and have noticed some of the general effects one receives from these compounds..</li>
            <li>but so far only temporarily.</li>
            <li>but so far only temporarily.</li>
            <li>I would never take sunifiram with another excitatory substance and now that I know its mechanism of action, until human tox screens come out I will exercise a lot of caution with dosing.</li>
            <li>They also told me for future reference to order the products with the FBLM by the name that&#x27;s coming directly from Liftmode they said.</li>
            <li>for the effects of this compound, I would say it provides a very sunny mood lift and sharp focus increase.</li>
            <li>The hangover from too high of a dose is pretty bad but speaks to the potency of this stuff strongly.</li>
            <li>Also, I am getting older and perhaps due to my lack of cognitive enhancement have developed&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. Had a strong racetams focus with increased energy. Thank you LiftMode for another great product</li>
            <li> I have found that this helps get me going faster early in the morning. It is great for attention focusing in class.</li>
            <li> This Sunifiram I received from Liftmode is amazing! It gives focus, energy, and uplifted mood. I have heard of side effects of headaches resulting from long term use, so my advice is to cycle it! I have had no negative side effects as of yet.</li>
            <li> This review was originally posted in June 2013 for the separate product B00C7CF6RG, which is also LiftMode sunifiram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you must already know, sunifiram is an AMPAR (AMPA receptor) drug. It also works on NMDAR (NMDA receptors). As such, it is not cleanly selective for AMPAR, as would have been desirable for an ampakine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While sunifiram is taken in about a 1-2 mg dose, taken up to twice daily, it can be a cognitive enhancer, but within days it stops being a stimulant at these doses. One is then inclined to increase doses to levels that are untested even in animals, to the tune of 15 mg or even higher. While doing this is also reported to be safe when done in isolation, the unfortunate problem is that sunifiram does not really stack well with other stimulants, especially when you also add other potentiators such as noopept to the mix. Stacking it as such with other strong stimulants can cause neurotoxicity or worse, as it indeed did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;TOXICITY INTERACTION REPORT&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;What I am about to say is extremely inconvenient for the enthusiastic reader, but if you have made up your mind already as to the safety of sunifiram, you can skip the remainder of this review and proceed with reckless self-experimentation with untested chemicals in the same spirit as I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been taking various combinations of armodafinil (prescribed), modafinil (also prescribed), phenylpiracetam (OTC), and noopept (OTC) for a long time now, without any issue whatsoever. One day I added 6 mg sunifiram in divided doses to this mix, after having increased it from 1 mg over a week or two. This immediately caused intermittent pressure plus pain, rated 0-5 out of 10, in my temples that has not even reduced after a week. Moreover, I cannot tolerate any stimulants now, not even a cup of coffee, or the pain increases quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hypothesis is one of continued glutamate excitotoxicity due to NMDA receptor over-sensitization. I suspect this as an action of sunifiram combined with the glutamate expressing action of modafinil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No amount of analgesic anti-inflammatory painkillers, whether oral or injected, have made the slightest difference. Exercise helps but so far only temporarily. Note that there was no other change in my activities leading up to the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other people have contacted me to report the same persistent side effects. One took ~30mg and the other only ~4mg. In light of this data, I strongly suggest taking no more than 2mg at most twice daily, for at most 3 days, and not combining it with any racetams, other potentiators (e.g. noopept), ampakines, NMDAR based LTP agents, or stimulants.as an action of sunifiram combined with the glutamate expressing action of modafinil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No amount of analgesic anti-inflammatory painkillers, whether oral or injected, have made the slightest difference.

            <li> Excellent quality and speedy shipping. Product as described and came in attractive utilitarian packaging. I have ordered from LiftMode in the past and they have never disappointed me - this product came with a certificate of assay that confirmed the purity to be very high. With such a potent compound as this, at doses around 10mg, synthetic impurities are not so worrisome, but when messing with my AMPARs I feel much more comfortable taking something of this high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effects of this compound, I would say it provides a very sunny mood lift and sharp focus increase. The hangover from too high of a dose is pretty bad but speaks to the potency of this stuff strongly. Be very careful with it as it is a positive allosteric modulator of AMPAR AND a glutamate receptor agonist if memory serves, which makes me wary of excitotoxicity. I would never take sunifiram with another excitatory substance and now that I know its mechanism of action, until human tox screens come out I will exercise a lot of caution with dosing. That being said, it is extremely potent (1000x more than noopept?? c: ) and useful to have in my nootropic arsenal. The intense focus and verbal fluency it provides are very useful to have on tap. To me, the lack of AMPAR PAM selectivity makes it a slightly less than ideal as a daily nootropic, but it is still definitely worth having around. I would rate this product and the seller very highly and I would definitely buy again if I ever managed to run out.</li>
            <li> The Effects are not as noticeable as I&#x27;d hoped. Perhaps I will redo this review after more testing is completed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with nootropics for the last year, phenylpiracetam was the most effective but this sunifiram was close to the same effect but slightly more energizing. I&#x27;ve tried products from another supplier but the Liftmode products are just higher quality (plus they come with lab analysis and don&#x27;t come in a foil pouch).</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 28 YR. OLD SON &amp; HE IS NOW IN THE HOSPTAL FROM USING IT. THIS SHOULD BE BAND FROM INTERNET SALES.</li>
            <li> I got results from my first dose of Sunifiram within 30mins of taking it. Razor sharp focus and an ease in memory recall. This stuff is very potent so you want to start with a small dose and build up. I have a presentation coming up soon and I can&#x27;t wait to use this for an edge.</li>
            <li> I am illiterate about this type of stuff. Therefore, my review will be based on its &amp;#34;effects&amp;#34; on me: NOTHING, except for a headache one day (I think it was caused by the amount taking: 0.15 cc scoop), and lack of sleep same day. I must day that I should be the best guinea pig for this type of things because of my terrible memory, but it didn&#x27;t work. If it works for someone else, fantastic! I&#x27;m throwing in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;For the SPANISH READERS:&lt;br /&gt;Soy ignorante de estos asuntos, por lo tanto, mi comentario será basado en los &amp;#34;efectos&amp;#34; que experimenté: NINGUNO, excepto por un dolor de cabeza un día (creo que fue la dosis que tomé: cucharadita de 0.15cc), y falta de sueño ese mismo día. Debo decir que soy el mejor conejillo de India para este tipo de cosas, pues mi memoria es terrible, pero no funcionó. Si trabaja para alguien más, fantástico! Lo estoy tirando a la basura.</li>
            <li> Love Sunifiram. Gives a nice mental stimulation and helps me concentrate and focus on what I want to get done. Excellent quality from Liftmode as well!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORKS BUT NOT FOR LONG. I&#x27;M STILL ON THE HUNT. I THINK KRATOM MAY BE THE BEST HELP SO FAR. BRAINWIZZE.LOL</li>
            <li> Hmmm, the hype with this stuff is just not what I was hoping for, I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong it basically does what everyone describes as it does, but BASICALLY though, the best way to sum this stuff up is it takes you to YOUR highest intelligence CAPABILLITES, it in NO WAY or shape or form makes you &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; intelligent your only as smart as you CAN be (as smart as your brain will let you), it was like a good coffee buzz kinda but without the come down and agitation. I give Liftmode a 5, there were &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; with the products quality but it was because Amazon stored, handled, and shipped the product, at which my order was completely refunded BY LIFTMODES REQUEST (I SWEAR TO YOU) they ask me after my order of my satisfaction or something to that sense and I told them the issue and the rest is/was history, (and allowed me to keep the product, for free, lol :) ) They also told me for future reference to order the products with the FBLM by the name that&#x27;s coming directly from Liftmode they said. But for the product I would rate it about a 3.5 a 4 though if I couldn&#x27;t half it. I really want to try some other of the racetams to see the slight difference&#x27;s until I find the one that&#x27;s going to suit my mind and body to the max, this just wasn&#x27;t the one for ME.</li>
            <li> Sets your brain to a different tune, nothing limitless but puts a long term kick in your step. Low hours of sleep well be a side effect if you don&#x27;t set yourself a bedtime. Do your research for best results.</li>
            <li> IMOHO (and other opinions similar to mine which I have read) this is a very strong nootropic and it should be approached with a lot more caution than racetams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was pretty dramatically awesome in its nootropic effect at first. Truly felt like a massive advancement beyond the racetams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like all the prosocial, motivating, focus, and mood boost effects of low/moderate dose amphetamine but with zero stimulation, and with genuine strong nootropic benefits on top of that. It felt like my brain was super fresh and healthy and young. It blows racetams out of the water. More than once I noted to keep careful mindfulness of my condition since it seemed to resemble low-grade hypomania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked awesome for about a week. The d-amphetamine effects which came to a standstill after that, but nootropic effects remained. Then that week or so, a few side effects began, my sleep was totally out of whack (I would fall asleep like a rock, but then I would wake up feeling dead like I hadn&#x27;t slept at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting brain fogged and irritable. I would feel overwhelmed by just too much mental workings, sounds sort of felt jarringly loud. I would get overwhelmed and fatigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still hold out a little bit of hope, there&#x27;s people over on Longecity who seem to have made this one a daily staple without problems, including the one member who if I recall correctly has stabilized on insane dosages of ~100mg/day and still praises it. (I was taking 10mg-15mg)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect sunifiram is incredibly sensitive to the other pharmacological factors going on in your body, and you cant really combine it with everything like you can with racetams. Perhaps taking this once in awhile, or once a week would be most effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many things from LiftMode in the past and was always extremely satisfied by the quality of their products. Sunifiram is certainly no exception. With a 6mg sublingual dosage I noticed a definitely apparent increase in focus, motivation, and sociability, as well as a slight stimulant effect. I&#x27;m still on my first week of taking this on a daily basis, but the effects from the first day still seem to be staying strong. As of now, I plan on taking this daily with maybe a few weeks off every couple of months, which I like to do with most nootropics. Given the extremely small active doses (&lt;10mg), I feel like this is a great value, definitely on par with noopept price wise but IMO with better effects. There isn&#x27;t that much research behind this, so I would exercise some caution, but from my experience I see no reason to not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Terrible, waste of money!!&lt;br /&gt;Threw in the garbage</li>
            <li> This potion lifted my mood which is always pretty good anyway to another level. Attended a funeral on it and felt like I was much more in control emotionally than I would have been otherwise. It lasts for a about 2 hours. So it can be taken later in the afternoon and you can still sleep. Don&#x27;t need to say much about the Liftmode brand in general. Their reviews speak for themselves. Awesome company all around. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of PTSD, I am always looking for something new that may help in the battle, the reviews were decent so I purchased this. Unfortunately it does nothing after an extended trial. I feel no different.. Perhaps more of a placebo affect the anything.</li>
            <li> Hello, dear cognitive enhancers:&lt;br /&gt;  Firstly, let me warn you that this is a review of the reviews I recently read about this product and which have given me pause as to weather I wish to ever ingest it.  Also, I am getting older and perhaps due to my lack of cognitive enhancement have developed&lt;br /&gt;a tendency to digress, and further, to digress from my digressions.  Still with me enhanced ones?  I shall endeavor nonetheless to&lt;br /&gt;keep this relatively brief,as I question as to weather it will ever be displayed.  To due so would, possibly, not be good for future sales of&lt;br /&gt;this product, and, should I trouble myself to read the reviews of other &amp;#34;cognitive enhancers&amp;#34;, and review them as well, their sales as well might suffer.  And so, as briefly as I can, allow me to review please.&lt;br /&gt;  I can, on reading most of the reviews ,come to several possible conclusions.  One is that rather than enhance the cognitive abilities of the reviewers it has decimated them; yet in such a way as to lead them to believe it has somehow improved them.  I would hypothesize this from the fact that though the ability to compose and &amp;#34;put to paper&amp;#34; as it were, coherent, comprehensible,&lt;br /&gt;and dare I say intelligent  expressions of ones thoughts, feelings, views, etc. has deteriorated greatly over the last few centuries,&lt;br /&gt;the near incomprehensible, grammatically horrid, absurdly decimated attempts to express themselves via the written language by&lt;br /&gt;these cognitively enhanced individuals is, and let me correct myself here, as I will for the sake of brevity, now mention not  only the one, but, to me, all the most obvious conclusions; which are, as well as the aforementioned, that these people were morons to begin with. Forgive me, I meant to say mentally challenged. And that the drug either did, did not, or further limited rather than improved their cognitive abilities.  Who&#x27;s to say, having no examples of their limitations before the drugs ingestion? Let me conclude now (much to your relief, I&#x27;m sure) with a recommendation and an observation.  I recommend that all you would-be enhancers out there have someone of known natural intelligence, and who does not believe that spellcheck (Ha Ha) is the answer to&lt;br /&gt;writing coherently, read the products reviews before you purchase it.  My observation is that most likely all of you that have purchased an item from Liftmode, possibly even viewed them, is now on the DEA&#x27;s, and who knows who else&#x27;s shitlist . Which is not to accuse Liftmode of wrongdoing, although in the real world how many corporations wouldn&#x27;t sell their collective mothers for&lt;br /&gt;a dime, or a little pressure from Big Brother, but do you really think your personal information is safe from anyone with the will, let alone the means to hack it?&lt;br /&gt;  See ya in the detention center someday.</li>
            <li> I have had a great experience with Liftmode every time I&#x27;ve ordered from them. The products are shipped fast and I love the companies packaging. Out of the nootropics I have tried and continue to use, I feel like Sunifiram has some of the most noticeable effects. If you are familiar with racetams such as piracetam then you will get a lot of the same effects with Sunifiram. An advantage to using sunifiram over other nootropics is the extremely low dose you need to take to get effects. I take 10 mgs of sunifiram in the morning with noopept and have found that it brightens up my morning and makes thinking and getting going in the morning much easier.</li>
            <li> Ive been using Nootropics for 15 years and find this highly effective. The only problem is the fast down regulation making it only effective for occasional use. I alternate with other nootropics.</li>
            <li> Qualitative difference in fatigue and brainfog issues. Noticed no &amp;#34;side&amp;#34; effects, and can take it right before bed... No matter what kind of sleep I get any particular night, upon awakening, feel noticeably more awake, rested, able to function. Even on little sleep, when I&#x27;d ordinarily feel like death warmed over, the suni&#x27;s done something overnight to where I feel like I got sufficient sleep, or close to. I read a ceiling exists for some with this nootropic. I just ordered the largest size... Hopefully the blanking FDA, et al, won&#x27;t yank this out from under us. BigPharma could easily rake in bucks.... Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. You srsly will notice an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff, simply Amazing. Clear thinking, and helps with my anxiety thank you lifemode! I Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I purchased sunifiram from liftmode.  Upon opening the little jar it was clumped up in lots of little balls for the most part. I do not know if this is normal or not.. but no real biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a small microscoop sublingually and noticed nothing.  I tried larger scoops... multiple scoops.. still no effect.  For me this might as well have been placebo and I really have no interest in purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used noopept before and have noticed some of the general effects one receives from these compounds.. piracetam too, so I know that they can have an effective action. Sunifiram did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience purchasing from Liftmode.. They seem to be a fine company, shipped the product relatively quickly.. I think sent a follow up email.. No real negatives in the transaction, just the product did not work for me. If I am looking for another compound at some point and liftmode was the source I came across I do not see why I wouldn&#x27;t do business with them again.</li>
            <li> Sunifiram was my first foray into nootropics. I was looking for an over-the-counter to manage ADHD and \\&quot;brain fog\\&quot;. So I tried Sunifiram based on reviews and online research. I took it for about 2 weeks straight in very small doses (8-10mg) subligually. The impact was very powerful and almost immediate, with increased attention, clarity of thought, and verbal fluency. Also noticed some color enhancement, but not as much as others described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, even a small dose in the morning kept me amped up through the evening and my sleep cycle was completely f*cked. However, each morning after a dose of Sunifiram, I would feel mentally fine, even though I had only gotten 3-4 hours of sleep (due to the Sunifiram) and was physically exhausted. Obviously, this is an unsustainable cycle. Eventually, it caught up with me, and I completely crashed. Another contributing factor to stopping my regular usage is the fact that there are no human trials and there is very little anectodal support for the long-term safety of Sunifiram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m now reserving my Sunifiram for situational use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I have switched to Citicholine CDP and Phenylpiracetam (Phenotropil), which are milder and have been widely used for a while.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of scammers out there, but this is the real deal and it works great! This is actually the third Liftmode product I&#x27;ve bought and I have appreciated them all. I will try to go into more detail about my experience with Sunifiram when I have more time, but I wanted to make it clear that Liftmode is a company you can depend on for reliable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make the whole experience better, though I ordered two grams, for some reason they sent me five. Assuming that that is what they had on hand and I appreciate that rather than delaying my order, they sent that instead. An all around great experience.</li>
            <li> Liftmode provides a great price for Sunifiram. The best I have found for small amounts, in fact. I have purchased Sunifiram from Newstarnootropics and Nootropicsdepot, and Liftmode&#x27;s has the same physical appearance, consistency, and taste as the products from the prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though you shouldn&#x27;t take this as an expectation, I received 5 grams when I purchased 2 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great value at a great price.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I use this often. It was packaged awesome and was delivered quickly. We love it and it works!</li>
            <li> This sunifiram is legit. I definitely notice the effects within 30 minutes of taking it sublingually. It came with a certificate of analysis, two scoops, and the container looks good and seals tightly. The taste is quite bitter, but a swig of water will wash it away. 10/10 would order again.</li>
