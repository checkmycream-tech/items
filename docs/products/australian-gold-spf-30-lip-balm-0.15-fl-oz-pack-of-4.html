            <li>, i tried tones of products until someone gave me a free sample of this one,, then i found it here in amazon ,,,great product,,</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a position to need sunscreen lip-balm, it&#x27;s probably too warm to use this one.</li>
            <li>It melts very easily.  </li>
            <li>This is so far the best lip balm I have used to protect my lips from the sun.  </li>
            <li>I am a chapstick addict, and this is my favorite lip balm ever.</li>
            <li>It moistens lips and stays on better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>My kids loved it so much I decided to bulk order for stock stuffers.</li>
            <li>The lip balm works fine.  </li>

            <li>Best lip balm year round .  </li>
            <li>I like how smooth it feels.</li>
            <li>Maybe the original Orange Creme/Mint is what everyone raved about but that&#x27;s not what I received, though it is what is pictured in the Amazon add.</li>

            <li>Purchased my first tube of this lip balm at a retail store.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s above 85 degrees, don&#x27;t count on being able to apply it without it deforming so much that you can&#x27;t apply it.  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I think these taste fine - despite the other negative &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; reviews.  </li>
            <li> Note that the product listing says &amp;#34;Pack of 4&amp;#34; but the image is only a single lip balm.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the time for me to return/exchange it, but I wanted to warn shoppers that you might only receive one.</li>
            <li> NO MORE peeling or dry lips!!!  </li>
            <li> Within minutes i started experiencing this horrible chemical taste, reminds me of an &amp;#34;earwax&amp;#34; taste (yeah, I know, really gross).  </li>
            <li> Something is very wrong with inventory.  </li>
            <li> i got the kiwi-lime and it leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> However, it taste horrible!  </li>

            <li> My wife loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Only lip balm brand I use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made multi-tube purchases twice. This is really smooth, it doesn&#x27;t get melty/mushy in warmer weather.</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems to work fine</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! My lips are so soft. I only wish I could find it in stores. I always order it here.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm year round .  NO MORE peeling or dry lips!!!  A must try.</li>
            <li> It melts very easily.  If it&#x27;s above 85 degrees, don&#x27;t count on being able to apply it without it deforming so much that you can&#x27;t apply it.  I would get a waterproof version instead.  If you&#x27;re in a position to need sunscreen lip-balm, it&#x27;s probably too warm to use this one.</li>
            <li> I like it,,it keeps my lips soft , i tried tones of products until someone gave me a free sample of this one,, then i found it here in amazon ,,,great product,,</li>
            <li> Wanted an spf lip balm for summer - love that these came Prime and in a 4 pack - a must have for my purse this summer!</li>
            <li> i got the kiwi-lime and it leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.  I used it earlier today in normal fashion, applying liberally, etc.  Within minutes i started experiencing this horrible chemical taste, reminds me of an &amp;#34;earwax&amp;#34; taste (yeah, I know, really gross).  I wiped the product off.  Later in the day, I needed something on my lips so I thought I&#x27;d give it another chance, this time only on the outer parts of my lips and purposefully did not smack my lips in order to spread it around.  As it started to heat and melt however, there goes the taste again.  YUCK!!  I wanted to like this product, after all, I got 4 tubes and everyone else seems to love it w/such positive reviews.  I cannot recommend this Kiwi-lime balm though.  Maybe the original Orange Creme/Mint is what everyone raved about but that&#x27;s not what I received, though it is what is pictured in the Amazon add.</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold SPF 30 Lip Balm.  One of the best products I&#x27;ve found to prevent sun burned lips.</li>
            <li> Works so well and great protection when in the sun.  I like how smooth it feels.</li>
            <li> I am a chapstick addict, and this is my favorite lip balm ever. Creamy, long-lasting, and pleasantly flavored/scented. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Purchased my first tube of this lip balm at a retail store. My kids loved it so much I decided to bulk order for stock stuffers.</li>
            <li> I needed lip balm with a SPF of 30. Flavor is okay, but it gets really soft in the heat. I thought the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I think these taste fine - despite the other negative &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; reviews.  Don&#x27;t be scared to give them a try.</li>
            <li> This is so far the best lip balm I have used to protect my lips from the sun.  However, it taste horrible!  So, I put up with the taste to protect my lips.</li>
            <li> This is the LAST TIME I will order this product.  This is now the 2nd time I have ordered packs of 4 and all I get are packs of ONE!!!! Something is very wrong with inventory.  There&#x27;s probably robots packing the bags and then preparing them for shipment.  Sad because this is my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> The lip balm works fine.  Note that the product listing says &amp;#34;Pack of 4&amp;#34; but the image is only a single lip balm.  I ordered the four pack but only received the single lip balm.  It&#x27;s not worth the time for me to return/exchange it, but I wanted to warn shoppers that you might only receive one.</li>
            <li> This has the 30 SPF I wanted. It moistens lips and stays on better than others I have tried. The 4-pack and the low price make a good combo.</li>
