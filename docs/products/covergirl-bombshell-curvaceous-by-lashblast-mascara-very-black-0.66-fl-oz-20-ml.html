            <li>I also waited about 30 seconds between coats and found that that resulted in the best application.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it at all.</li>
            <li>but it was great!</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of getting it on without getting it everywhere, it was awesome.</li>

            <li>Anyway, I used the 1 side to build up the volume and it worked great.</li>
            <li>The 2 side is to build the color, which it did great.</li>

            <li>I love the fact that it is waterproof because I can look great without smudging when at the beach or pool with my summer camp kids!</li>
            <li>I see people complaining about it, but, honestly, you should expect (and hope) that your mascara doesn&#x27;t move!</li>

            <li>and I really liked it!</li>

            <li>It is wonderful and I love it.  </li>
            <li>NICE !</li>
            <li>Being able to choose between the sides is a great selling point!</li>
            <li>and I actually liked it!  </li>
            <li>Being able to choose between the sides is a great selling point!</li>
            <li>Works ok but not the greatest.</li>
            <li>EVERY LASH IS PERFECTLY COATED AND NO UGLY CLUMPS!</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look awesome and full!</li>
            <li>This is a very good mascara, I love that it is water resistant, so even when my eyes water from allergies</li>
            <li>Also be sure to have a VERY good eye makeup remover as this does NOT come off..</li>
            <li>It went on very easily (once I got used to the brush) and it didn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li>It did a great job, but didn&#x27;t do anything amazing to my lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing feels great on my lashes</li>
            <li>never wear eye makeup because I just don&#x27;t think it looks good on me, well after trying this Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara</li>
            <li>Good mascara,</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved how the product went on.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good for lengthening and also for adding volume.</li>
            <li>Both brushes are nice and the formula is great.  </li>
            <li>i loved this mascara.</li>
            <li>this is a good product.</li>
            <li>No clumping, lots of volume and  it even looks good through the lenses of my glasses.</li>
            <li>It has good staying power.</li>
            <li>But I loved it</li>
            <li>It doesn’t clump, and seems to effortlessly glide over your lashes to create a gorgeous look.</li>
            <li>This side is good at separating the lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s a lot of coats and work to get to a good look</li>
            <li>I knew it was going to be a good waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>but this is just as good.  </li>
            <li>I am a mascara junkie and pride myself on good products and technique.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll get over it in order for some good mascara.</li>
            <li>and she loved how it work</li>
            <li>I loved the mascara, it gave the va va boom i needed.</li>
            <li>The best part of this is I got this 100% free from my Influenster side.</li>
            <li>I loved the volume and the curl in this mascara.</li>
            <li>LOVED it besides that.</li>
            <li>Once I applied step two, I loved the look and had on complaints.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my eyelashes popped and curled when I applied the Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara by Lashblast.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I got this in my VoxBox for review and loved it.</li>
            <li>I found it to work nicely and was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I do have to use a good makeup remover to remove when needed</li>
            <li>I received the product for VoxBox testing purposes and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Upon recieving the item, I loved the packaging.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I loved this product from the moment I put it on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I used this mascara and loved it</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous by lashblast mascara totally free for testing purposes from Influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;It was awesome</li>
            <li>However, I really enjoy this product as well and it pairs perfectly with the volume the NYM Beach Babe texturizing shampoo and conditioner gives you!</li>
            <li>it creates gorgeous lashes without needing a eyelash curler, and doesn&#x27;t create clumps.</li>
            <li>good measure</li>
            <li>everything was good.</li>
            <li>so I recommend a good make up remover or some oil to help take it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clinique for years and this is just as good but at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Good job Covergirl</li>
            <li>and I Loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the brush is good for the lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn for decades and which create gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li>Almost TOO good...</li>
            <li>Wowwwww is great NICE GOOD</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THAT good! :)</li>
            <li>Make sure to have a good make up remover for when you want to take it off!</li>
            <li>True to their word of waterproof.first time I used it was at the beach, this stuff didn&#x27;t come off in the ocean!!!</li>
            <li>and it makes my lashes look so full!!!</li>
            <li>It coats and curls my lashes just perfectly in just the right shade!  </li>
            <li>If you want full beautiful eye lashes then this is the mascara for you!!</li>
            <li>But it did make my lashes full and beautiful!</li>
            <li>The packaging of the product is very cute and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Works great and goes on easily!</li>
            <li>It goes on great and really does make my eyelashes look longer and adds a perfect curl.</li>

            <li>I was super impressed by the way this stuff separated the lashes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super impressed!</li>

            <li>My eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>product itself is amazing.  </li>
            <li>now i may not be a fan of mascara, but this mascara is fantastic in my opinion (maybe its because i dont use it lol).</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes look amazing</li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li>My lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how I have curl and add volume with 1 tube.</li>
            <li>I am a mascara lover and go to is the orange tube of Covergirl Lashblast (not the waterproof kind)</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants the perfect lash!</li>
            <li>The wands and product are so nice.</li>
            <li>And I feel like I am ripping out my own lashes to get the mascara off.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara from Influenster for testing purposes, and I actually liked it.</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>So, when I received the Curvaceous mascara courtesy of Influenster.com, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are nice</li>
            <li>it goes on nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it and found that it did what it said.  </li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>It does not clump and makes them curl up on there own .</li>
            <li>Price is nice, too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really liked this mascara.  </li>
            <li>This one did that with side 1 and side 2 just kind of pumped up the volume a bit.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice if youre going out and don&#x27;t want it to come off</li>
            <li>Influenster gave me this and honestly for a drugstore brand</li>
            <li>But in my honest option this mascara wasn’t one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>(I’m still in the hunt for the one I can use on its own)</li>
            <li>the product did produce a nice lash, but at the cost of ripping my eyelashes out to remove it.</li>
            <li>so that was nice.</li>
            <li>However, as is, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it on my own.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It was nice for defining, but not quite spectacular.</li>
            <li>and i really liked it.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>and it goes on really nice,</li>
            <li>It wears longer than waterproof mascara, and not in a good way, i tried many times to remove with eye makeup remover and cleanser and it wouldn&#x27;t budge and frankly it hurt.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It stays forever (waterproof with removal by an oil based remover) and gives your lashes volume and a nice curve.</li>
            <li>Although I have to be honest it does not lengthen them.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are full and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Nicely done Cover Girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try this awesome product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I liked the look of my lashes after applying both steps.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get it in my box, but I was intrigued, so I went to purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li>tried this mascara and liked it.</li>
            <li>This is part of the Surfs Up Vox Box campaign, but I did purchase the mascara on my own.</li>
            <li>You have to be really adept at lash separating to fix the problem.</li>
            <li>I am reviewing this product for Influenster, but I did purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li>mascara was a downfall in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for another great product Covergirl!</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>But what I do love is a good mascara.</li>
            <li>This review is my own thoughts.</li>
            <li>I liked the two step process, as I think it helped to create a fuller lash look.</li>
            <li>I liked the staying power, which didn&#x27;t smear or run throughout the course of my day.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and I was absolutely thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it made my eyelashes pop.</li>
            <li>Besides, Covergirl makes their own.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how much this stuff made my lashes stand</li>
            <li>nice length, however, it is a pain in the butt to get off makeup remover or not.</li>
            <li>I have to say I really liked it.</li>
            <li>it seems nice, but I don&#x27;t think its for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Loving the way it makes</li>
            <li>I just got this product to try and review from Influenster and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received mine through Influenster&#x27;s voxbox program and I was really thrilled to try it</li>
            <li>I actually really liked this mascara to begin with.</li>
            <li>I loved being able to test this product</li>
            <li>I liked the look that I got from the two step process.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product and very happy with it!</li>
            <li>The results are so great, I think this is better than Maybelline&#x27;s The Rocket which has been my favorite for a while.</li>
            <li>It accentuated my lashes nicely and made them look thicker.</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect for plumping the lashes without wetting them so much that the curl gets relaxed.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it looked.</li>
            <li>given a good reason (important night with my guy) I would wear it for the look!</li>
            <li>It does make the lashes look nice and curled like promised</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes my lashes look amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it and ll buy again for sure :) !</li>
            <li>I was really excited because I had heard great things, and have yet to find an amazing mascara for my eyes</li>
            <li>This mascara went on very easily and feels light, but also adds great volume and length to my lashes.</li>
            <li>After receiving this complimentary mascara (for testing purposes) from Influenster , here is my review!!&lt;br /&gt;Great mascara!!!</li>
            <li>I love it is amazing product i love it!</li>
            <li>I got this free for testing purposes from Influenster, but ended up loving it!  </li>
            <li>The two together are absolutely incredible (and I&#x27;m very picky about my mascaras!)</li>
            <li>A good mascara is a necessity for every girl so getting it to try for free from Influenster is amazing.</li>
            <li>I really loved the waterproof aspect and it came off easily with an oil based remover.</li>
            <li>I honestly was surprised with how wonderful my lashes ended up looking with just step 1!</li>
            <li>easy application, good results &amp;</li>
            <li>i love covergirl, but this product is not the best, it is very clumpy and sticky, i do not recomend it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Once you do, it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and does give your eyelashes a fuller look.</li>
            <li>That being said, I found this very easy to use and serves it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that i LOVED the mascara!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite ones I have, definitely love covergirl!</li>
            <li>Specially when you are out partying all night!!</li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara!!!</li>
            <li>I received these products free for testing purposes from Influenster , I really loved the end results of this product and how there are no clumps.</li>
            <li>Bombshell curvaceous by covergirl is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best out of all the Covergirl brands!</li>
            <li>The formula is light, which is good.</li>
            <li>So happy I got this item complimentary in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best they have done so far.</li>
            <li>So far best masscera I have ever gotten !</li>
            <li>this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement for my old discontinued brand, and this worked perfect!!</li>
            <li>This mascara which i got as part of my #surfsupvoxbox from @influenster for free, was just the ticket for my fair</li>
            <li>So far this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li>I have loved &#x27;Cover Girl&#x27; since I was a teenager (many eons ago), and that love has grown even more since receiving the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara from Influenster.</li>
            <li>Thus one once again is great and sturdy for summer fun and splashing in the water.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Covergirl &amp; wish I could have tried it for FREE through Influenster, they have amazing VoxBoxes!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing in every way I love that it&#x27;s double-sided</li>
            <li>As a compromise, I am now just using Step 1 which in my opinion is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>This by FAR is the best.</li>
            <li>The concept of a two-step application is interesting, and step 1 works nicely.</li>
            <li>I was conscious of the rigid fringe around my eyes all day which doesn&#x27;t make for a very happy me...</li>
            <li>the one on side 1 was the one i liked the most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can safely say that the lashes I got with it were AMAZING.</li>
            <li>After that though it added a nice layer of mascara to my top lashes.  </li>
            <li>As a mascara junkie I am ALWAYS on the hunt for the perfect product to make my lashes long and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The first brush worked great on its own to give my lashes some pop.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to say that I&#x27;m so happy that I was one of the lucky ones who got it.</li>
            <li>it works great and the packaging is super cute.</li>
            <li>needed eye make up remover to take off but came off easy!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and makes your eyes a pop!</li>
            <li>This is one of the blackest mascaras I&#x27;ve found and also is easy to remove with makeup remover!</li>
            <li>and it comes off easily with makeup remover!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li>and I can end up raccoony easily, but not with this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Love this makes my eyelashes look very full!</li>
            <li>I tried it the first time without curling my eyelashes just to see what kind of lift it might provide, and it was entirely successful.</li>
            <li>I really liked it and it is very waterproof, which makes it great to use at the pool or beach.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciated that even in warm, humid weather, I experienced no smudging or flaking.</li>
            <li>I love using this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t run very easily.</li>
            <li>Great mascara for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl your eyelashes very much, but it gives great volume and length.</li>
            <li>Lashes look great, and very very waterproof.</li>
            <li>I do think this is a great mascara and even with my very own personal dislikes I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li>I love the formula - it&#x27;s clump free, very buildable, and makes lashes look almost perfect.</li>
            <li>first brush end is for creating a curled eyelash look, and the applicator does a great job of creating that curl</li>
            <li>Pretty great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this stuff&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>The first one is great from separating the lashes and giving them length and curl  </li>
            <li>The first mascara was great.</li>
            <li>However, this mascara does a really good job of volumizing my lashes and separating them to give a really full look.</li>
            <li>and this mascara is perfect for the dramatic falsie look which is perfect for day or transitioning to the evening!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of curling and darkening my lashes in a way that is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I love the easy two step process!</li>
            <li>I received this mascara complimentary to test out from Influenster, and I must say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure it is great at that too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and makes your eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>It works nice and removes easily</li>
            <li>It also has a nice design and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara free for testing purposes from Influenster, and boy am I glad that I did!</li>
            <li>I received this mascara for free from Influenster and love it!</li>
            <li>It is bright and appealing to the eye, and really made me want to try it out even more!</li>
            <li>It make your eyelashes huge and makes your eye pop!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge mascara addict!</li>
            <li>I love how there is no fallout with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have used it before</li>
            <li>I love that mascara.</li>
            <li>I love the ease in using.</li>
            <li>but the more I used it one or two more lashes would fall off and that got me scared</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes so much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes, and it&#x27;s not clumpy.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>It worked well for me and gave my lashes a lot more volume.</li>
            <li>but I got it as a trial and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>awesome mascara for someone like me with short eye lashes!</li>
            <li>The 2-step process really works great.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>Many not waterproof mascaras tend to smudge through the day and give me raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>just cause I have better mascaras that are cheaper.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it not only goes on well and with great color, but does not even clump!</li>
            <li>I just prefer a thicker variety with more &amp;#34;la la la&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at all sure why I&#x27;ve seen some reviews say that it&#x27;s clumpy bc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OKAY.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have something that will help you take it off at night it is def.</li>
            <li>I love the way this Mascara makes my lashes look.  </li>
            <li>I love the product packaging and design.</li>
            <li>I love how it has the two sides and that it helps curl your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Omg I love my cover girl bombshell curvaceous mascara.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>the packaging is kinda big and clunky but it&#x27;s the best drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>love how it is a two step process</li>
            <li>love the way I grab for that mascara more than the ones I have now.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough great things about this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>It has also given my lashes much more volume.</li>
            <li>I love this COVERGIRL Bombshell mascara, it gives my eyelashes volume.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love ever since.</li>
            <li>use a eyelash curler for better results).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I received COVERGIRL</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get my Bombshell look again :)</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Most often, I buy a salon quality/higher name brand mascara.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>With that being said - be sure to use an oil-based makeup remover to fully remove this product at night.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Removal was OK -</li>
            <li>absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara is okay.</li>
            <li>That was my favorite part.</li>
            <li>I received a free mascara for testing purposes from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>But I did love the results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love COVERGIRL PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>Found the product was heavier then most others.</li>
            <li>When i used it properly I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and i LOVE</li>
            <li>Received this product in an Influenster Vox Box, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Covergirl products and Lash blast</li>
            <li>is one of my favorite mascara&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the step one of this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love being able to try a product without having to buy it and risk not liking it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will repurchase</li>
            <li>I like more room to play.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed trying out</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I fell instantly in love.</li>
            <li>I love how each brush can be used separately or together for added drama.</li>
            <li>So, when appled correctly it makes my lashes look fantastic!</li>
            <li>It stays on all night and doesn&#x27;t flake off like most mascaras.</li>
            <li>I love this masacra</li>
            <li>Its quite chunky(packing wise) but its all worth it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>However, I do agree with many others that the clumping is an issue.</li>
            <li>I did end up with a result I am satisfied with and I will continue to use it</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see myself buying more to replace it once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m so glad Influenster gave me the opportunity to test it out for them, for free!</li>
            <li>I think I fell in love :))</li>
            <li>So I received a voxbox from Influenster and got to try a sample of Covergirl Bombshell for free!</li>
            <li>I would love it if I were going to the beach, but I&#x27;m not one for using waterproof every day.</li>

            <li>This is an amazing mascara that I got in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from @influenster and if it wasn&#x27;t free I&#x27;d buy it for sure.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not waterproof would love if it was waterproof.....</li>
            <li>i love the color and the feel and texture that they give to my lashes</li>
            <li>And well it didn&#x27;t really work that great on my lashes.</li>
            <li>But yeah I love that it has two brushes.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras....</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>I find that is okay</li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked better....</li>
            <li>I like to be able to wash my makeup off without using oiled based products.</li>
            <li>This mascara was just okay for me.</li>
            <li>I love the way the product looks when finished.</li>
            <li>However, the more i use it the more i am getting used to it</li>
            <li>Love this 2 step mascara.</li>
            <li>Love how it lengthens and makes</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my eyes look:)</li>
            <li>also no clumping here:)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use an oil based make up remover because it acts like a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love mascara, and was thrilled to get this product in my free vox box from influenster.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, I was aiming to try it out but lucked up on getting it in my box.</li>
            <li>I love it♡</li>
            <li>I love the curved brush and the way the mascara goes on.</li>
            <li>I love the look, but I need to know how to get the mascara off better besides loosing my lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes looked fantastic!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m so glad i did ..</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gives you a ton of volume for being a 2 step mascara I&#x27;ve seen better results on a one step and cheaper mascara.</li>
            <li>Some people might love this, I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This product makes me want to try mascara more now, which I think says a lot.</li>
            <li>MAN, my eyeslashes looked way better than they did when I was</li>
            <li>You do have to take time to make sure that it gets washed off.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I found one I love.</li>
            <li>I love CoverGirl mascara, however this one wasn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love CoverGirl mascara products</li>
            <li>However, I did fall in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>Brush 1 is my favorite-</li>
            <li>so make sure to use an oil-based product when removing this mascara.</li>
            <li>So it was not my favorite</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>There are much more better mascaras out there in the beauty market than this.</li>
            <li>I love that this mascara comes as a 2-step process instead of one.</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t clump up my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>I also like mascara better when it has one wand and no two because I think it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have always layered two different mascaras, so this is perfect for me!!</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love how my eyes has popped more with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the two sides and they work well together</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most eye makeup removers as they tend to be too oily feeling for me</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my eye lashes look.</li>
            <li>That may not necessarily be what YOU want in a mascara, but it&#x27;s perfect for me &amp; I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my lashes with this mascara</li>
            <li>I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes and so far am very impressed.</li>
            <li>the tears on top of that</li>
            <li>it did not irritate my eyes like most mascaras I love it and will continue to use bombshell volume mascara</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I love the curved side because I don&#x27;t have to use a curler.</li>
            <li>but I was able to take it off with liquid eye make up remover without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you use an oil based makeup remover like the one from Covergirl to remove it.  </li>
            <li>The double ended wand is a wonderful tool which helps speed up my application, it brings my eyelashes up and out, without a lot of fuss!</li>
            <li>If you enjoy having people compliment your &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34; eyes, try Bombshell Curvaceous Lashes!</li>

            <li>but I have tried way better.</li>

            <li>I think this is a pretty good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on I could tell how good of quality is was.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty good although I would not purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>Wipe the applicators first (always a good tip anyway.)  </li>
            <li>The first coat/brush does a good job of depositing color, volumizing, and the curved brush head does its part in getting those lashes to go up.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product,</li>
            <li>I wore this for 12 hours and was impressed that it did curl and lengthen my already long lashes.  </li>
            <li>I liked the first part of it, it separated my lashes well and kept them from clumping which I loved but the second step wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try it, as I have always loved Covergirl products.</li>
            <li>i like the way it elongates my lashes and makes them look more full!</li>
            <li>I received the full-size courtesy of Influenster, and was excited to try it!</li>
            <li>but I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it!</li>
            <li>I love how full my lashes are!</li>
            <li>Lifts, lengthens and brings major lash drama... in a good way!</li>
            <li>Great new mascara</li>
            <li>I love that it is easy to use</li>
            <li>the top coat made them even longer and waterproof but it came off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I love the curled wand because it makes applying the mascara easy.  </li>
            <li>I love how you get 2 applicators and goes on easy no clumping.</li>
            <li>Love how it went on and washes off easily for being waterproof.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this mascara is that it was truly waterproof and it came off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and love that it gives you volume on your lashes.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product through a complimentary testing service called Influentser, and it was by far the best thing I recieved.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the mascara, but goodness it&#x27;s a huge tube!  </li>
            <li>Received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster (love these guys and COVERGIRL for participating!)</li>
            <li>I love that it lasted all day and looked amazing right up until i took it off.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays put all day, for lush, beautiful bombshell lashes.</li>
            <li>I love how side one coats all the fine lashes and side 2</li>
            <li>Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara is the best mascara i ever use i love how it douset smear and some other mascara.</li>
            <li>Just when I thought I couldn&#x27;t love anything more than the original Lashblast or Bombshell Volume by Lashblast Mascaras, COVERGIRL went and did this.</li>
            <li>My lashes clump together and don&#x27;t look very full.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product through Influenster and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got it for free in my surfs up voxbox from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I was able to try for free through influenster.com.</li>
            <li>The curved wand gives my lashes a great, professional looking curl.</li>
            <li>Like many others on here, I received a free sample of this mascara through Influenster for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I received  this item free from Influenster to test and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>And the second step gives your lashes incredible volume.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara as a free sample and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Received this prouduct free for testing through Influenster and totally love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this mascara for free from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>Got to try this product for free from Influenster and definitely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, it made my eyelashes look big and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I made sure to put on a light coat</li>
            <li>I was able to try this mascara for free through Influenster.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, not only was it free from influenster but works great too.</li>
            <li>I was able to test this product for free using #Influenster in my #Surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li>This was my first dual-wanded mascara too, and I was very pleased with its turn out.</li>
            <li>The curved one is ideal for the upper lashes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to test this out because I absolutely loved this mascara.</li>
            <li>Plus it keeps my lashes curled all day too (which is good for this girl with straight lashes).</li>
            <li>I always buy CoverGirl mascara products, so I was thrilled when I received the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster to test.</li>
            <li>but the pros are makes your eye lashes longer and coverage is good for a whole day</li>
            <li>I loved the way the product worked and made my lashes really stand out.</li>
            <li>You really have to have a good eye makeup remover in order to get this off without some of your lashes falling out.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good product on the whole.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Covergirl lash blast is still probably my favorite mascera, but I love bombshell for a special occasion, or if I have a bit more primping time since it does take a bit longer to apply (totally worth it though!)</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this mascara for free from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>I love how side one separates and makes my lashes individualize, then curl and then BAM, side 2 lengthens and makes my lashes long and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>it makes my lashes full!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and shape is automatic!</li>
            <li>I received it complimentary from Influenster and have already bought another tube! :)</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it out, but I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty ingenious!</li>
            <li>Other than those issues, the mascara formula and wands were great!</li>
            <li>I used sweet almond oil, and that did the trick!</li>
            <li>I love the Covergirl Bombshell Curvasceous mascara that I received for complimentary testing purposes from Influenster!</li>
            <li>But not a bad product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to remove with some makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to come off when needed.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, and I didn&#x27;t need to use a billion coats.</li>
            <li>My lashes were defined, shiny, full, incredibly long and had great curl!</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and applies easy.</li>
            <li>so I can tell you if that&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>The two wand system is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The curved brush was easy to use.</li>
            <li>but i guess that will make for easy finding in your purse.</li>
            <li>I found this mascara easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It applies on easy.</li>
            <li>but it came off extremely easily with a swipe of makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I love my mascara and eye-shadow and am always looking for the next great thing.</li>
            <li>It went on so easily, and the brush never gives clumps.</li>
            <li>but that was easily fixable by using the brush to remove the clumps.</li>
            <li>Easy to use too.</li>
            <li>I sweated most of the day, but my mascara still looked great later in the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take off with just some make-up remover.</li>
            <li>Step 2 was just as easy:</li>
            <li>The formula did come off easily with make up remover (I use almay&#x27;s version).  </li>
            <li>Both steps are easy to apply...</li>
            <li>I would rather have a 1-step mascara with an easy applicator.</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t that easy to use.</li>
            <li>And easily comes off with an oil based remover.</li>
            <li>It clumps and gets on my eyelids easily before drying and then doesn&#x27;t remove without an oil based cleanser from the eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Also, it clumps easily so watch out.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I did notice that it got clumpy really easily and that it smudged off onto my skin a lot.</li>
            <li>These things are easy to fix but is a bit of an annoyance.</li>
            <li>The # 2 side made what I already put on with the # 1 side clump up a bit but was easy to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to remove with baby oil.</li>
            <li>I love having this mascara on hand for days that I want a simple, beach-like look, but I do not use this to get dressed up and look great.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply with the curved brush.</li>
            <li>makes it easy to find in the bottom of my purse.</li>
            <li>It makes it easier for me to easily apply mascara to all my lashes.</li>
            <li>I was very excited and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive a full product as a tester, but I was not all that impressed with the product itself, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore this particular mascara, I cannot tell you how many friends commented on how great my lashes looked - thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>but this one is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead so that could be why I wasn&#x27;t completely wowed with the color, BUT this color looked absolutely amazing on my daughter!</li>
            <li>I think it makes my lashes look more full...</li>
            <li>I loved the volume and length of my normally skimpy eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a more intense eye, or for a simple day look.  </li>
            <li>First you apply the curling lash mascara, on a nice silicone, lash separating wand,  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference with step 1, but after applying step 2, my lashes looked longer and more full.</li>
            <li>The first step has a nice brush that separates your lashes &amp; lengths them well.</li>
            <li>It gave me big beautiful lashes that popped.</li>
            <li>I applied the first coat, it seemed kind of sticky and clumped my lashes together instead of building up the product which I thought it would do.</li>
            <li>A much more cost effective product than splurging on high end makeup that doesn&#x27;t quite get the job</li>
            <li>love that i can get the best of 3 worlds, use one of the fabulous brushes, or use both for an EXTREME curvaceous blast of beautiful lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this mascara, I have lash confidence and I am excited to wear it all summer long!</li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with the definition and length that this mascara was able to achieve.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend for someone with fine, shorter lashes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a raccoon after getting caught in the rain, it was smooth going on and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>It would take me a while to take everything off, but that&#x27;s perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>The first wand separates every lash flawlessly and the second adds volume without clumping.</li>
            <li>Side one was fine though.</li>
            <li>My Mary Kay oil free eye makeup remover took it off easily though even though it is waterproof.</li>
            <li>step one is fine but</li>
            <li>I removed it with a cream eye-makeup remover, and it came off just fine.</li>
            <li>First off I just want to say I love cover girl products, but this product is just ok in my book.</li>
            <li>but I used the covergirl oil based makeup remover and it came off just fine.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful when you&#x27;re in a real hurry and barely have time to put on mascara, period.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how my lashes grew and just popped by only using the first wand.</li>
            <li>This mascara has quickly become one of my favorite mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great volume with just the right amount of curl to it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with getting the mascara to come off with my makeup remover (or just soap and water) but it also stays on really well through the day (or more!</li>
            <li>I tried Covergirl Bombshell one time and absolutely fell in love!</li>
            <li>Always a plus, thanks to Influenster for letting me try this product free!!</li>
            <li>If you want a mascara that really brings out your eyes, you will love covergirls bombshell curvaceous mascara!</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster for my free sample!!</li>
            <li>Side 1 does a wonderful job of curling and separating the lashes, while side 2 makes them look more thick and full; side 2 gives the impact!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I got to try this product thanks to Influenster, and you better believe when I am in the market for a new tube of mascara</li>

            <li>i also love the fact that its water proof and quite easy to take off with the right makeup removal.</li>
            <li>Even though there are 2 steps, just as easy as any 1 step mascara and well worth it!</li>
            <li>The curved end works better thAn the straight over all works fine but could be better</li>
            <li>Super excited to tru this ad I&#x27;ve heard so many things about it</li>
            <li>Love this mascara and was super excited to get one for free from Influenster.</li>

            <li>I received this through influensters surfs up vox box and was super excited to try it!</li>
            <li>By the time I managed to get most of it off, my eyelids were bright red.</li>
            <li>Its also a huge pain to get off, oil or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mascara made a huge difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li>I usually am a huge advocate for cover girl make up.</li>
            <li>I already was a huge fan of CoverGirl and use their products among others.</li>

            <li>and I enjoy it, but I do think the size could be an issue at some point.</li>
            <li>but I always go back to Maybeline great lash.  </li>
            <li>I may never go back to great lash.  </li>
            <li>I probably would not repurchase, thankfully I got it for free.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling cemented; they were still flexible and felt fairly light.</li>
            <li>but if you look from the side there is obvious difference which makes me happy.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary by Influenster and I gotta say I love it.</li>

            <li>I received this mascara for free from Influenster for testing.</li>
            <li>This mascara has a formula that does apply smoothly, but then gets sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I received a free cover girl bombshell from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>I got this product free to test from Influenster.com  in my #SurfsUpVoxBox.</li>
            <li>When I tried to move on the second step, I experienced a lot of stickiness and clumping.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara for free from influencer for free to try and review</li>
            <li>The first coat was pretty good, if a touch clumpy.</li>
            <li>I usually only get cover girl brand and most of them are good</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in how curled this mascara makes my lashes because I already have a good natural curl.</li>
            <li>you need a good eye makeup remover to take it off completely.</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFUL LONG LASHES</li>
            <li>i used it twice last week, i loved how it curled my lashes since i love the look</li>
            <li>It makes me lashes look long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>After applying the first coat, it felt a bit sticky but pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is super cost effective and does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I really love how easy &amp; fast this mascara covers!</li>
            <li>The curvaceous part sure is right.</li>
            <li>I love Cover Girl mascara products, so when I received the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster to try I was excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge mascara wearer but always love a good one!  </li>
            <li>It really coats and lengthens my lashes without getting clumpy and it stays on all day!!!</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of mascara and very rarely use it.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of mascara and very rarely use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and very worth it.  </li>
            <li>Mine is a very rare allergy, (I can&#x27;t even take immunizations) but</li>
            <li>My lashes are already long and all I need it a wand to separate them and the large rounded wand works best.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;d be good for a dressy full face, but I love that it gives just enough curve on one swipe to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a pretty nice mascara, with good color and definition.</li>
            <li>The two step process is quick and easy and keeps it from clumping together.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of the Influenster VoxBox, and while I was totally stoked that this was a full size freebie - when I tried it on, I wasn&#x27;t so happy.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy to take off though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about quick &amp; easy &amp; this is it.</li>
            <li>this is much more about lengthening than volumizing but it goes on smoothly and looks pretty.</li>
            <li>This will be my new mascara until something better comes out!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>My new favorite eye product!</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I was highly skeptical when I received the Bombshell mascara, because I had honestly lost hope of anything working to make my eyelashes look beautiful and full again.</li>
            <li>I would buy with my own money and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Over all it is a great mascara that goes on easily and quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>glad I was able to check out this new mascara courtesy of @influenster as part of my #surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s important to note is the special technique of washing it off at night.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a good eye make up remover because it a little bit more water resistant.</li>
            <li>The color power is good, and it easily hides my white lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so lightly and fresh feeling, non sticky, no smudge and easy tomalley, not to mention my lashes are like 300% longer than before.....</li>
            <li>If you like really bold lashes this is great, especially for a night out.</li>
            <li>Both sides do different things, but makes my eyelashes look amazing!</li>
            <li>Very much worth it!</li>
            <li>(I had to go buy remover for it) but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I already have full eye lashes and always enjoy highlighting my finer quality...</li>
            <li>and I was soooo excited.</li>
            <li>I love how the first step lengthens and separates my lashes and step two adds volume and plump.</li>
            <li>I originally received a complimantary sample from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster!</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I received a full size tube of this mascara from Influenster for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Since this is the first time I used this type of mascara, maybe it&#x27;ll get better with use.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product in my Influenster box.</li>
            <li>I was sent this mascara complimentary from Influenster!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the first side the brush it</li>
            <li>I was able to try Covergirl&#x27;s Bobshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara thanks to Influenster!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it</li>
            <li>Removal requires an oil-based product, but so worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara thanks influenza tear you rock !</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Great long wearing and waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>and it worked a lot better than the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My first thought was that it made my lashes fabulous!</li>
            <li>I got it from Influenster in a VOXbox, and because it was complimentary and i was asked to review it, i was sceptical!</li>
            <li>I received this mascara complimentary from influenster for testing purposes!</li>
            <li>I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster!</li>
            <li>I placed Step 1 on and I was immediately excited.</li>
            <li>Got this in my Influenster box to test which I was so excited about.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed by my Bombshelling look that this mascara gave my lashes.  </li>
            <li>and I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I was excited since I do like to wear mascara.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time the other day and it make my eyelashes look awesome!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try it</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I received a full sized product free from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>You truly can put on as many coats as you like of the first side without your eye lashes getting clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was sooooo excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Received in my influenster box that I received complimentary for testing purposes!</li>
            <li>I washed my face first and then used the Mary Kay eye make up remover and was able to remove my mascara without ripping my eyelashes out like some might have done without an eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>I love how much they pop when I wear bombshell!</li>
            <li>It worked pretty okay.</li>
            <li>I love Covergirl eye makeup products and was very excited to try this new mascara.</li>
            <li>The first step of this product is great, very simple easy to use primer/base.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster and was in love with it the first time I tried!  </li>
            <li>I think Covergirl hit the jackpot with this new formula because this mascara is so amazing for my lashes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make (my) lashes super huge looking.</li>
            <li>As far as the actual mascara, I thought it was great!</li>
            <li>That said, once it&#x27;s on and dry, it&#x27;s a great mascara.</li>
            <li>Another point worth mentioning is that it does act like a waterproof mascara and doesn&#x27;t just wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li>And I wear less make up because if its beautiful bold curves!</li>
            <li>Loving this so far!</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive a full size product and couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out.  </li>
            <li>:) Just make sure to have an oil-based make-up remover because it is kind of hard to take off. :)</li>
            <li>It went on very smooth, with no clumping really.</li>
            <li>I love how innovative this piece is to begin with (double wand stick), and the color stands out strong.</li>
            <li>but when I do for special occasions I put the mascara on and people always notice  and say they make your eyes pop Pow.</li>
            <li>in all, I probably would choose this mascara for special occasions when I want that amped up look.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t stand out in any special way to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I do love the large fat wand though.</li>
            <li>This mascara gives me a glamourous look for any special occasion.</li>
            <li>Nothing entirely special.</li>
            <li>Just isn&#x27;t the right mascara for me!</li>
            <li>I definitely would not wear this every day, but it was good for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing in the future, on the bright side</li>
            <li>I still like the CoverGirl Lash Blast clump clusher a bit better because it gives nice long, separated lashes.</li>
            <li>Although this mascara costs more, it gives me the option of a normal clump free look</li>
            <li>The first coat went on great, but once I put the second coat on it became sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I really had to get creative to get all of my lashes</li>
            <li>I loved the larger sized container as it makes it easier to locate amongst my drawer of products..</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li>If you want good mascara that isn&#x27;t going to hurt your wallet, definitely buy this!</li>
            <li>it could really have a greater impact,</li>
            <li>However, I love the mascara so much that I will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li>but I also feel it&#x27;s a good value with the 2 different looks you can get from this product.</li>
            <li>This product does add a lot of volume, separates lashes, but it makes your top lashes stick to your bottom lashes (very sticky).</li>
            <li>What I love is that it really does make my lashes look fuller and curled, even without using the curler.</li>
            <li>The cool think is</li>
            <li>How cool is that ?</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It was true to color.</li>
            <li>I received a full size version of this mascara from Influenster.com for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It is a true stay-put formula.  </li>
            <li>It made my lashes look longer and really full.</li>
            <li>I can never get my eyelashes to look good and with this they actually do.</li>
            <li>It stays on even after a whole day and my lashes sure looks thicker and fuller with it.  </li>
            <li>Overall good mascara.</li>
            <li>(I received it free courtesy of Influenster and CoverGirl, so it was definitely worth the try.)  </li>
            <li>I find my lashes look full (and feel full too), look longer and after removal</li>
            <li>My eyelashes weren&#x27;t as full at night as they were in the morning, but they still looked fuller and made my eyes look brighter than if I had not been wearing any mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>I love side 1, but side 2 doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I received a full size tube from Influenster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good solid choice for mascara.</li>
            <li>I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast complimentary free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Looks good, doesn&#x27;t clump but the tube is way to fat and the wonds are too short.</li>
            <li>With this mascara, however, my lashes appeared full and curled.</li>
            <li>I currently use Covergirl&#x27;s Volumizing Mascara and love it, but I have to say that I enjoy that one much more than Bombshell.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t as full as i would like.</li>
            <li>, makes me feel like I have better control of how much goes on.</li>
            <li>Goes on good &amp; seems to last.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the mascara definitely lengthened and curled my lashes without being clumpy.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is really, really water proof so make sure you have oil based make-up remover</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>:) I would highly recommend this mascara and will be buying this when my tube runs out!</li>
            <li>If you are like me and love that intense lash effect then this will not do your eyes justice.</li>
            <li>OVERALL this is a good product</li>
            <li>Overall, easy application &amp; fairly great results, especially if you have shorter lashes :)</li>
            <li>And on top of that, my lashes look super full and long and amazing.</li>
            <li>The first side went on fine but nothing to be super excited about then adding side number 2</li>
            <li>This mascara was probably my favorite drug store mascara that I&#x27;ve ever tried, it will probably be my new go-to mascara when I need something quick and cheap.</li>
            <li>The color is strong and it does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>They were bold and full of life besides what is given from my lash curler.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to put on and it didn&#x27;t clump up or anything.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara for free last week from Influenster to try and love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently received this product for free from Influenster and it is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I think this product is great for summer.</li>
            <li>Other than that , it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great product by COVERGIRL.</li>
            <li>But overall very satisfied with  the product I wouldn&#x27;t complain too much :)</li>
            <li>I love when my eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; &amp;  the new Bombshell Curvaceous Lashes by  Covergirl does just that!</li>
            <li>Love this new mascara!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love trying new products and thanks to @Influenster, I was able to try this one for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample from influenster, and it does give a great look, with a few tweaks on tube design</li>
            <li>The first want was fine,</li>
            <li>Its fine comb will separate all your lashes evenly with the first step.  </li>
            <li>No clumping and super results.  </li>
            <li>I figured i would see how it would hold up to a quick swim in the pool.</li>
            <li>It applies evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Great staying power, especially with hooded lids in heat and high humidity - no smudges or transfer!</li>
            <li>But lucky for me I am a product junkie</li>
            <li>I was able to try this out like many others with Influenster and while I wasn&#x27;t wowed by it, it still actually did a goo job of pumping up and filling in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adequate for day use, but not for a bold night look.</li>
            <li>This mascara also did not wash off with just water and mild soap, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I will most likely be purchasing this again :)</li>
            <li>Just put super glue on your lashes</li>
            <li>but I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries rather quick as well.</li>
            <li>I did have some clumping issues but it wasn&#x27;t anything I could fix quickly.</li>
            <li>Other wise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I love this and highly recommend buying.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d stack up against my high end brand mascaras</li>
            <li>However, the best feature of this mascara is that even though it is waterproof, it is easier to removes and causes less irritation with removal than my normal mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it was marketed as a waterproof mascara, but other than that it&#x27;s a very nice mascara.  </li>
            <li>The issues I have are that first the tube is HUGE.  </li>
            <li>At first I was amazed at how huge the tube is.  </li>
            <li>First of this is HUGE for a mascara.</li>
            <li>So I just received my first Influenster box for free from influenster.com</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara, it&#x27;s not what I normally buy, but i decided to give it a try</li>
            <li>I received the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous free from Influenster and tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick &amp; it doesn&#x27;t clump like so many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I received this Covergirl Bombshell Mascara FREE in my influenster surfsup voxbox to try for free and I will definitely use this and buy more.  </li>
            <li>With just 1-2 steps i feel pretty important.</li>
            <li>The packaging for the product is very pretty and girly also.</li>
            <li>I received this free from Influenster to try and review, which was really neat!</li>
            <li>it looked very promising!</li>
            <li>but this review is based on my very first time testing this product out.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth having to use true makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li>I felt like it gave me good length and volume and stayed on a long time.</li>
            <li>I have short and straight lashes, so I absolutely love any mascara that can give me nice lashes.</li>
            <li>The 2 sides feature is great you can have either a glamorous Hollywood look or a cute and subtle look.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the mascara is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I received it complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes in my Surf&#x27;s Up VoxBox, and I was excited to try it right away.</li>
            <li>Though I love trying new mascaras every time</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I love trying new mascaras</li>
            <li>I think I may have found my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>To me is the only downfall since I normally don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara, but this is great for &amp;#34;girls night out getting all dressed</li>
            <li>Great black color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight which I love, and it really is waterproof.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight which I love, and it really is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Its an awesome two in one; I sometimes use each end individually; each brush is different... or use them together for super volume and pretty lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love the curve of the first brush, it makes it easier to apply the mascara and really lifts lashes up.</li>
            <li>It came off really gently and easy with my oilbased makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good mascara, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I love mascaras and is probably one of the beauty products I use the most because I haven&#x27;t been blessed with long lashes.</li>
            <li>First, the wands are too short; I couldn&#x27;t reach all my lashes in order to get good coverage on them.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who wants very bold and noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s two steps, which I normally don&#x27;t like because it ends up too heavy but worked perfectly in this case.</li>
            <li>It made my eyes beautiful with curved lashes while stilling keeping the natural beauty mixed it.</li>
            <li>This mascara is point-blank perfect as long as you&#x27;re only in the application or wearing stage.</li>
            <li>It applies easy and drys fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after I saw some lucky friends who received this product in their Influenster vox box complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re looking for an absolutely waterproof mascara for swimming or just a hot summer day, it certainly isn&#x27;t the kind of mascara</li>
            <li>Not only did my top and bottom lashes stick together upon every blink throughout the day, I&#x27;m pretty sure they all fell out when I attempted to remove the mascara.</li>
            <li>and I actually like it more than I thought I would!</li>
            <li>Overall I love it though and recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>That was the first time I had a mascara stay on at the beach!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s works pretty well!</li>
            <li>My lashes are big and amazing, but I get more smears than I normally would.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this once I run out!</li>
            <li>I really like Covergirl&#x27;s Bombshell mascara!!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this mascara has definitely bombshelled its way into my Top 3!  </li>
            <li>I usually use department store brands like Clinique , but for a drugstore brand mascara this was good!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I really love this mascara!</li>
            <li>and this gives me just enough to be able to show mine off!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says !</li>
            <li>Overall, one of my favorite mascaras!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited.  </li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>The 2 step process sounds like it should do something really amazing for your lashes but really doesn&#x27;t do any better if even as good as other mascaras in the same price range.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it so far!  </li>
            <li>Like really waterproof!!</li>
            <li>(I never wear mascara because I have contacts in all day and normally end up touching my eye lashes and getting it everywhere) and it actually looks really nice.</li>
            <li>I definitely look forward to using this more!</li>
            <li>bombshell curvacecous made my eyes smokin hot!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sexy waterproof look!</li>
            <li>I got this mascara as part of a Birchbox &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; box and was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascaras are high-end brands, and I rarely experiment with new cosmetics you can find at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I am pretty easy to please and this is the first time I ever wrote to a company to complain about a product.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty easy and stayed on without making my look like a raccoon after a hot, humid night on the water.</li>
            <li>The first step made my eye lashes super curly and full.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is fine (doesn&#x27;t do much lifting and curling)</li>
            <li>My lashes weren&#x27;t clumpy or heavy after this which was pretty surprising after two steps!</li>
            <li>My lashes are not really long and this mascara really does a good job of creating length and curve to my lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its a pretty good product and while it doesn&#x27;t give me super long lashes</li>
            <li>The first step is pretty easy and the applicator is nice, but the second step...</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m wearing it, but with the lashes this gives me I&#x27;m willing to overlook it on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When it was all done was easy to clean away no mess!</li>
            <li>The 1 side of the wand doesn&#x27;t clump up your lashes and makes them super long and the 2 side of the wand makes them more voluminous!</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t excited to try it, since I was very loyal to my old mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super waterproof, which I love and it doesn&#x27;t flake off like many other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Bold, clump free, sky high lashes, I was even asked if I was wearing falsies the first time I wore it!  </li>
            <li>The primer &amp; mascara are very easy to use, &amp; you do need more of a light hand to apply it, but the end result is very heavy lashes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster for my free sample.</li>
            <li>The mascara bottle is huge, and it takes up so much room in my make up box.</li>
            <li>I got to try this product free from Influenster and I must say I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really separates the lashes and makes your eyes look bright and open.</li>
            <li>For starters, it is very sticky after two light coats, my lashes were all clumped together and spidery.</li>
            <li>and it still looks amazing on the second day!</li>
            <li>Great for a night out but not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth pumped up my lashes and gave so much volume.</li>
            <li>The second step is suppose to volumize them and make them darker which I don&#x27;t feel it did amazingly on.</li>
            <li>and I rated this 4/5 stars because it gives nice, simple, more natural looking lashes.  </li>
            <li>Great price and the mascara hold on all day, not clumpy, not flaky, makes my lashesh huge and thick.</li>
            <li>its a great brush so when applying its actually giving you length in your lashes,my lashes are light and short but covergirl</li>

            <li>Received this for testing purposes complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>Not for someone who prefers a more natural lash look.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have your oil based makeup removed on hand when you&#x27;re ready to wash it off - it really does stay otherwise.</li>
            <li>But I liked it overall.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary Bombshell mascara from Influenster for testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li>It makes me actually want to wear it more since I now have one (which I received free from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes) to use.</li>
            <li>The first one aligns my lashes to keep them looking full.</li>
            <li>I did receive this mascara complimentary as a tester from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.</li>
            <li>- I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who thinks a little extra time in makeup removal is worth the stunning look perfect for day or night, that this mascara provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first step lengthens and curves your lashes and the second top coat intensifies and sets the mascara!</li>
            <li>The 2 side is made of the traditional nylon bristles, but it has a unique tapered cone shape that is able to reach all of the lashes and thicken and darken them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a bit more &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34; then some of the other mascaras I use, but it&#x27;s not over the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely very black and provides great coverage and volume.</li>
            <li>but other than that I enjoyed and probably will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of this product that it builds volume first then adds bold blackness to the lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is an overall good product it is kind of big to hold in your hand however, it is a easy applicable would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I will stick with my other Covergirl mascara, you know the good one.</li>
            <li>but it is good other than that</li>
            <li>I really was excited to receive this for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>when I apply it, it coats every strand with its dark, beautiful goop that makes my eyelashes look sexy, long, and full.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the two steps since I already do this with two other mascaras.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this mascara from Influenster and was excited to see if it really made my eyes &amp;#34; pop&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is surprisingly lightweight, and it doesn&#x27;t feel any heavier than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The other brush is good for the lower lashes.</li>
            <li>Overall I loved it and would highly reccomend</li>
            <li>It was also very pigmented which made it very black, which I absolutely loved!</li>
            <li>I threw it right in the garbage</li>
            <li>, I remove my eye make up with organic coconut oil and it came right off.</li>
            <li>It curls, lengthens and adds just the right amount of drama!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But on a positive note, the mascara doesn&#x27;t budge at all!</li>
            <li>Using just the first formula is makes my lashes look amazing, the second formula makes them look all clumpy.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times and am pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I have used it a few times and am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I generally need heated eyelash curlers to get any curl into my lashes but even without a curler, this mascara adds enough curl to look great.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and have not after long wear (which is great as I am sensitive by the end of the day).</li>
            <li>If you love mascara that leaves your eyelashes full and curly definitely try this mascara.</li>
            <li>If I want to look more natural I just use the first step.</li>
            <li>I liked the separation I got from first coat and the fullness from the second.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great mascara if your just looking to have a quick fresh up in the morning when running late.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product by any means, it just requires a bit more extra work.</li>
            <li>The second step clumps very easily and does not brush out well.  </li>
            <li>I love the first side, it is reminiscent of the lash blast mascara (my go to mascara) and works by itself for a day to day clean look.</li>
            <li>I like the two different brushes, very quick and easy to use once you get used to the tube, which is pretty bulky.</li>
            <li>It may very well be my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to @influenster I recieved a covergirl Bombshell mascarra in their #voxbox to try out, I’m More than grateful for the opportunity to try out new products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big size and easy to fit in hand.</li>
            <li>First application was somewhat smooth; first removal, not so much.</li>
            <li>Great mascara for everyday wear!  </li>
            <li>At first I was annoyed that there were two steps to put it on, but now I am willing to do it because the mascara is so great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M HAPPY TO SHOW OFF EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li>I first received this product through  complimentary Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad mascara, it didn&#x27;t really do much  for volume, but it added some length and lift to my lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are fairly long, but not very dark so anything to help see them is great.  </li>
            <li>This mascara has really nice length and makes your lashes soooo long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always up for trying something new, and when I received a free sample of COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara from Influenster</li>
            <li>I tried it right away, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I was lucky  enough to receive this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and it did wonders on my lashes!!</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer of using 2 different types of mascara at a time to get the best outcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Clinique mascara fan my whole life.</li>
            <li>Super intense-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s black and looks good if you can get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>It might be perfect for someone who likes a natural look and who are already blessed with thick lashes.</li>
            <li>I teach Kindergarten and am constantly on the go, so I think this will be a great mascara to last all day for me.</li>
            <li>Really lengthens and then side two fills it in to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>I like my make up routine to be quick, so the 2-step process didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.</li>
            <li>The first brush didn&#x27;t do much, and then the second brush added a little more, but I honestly get better lashes with my telescopic mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But be careful it will clump if ya put on too many layers !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stoked that I got it free and will continue to use it, but once I use it up, I will go back to my normal favorite mascara - the orange Lash Blast, also by Covergirl.</li>
            <li>After the first wand, I noticed huge length to my eyelash while the second wand adds volume and that beautiful dark color!  </li>
            <li>i liked it the first time but the second time when i went out for the day i noticed it was very sticky.</li>
            <li>My lashes look huge, long and full when using Bombshell mascara!</li>
            <li>I probably wont repurchase this particular mascara, but I love the other CG mascaras. :)</li>
            <li>Cool new product!</li>
            <li>very very sticky.</li>
            <li>I have lashes that are very straight and do not hold a curl well.</li>
            <li>VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use mascara very much</li>
            <li>I just opened my Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast mascara in Very Black, and am really happy with it so far!!!</li>
            <li>The wand was very easy to use and apply, however it did take quite a bit of product to get the long lashes I desired.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, but it&#x27;s never difficult to get off!</li>
            <li>it added a good amount of volume, but it did get just a little clumpy sometimes.</li>
            <li>I was excited for a new mascara</li>
            <li>First, this mascara, I would say, is very much waterproof.</li>
            <li>find the formula to be very dark and of a good viscosity.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it</li>
            <li>is my process, first I curled my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The first side is ok, but as soon as I go to put the second side on, it just clumps.</li>
            <li>Normally I love Covergirl, but this time they definitely missed the mark.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it I notice that one or two of my lashes would fall off</li>
            <li>Side one did curl the lashes pretty well</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely lengthens more than volumizes.</li>
            <li>but it gives my lashes so much volume!</li>
            <li>After the 2nd coat it looked even better ..</li>
            <li>It held up really well all day!</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily!</li>
            <li>I used it specifically on a hot weekend, sweating through a horseback riding day and then a day at the pool.</li>
            <li>And this mascara really coats the sparse lashes I have, spread them out, and lengthen them!  </li>
            <li>It thickened my lashes, but not in a pretty way.</li>
            <li>really plumps up the volume!</li>
            <li>I was pretty scared to try this product</li>
            <li>first step lengthens my lashes&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>second step made it more thicker</li>
            <li>The second side plumped up my lashes and I feel really confident in this product, just after one use.</li>
            <li>I love the two separate brushes that helps to give your eyelashes a different look.</li>
            <li>Next time I use it I will be sure to have purchased the makeup remover.</li>
            <li>But step 2 really helped!</li>
            <li>Love the effects, just think if the brush was smaller an thiner</li>
            <li>the first time i tried it i thought it was a two part mascara (which its not)</li>
            <li>I love the double wand.</li>
            <li>and I actually really like it!</li>
            <li>And makes glop-eyes more likely.</li>
            <li>The second side if definitely more for nights out (which I use in combination with the first).</li>
            <li>But they do make my eye lashes look pretty.</li>
            <li>At first I was kind of skeptical because most of the reviews weren&#x27;t so hot , but then I tried it for myself and if you apply it lightly</li>
            <li>After putting on the first coat, my eyelashes stuck together.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to rest the back of the want on the palm of my hand, almost like a pencil (</li>
            <li>I will be attending next week though :)</li>
            <li>This mascara really carries the curves!</li>
            <li>It really lasts all day too!</li>
            <li>The first day I used it</li>
            <li>I  am not an avid mascara user</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear mascara much except for Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash mascara once in a while for church or when I go out with my husband.</li>
            <li>I have tried many department store and drugstore mascaras for my short blond lashes.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to every girl.</li>
            <li>I curled them first with an eyelash curler</li>
            <li>This stuff really stays on!</li>
            <li>I received this mascara last night compliments of Influenster completely free!</li>
            <li>From the first moment I put on this mascara</li>
            <li>It really stays put!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I played with it and did several layers</li>
            <li>It left some on, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>First you apply the #1  mascara that will give volume to your lashes and then you apply the #2 to seal the lashes.</li>
            <li>The difference between my naked eyelashes and the ones with the mascara is visible , the first pic has more length and definition.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Amazed with the results!</li>
            <li>Also it does not clump up is pretty is to take off with baby oil.</li>
            <li>Adds fullness and volume to make your eyes really POP!</li>
            <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who asks!</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t my first go to</li>
            <li>Thanks you influenster for allowing me to try it!</li>
            <li>I love how they&#x27;re is 2 different sides to this.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I look for in a mascara is if it  makes the lashes longer and this did just that.</li>
            <li>If I closed my eyes or even blinked my eyes kind of stuck together.</li>
            <li>I recommend letting the hot water in the shower run over your face and then use an eye makeup remover to get any residue off.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look much fuller!</li>
            <li>However I ended up really liking it!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I want from a mascara.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the first week</li>
            <li>be wiping it off more in the future to see if it helps.</li>
            <li>I think that I will use them both together most of the time, but I can see myself only doing one side from time to time as well.</li>
            <li>Will be using this when I need that bigger lushious look. :)</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my fault</li>
            <li>I have used multiple covergirl mascaras that I love</li>
            <li>I would rate it a lot higher.</li>
            <li>The first step is curved and allows you coat every lash evenly.  </li>
            <li>It even stays on pretty well while swimming .</li>
            <li>It has great lengthening ability in my opinion, but it was too thick and made my lashes stick together...</li>
            <li>After using side one the first time, I was already pleased with the appearance of my lashes, and the look only improved once I used side two.</li>
            <li>However, my curl still only lasts a couple hours at most.</li>
            <li>The wands are very short, I will guess from top to bottom it is around 1.5 inches (maybe 2 inches</li>
            <li>(I wore it for over 9 hrs and no issues) even in hot sunny days when you might be sweating.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I enjoyed this product and will probably purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, I had to walk around granite warehouses with no air conditioning for 4 hours...</li>
            <li>First of all, I like the color of the mascara tube.</li>
            <li>Thanks Influencer!</li>
            <li>If you are an expert mascara applier, want heavy super long eyelashes, and don&#x27;t mind taking 15 minutes to clean just your eyelashes, this might be a great product....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I had never tried a double brush mascara before, and it is definitely an interesting experience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying different brands and this is one I may have to purchase more than once.  </li>
            <li>I love how there are two different types of wands.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a sacrifice that I&#x27;m willing to make.</li>
            <li>I lost eyelashes for real, people!</li>
            <li>The second brush gave them a fuller look and more volume.</li>
            <li>At first I was kinda iffy because of the way the bottle was shaped</li>
            <li>I got this in my first influenster VoxBox.</li>
            <li>Overall its a ok mascara .</li>
            <li>So, yeah, it works pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact the first time I tried it I stabbed myself in the eye.  </li>
            <li>I like this mascara only because it makes my eyes show more</li>
            <li>Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li>Really made my eyes pop!</li>
            <li>which was a surprise the first time I poked myself-</li>
            <li>My eyes really POPPED!</li>
            <li>Never have I used a mascara that made my eyelashes pop so much!</li>
            <li>Thanks Covergirl!</li>
            <li>The first end is rubber which I&#x27;ve never tried before,</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>eyelashes, but overall I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>but I really like this!</li>
            <li>Received this to try as part of my Influenster VoxBox -- really like it!</li>
            <li>I can use just one side or both sides to really amp it up!</li>
            <li>This mascara definitely isnt my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>I decided to use my simple mascara when I am in a hurry, and the COVERGIRL bombshell mascara when I am going out and want to look sexy.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favorite mascaras now.</li>
            <li>It does actually help my lashes to curl up more, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it a lower score.</li>
            <li>I just tried this today and &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; is pretty much exactly what I have to say about it.</li>
            <li>mostly made it think and a tiny bit clumpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it as backup but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice by any means.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says, Bombshell Curvaceous.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy this product again :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see that it was waterproof, but I will be interested to see how it does at the pool on 4th of July.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!  </li>
            <li>However upon trying the dual system first applying the curve then the thickening mascara</li>
            <li>The first is for curling and volumizing.</li>
            <li>must say it works very well!</li>
            <li>It really has staying power!</li>
            <li>really makes my eyes pop!  </li>
            <li>I initially thought this would be more of a primer/mascara duo</li>
            <li>My lashes on top stuck to my tiny lashes on bottom.</li>
            <li>and at first can be kinda sticky till it dries.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>The first time I screwed up and did two coats of the Step 1</li>
            <li>I’m one of those people who love the “spider” look of my eyelashes, and this mascara not only has one but two mascaras to give me that look.</li>
            <li>I really love that it has the two different brushes, allowing you to hit your  lashes from every angle.</li>
            <li>First thing I didn&#x27;t like were the mascara wands, I found them to be bulky</li>
            <li>Besides the weird smell, its pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>As far as removing the mascara as long as you have a good waterproof makeup remover</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my lashes more noticeable, but is a lot of work to get off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back to my outstanding Lancome duo--Hypnose Drama and L&#x27;Extreme--&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, the long lasting mascara is great until you have to take it off.</li>
            <li>The mascara is okay overall</li>
            <li>A few of my friends loved this mascara so I&#x27;ll be giving it to one of them since they asked to have it.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I do makeup wise everyday is my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for something that will last through a good gym workout and make my lashes look long (they are not) and full (they are not).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, creates thick full lashes.</li>
            <li>Stays on long, and easy to put on!</li>
            <li>Overall, this mascara is a great long wearing lengthening mascara!</li>
            <li>Thus far, I have had zero problems with clumping or smearing, plus it behaves just like waterproof mascara, so I&#x27;m good to go all summer long!</li>
            <li>the wand is short and the container is bulky making application less than ideal.</li>
            <li>I like how well it stays, but it went on super thick and clumpy, so it took a lot of time for me to get it looking good.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to remove with a little coconut oil (I prefer to use natural products when I can)&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad</li>
            <li>It was somewhat similar to Elf&#x27;s mascara which is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have naturally long eye lashes that curl on their own, but this mascara gave it a nice little boost that my eye lashes needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m already a fan of the lashblast formula and large, plasticy brush and was pleased overall with this product as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wants full lashes</li>
            <li>It have me a rich black color, flake free and tons of volume!</li>
            <li>I was actually using the original bombshell before I received this in my voxbox from influenster!</li>
            <li>I also had best results with scraping off a lot of the mascara from the second wand since it was so heavily coated, being brand new and all.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t work fast enough, it does get a bit clumpy, but it made my lashes HUGE!</li>
            <li>I recently received this product to try for free complimentary of Influenster...</li>
            <li>:) The only thing i really didnt like was side one bristles.</li>
            <li>While I do think it looks good once on my lashes, it is very sticky and heavy feeling to me.</li>
            <li>gotta say it worked really well probably better than the regular brushes.</li>
            <li>I got this product free from Influenster recently and thought I&#x27;d love the second side because it had a fibery brush versus the first side, which was the plasticy, curved brush.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s great ad worth a little extra effort</li>
            <li>I received this totally free to try and review from Inflenster&lt;br /&gt;While it does make them super long  </li>
            <li>I wear mascara and eye liner pretty much every day</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is pretty reasonable.  </li>
            <li>girl bombshell mascara really makes your eye lashes look full and fabulous all day long</li>
            <li>It is just as great as the more expensive brands I have tried!</li>
            <li>could not believe HOW much thicker and longer my lashes looked after just ONE application with the first step.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my long lashes look.</li>
            <li>Keep it real people ;)</li>
            <li>I ended up really liking this mascara (I&#x27;m wearing it now), but the first couple of times I used it, I had to get used to it.</li>
            <li>- if you use this mascara it is pretty much a must have to use a oil based eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>I love longer lashes because I don&#x27;t have long ones and they enhance your looks.</li>
            <li>If you want a mega volume boost, do a little more of step 1; if you&#x27;re feeling like you&#x27;d like to accentuate more length, do a little more of step 2.</li>
            <li>really like it, this is the first time i&#x27;ve ever tried Covergirl mascara.</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for a good mascara that lengthens, curls and volumizes my lashes for the past year.</li>
            <li>(I even skipped my usual eyelash-curling step, and got good results).</li>
            <li>I did have a little bit of the clumping issue others mentioned, but I found I was able to fix it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I recently got this in an influenster box and although it is a decent mascara I feel Covergirl has better (clump crusher).</li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of mascaras and this one holds its own against even more expensive</li>
            <li>have very straight lashes that can and do go unnoticed, it takes a lot to make them look nice.  </li>
            <li>but this was so shiny it reflected white and made it look like the full areas of my lashes had holes!</li>
            <li>Definitely a must buy for those of you seeking those luscious and full lashes!</li>
            <li>I love how long and separated my eyelashes look with this product and it stays put ALL day!</li>
            <li>I love that there were two different brushes with this mascara, because I was able to get the volume from one side and the intensity from the other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars due to my very own personal unliking.</li>
            <li>I probably would use this for a special occasion when I have a little more time to get ready.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the mascara itself, or if it&#x27;s the fact that my eyes are super sensitive when it comes to mascara.  </li>
            <li>and like it, it&#x27;s easy enough to put on</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a problem for me given that my skin is super sensitive with make up.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t like my make up easy to remove.</li>
            <li>it just seems like a dry brush to comb your lashes to give them more separation ....</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t come off as easy as they say.</li>
            <li>I have three rows of lashes and find it difficult to find a great mascara for naturally full lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and last all day without clumps.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is easy enough to take off</li>
            <li>I could see myself using this on a daily basis easily.</li>
            <li>I curled my lashes as normal (they usually only stay curled for a couple of hours at most)</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t work better than the ones without primer, plus it made my lashes feel dry.</li>
            <li>Both steps were easy to use and I would use it next time</li>
            <li>Very decent mascara.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that there are 2 steps, rather than the easy mascara you apply once when you&#x27;re running out the door in a hurry.</li>
            <li>The color is dark and gives such a great curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never loved Cover Girl mascaras, but I recently tried this mascara and it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>Loved the step 2, it helped create a long lasting look.</li>
            <li>I would have to press the handle area against my face in order to reach certain area of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I find it is rather large and not that convenient.</li>
            <li>it will smart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new go-to mascara!!</li>
            <li>great mascara and easily removed with cold cream or make-up wipes</li>
            <li>It is a great solid black, and stays.</li>
            <li>Performing step 1 that second time helped better distribute the mascara that was laid down for volume, and it helped add more length while avoiding clumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a fan of COVERGIRL mascaras and buy more expensive brands, but when I received this complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes, I fell in love!</li>
            <li>The tube is too bulky and the wands are too short, it ran a LITTLE bit in very humid hot conditions, but it applies great and gives an amazing false lash look, change the tube and I&#x27;ll be a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>For a quick and on the go day, I will normally just throw on some mascara to make my eyes a little wider and more pronounced, and this really did the trick!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and it dries pretty quickly between the first and second coat.  </li>
            <li>received this mascara courtesy of Influenster.com and am writing this review for product testing purposes - that said, the product has been tested and approved by this particular user!</li>
            <li>While there are some things I loved about the product (bold color, dramatic lashes) the negatives outweighed the positive.</li>
            <li>then I use two and my lashes are super long and bold.</li>
            <li>but side two did clump the lashes a little bit, but overall it did make my lashes look great.</li>
            <li>It does take a little bit more time to do both steps every morning, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>The shade of black is dark and bold and it provides great, even coverage.</li>
            <li>The product is hard to take off but with a good oil based makeup remover it should come off.</li>
            <li>Even if you use a good oil based remover it is still somewhat hard to get it all off.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the two steps was necessary but there actually is a huge difference when you apply both.</li>
            <li>This mascara actually makes my lashes look like huge faux Kim Kardashian lashes, without having to glue anything over my eyeball.</li>
            <li>Overall though, a great product that I will add to my everyday routine.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes stay curled throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this mascara.</li>
            <li>nothing really separates.</li>
            <li>I also really soak the cotton pad with remover which may be another reason.  </li>
            <li>also use Lancome Drama waterproof mascara and would rate the Cover Girl just as highly!</li>
            <li>The mascara is not marketed as waterproof, but takes some time to remove with my makeup wipes, so it could probably withstand some light water although I have not personally tested it as such.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like how it&#x27;s dual tipped.</li>
            <li>I diodes not clump or anything I agree on it being sticky, but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>Thanks covergirl for making a product that is in everyone&#x27;s price range.</li>
            <li>It goes on without any clumps and very evenly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I like the chunkiness of the tube, but I don&#x27;t really see the need for the &amp;#34;2-step&amp;#34; process.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really made my lashes look thicker though.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes stand out and really accents my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really you guys should check it</li>
            <li>It does however make lashes pop and curl really well.  </li>
            <li>Although it has the curved wand it really didn&#x27;t help curl my lashes.</li>
            <li>I really like the formula of this, but one shortcoming, literally.</li>
            <li>but i absolutely recommend this if you dont mind the difficulty of removing it.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to testing this product</li>
            <li>It really lengthens and defines lashes well and doesn&#x27;t cake on like some defining mascaras.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pump up the volume of my lashes that much.</li>
            <li>I tried this today, I like the two steps - that really seems to make a difference in the plump/long lash look.</li>
            <li>I have really been liking the curve and length that this product is giving me.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>COVERGIRL wanted to give us a product that embodied a bombshell, and I have to say I really think it lives up to its name.</li>
            <li>I really like the step one brush, it really gets between each lash to amplify and separate.</li>
            <li>it stays on really well</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil to get it off and it does really well</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look much longer.</li>
            <li>It looks like I have a lot fuller lashes than I really do.</li>
            <li>This mascara really lasts.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample from Influenster.com for testing purposes, and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I felt like it really did curl my lashes and make them look fuller, longer and darker.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want it as intense</li>
            <li>I like how much fuller they looked</li>
            <li>It really did lift and define my lashes while making them look voluminous.</li>
            <li>I typically only wear mascara on a day-to-day basis because my eyelashes are so light.</li>
            <li>That is even when I don&#x27;t build the mascara up much.</li>
            <li>Yet, it is very durable.  </li>
            <li>and I really like how it defines my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t clump them.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I found it to work really well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really separate the hair that well.</li>
            <li>This mascara was definitely better than I expected.</li>
            <li>once I have been asked if my eyelashes were real or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it does not wear off throughout the day, does not smear, and even stayed put through a very vigorous workout in a non air conditioned place.</li>
            <li>Mascara is my absolute must when venturing out</li>
            <li>and I feel like it made my eye lashes look much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tries to get it off but as far as making your lashes look great, it definitely does that.</li>
            <li>I have been a Maybelline mascara for years and this didn&#x27;t really change my mind.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t add much curl.</li>
            <li>Thanks covergirl and influenster</li>
            <li>it really add volume and lenght to my lashes.this</li>
            <li>thanks cover girl and Influenster.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I got this prodcut from Infuenster and I think the whole two sided mascara is overrated.</li>
            <li>It really helped to make my lashes pop.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very big and doesn&#x27;t fit well in my make up bag that I carry in my purse.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very unattractive.</li>
            <li>so much ive never had a mascara that doubled the length of my eyelashes like this.</li>
            <li>Really provides length and curl plus has endurance.</li>
            <li>With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this Covergirl mascara, which I received complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have blonde lashes, and they are very... unnoticeable on their own and even when i am using a lot of different brands of mascaras.</li>
            <li>and it really thickens them.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for some help with my shirt, blond, straight lashes.  </li>
            <li>I like this product it works very well and holds curl.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I found it to be very clumpy on my eyelashes though.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>it really makes my lashes fuller and longer and its not playing when it says its waterproof.</li>
            <li>not so much the feeling.</li>
            <li>When you look from the front, there is still not too much difference</li>
            <li>and it also is very sticky</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>To begin with I want to say that I am really picky about my mascara.</li>
            <li>You absolutely need to use makeup remover to get it out of your eyelashes and</li>
            <li>It really helped darken and curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>it is that it doesn&#x27;t really come off too well with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li>and this mascara really pops up my lashes.</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;bleeds&amp;#34; onto my skin (I have very oily skin)</li>
            <li>but I have used this product before and really like it.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t volumize much, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look thicker.</li>
            <li>Really brings out your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have to start off by saying I&#x27;m very picky with my mascaras.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>when using both i really cant tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I do like this product even though the whole things is to bulky and really dont feel the need when using it to use both sides because i cant see any changes.</li>
            <li>I had very noticeable longer thicker fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li>This mascara really curled my lashes and gave them a ton of volume, and</li>
            <li>There are two different wands in the tube, however I honestly don&#x27;t see much difference after adding the second step.</li>
            <li>It thickens my lashes really well</li>
            <li>When you are ready to take it off, it takes a lot of work with an oil based cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This mascara really is the BOMB.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes i feel its lasting feature is important than getting is washed away with oil based liquid.</li>
            <li>That really helped define and separate my lashes.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is having to buy make up remover that isn&#x27;t oil free</li>
            <li>Then it dries SO fast</li>
            <li>But the color is intense and it does give volume which I like.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>All in all, it does thicken and lengthen like it says but takes to much time to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>, I ended up really liking the mascara.</li>
            <li>Stayed on really well.</li>
            <li>I must say that I really do like this mascara.</li>
            <li>This really gives you the maximum bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>It pumps up my lashes so much.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it off very well with removers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear mascara very often.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am really picky when it comes to mascara</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It also wears very well.</li>
            <li>Using both sides clumps my lashes too much (hence the 4 stars).</li>
            <li>I got this in an Influenster box, and though I have no brand loyalty for mascara, I do tend to really like Cover Girl.</li>
            <li>Mascara can really change the look of your eyes</li>
            <li>I received this for free for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li>It also makes it feel like there isn&#x27;t much makeup in the tubes</li>
            <li>The plus side is that this stuff it really water proof.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much curling with Step 1....</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find a mascara that really lengthens and makes them noticeable without spending a lot of time curling and layering lots of product onto them.  </li>
            <li>To really test it, I didn&#x27;t curl my lashes ahead of time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really got nothing to say about this stuff.</li>
            <li>Overall like the look and enjoy using it</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara for the stay put factor.</li>
            <li>and was very eager to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m very picky about mascara</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I got it early today as a complimentary test product from Influenster</li>
            <li>Thanks to influenster</li>
            <li>Also I didn&#x27;t really follow the instructions for taking it off with an oil based makeup remover</li>
            <li>This mascara made my lashes appear much longer and fuller without looking clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I got this product to try compliments of influenster, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t much for using mascara before I tried this</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this mascara for ladies with similar lashes to my own.</li>
            <li>Lastly, this does remove nicely with regular makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I love curvy, dark lashes and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The formula was nice in that I could build a few coats to increase the intensity to my liking.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I liked the first and second coats, but it got crispy and dry.</li>
            <li>I live in the south, where it&#x27;s hot and humid during the summer.</li>
            <li>It is a good mascara, it gives big eyelashes just not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Very good product, and you can really make a dramatic look with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very waterproof and you&#x27;ll need actual make remover to clean it off.</li>
            <li>most other mascaras do.</li>
            <li>Mascara is my one key makeup item, so I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good, but a bit gimmicky.</li>
            <li>When applied normally, my lashes look thicker and longer, and they did not clump!  </li>
            <li>mascara is a good deal larger than your normal mascara and has two wands attached to the center part and two reservoirs of mascara.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>It plumps the lashes way better then the other mascaras out there.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t flake like so many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once its on it doesn&#x27;t flake off like many other brands I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I felt that it worked as well as the other CoverGirl Lashblast mascaras, which I really love and added a lot of volume.</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>personally use covergirl mascara, so i was excited to recieve this product.</li>
            <li>On the other hand if you already love layering mascara this won&#x27;t bother you one bit.</li>
            <li>The product is double ended and contains two kinds of mascara which you layer for a unique look.</li>
            <li>There are other mascaras from this brand that work alot better.</li>
            <li>This mascara tends to clump more often than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>I give it a four star because it does not come off easily but other than that it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Alone, the two mascaras do very little, but together they do give me a nicely curled, intense look.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants full looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I love that its double ended and is not rough on the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>So, if youre willing to put in the extra work to take it off, its worth it 100%.</li>
            <li>the extra clean up since it dramatically changes the look of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and really makes my lashes look long and curvy.</li>
            <li>After a full day of swimming, and NO running of the mascara I really put it to the test and the only thing that removed it was an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this mascara for like a working girl in a professional setting or a girl who likes a bold but natural make up</li>
            <li>I liked this mascara especially with long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I Find the coverage and the shape of the want very helpful on the hard to reach areas but what i live most of all is the durability and makes my eyelashes stay nice and curled for a long time.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s very easy to apply although I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my everyday mascara</li>
            <li>Overall the product is good, however, it could use some slimming down.</li>
            <li>: the # 1 side lays down a nice mascara that seems to thicken up the lashes, the side# 2 curves the lashes and seal it in making it near indestructible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Overall the product is good, however, it could use some slimming down.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s defiantly worth it to spend a few extra bucks on COVERGIRL&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara, I just absolutely love this item!</li>
            <li>I liked how it made my eyes look, very dramatic, would be lovely for a night out</li>
            <li>So I only use it for special nights out</li>
            <li>but I do feel like the black was more intense</li>
            <li>This one really thickens and lengthens much more than a typical waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have super straight and short lashes.</li>
            <li>The last two times I wore it, I was short on time, so only used the #1 side, which seemed to make my lashes look just as good.  </li>
            <li>Give full eyelashes that last all day.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>but I did not see as much volume than my normal length.</li>
            <li>Also looked very shiny, normally I like a glossy coat of mascara</li>
            <li>However, you have to use a true make-up remover to remove this product (I generally only use face wash); however, that is also a testament to the staying power of the mascara throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous definitely gave me the full volume i was looking for.</li>
            <li>But soaking for at least 5 seconds using Almay oil-free eye makeup remover worked wonders and I&#x27;ve found it removes more cleanly and easily than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either, just middle of the road.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the fact that this clumps super easily, and feels incredibly heavy on.</li>
            <li>Amazing made my lashes look full and dramatic.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and long lasting too.</li>
            <li>I will say that the 2 times I used the mascara #1 side only, it seemed to remove more easily, but not totally sure about that</li>
            <li>Made my whole day a little better...</li>
            <li>My new fav!</li>
            <li>This is one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li>It took my lashes to new lengths!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nurse and work long, hot, 12-hr shifts and this mascara can stand the test!!</li>
            <li>the tube is too big.....makes it too hard to handle.....as far as the mascara ....does not go on as good as i like......</li>
            <li>Love the curved wand, really helped open up my eyes and elongate my lashes and the flat wand</li>
            <li>It makes them seem much fuller and lively.</li>
            <li>The mascara didn&#x27;t run or flake and love black under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t achieve the amount of volume that I typically like and ended up putting a coat of my favorite mascara on over it.  </li>
            <li>I just had to be careful when applying because it clumps easily.</li>
            <li>While I had no problems removing it, that may be because I only use removers for waterproof eye makeup and only two top brands - Lancome and Clinique.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras all from different brands.</li>
            <li>I received it in my Influenster Box to try :) Definitely gives my short lashed some length and volume!</li>
            <li>But it is decent.</li>
            <li>im really particular about mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my lashes look so long and full.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a decent mascara.</li>
            <li>What is nice is you could use one side wait until it&#x27;s empty and then use the second side.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive the CoverGirl Bombshell Curvaceous mascara in a VoxBox provided Influenster.com.</li>
            <li>I have super short eyelashes</li>
            <li>I have always been searching for a product that will not only enhance my top lashes, but provide the definition for my lower lashes and this definitely helped.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that the wand is kind of clunky and makes it harder to control application.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>I love that it has 2 different wands for different effects.</li>
            <li>Glad I got to try this product and will definitely buy in the future.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again though because it&#x27;s a decent price and works well.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a decent, well-priced performer that is convenient to get then give this a shot.</li>
            <li>It did give decent volume though.</li>
            <li>Out of the various mascaras I have received recently this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>only thing I wish it did a better job of was making my individual lashes look thicker.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy it again and the price is very reasonable!</li>
            <li>and I was impressed by how long and thick it actually made my lashes.</li>
            <li>Great dark black color.</li>
            <li>SO many people are complaining that it is hard to get off, but i found it easy when I used a simple eye make up remover!</li>
            <li>Also I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you buy an oil-based eye makeup remover to remove this mascara.</li>
            <li>Before trying this mascara, I had high hopes it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascera!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>All in all if someone were to ask for a mascara recommendation this would go high up on my list.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was highly recommended after the #surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with a little</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again if they changed their packaging to something a little more application-friendly and sleek.</li>
            <li>All in all, really great product if you are looking for some serious drama and lasting ability!</li>
            <li>I like the product, it can be kind of sticky and can also be hard to get off.</li>
            <li>I really liked this mascara, however it was hard to remove even with waterproof makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>so it was kind of hard to use because of the size.</li>
            <li>I liked the mascara, it stayed on all day, but was hard to take off when I wanted to.</li>
            <li>Almost as quickly as I applied it, my lashes fell flat as well as my hopes.  </li>
            <li>The first wand is fine, but for as big as the tube is, there&#x27;s not much to go around and the wands are really short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a little trouble getting it to come off, but overall I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually care for waterproof, too hard to remove, but this great mascara!</li>
            <li>This is like concrete on your lashes.</li>
            <li>I was impressed and shocked.</li>
            <li>While it looks GREAT it is extremely difficult to get off and makes your eyelashes brittle.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara for everyday use.</li>
            <li>To me it is like a normal mascara, but with a 2-step process.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it now and use it everyday</li>
            <li>They look long and full.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally one to say, why make it two steps?  </li>
            <li>and he said, &amp;#34;your eyelashes aren&#x27;t as clumpy...and look longer&amp;#34; and his normal response would have been, &amp;#34;am I supposed to notice something different&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I’m not gonna be completely harsh on this mascara because I did love it when I would pair it with falsies</li>
            <li>I recently received this mascara complimentary form Influenser for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it curled or made my lashes look any thicker than my normal mascara,  </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look long and full.  </li>
            <li>It was a lovely everyday type of mascara.</li>
            <li>Normally I use waterproof just for the staying power</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to higher end brand mascaras like Dior or bare minerals</li>
            <li>making my lashes look full, curved and long.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I think is worth mentioning is that this stuff won&#x27;t budge off your lashes.</li>
            <li>It make my lashes so full, bolld and long, I have tried all brands of mascara</li>
            <li>I felt like the double application was really worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off all over my face during a normal work day.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with Step 1 because I usually have to separate my lashes because they are so thick.</li>
            <li>I probably wont purchase again just because most mornings I do a five minute makeup routine and this does not fit into my normal routine.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to do one eye at a time though because I waited too long between 1 &amp; 2 so one of my eyes was clumpy when I used the second brush.</li>
            <li>but overall it wasn&#x27;t bad.i received this product complimentary for testing purposes from influenster.</li>
            <li>It makes your eye lashes full and long without making them look like spider lashes.</li>
            <li>Most of the mascara ended up staying clumped on my lashes for a few days.</li>
            <li>I feel like the first step really lengthens my lashes and the second step adds volume.</li>
            <li>I received a full-size Bombshell Curvaceous complimentary from Influenster &amp; COVERGIRL in my #SurfsUpVoxBox, and I will definitely purchase another when mine runs out</li>
            <li>Even my husband, who is the most unobservant human being in the universe when it comes to my makeup noticed how long my eyelashes</li>
            <li>Like any waterproof product,  takes some work to remove but the time is well worth this amount of definition and volume at the same time.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use make up remover to take it off (or even just lotion on a cotton round).</li>
            <li>in which I normally just put on eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I normally use high-end sample mascara freebies from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I normally use covergirl mascara that is waterproof.</li>
            <li>I love how long lasting the mascara is.</li>
            <li>This mascara is really good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>The application is really easy, and washes off very quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lashes like previous mascaras!</li>
            <li>I just recently tried the new Perversion Mascara from Urban Decay, and this Cover Girl mascara is far better.</li>
            <li>i received a sample of this product from influenster and this is the best mascara that i&#x27;ve ever had it holds up well for hours and gives my eyelashes a dramatic look that i can&#x27;t get with other brands</li>
            <li>I wanted more volume and a deeper black, but I am finding this is just clumping my eyelashes together!</li>
            <li>The first side basically made your lashes look longer and less clumped while the second side added more color.</li>
            <li>I love the dramatization that the black brings to my eyes!</li>
            <li>This was, as other posters have mentioned, somewhat hard to remove with regular remover but is a great product!</li>
            <li>Formula is ok but is very sticky and takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li>The key for me was to make sure that I didn&#x27;t leave any time at all to let step 1 dry before applying step 2.</li>
            <li>The liquid seems build able, though it would wait for it to dry before trying a second coat.</li>
            <li>Typically, I am strictly a Benefit Cosmetics mascara kind of girl but this CoverGirl Bombshell mascara definitely lived up to my mascara standards.</li>
            <li>I love the curve brush on one end and the straight brush on the other and how the 2nd one coats and makes it stick – waterproofing.  </li>
            <li>Third, right after applying Step 1, I applied Step 2:</li>
            <li>I am even wearing it into the next day right now.</li>
            <li>The upper right photo is</li>
            <li>I already have very long and full lashes</li>
            <li>and I love the very black because it gives them a sense of being fuller, and it stretches out my lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love this mascra,and i am very picky when it comes to mascara this totally adds volume to your lashes as it goes on evenly theres no clumping which is a big big plus!</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers, I received this mascara free from the Surf&#x27;s Up Voxbox from Influenster.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews with it not coming off.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product, it works really well since my lashes are pretty blond and are thin.</li>
            <li>I really live this product</li>
            <li>This mascara claims to curve, volumize, and define your lashes with their new two part</li>
            <li>Id recommend this product to anyone looking for some new mascara.</li>
            <li>This new mascara (or new to me because I have never seen it before) was the bomb as the name suggests.</li>
            <li>and I can live with that.</li>
            <li>and then I try a new mascara</li>
            <li>This is seriously my new go-to mascara.</li>
            <li>so I am always picky about trying out new mascara.</li>
            <li>What I liked about this mascara is that it dries soft and not crispy and hard.  </li>
            <li>generally don&#x27;t bother using mascara since i live in a warm climate and usually in the pool.</li>
            <li>but with this mascara its much harder to clean</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it goes on smoothly, lasts, and makes my eye lashes look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes</li>
            <li>I have been trying many mascaras lately and was very nervous about trying this one after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>no clumps, quick dry time.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are naturally long, so I usually look for mascara with good volume and separation.</li>
            <li>It has to dry moderately quick so that when I look up from applying it, I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes</li>
            <li>I liked the color, how long it stayed on, and how dark it made my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li>The volume is a nice, casual amount, not crazy night time.</li>
            <li>I count on it for big, clump free lashes that have been lasting me through the sweat &amp; tears of the World Cup so far!</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, as unlike other mascaras I have used in the past in looked good throughout the day and into the evening.</li>
            <li>The price range is very reasonable and it&#x27;s a definite go-to!</li>
            <li>It is long lasting but easily removable as well.</li>
            <li>Since it is long lasting, this is not something you can remove easily</li>
            <li>It dried pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find that the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara did that pretty instantly.  </li>
            <li>Orginally, I was skeptical of the multi-layer function of this mascara, but after using the ends one after another like suggested, my results were amazing!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get this anywhere near your eyes without bumping into your face!</li>
            <li>I received this mascara from Influenster to try, and WOW!</li>
            <li>I have pretty moderate lashes but with Bombshell Curvaceous, my lashes are luscious!!</li>
            <li>I like the dual brushes, and how the first brush actually curled my lashes.</li>
            <li>I would buy this mascara if it only had the first formula.</li>
            <li>The first brush separated and curled my lashes while the second brush layered on the mascara and lengthened my lashes.</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this mascara!</li>
            <li>The only issues I have are: my eyes are still pretty watery, but this mascara does not advertise itself to be hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>The first brush helps to put mascara on each lash and the second makes them fuller!</li>
            <li>with this mascara, 1-2 coats is enough because with the first coat, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I used the first side then the second</li>
            <li>There is a lot of product, double that of many other mascaras, but that led to a bulky product.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Cover Girl, for finally making exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this was that it was really sticky!</li>
            <li>It stays on and it doesn&#x27;t rub off even in the hot Southern California weather.</li>
            <li>The tube is pretty big</li>
            <li>First off I didn&#x27;t like how big and bulky it is.</li>
            <li>Covergirl has always been known for their inexpensive yet with professional looking make up make up results &amp; they still got it!</li>
            <li>Each eye I switch wands so I can get the second mascara on before the first dries.  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no clumping on the bristles, and the small amount product on the end of the brush doesn&#x27;t leave lumps of product on your lashes like most brushes do.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money !</li>
            <li>I even slept with it on and it looked the same as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty solid.</li>
            <li>It was actually pretty simple!!</li>
            <li>As soon as you open the tube, the smell is the first thing you notice.</li>
            <li>Its pretty massive.  </li>
            <li>Oh and the bottle itself, is pretty big!  </li>
            <li>So far I am a fan!</li>
            <li>I love the double wand and it doesn&#x27;t clump together like many other mascara that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the first wand.</li>
            <li>If you want super long, curly lashes, spend the extra money on Benefit or Urban Decay Super Curl.</li>
            <li>it is easy to take off with a little soap and water or water by itself.</li>
            <li>The black color is intense and bold and it volumes and DOES NOT clump.</li>
            <li>I Recieved this product free from Influenster, Hands Down</li>
            <li>This mascara make my lashes dark, long, full and bold.</li>
            <li>The wand was very stiff and put on a very light coat.</li>
            <li>Stays clump free and long lasting!</li>
            <li>I typically buy $30 mascara but got this one for free from influenster.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I actually adored the first side.</li>
            <li>but once I put on the first coat and then flipped it and did the second, wow what a difference and enhancement it made.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I liked the results, dont get me wrong.</li>
            <li>It does not get full stars because I have found mascaras that do the same thing without having to use two different wands.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see the difference between other mascaras I used and this one, this one last much more longer and also make my lashes much longer, I will be purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li>Love the double wand, curling and volumising brush and then the intensify brush make such a great duo, I have very thin, sparse eyelashes and the usual suspects as far as volumising mascaras never really make my eyes pop, they just clump and look spidery, this one is much better than any I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>but alas, I love it!</li>
            <li>This product makes my lashes look 3 times as full and voluminous than any other.</li>
            <li>All in all not a bad mascara at all just doesn&#x27;t work well for me, I would choose one of the other Covergirl mascaras before I pick this one up.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply doesn&#x27;t smudge last all day long!!!</li>
            <li>or I can use the second wand for extra bold lashes.  </li>
            <li>I  would like it if the wand was a different shape and that the container wasn&#x27;t so large.</li>
            <li>but they quickly fell back down after I applied my first coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>I have really light lashes and a little leftover doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the mascara to anyone who has little to no eyelashes or light colored.</li>
            <li>However, like other reviewers, I am not sure if the side 2 really makes the whole thing better.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is sometimes when I use it, it&#x27;ll clump a bit and requires a little more time to fix.</li>
            <li>I have also seen this in many drugstores so it will not be hard to find.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes do look a bit more longer using this and taking it off isn&#x27;t so hard since I use olive oil to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>I loved the product a lot it just at moments went on a little clumpy and felt heavy when it did</li>
            <li>Covergirl&#x27;s new bombshell mascara is easy to put on but very messy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything and this is by far the craziest mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like the double applicator!</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised when I found this mascara inside for me to test.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li>my lashes were long, curly, and really, well, bombshell-esque!  </li>
            <li>I like that it has two different wands but wish the whole thing was thinner.</li>
            <li>It held up to my expectations as far as waterproof goes.</li>
            <li>I like my lashes to be soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>For me, it seems the curved side really adds length and the regular side adds volume.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it was the fact that it is much like a waterproof mascara and does require the use of an oil makeup remover.</li>
            <li>the wand is too short and the mascara was VERY clumpy.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I think the trick is really in the 2 different application brushes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li>The second step really adds length and separates the lashes.</li>
            <li>Overall I like the mascara, it really defines and separates,</li>
            <li>I really like the double end of it.</li>
            <li>but I think if you just used one you really could not tell the different.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of the two wands, but they are both short and just don&#x27;t feel very intuitive.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t come across a lot of mascaras that really impress me, but this one definitely does.</li>
            <li>AT LEAST make sure to put on mascara.</li>
            <li>I am cheap, so I prob wouldn&#x27;t buy it or use it everyday, but I will use it for dates and nights out.</li>
            <li>My lashes are naturally curly</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a mascara that was reasonably priced that actually did what was promised...</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised by the mascara.</li>
            <li>And I really really like it actually.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about</li>
            <li>I like a natural look</li>
            <li>I really dig the Bombshell Curvaceous, as it definitely adds some va-va-voom to my peepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also found the whole wand to be a bit clunky, but I have tiny carny-sized hands ...</li>
            <li>mascara is also a stubborn beast to get off when just washing your face, and since I like to keep oils / makeup removers away from my v. sensitive eyeballz, I&#x27;ll just have to settle waking up looking like a $2 whore.</li>
            <li>I have lashes like I did in my early 30s</li>
            <li>It also has a chemical-like smell so if you have a sensitive nose, be warned.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m liking the results.  </li>
            <li>I used three pads of remover for each eye before it was completely off.  </li>
            <li>I really like the volume of this mascara, it separates my lashes and lengthens at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I was admittedly surprised about that.</li>
            <li>I have naturally sparse lashes that want to point downwards.</li>
            <li>look and the complete review on my blog.</li>
            <li>However I find that if I combine it with a second mascara, I can really achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li>My lashes also looked fuller and longer, thicker and made my eyes just completely pop.</li>
            <li>Is not clumpy or flaky and doesn&#x27;t irritate my usually sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Really well, actually.</li>
            <li>i was surprised by the size</li>
            <li>Could be that my eyes are just sensitive, or it could be that it contains a harsher chemical.</li>
            <li>A 2- step process with professional results.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see the difference after applying the second step.</li>
            <li>Bombshell Curvaceous is a two part system mascara, with a volumizing and curling top coat, and a secondary intensifying coat.  </li>
            <li>Take my advice, do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>For me, it seems the curved side really adds length and the regular side adds volume.</li>
            <li>but if I can&#x27;t use my current eye makeup remover I really don&#x27;t see the point of bothering...</li>
            <li>The second just felt like too much.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes but with this mascara it makes them look full as well as add extra length.</li>
            <li>My only complaint was that it would have been nice if the brush length was longer.  </li>
            <li>I thought the hassle of having two different wands would get on my nerves, but the results are completely worth the extra step.  </li>
            <li>but, It definitely gives my lashes a long and full look.</li>
            <li>My lashes are full and dark.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I have used that makes my lashes long and full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly not a make up person, the only time I wear make up is when I have to get dressed up to go somewhere nice</li>
            <li>Even though my lashes don&#x27;t look outrageously thick or voluminous I am really satisfied with how well it has stayed on my lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not AMAZING but definitely not horrible.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews before trying it was scary but I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I have very long lashes, however they are very straight.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up liking this mascara more than my previous one!</li>
            <li>I am always curious about new mascaras because of my pretty pitiful lashes.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for black glue in a tube, you have come to the right place!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are already very long, so this makes them look really full without making them clumpy, even with multiple coats from two wands.</li>
            <li>The up side is that it is super long lasting.</li>
            <li>so I mean its ok.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;d definitely choose other Covergirl products over this one.</li>
            <li>This time I used the 2nd side first and the 1st last and WOW!</li>
            <li>I received this mascara in the color &#x27;very black&#x27; for free from Influenster for testing purchases.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear mascara, but when I do they are easy to remove.</li>
            <li>When I used this the first problem was it didn&#x27;t dry for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Makes your eyelashes look long and thick, I love it!</li>
            <li>I liked the product, it wasn&#x27;t heavy and clumpy like other mascara</li>
            <li>In general I don&#x27;t like a lot of mascara because my eyes are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big around and hard to get a comfortable grip on</li>
            <li>For someone with barely any lashes to begin with, it&#x27;s nice to have something that actually accentuates my lashes without looking like I&#x27;ve tried too hard.</li>
            <li>Thought at first it would be a little much.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as what I expected from CG the #2 made it weird and clumpy if you added too much!</li>
            <li>No clumps, no mess.  </li>
            <li>If the two wands were a little longer, it would be a good contender with the type of mascara I usually buy.  </li>
            <li>The dark color was nice but it made my eyelashes look a little spidery and it flaked off throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The colors very black, and it&#x27;s pretty much easy to use like other mascaras.</li>
            <li>I wear waterproof mascara on a regular basis and have never had anyone mention anything in particular about it.  </li>
            <li>I really like how dark and, yes, intense it looked all day.</li>
            <li>Its very big, and with a tremor I need to balance my hand on the bridge of my nose as I apply eye makeup to steady my hand.  </li>
            <li>Its bitter sweet because it last all day and is water proof.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to others to try, its unique from every other brush application out there.</li>
            <li>For a generic brand (as opposed to CK, Benefit, M.A.C) it was a decent mascara.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly, meaning my eyes don&#x27;t get those black streaks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a long lasting mascara and worth trying.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to any girl who loves a strong dark eyelash!</li>
            <li>I am unsure about the first step because it seemed very dry and didn&#x27;t seem to be putting anything on my lashes.</li>
            <li>they where full, dark and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks CoverGirl!</li>
            <li>and I really like how it makes my eyelashes look, but it is super hard to get off.</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, especially if you want to feel glamorous!!</li>
            <li>Every time I try something new, I through it away after a few times and always go back to my original.  </li>
            <li>I generally use clear.</li>
            <li>I got this for free from Influenster and I am not totally pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about mascara because I have long lashes</li>
            <li>This mascara does add length and separates the lashes, but since my lashes are already long and separated, that doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>It really makes your eyelashes look long and voluptuous</li>
            <li>I have long eyelashes and it made them look much longer giving a fuller look.</li>
            <li>Since I have thin short lashes, this really pleased me!  </li>
            <li>normally I have to use three different types of mascara to achieve the look I get with just this one product!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like having to do this extra step and have yet to see any primer that made a difference.</li>
            <li>Two-step mascaras have never really been my first choice</li>
            <li>However, I could not give it the full 5 Stars because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of how &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to take off and it last all day.</li>
            <li>It was a little tricky to remove, but not impossible.</li>
            <li>When I put it on the first time it was okay, but the second time it was very clumpy, very heavy, and very messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other drug store products that cost less than this product and give much better results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to a waterproof mascara, and if you try too hard to rub it off, I&#x27;ve read many reviews of where people have lost their eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I love how it gives me eyelashes since mine are short, but i dont like that its kinda hard to remove and sticky.</li>
            <li>After a mishap with a curling wand a few years ago, I have a hard time getting a good curl to my lashes.</li>
            <li>It really is waterproof and stays for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My eyes were instantly big, bright and extra dramatic.</li>
            <li>But it did dry fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being Asian, I have very short, straight lashes.  </li>
            <li>I actually double both this mascara and the yellow volume one together to make a very dramtic look.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my lashes look big and doesnt really clump.</li>
            <li>The two wands is a really neat idea, especially with two different formulas.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much different from side 2, but I don&#x27;t have full or dark lashes to begin with</li>
            <li>My only point of contention is the second step can get sticky if you take to much time applying it</li>
            <li>it really LASTS-in spite of our humid Southern weather, I had it last ALL day, including beach time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for length and volume since I have small eyes and want them to really pop, so the pretty packaging and hype drew me in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better mascaras, but I do rank this top 3.</li>
            <li>Overall I love how thick and curly they look</li>
            <li>The first wand is what columizes , lengthens , and primes the eyelashes and the second wand really deepens your eyes and brings out that dark eyelashes!</li>
            <li>One of the major negatives of this product for me is the fact that to get off, you must use an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li>First step to volumize lift and curl, second step to amplify and intensify lashes as well as to seal the mascara to keep it on all day long!</li>
            <li>The first step makes your lashes extra long!</li>
            <li>It was too hot to wear any other makeup</li>
            <li>I used to put baby powder on my lashes, this would lead to some major clumping.</li>
            <li>The other end added fullness where the first end added length.</li>
            <li>I love how thick my lashes become after using step 2!</li>
            <li>The only thing that kind of sucks is how hard this stuff is to remove, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The second step is a dark, intensifying topcoat that gives bold, noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump, the design is slightly awkward because of the double ended brush, but it is easily accommodated.</li>
            <li>It was a little tricky to apply but it was worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Although I thought the packaging was a little ackward, a little too big, I really liked the sealant.</li>
            <li>the tube is a bit overly large &amp; it&#x27;s kind of awkward to hold the first few times.</li>
            <li>And I generally just don&#x27;t care for that type of brush.</li>
            <li>The sttick is incredibly thick/too wide and the brushes are short, which makes it awkward to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li>I usually stick to the same mineral mascara I&#x27;ve been using for years, but I received this mascara free from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Overall I enjoy it but not sure if I would repurchase</li>
            <li>This really extended my already long lashes which I dident even think was possible.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were so long and pretty all day long.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and really makes my lashes look defined.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute and definitely catches your eye especially since there are not many double sided mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the two step process did not take longer than my traditional mascara product (with two coats) and that this waterproof mascara was truly that!</li>
            <li>and I can say that I have never used a mascara with the double wand action.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how big the tube is</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you have to use a lot of make up remover to remove it completely.</li>
            <li>The two step process is not heavy or clumpy, it actually feels like you have no mascara on.</li>
            <li>but that apparently did not help.  </li>
            <li>The 1st wand gave a natural lift but the 2nd want just made it clumpy</li>
            <li>It goes on well and stays all day with barely any flaking off.</li>
            <li>it has the same effect, but it&#x27;s not nearly so heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>As far as the application, I did see a difference between Step 1 and Step 2 - Step 2 definitely maximizes the look!  </li>
            <li>I had absolutely zero issues with it coming off/running off/flecking off during the day, even when I spent it at the beach/pool.</li>
            <li>Then after you screw it back in, you unscrew the second wand &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; and apply to lashes with the straight wand to add volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an instant change.</li>
            <li>It packs lashes big enough for a fancy event, but simple enough that as your only makeup you look fresh for summer.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about the packaging to be honest but as soon as I tried product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better; I&#x27;ve had worse.</li>
            <li>It wastes my time, but this was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Liked it at first, but didn&#x27;t like the second step of the mascara, and very difficult to remove..</li>
            <li>If you love the look of false lashes, but don&#x27;t have the time or patience to apply them, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I love the false eyelash look</li>
            <li>If I get in a hurry, I can get a little clumping from mascara, but still less than most brands.</li>
            <li>This mascara is also pretty waterproof so even after a dip in the pool it wasn&#x27;t running down my face.</li>
            <li>So if you’re planning on re-curling your eyelashes after applying the mascara, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you wait till your mascara dry</li>
            <li>I opened the packaging and got right down to business!</li>
            <li>FINALLY Covergirl has made it all possible with their new Bombshell.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Covergirls&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara to anybody looking for a new daily mascara - especially for the summer!</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Very Black color to anyone with dark hair and eyes as I think it created a stunning contrast.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes</li>
            <li>Very Black complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>I have used waterproof mascaras in the past and as long as you use a makeup remover, it was fine.</li>
            <li>since I really didn&#x27;t have a problem with removal the other</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only mascara so far that makes my lashes long and lush.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was worried after seeing other people claim that it made them very clumpy.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if I either can&#x27;t read or if the mascara is actually hard to clean off.</li>
            <li>I also received this mascara for free from Influenster and even though its hard to remove, I like it enough that I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>I would love it if they could sort of combine the qualities of both side 1 and 2, just to make it a little less time consuming, but each side works for what it&#x27;s intended to!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that fact though especially because it can last multiple days which means I can go without having to apply new mascara.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I like to use only side 1 to create a more natural look, but brush 2 definitely gives me a dramatic eye.</li>
            <li>I initially didn&#x27;t expect to like this mascara at all, since my lashes are pretty dark to begin with.</li>
            <li>This mascara has staying power and the second coat definitely adds some WOW to your lashes.</li>
            <li>It definitely adds volume but you have to be careful how much you apply because it can get clumpy.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like how sticky it feels when it&#x27;s not completely dry.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look extra thick &amp; it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to take off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super into trying different kinds of drugstore mascaras, and this one really fills out my thin lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read in several of the reviews that the users had major problems removing the mascara.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly more time consuming to go through two rounds of mascara and having to switch sides of wand in between, but I usually put on two coats of other mascara anyway, so it really isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>I will say though, it definitely has some major staying power.</li>
            <li>It is one of the first mascaras that made my eye lashes look a little fuller, but not the bombshell look as promised.</li>
            <li>I am not familiar with mascara, so this was one of the first ones I tried.</li>
            <li>I only wear mascara at work, no other make up.</li>
            <li>When I tried to add more mascara the next  morning, the left overs made it clumpy and weird- huge eyelash mess!</li>
            <li>If you buy a product because you want your lashes to look full, it shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to get off that your lashes fall out.</li>
            <li>First thing first, I have sad Asian girl lashes that are not only short, but stick straight.</li>
            <li>I received the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara in Very Black from Influenster, complimentary for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li>It took me multiple tries with eye make-up remover to get it off, so by the time this was all done, I had missing eyelashes, huge red/black rings around my eyes and STILL had eyelashes stuck together.</li>
            <li>This mascara promises curl and intense dark finish all day, and it delivers.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara but due to my short and straight lashes, I only really use one side or the other.</li>
            <li>When I applied the second wand and formula, it took it to a whole other level.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clump and made my lashes look natural and long.</li>
            <li>but my lashes look long and lush.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Cover Girl’s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara, but after just a few swipes it may find a permanent place in makeup collection.</li>
            <li>and/or wet for a longer than normal amount of time, but</li>
            <li>The mascara fills them in and makes them look thick and full.</li>
            <li>If you want your eyes to pop and your lashes to be full and thick, this mascara does not do the job.  </li>
            <li>it gives me full eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t look clumply, the only downside is that it takes a little while to dry.</li>
            <li>Most likely not as dramatic difference as side one.</li>
            <li>Adds so much volume and length to my lashes without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Made my lashes do much longer and fuller than other mascaras I have tried!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of coats where as with other ones I do!</li>
            <li>The only issue is removing it - this product is VERY waterproof and you have to work pretty hard at getting it off!</li>
            <li>No scary black eyes!</li>
            <li>So, save a little extra time, have oil based eye make up remover, and have super long lashes!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about mascaras to begin with because I have super short lashes</li>
            <li>This mascara extends the eyelashes without making the eyelashes super hard.</li>
            <li>I have very straight lashes that rarely There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product at all, I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>other than that - I&#x27;d highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li>I bought it at Target, but didn&#x27;t pas as much as this, about 50% less.</li>
            <li>Prevents clumping and isn&#x27;t too heavy on bottom lashes if you only use the first one.</li>
            <li>the very black color really made them pop!</li>
            <li>I have little blonde lashes and after the first step I was amazed at how big my lashes looked ..</li>
            <li>It is a little too large and bulky for me.</li>
            <li>I think the package is a little to large</li>
            <li>You end up getting mascara all over because the wand is not long enough.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like to find a mascara that makes you look just a little more special, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Covergirl Bombshell!</li>
            <li>I did notice some clumping/stickiness when I moved to step 2, but this was resolved by allowing each coat to dry completely before moving on to the next coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that this mascara really made my eyelashes less clumpy, and definitely made them look longer.</li>
            <li>The standard black worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>The second coat really made the black pop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rather large tube of mascara and really one that I could take in a small makeup bag with my other essentials.</li>
            <li>I like that you can build it up as little or much as you want</li>
            <li>is a little too much for me.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s clever having the two sides but pretty unnecessary.</li>
            <li>It makes my short lashes look a little longer and much fuller.  </li>
            <li>I mainly look for volumizing and dark color when I shop for mascara because even though I&#x27;m only 33, both my eye lashes and eye brows are turning white.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it&#x27;s extremely humid where I live</li>
            <li>The two step setup is a little weird since the brushes are on the center piece, but once you get a feel for it works great.</li>
            <li>While the product went on easily and made my eyes look very pretty, my eyes are currently itching like crazy!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot about it (good and bad) and wanted to give it a try for myself.</li>
            <li>This is both a good thing (in that it doesn&#x27;t come off throughout the day) and a bad thing</li>
            <li>That is both a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be a good way to make my lashes look bigger and fuller, and in a way it did but only because it clumps so bad</li>

            <li> Awesome.</li>

            <li> I cannot stress how wonderful this mascara is.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t that happy using it!</li>
            <li> It made my lashes look great!</li>

            <li> So if you&#x27;re swimming or at the beach this is perfect.</li>
            <li> However, the design of the packaging was not the best.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara.  </li>
            <li> The primer (step 1) went on perfectly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was very happy!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the way my lashes looked after using this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the best waterproof mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I also waited about 30 seconds between coats and found that that resulted in the best application.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it at all.</li>
            <li> but it was great!</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of getting it on without getting it everywhere, it was awesome.</li>
            <li> I have excellent make up remover</li>
            <li> This mascara is incredible!</li>
            <li> this is perfect.</li>

            <li> Really great mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great.</li>
            <li> I feel like a lot of waterproof mascaras tend to be clumpy, but this did a great job of separating lashes and making them look longer and fuller without sticking together.</li>
            <li> Color was great.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara.</li>

            <li> The curl isn&#x27;t as great as it can be, but I think if you have thinner lashes than myself it&#x27;ll work well.</li>

            <li> I find this mascara is great at darkening and thickening my lashes.</li>
            <li> Great volume .</li>
            <li> It stayed looking great all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the packaging is great-</li>

            <li> it makes my lashes look great</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in a influenster vox box, I was happy to receive it</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used the 1 side to build up the volume and it worked great.</li>
            <li> The 2 side is to build the color, which it did great.</li>
            <li> So thank you, Cover Girl for a great product (and a renewed self-confidence).</li>

            <li> I am a proud mascara junkie</li>
            <li> With that being said, it looks great on</li>
            <li> On one hand its great because it NEVER comes off.</li>

            <li> I see people complaining about it, but, honestly, you should expect (and hope) that your mascara doesn&#x27;t move!</li>

            <li> Being able to choose between the sides is a great selling point!</li>
            <li> Works ok but not the greatest.</li>
            <li> EVERY LASH IS PERFECTLY COATED AND NO UGLY CLUMPS!</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look awesome and full!</li>
            <li> This is a very good mascara, I love that it is water resistant, so even when my eyes water from allergies</li>
            <li> Also be sure to have a VERY good eye makeup remover as this does NOT come off..</li>
            <li> It went on very easily (once I got used to the brush) and it didn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li> It did a great job, but didn&#x27;t do anything amazing to my lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing feels great on my lashes</li>
            <li> never wear eye makeup because I just don&#x27;t think it looks good on me, well after trying this Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara</li>
            <li> Good mascara,</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved how the product went on.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good for lengthening and also for adding volume.</li>
            <li> Both brushes are nice and the formula is great.  </li>
            <li> i loved this mascara.</li>
            <li> this is a good product.</li>
            <li> No clumping, lots of volume and  it even looks good through the lenses of my glasses.</li>
            <li> It has good staying power.</li>
            <li> But I loved it</li>
            <li> It doesn’t clump, and seems to effortlessly glide over your lashes to create a gorgeous look.</li>
            <li> This side is good at separating the lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> but I feel like it&#x27;s a lot of coats and work to get to a good look</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be a good waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> but this is just as good.  </li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie and pride myself on good products and technique.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll get over it in order for some good mascara.</li>
            <li> and she loved how it work</li>
            <li> I loved the mascara, it gave the va va boom i needed.</li>
            <li> The best part of this is I got this 100% free from my Influenster side.</li>
            <li> I loved the volume and the curl in this mascara.</li>
            <li> LOVED it besides that.</li>
            <li> Once I applied step two, I loved the look and had on complaints.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my eyelashes popped and curled when I applied the Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara by Lashblast.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I got this in my VoxBox for review and loved it.</li>
            <li> I found it to work nicely and was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I do have to use a good makeup remover to remove when needed</li>
            <li> I received the product for VoxBox testing purposes and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Upon recieving the item, I loved the packaging.</li>

            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous by lashblast mascara totally free for testing purposes from Influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;It was awesome</li>
            <li> However, I really enjoy this product as well and it pairs perfectly with the volume the NYM Beach Babe texturizing shampoo and conditioner gives you!</li>
            <li> it creates gorgeous lashes without needing a eyelash curler, and doesn&#x27;t create clumps.</li>
            <li> good measure</li>
            <li> everything was good.</li>
            <li> so I recommend a good make up remover or some oil to help take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique for years and this is just as good but at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Good job Covergirl</li>
            <li> and I Loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the brush is good for the lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn for decades and which create gorgeous lashes.</li>

            <li> and it makes my lashes look so full!!!</li>
            <li> It coats and curls my lashes just perfectly in just the right shade!  </li>
            <li> If you want full beautiful eye lashes then this is the mascara for you!!</li>
            <li> But it did make my lashes full and beautiful!</li>
            <li> The packaging of the product is very cute and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Works great and goes on easily!</li>
            <li> It goes on great and really does make my eyelashes look longer and adds a perfect curl.</li>

            <li> it takes my very light lashes and makes them show up!  </li>
            <li> Great product and will def recommend to friends :-)</li>
            <li> They go great together and it comes off better than on</li>

            <li> While this mascara did a really good job of creating the full lashes look and would look great for parties</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a Cover Girl product in my Influenster Surfs Up Vox Box to test!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say this certainly was one of the best things in the #surfsupvoxbox.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing it makes my eyes stand out.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>

            <li> it makes my lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> But the end result was simply amazing.</li>
            <li> it actually is really amazing</li>
            <li> When I tell you guys this is amazing...</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING mascara.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s waterproof and that it makes my eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> product itself is amazing.  </li>
            <li> now i may not be a fan of mascara, but this mascara is fantastic in my opinion (maybe its because i dont use it lol).</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes look amazing</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li> My lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how I have curl and add volume with 1 tube.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara lover and go to is the orange tube of Covergirl Lashblast (not the waterproof kind)</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants the perfect lash!</li>
            <li> The wands and product are so nice.</li>
            <li> And I feel like I am ripping out my own lashes to get the mascara off.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster for testing purposes, and I actually liked it.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> So, when I received the Curvaceous mascara courtesy of Influenster.com, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be thrilled.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are nice</li>
            <li> it goes on nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it and found that it did what it said.  </li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> It does not clump and makes them curl up on there own .</li>
            <li> Price is nice, too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara.  </li>
            <li> This one did that with side 1 and side 2 just kind of pumped up the volume a bit.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice if youre going out and don&#x27;t want it to come off</li>
            <li> Influenster gave me this and honestly for a drugstore brand</li>
            <li> But in my honest option this mascara wasn’t one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> (I’m still in the hunt for the one I can use on its own)</li>
            <li> the product did produce a nice lash, but at the cost of ripping my eyelashes out to remove it.</li>
            <li> so that was nice.</li>
            <li> However, as is, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it on my own.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It was nice for defining, but not quite spectacular.</li>
            <li> and i really liked it.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> and it goes on really nice,</li>
            <li> It wears longer than waterproof mascara, and not in a good way, i tried many times to remove with eye makeup remover and cleanser and it wouldn&#x27;t budge and frankly it hurt.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> It stays forever (waterproof with removal by an oil based remover) and gives your lashes volume and a nice curve.</li>
            <li> Although I have to be honest it does not lengthen them.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are full and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Nicely done Cover Girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this awesome product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of my lashes after applying both steps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it in my box, but I was intrigued, so I went to purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li> tried this mascara and liked it.</li>
            <li> This is part of the Surfs Up Vox Box campaign, but I did purchase the mascara on my own.</li>
            <li> You have to be really adept at lash separating to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this product for Influenster, but I did purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li> mascara was a downfall in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for another great product Covergirl!</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> But what I do love is a good mascara.</li>
            <li> This review is my own thoughts.</li>
            <li> I liked the two step process, as I think it helped to create a fuller lash look.</li>
            <li> I liked the staying power, which didn&#x27;t smear or run throughout the course of my day.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and I was absolutely thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it made my eyelashes pop.</li>
            <li> Besides, Covergirl makes their own.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how much this stuff made my lashes stand</li>
            <li> nice length, however, it is a pain in the butt to get off makeup remover or not.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really liked it.</li>
            <li> it seems nice, but I don&#x27;t think its for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Loving the way it makes</li>
            <li> I just got this product to try and review from Influenster and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received mine through Influenster&#x27;s voxbox program and I was really thrilled to try it</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this mascara to begin with.</li>
            <li> I loved being able to test this product</li>
            <li> I liked the look that I got from the two step process.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product and very happy with it!</li>
            <li> The results are so great, I think this is better than Maybelline&#x27;s The Rocket which has been my favorite for a while.</li>
            <li> It accentuated my lashes nicely and made them look thicker.</li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect for plumping the lashes without wetting them so much that the curl gets relaxed.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it looked.</li>
            <li> given a good reason (important night with my guy) I would wear it for the look!</li>
            <li> It does make the lashes look nice and curled like promised</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes my lashes look amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it and ll buy again for sure :) !</li>
            <li> I was really excited because I had heard great things, and have yet to find an amazing mascara for my eyes</li>
            <li> This mascara went on very easily and feels light, but also adds great volume and length to my lashes.</li>
            <li> After receiving this complimentary mascara (for testing purposes) from Influenster , here is my review!!&lt;br /&gt;Great mascara!!!</li>
            <li> I love it is amazing product i love it!</li>
            <li> I got this free for testing purposes from Influenster, but ended up loving it!  </li>
            <li> The two together are absolutely incredible (and I&#x27;m very picky about my mascaras!)</li>
            <li> A good mascara is a necessity for every girl so getting it to try for free from Influenster is amazing.</li>
            <li> I really loved the waterproof aspect and it came off easily with an oil based remover.</li>
            <li> I honestly was surprised with how wonderful my lashes ended up looking with just step 1!</li>
            <li> easy application, good results &amp;</li>
            <li> i love covergirl, but this product is not the best, it is very clumpy and sticky, i do not recomend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Once you do, it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and does give your eyelashes a fuller look.</li>
            <li> That being said, I found this very easy to use and serves it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that i LOVED the mascara!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite ones I have, definitely love covergirl!</li>
            <li> Specially when you are out partying all night!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!!!</li>
            <li> I received these products free for testing purposes from Influenster , I really loved the end results of this product and how there are no clumps.</li>
            <li> Bombshell curvaceous by covergirl is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best out of all the Covergirl brands!</li>
            <li> The formula is light, which is good.</li>
            <li> So happy I got this item complimentary in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best they have done so far.</li>
            <li> So far best masscera I have ever gotten !</li>
            <li> this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my old discontinued brand, and this worked perfect!!</li>
            <li> This mascara which i got as part of my #surfsupvoxbox from @influenster for free, was just the ticket for my fair</li>
            <li> So far this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li> I have loved &#x27;Cover Girl&#x27; since I was a teenager (many eons ago), and that love has grown even more since receiving the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara from Influenster.</li>
            <li> Thus one once again is great and sturdy for summer fun and splashing in the water.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Covergirl &amp; wish I could have tried it for FREE through Influenster, they have amazing VoxBoxes!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing in every way I love that it&#x27;s double-sided</li>
            <li> As a compromise, I am now just using Step 1 which in my opinion is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This by FAR is the best.</li>
            <li> The concept of a two-step application is interesting, and step 1 works nicely.</li>
            <li> I was conscious of the rigid fringe around my eyes all day which doesn&#x27;t make for a very happy me...</li>
            <li> the one on side 1 was the one i liked the most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can safely say that the lashes I got with it were AMAZING.</li>
            <li> After that though it added a nice layer of mascara to my top lashes.  </li>
            <li> As a mascara junkie I am ALWAYS on the hunt for the perfect product to make my lashes long and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The first brush worked great on its own to give my lashes some pop.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased to say that I&#x27;m so happy that I was one of the lucky ones who got it.</li>
            <li> it works great and the packaging is super cute.</li>
            <li> needed eye make up remover to take off but came off easy!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and makes your eyes a pop!</li>
            <li> This is one of the blackest mascaras I&#x27;ve found and also is easy to remove with makeup remover!</li>
            <li> and it comes off easily with makeup remover!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li> and I can end up raccoony easily, but not with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> Love this makes my eyelashes look very full!</li>
            <li> I tried it the first time without curling my eyelashes just to see what kind of lift it might provide, and it was entirely successful.</li>
            <li> I really liked it and it is very waterproof, which makes it great to use at the pool or beach.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciated that even in warm, humid weather, I experienced no smudging or flaking.</li>
            <li> I love using this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t run very easily.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl your eyelashes very much, but it gives great volume and length.</li>
            <li> Lashes look great, and very very waterproof.</li>
            <li> I do think this is a great mascara and even with my very own personal dislikes I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> I love the formula - it&#x27;s clump free, very buildable, and makes lashes look almost perfect.</li>
            <li> first brush end is for creating a curled eyelash look, and the applicator does a great job of creating that curl</li>
            <li> Pretty great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this stuff&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> The first one is great from separating the lashes and giving them length and curl  </li>
            <li> The first mascara was great.</li>
            <li> However, this mascara does a really good job of volumizing my lashes and separating them to give a really full look.</li>
            <li> and this mascara is perfect for the dramatic falsie look which is perfect for day or transitioning to the evening!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of curling and darkening my lashes in a way that is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love the easy two step process!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary to test out from Influenster, and I must say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> but I am pretty sure it is great at that too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and makes your eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> It works nice and removes easily</li>
            <li> It also has a nice design and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free for testing purposes from Influenster, and boy am I glad that I did!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from Influenster and love it!</li>
            <li> It is bright and appealing to the eye, and really made me want to try it out even more!</li>
            <li> It make your eyelashes huge and makes your eye pop!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge mascara addict!</li>
            <li> I love how there is no fallout with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have used it before</li>
            <li> I love that mascara.</li>
            <li> I love the ease in using.</li>
            <li> but the more I used it one or two more lashes would fall off and that got me scared</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes so much more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> , I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, and it&#x27;s not clumpy.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> and I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li> It worked well for me and gave my lashes a lot more volume.</li>
            <li> but I got it as a trial and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> awesome mascara for someone like me with short eye lashes!</li>
            <li> The 2-step process really works great.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> Many not waterproof mascaras tend to smudge through the day and give me raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> just cause I have better mascaras that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it not only goes on well and with great color, but does not even clump!</li>
            <li> I just prefer a thicker variety with more &amp;#34;la la la&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all sure why I&#x27;ve seen some reviews say that it&#x27;s clumpy bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OKAY.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have something that will help you take it off at night it is def.</li>

            <li> Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> With that being said - be sure to use an oil-based makeup remover to fully remove this product at night.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love COVERGIRL PRODUCTS.</li>

            <li> When i used it properly I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and i LOVE</li>

            <li> I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I fell instantly in love.</li>
            <li> I love how each brush can be used separately or together for added drama.</li>
            <li> So, when appled correctly it makes my lashes look fantastic!</li>
            <li> It stays on all night and doesn&#x27;t flake off like most mascaras.</li>
            <li> I love this masacra</li>
            <li> Its quite chunky(packing wise) but its all worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> However, I do agree with many others that the clumping is an issue.</li>
            <li> I did end up with a result I am satisfied with and I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see myself buying more to replace it once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m so glad Influenster gave me the opportunity to test it out for them, for free!</li>
            <li> I think I fell in love :))</li>
            <li> So I received a voxbox from Influenster and got to try a sample of Covergirl Bombshell for free!</li>
            <li> I would love it if I were going to the beach, but I&#x27;m not one for using waterproof every day.</li>
            <li> More like a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> but I have heard it is a bit challenging to remove.  </li>
            <li> I recalling enjoyed trying out this product courtesy of influenster.</li>
            <li> This product allows you to do that without carrying around as many products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have top lashes sticking to bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes stand out and stays clump-free for the most part.</li>

            <li> Most just straighten them out.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this mascara.</li>

            <li> They stand out and people notice. :)</li>
            <li> and it made her sexy</li>
            <li> This is an amazing mascara that I got in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from @influenster and if it wasn&#x27;t free I&#x27;d buy it for sure.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not waterproof would love if it was waterproof.....</li>
            <li> i love the color and the feel and texture that they give to my lashes</li>
            <li> And well it didn&#x27;t really work that great on my lashes.</li>
            <li> But yeah I love that it has two brushes.</li>

            <li> I like to be able to wash my makeup off without using oiled based products.</li>
            <li> This mascara was just okay for me.</li>
            <li> I love the way the product looks when finished.</li>

            <li> I love how it makes my eyes look:)</li>
            <li> also no clumping here:)</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use an oil based make up remover because it acts like a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love mascara, and was thrilled to get this product in my free vox box from influenster.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I was aiming to try it out but lucked up on getting it in my box.</li>
            <li> I love it♡</li>
            <li> I love the curved brush and the way the mascara goes on.</li>
            <li> I love the look, but I need to know how to get the mascara off better besides loosing my lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes looked fantastic!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m so glad i did ..</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gives you a ton of volume for being a 2 step mascara I&#x27;ve seen better results on a one step and cheaper mascara.</li>
            <li> Some people might love this, I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product makes me want to try mascara more now, which I think says a lot.</li>
            <li> MAN, my eyeslashes looked way better than they did when I was</li>
            <li> You do have to take time to make sure that it gets washed off.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I found one I love.</li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl mascara, however this one wasn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl mascara products</li>
            <li> However, I did fall in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Brush 1 is my favorite-</li>
            <li> so make sure to use an oil-based product when removing this mascara.</li>
            <li> So it was not my favorite</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> There are much more better mascaras out there in the beauty market than this.</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara comes as a 2-step process instead of one.</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t clump up my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> I also like mascara better when it has one wand and no two because I think it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have always layered two different mascaras, so this is perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I love how my eyes has popped more with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the two sides and they work well together</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most eye makeup removers as they tend to be too oily feeling for me</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my eye lashes look.</li>
            <li> That may not necessarily be what YOU want in a mascara, but it&#x27;s perfect for me &amp; I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on my lashes with this mascara</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes and so far am very impressed.</li>
            <li> the tears on top of that</li>
            <li> it did not irritate my eyes like most mascaras I love it and will continue to use bombshell volume mascara</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> I love the curved side because I don&#x27;t have to use a curler.</li>
            <li> but I was able to take it off with liquid eye make up remover without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you use an oil based makeup remover like the one from Covergirl to remove it.  </li>
            <li> The double ended wand is a wonderful tool which helps speed up my application, it brings my eyelashes up and out, without a lot of fuss!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy having people compliment your &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34; eyes, try Bombshell Curvaceous Lashes!</li>

            <li> A lot better than what I was using before.</li>

            <li> That caused my top and bottom lashes to stick together.</li>
            <li> More on this ahead...</li>
            <li> mascara&#x27;s 2-step application is a foolproof and adjustable way to make sure you get your eye look just the way you want it.</li>
            <li> Cover girl has always had my favorite drugstore mascaras.</li>
            <li> personally love the product.</li>

            <li> a must buy 4 sure</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I received this free from #influenster in their #surfsupvoxbox!</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes look fantastic!</li>
            <li> influenster sent this to me for free to test and its amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My lashes were more defined and seemed fuller.</li>
            <li> In the end though, it ended up being just okay for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> but I have tried way better.</li>
            <li> but i think the formula could be better.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Influenster to test, and was so excited to try it out after hearing many good things about it.</li>
            <li> it is amazing.. cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the color is very rich.</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to try this mascara in hopes that it would be the solution to my lash lifting issues.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this mascara in my VoxBox by Influenster and i was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this mascara</li>
            <li> Cute packaging and unique idea!</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara, Stays on long, and is clump free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very particular about how a product smells and if it has a strong smell even if its a great product I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, I even watched How to Train Your Dragon 2 with my kids (and cried) and it stayed put and looked just as good as when I first applied it!&lt;br /&gt;I will be using it from now on :)</li>
            <li> Any makeup that will make my day easier is great in my book and this certainly did that with how easy it was to get the look I wanted</li>
            <li> and I love the more natural curve in the brush love love love it!!</li>
            <li> not only it covers but it voluminousness your lashes for a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> But on the bright side of that, the mascara stays on very well throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;ve gone to bed without taking it off and waking up in the morning with my eyelashes still looking pretty good)</li>
            <li> Received it in my vox box from influenster and it was awesome made my lashes long long and perfect!!</li>
            <li> You get to test cool products and give your honest opinion about them .</li>
            <li> Pretty good for a drug store priced mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on I could tell how good of quality is was.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty good although I would not purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> Wipe the applicators first (always a good tip anyway.)  </li>
            <li> The first coat/brush does a good job of depositing color, volumizing, and the curved brush head does its part in getting those lashes to go up.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product,</li>
            <li> I wore this for 12 hours and was impressed that it did curl and lengthen my already long lashes.  </li>
            <li> I liked the first part of it, it separated my lashes well and kept them from clumping which I loved but the second step wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try it, as I have always loved Covergirl products.</li>
            <li> i like the way it elongates my lashes and makes them look more full!</li>
            <li> I received the full-size courtesy of Influenster, and was excited to try it!</li>
            <li> but I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try it!</li>
            <li> I love how full my lashes are!</li>
            <li> Lifts, lengthens and brings major lash drama... in a good way!</li>
            <li> Great new mascara</li>
            <li> I love that it is easy to use</li>
            <li> the top coat made them even longer and waterproof but it came off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love the curled wand because it makes applying the mascara easy.  </li>
            <li> I love how you get 2 applicators and goes on easy no clumping.</li>
            <li> Love how it went on and washes off easily for being waterproof.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this mascara is that it was truly waterproof and it came off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and love that it gives you volume on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product through a complimentary testing service called Influentser, and it was by far the best thing I recieved.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the mascara, but goodness it&#x27;s a huge tube!  </li>

            <li> I love that it lasted all day and looked amazing right up until i took it off.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and stays put all day, for lush, beautiful bombshell lashes.</li>
            <li> I love how side one coats all the fine lashes and side 2</li>
            <li> Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara is the best mascara i ever use i love how it douset smear and some other mascara.</li>
            <li> Just when I thought I couldn&#x27;t love anything more than the original Lashblast or Bombshell Volume by Lashblast Mascaras, COVERGIRL went and did this.</li>
            <li> My lashes clump together and don&#x27;t look very full.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product through Influenster and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got it for free in my surfs up voxbox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I was able to try for free through influenster.com.</li>
            <li> The curved wand gives my lashes a great, professional looking curl.</li>
            <li> Like many others on here, I received a free sample of this mascara through Influenster for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I received  this item free from Influenster to test and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> And the second step gives your lashes incredible volume.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a free sample and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> Received this prouduct free for testing through Influenster and totally love it.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this mascara for free from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> Got to try this product for free from Influenster and definitely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, it made my eyelashes look big and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I made sure to put on a light coat</li>
            <li> I was able to try this mascara for free through Influenster.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, not only was it free from influenster but works great too.</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product for free using #Influenster in my #Surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li> This was my first dual-wanded mascara too, and I was very pleased with its turn out.</li>
            <li> The curved one is ideal for the upper lashes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to test this out because I absolutely loved this mascara.</li>
            <li> Plus it keeps my lashes curled all day too (which is good for this girl with straight lashes).</li>
            <li> I always buy CoverGirl mascara products, so I was thrilled when I received the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster to test.</li>
            <li> but the pros are makes your eye lashes longer and coverage is good for a whole day</li>
            <li> I loved the way the product worked and made my lashes really stand out.</li>
            <li> You really have to have a good eye makeup remover in order to get this off without some of your lashes falling out.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good product on the whole.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Covergirl lash blast is still probably my favorite mascera, but I love bombshell for a special occasion, or if I have a bit more primping time since it does take a bit longer to apply (totally worth it though!)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this mascara for free from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> I love how side one separates and makes my lashes individualize, then curl and then BAM, side 2 lengthens and makes my lashes long and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> it makes my lashes full!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and shape is automatic!</li>
            <li> I received it complimentary from Influenster and have already bought another tube! :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it out, but I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty ingenious!</li>
            <li> Other than those issues, the mascara formula and wands were great!</li>
            <li> I used sweet almond oil, and that did the trick!</li>
            <li> I love the Covergirl Bombshell Curvasceous mascara that I received for complimentary testing purposes from Influenster!</li>
            <li> But not a bad product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to remove with some makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to come off when needed.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and I didn&#x27;t need to use a billion coats.</li>
            <li> My lashes were defined, shiny, full, incredibly long and had great curl!</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and applies easy.</li>
            <li> so I can tell you if that&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> The two wand system is easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The curved brush was easy to use.</li>
            <li> but i guess that will make for easy finding in your purse.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It applies on easy.</li>
            <li> but it came off extremely easily with a swipe of makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love my mascara and eye-shadow and am always looking for the next great thing.</li>
            <li> It went on so easily, and the brush never gives clumps.</li>
            <li> but that was easily fixable by using the brush to remove the clumps.</li>
            <li> Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> I sweated most of the day, but my mascara still looked great later in the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take off with just some make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Step 2 was just as easy:</li>
            <li> The formula did come off easily with make up remover (I use almay&#x27;s version).  </li>
            <li> Both steps are easy to apply...</li>
            <li> I would rather have a 1-step mascara with an easy applicator.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t that easy to use.</li>
            <li> And easily comes off with an oil based remover.</li>
            <li> It clumps and gets on my eyelids easily before drying and then doesn&#x27;t remove without an oil based cleanser from the eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Also, it clumps easily so watch out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> I did notice that it got clumpy really easily and that it smudged off onto my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> These things are easy to fix but is a bit of an annoyance.</li>
            <li> The # 2 side made what I already put on with the # 1 side clump up a bit but was easy to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to remove with baby oil.</li>
            <li> I love having this mascara on hand for days that I want a simple, beach-like look, but I do not use this to get dressed up and look great.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply with the curved brush.</li>
            <li> makes it easy to find in the bottom of my purse.</li>
            <li> It makes it easier for me to easily apply mascara to all my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was very excited and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive a full product as a tester, but I was not all that impressed with the product itself, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore this particular mascara, I cannot tell you how many friends commented on how great my lashes looked - thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> but this one is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead so that could be why I wasn&#x27;t completely wowed with the color, BUT this color looked absolutely amazing on my daughter!</li>
            <li> I think it makes my lashes look more full...</li>
            <li> I loved the volume and length of my normally skimpy eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for a more intense eye, or for a simple day look.  </li>
            <li> First you apply the curling lash mascara, on a nice silicone, lash separating wand,  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference with step 1, but after applying step 2, my lashes looked longer and more full.</li>
            <li> The first step has a nice brush that separates your lashes &amp; lengths them well.</li>
            <li> It gave me big beautiful lashes that popped.</li>
            <li> I applied the first coat, it seemed kind of sticky and clumped my lashes together instead of building up the product which I thought it would do.</li>
            <li> A much more cost effective product than splurging on high end makeup that doesn&#x27;t quite get the job</li>
            <li> love that i can get the best of 3 worlds, use one of the fabulous brushes, or use both for an EXTREME curvaceous blast of beautiful lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this mascara, I have lash confidence and I am excited to wear it all summer long!</li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with the definition and length that this mascara was able to achieve.</li>
            <li> but I would recommend for someone with fine, shorter lashes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a raccoon after getting caught in the rain, it was smooth going on and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> It would take me a while to take everything off, but that&#x27;s perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> The first wand separates every lash flawlessly and the second adds volume without clumping.</li>
            <li> Side one was fine though.</li>
            <li> My Mary Kay oil free eye makeup remover took it off easily though even though it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> step one is fine but</li>
            <li> I removed it with a cream eye-makeup remover, and it came off just fine.</li>
            <li> First off I just want to say I love cover girl products, but this product is just ok in my book.</li>
            <li> but I used the covergirl oil based makeup remover and it came off just fine.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful when you&#x27;re in a real hurry and barely have time to put on mascara, period.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how my lashes grew and just popped by only using the first wand.</li>
            <li> This mascara has quickly become one of my favorite mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great volume with just the right amount of curl to it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with getting the mascara to come off with my makeup remover (or just soap and water) but it also stays on really well through the day (or more!</li>
            <li> I tried Covergirl Bombshell one time and absolutely fell in love!</li>
            <li> Always a plus, thanks to Influenster for letting me try this product free!!</li>

            <li> Thanks Influenster for my free sample!!</li>
            <li> Side 1 does a wonderful job of curling and separating the lashes, while side 2 makes them look more thick and full; side 2 gives the impact!</li>

            <li> Even though there are 2 steps, just as easy as any 1 step mascara and well worth it!</li>
            <li> The curved end works better thAn the straight over all works fine but could be better</li>

            <li> I received this mascara for free from influencer for free to try and review</li>
            <li> The first coat was pretty good, if a touch clumpy.</li>
            <li> I usually only get cover girl brand and most of them are good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in how curled this mascara makes my lashes because I already have a good natural curl.</li>
            <li> you need a good eye makeup remover to take it off completely.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL LONG LASHES</li>
            <li> i used it twice last week, i loved how it curled my lashes since i love the look</li>
            <li> It makes me lashes look long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> After applying the first coat, it felt a bit sticky but pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is super cost effective and does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I really love how easy &amp; fast this mascara covers!</li>
            <li> The curvaceous part sure is right.</li>
            <li> I love Cover Girl mascara products, so when I received the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster to try I was excited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge mascara wearer but always love a good one!  </li>
            <li> It really coats and lengthens my lashes without getting clumpy and it stays on all day!!!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of mascara and very rarely use it.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of mascara and very rarely use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and very worth it.  </li>
            <li> Mine is a very rare allergy, (I can&#x27;t even take immunizations) but</li>
            <li> My lashes are already long and all I need it a wand to separate them and the large rounded wand works best.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;d be good for a dressy full face, but I love that it gives just enough curve on one swipe to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a pretty nice mascara, with good color and definition.</li>
            <li> The two step process is quick and easy and keeps it from clumping together.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of the Influenster VoxBox, and while I was totally stoked that this was a full size freebie - when I tried it on, I wasn&#x27;t so happy.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy to take off though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about quick &amp; easy &amp; this is it.</li>
            <li> this is much more about lengthening than volumizing but it goes on smoothly and looks pretty.</li>
            <li> This will be my new mascara until something better comes out!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> My new favorite eye product!</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I was highly skeptical when I received the Bombshell mascara, because I had honestly lost hope of anything working to make my eyelashes look beautiful and full again.</li>
            <li> I would buy with my own money and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Over all it is a great mascara that goes on easily and quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> glad I was able to check out this new mascara courtesy of @influenster as part of my #surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s important to note is the special technique of washing it off at night.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a good eye make up remover because it a little bit more water resistant.</li>
            <li> The color power is good, and it easily hides my white lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so lightly and fresh feeling, non sticky, no smudge and easy tomalley, not to mention my lashes are like 300% longer than before.....</li>
            <li> If you like really bold lashes this is great, especially for a night out.</li>
            <li> Both sides do different things, but makes my eyelashes look amazing!</li>
            <li> Very much worth it!</li>
            <li> (I had to go buy remover for it) but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I already have full eye lashes and always enjoy highlighting my finer quality...</li>
            <li> and I was soooo excited.</li>
            <li> I love how the first step lengthens and separates my lashes and step two adds volume and plump.</li>
            <li> I originally received a complimantary sample from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster!</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received a full size tube of this mascara from Influenster for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Since this is the first time I used this type of mascara, maybe it&#x27;ll get better with use.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product in my Influenster box.</li>
            <li> I was sent this mascara complimentary from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the first side the brush it</li>
            <li> I was able to try Covergirl&#x27;s Bobshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara thanks to Influenster!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it</li>
            <li> Removal requires an oil-based product, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara thanks influenza tear you rock !</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Great long wearing and waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> and it worked a lot better than the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My first thought was that it made my lashes fabulous!</li>
            <li> I got it from Influenster in a VOXbox, and because it was complimentary and i was asked to review it, i was sceptical!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from influenster for testing purposes!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I placed Step 1 on and I was immediately excited.</li>
            <li> Got this in my Influenster box to test which I was so excited about.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed by my Bombshelling look that this mascara gave my lashes.  </li>
            <li> and I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I was excited since I do like to wear mascara.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time the other day and it make my eyelashes look awesome!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try it</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I received a full sized product free from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> You truly can put on as many coats as you like of the first side without your eye lashes getting clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> Received in my influenster box that I received complimentary for testing purposes!</li>
            <li> I washed my face first and then used the Mary Kay eye make up remover and was able to remove my mascara without ripping my eyelashes out like some might have done without an eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> I love how much they pop when I wear bombshell!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty okay.</li>
            <li> I love Covergirl eye makeup products and was very excited to try this new mascara.</li>
            <li> The first step of this product is great, very simple easy to use primer/base.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster and was in love with it the first time I tried!  </li>
            <li> I think Covergirl hit the jackpot with this new formula because this mascara is so amazing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make (my) lashes super huge looking.</li>
            <li> As far as the actual mascara, I thought it was great!</li>
            <li> That said, once it&#x27;s on and dry, it&#x27;s a great mascara.</li>
            <li> Another point worth mentioning is that it does act like a waterproof mascara and doesn&#x27;t just wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li> And I wear less make up because if its beautiful bold curves!</li>
            <li> Loving this so far!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive a full size product and couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out.  </li>
            <li> :) Just make sure to have an oil-based make-up remover because it is kind of hard to take off. :)</li>
            <li> It went on very smooth, with no clumping really.</li>
            <li> I love how innovative this piece is to begin with (double wand stick), and the color stands out strong.</li>
            <li> but when I do for special occasions I put the mascara on and people always notice  and say they make your eyes pop Pow.</li>
            <li> in all, I probably would choose this mascara for special occasions when I want that amped up look.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t stand out in any special way to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I do love the large fat wand though.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives me a glamourous look for any special occasion.</li>
            <li> Nothing entirely special.</li>
            <li> Just isn&#x27;t the right mascara for me!</li>
            <li> I definitely would not wear this every day, but it was good for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing in the future, on the bright side</li>
            <li> I still like the CoverGirl Lash Blast clump clusher a bit better because it gives nice long, separated lashes.</li>
            <li> Although this mascara costs more, it gives me the option of a normal clump free look</li>
            <li> The first coat went on great, but once I put the second coat on it became sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I really had to get creative to get all of my lashes</li>
            <li> I loved the larger sized container as it makes it easier to locate amongst my drawer of products..</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li> If you want good mascara that isn&#x27;t going to hurt your wallet, definitely buy this!</li>
            <li> it could really have a greater impact,</li>
            <li> However, I love the mascara so much that I will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> but I also feel it&#x27;s a good value with the 2 different looks you can get from this product.</li>
            <li> This product does add a lot of volume, separates lashes, but it makes your top lashes stick to your bottom lashes (very sticky).</li>
            <li> What I love is that it really does make my lashes look fuller and curled, even without using the curler.</li>
            <li> The cool think is</li>
            <li> How cool is that ?</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It was true to color.</li>
            <li> I received a full size version of this mascara from Influenster.com for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It is a true stay-put formula.  </li>
            <li> It made my lashes look longer and really full.</li>
            <li> I can never get my eyelashes to look good and with this they actually do.</li>
            <li> It stays on even after a whole day and my lashes sure looks thicker and fuller with it.  </li>
            <li> Overall good mascara.</li>
            <li> (I received it free courtesy of Influenster and CoverGirl, so it was definitely worth the try.)  </li>
            <li> I find my lashes look full (and feel full too), look longer and after removal</li>
            <li> My eyelashes weren&#x27;t as full at night as they were in the morning, but they still looked fuller and made my eyes look brighter than if I had not been wearing any mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I love side 1, but side 2 doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> I received a full size tube from Influenster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good solid choice for mascara.</li>
            <li> I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast complimentary free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Looks good, doesn&#x27;t clump but the tube is way to fat and the wonds are too short.</li>
            <li> With this mascara, however, my lashes appeared full and curled.</li>
            <li> I currently use Covergirl&#x27;s Volumizing Mascara and love it, but I have to say that I enjoy that one much more than Bombshell.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t as full as i would like.</li>
            <li> , makes me feel like I have better control of how much goes on.</li>
            <li> Goes on good &amp; seems to last.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the mascara definitely lengthened and curled my lashes without being clumpy.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is really, really water proof so make sure you have oil based make-up remover</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> :) I would highly recommend this mascara and will be buying this when my tube runs out!</li>
            <li> If you are like me and love that intense lash effect then this will not do your eyes justice.</li>
            <li> OVERALL this is a good product</li>
            <li> Overall, easy application &amp; fairly great results, especially if you have shorter lashes :)</li>
            <li> And on top of that, my lashes look super full and long and amazing.</li>
            <li> The first side went on fine but nothing to be super excited about then adding side number 2</li>
            <li> This mascara was probably my favorite drug store mascara that I&#x27;ve ever tried, it will probably be my new go-to mascara when I need something quick and cheap.</li>
            <li> The color is strong and it does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> They were bold and full of life besides what is given from my lash curler.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to put on and it didn&#x27;t clump up or anything.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free last week from Influenster to try and love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently received this product for free from Influenster and it is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I think this product is great for summer.</li>
            <li> Other than that , it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great product by COVERGIRL.</li>
            <li> But overall very satisfied with  the product I wouldn&#x27;t complain too much :)</li>
            <li> I love when my eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; &amp;  the new Bombshell Curvaceous Lashes by  Covergirl does just that!</li>
            <li> Love this new mascara!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love trying new products and thanks to @Influenster, I was able to try this one for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from influenster, and it does give a great look, with a few tweaks on tube design</li>
            <li> The first want was fine,</li>
            <li> Its fine comb will separate all your lashes evenly with the first step.  </li>
            <li> No clumping and super results.  </li>
            <li> I figured i would see how it would hold up to a quick swim in the pool.</li>
            <li> It applies evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> Great staying power, especially with hooded lids in heat and high humidity - no smudges or transfer!</li>
            <li> But lucky for me I am a product junkie</li>
            <li> I was able to try this out like many others with Influenster and while I wasn&#x27;t wowed by it, it still actually did a goo job of pumping up and filling in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adequate for day use, but not for a bold night look.</li>
            <li> This mascara also did not wash off with just water and mild soap, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I will most likely be purchasing this again :)</li>
            <li> Just put super glue on your lashes</li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries rather quick as well.</li>
            <li> I did have some clumping issues but it wasn&#x27;t anything I could fix quickly.</li>
            <li> Other wise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I love this and highly recommend buying.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d stack up against my high end brand mascaras</li>
            <li> However, the best feature of this mascara is that even though it is waterproof, it is easier to removes and causes less irritation with removal than my normal mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it was marketed as a waterproof mascara, but other than that it&#x27;s a very nice mascara.  </li>
            <li> The issues I have are that first the tube is HUGE.  </li>
            <li> At first I was amazed at how huge the tube is.  </li>
            <li> First of this is HUGE for a mascara.</li>
            <li> So I just received my first Influenster box for free from influenster.com</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara, it&#x27;s not what I normally buy, but i decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous free from Influenster and tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick &amp; it doesn&#x27;t clump like so many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I received this Covergirl Bombshell Mascara FREE in my influenster surfsup voxbox to try for free and I will definitely use this and buy more.  </li>
            <li> With just 1-2 steps i feel pretty important.</li>
            <li> The packaging for the product is very pretty and girly also.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster to try and review, which was really neat!</li>
            <li> it looked very promising!</li>
            <li> but this review is based on my very first time testing this product out.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth having to use true makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> I felt like it gave me good length and volume and stayed on a long time.</li>
            <li> I have short and straight lashes, so I absolutely love any mascara that can give me nice lashes.</li>
            <li> The 2 sides feature is great you can have either a glamorous Hollywood look or a cute and subtle look.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the mascara is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I received it complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes in my Surf&#x27;s Up VoxBox, and I was excited to try it right away.</li>
            <li> Though I love trying new mascaras every time</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love trying new mascaras</li>
            <li> I think I may have found my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> To me is the only downfall since I normally don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara, but this is great for &amp;#34;girls night out getting all dressed</li>
            <li> Great black color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty lightweight which I love, and it really is waterproof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty lightweight which I love, and it really is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Its an awesome two in one; I sometimes use each end individually; each brush is different... or use them together for super volume and pretty lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love the curve of the first brush, it makes it easier to apply the mascara and really lifts lashes up.</li>
            <li> It came off really gently and easy with my oilbased makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mascara, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I love mascaras and is probably one of the beauty products I use the most because I haven&#x27;t been blessed with long lashes.</li>
            <li> First, the wands are too short; I couldn&#x27;t reach all my lashes in order to get good coverage on them.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who wants very bold and noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s two steps, which I normally don&#x27;t like because it ends up too heavy but worked perfectly in this case.</li>
            <li> It made my eyes beautiful with curved lashes while stilling keeping the natural beauty mixed it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is point-blank perfect as long as you&#x27;re only in the application or wearing stage.</li>
            <li> It applies easy and drys fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I saw some lucky friends who received this product in their Influenster vox box complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re looking for an absolutely waterproof mascara for swimming or just a hot summer day, it certainly isn&#x27;t the kind of mascara</li>
            <li> Not only did my top and bottom lashes stick together upon every blink throughout the day, I&#x27;m pretty sure they all fell out when I attempted to remove the mascara.</li>
            <li> and I actually like it more than I thought I would!</li>
            <li> Overall I love it though and recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> That was the first time I had a mascara stay on at the beach!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s works pretty well!</li>
            <li> My lashes are big and amazing, but I get more smears than I normally would.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this once I run out!</li>
            <li> I really like Covergirl&#x27;s Bombshell mascara!!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this mascara has definitely bombshelled its way into my Top 3!  </li>
            <li> I usually use department store brands like Clinique , but for a drugstore brand mascara this was good!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I really love this mascara!</li>
            <li> and this gives me just enough to be able to show mine off!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says !</li>
            <li> Overall, one of my favorite mascaras!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited.  </li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> The 2 step process sounds like it should do something really amazing for your lashes but really doesn&#x27;t do any better if even as good as other mascaras in the same price range.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it so far!  </li>
            <li> Like really waterproof!!</li>
            <li> (I never wear mascara because I have contacts in all day and normally end up touching my eye lashes and getting it everywhere) and it actually looks really nice.</li>
            <li> I definitely look forward to using this more!</li>
            <li> bombshell curvacecous made my eyes smokin hot!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sexy waterproof look!</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as part of a Birchbox &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; box and was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascaras are high-end brands, and I rarely experiment with new cosmetics you can find at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I am pretty easy to please and this is the first time I ever wrote to a company to complain about a product.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty easy and stayed on without making my look like a raccoon after a hot, humid night on the water.</li>
            <li> The first step made my eye lashes super curly and full.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is fine (doesn&#x27;t do much lifting and curling)</li>
            <li> My lashes weren&#x27;t clumpy or heavy after this which was pretty surprising after two steps!</li>
            <li> My lashes are not really long and this mascara really does a good job of creating length and curve to my lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall its a pretty good product and while it doesn&#x27;t give me super long lashes</li>
            <li> The first step is pretty easy and the applicator is nice, but the second step...</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m wearing it, but with the lashes this gives me I&#x27;m willing to overlook it on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When it was all done was easy to clean away no mess!</li>
            <li> The 1 side of the wand doesn&#x27;t clump up your lashes and makes them super long and the 2 side of the wand makes them more voluminous!</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t excited to try it, since I was very loyal to my old mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super waterproof, which I love and it doesn&#x27;t flake off like many other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Bold, clump free, sky high lashes, I was even asked if I was wearing falsies the first time I wore it!  </li>
            <li> The primer &amp; mascara are very easy to use, &amp; you do need more of a light hand to apply it, but the end result is very heavy lashes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster for my free sample.</li>
            <li> The mascara bottle is huge, and it takes up so much room in my make up box.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free from Influenster and I must say I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really separates the lashes and makes your eyes look bright and open.</li>
            <li> For starters, it is very sticky after two light coats, my lashes were all clumped together and spidery.</li>
            <li> and it still looks amazing on the second day!</li>
            <li> Great for a night out but not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth pumped up my lashes and gave so much volume.</li>
            <li> The second step is suppose to volumize them and make them darker which I don&#x27;t feel it did amazingly on.</li>
            <li> and I rated this 4/5 stars because it gives nice, simple, more natural looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> Great price and the mascara hold on all day, not clumpy, not flaky, makes my lashesh huge and thick.</li>
            <li> its a great brush so when applying its actually giving you length in your lashes,my lashes are light and short but covergirl</li>

            <li> Received this for testing purposes complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> Not for someone who prefers a more natural lash look.</li>
            <li> Be sure to have your oil based makeup removed on hand when you&#x27;re ready to wash it off - it really does stay otherwise.</li>
            <li> But I liked it overall.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary Bombshell mascara from Influenster for testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> It makes me actually want to wear it more since I now have one (which I received free from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes) to use.</li>
            <li> The first one aligns my lashes to keep them looking full.</li>
            <li> I did receive this mascara complimentary as a tester from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.</li>
            <li> - I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who thinks a little extra time in makeup removal is worth the stunning look perfect for day or night, that this mascara provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first step lengthens and curves your lashes and the second top coat intensifies and sets the mascara!</li>
            <li> The 2 side is made of the traditional nylon bristles, but it has a unique tapered cone shape that is able to reach all of the lashes and thicken and darken them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a bit more &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34; then some of the other mascaras I use, but it&#x27;s not over the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely very black and provides great coverage and volume.</li>
            <li> but other than that I enjoyed and probably will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product that it builds volume first then adds bold blackness to the lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is an overall good product it is kind of big to hold in your hand however, it is a easy applicable would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I will stick with my other Covergirl mascara, you know the good one.</li>
            <li> but it is good other than that</li>
            <li> I really was excited to receive this for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> when I apply it, it coats every strand with its dark, beautiful goop that makes my eyelashes look sexy, long, and full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the two steps since I already do this with two other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara from Influenster and was excited to see if it really made my eyes &amp;#34; pop&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is surprisingly lightweight, and it doesn&#x27;t feel any heavier than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The other brush is good for the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Overall I loved it and would highly reccomend</li>
            <li> It was also very pigmented which made it very black, which I absolutely loved!</li>
            <li> I threw it right in the garbage</li>
            <li> , I remove my eye make up with organic coconut oil and it came right off.</li>
            <li> It curls, lengthens and adds just the right amount of drama!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But on a positive note, the mascara doesn&#x27;t budge at all!</li>
            <li> Using just the first formula is makes my lashes look amazing, the second formula makes them look all clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and am pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I generally need heated eyelash curlers to get any curl into my lashes but even without a curler, this mascara adds enough curl to look great.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and have not after long wear (which is great as I am sensitive by the end of the day).</li>
            <li> If you love mascara that leaves your eyelashes full and curly definitely try this mascara.</li>
            <li> If I want to look more natural I just use the first step.</li>
            <li> I liked the separation I got from first coat and the fullness from the second.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great mascara if your just looking to have a quick fresh up in the morning when running late.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product by any means, it just requires a bit more extra work.</li>
            <li> The second step clumps very easily and does not brush out well.  </li>
            <li> I love the first side, it is reminiscent of the lash blast mascara (my go to mascara) and works by itself for a day to day clean look.</li>
            <li> I like the two different brushes, very quick and easy to use once you get used to the tube, which is pretty bulky.</li>
            <li> It may very well be my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to @influenster I recieved a covergirl Bombshell mascarra in their #voxbox to try out, I’m More than grateful for the opportunity to try out new products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big size and easy to fit in hand.</li>
            <li> First application was somewhat smooth; first removal, not so much.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for everyday wear!  </li>
            <li> At first I was annoyed that there were two steps to put it on, but now I am willing to do it because the mascara is so great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M HAPPY TO SHOW OFF EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> I first received this product through  complimentary Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad mascara, it didn&#x27;t really do much  for volume, but it added some length and lift to my lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fairly long, but not very dark so anything to help see them is great.  </li>
            <li> This mascara has really nice length and makes your lashes soooo long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying something new, and when I received a free sample of COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara from Influenster</li>
            <li> I tried it right away, and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I was lucky  enough to receive this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and it did wonders on my lashes!!</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer of using 2 different types of mascara at a time to get the best outcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Clinique mascara fan my whole life.</li>
            <li> Super intense-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s black and looks good if you can get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It might be perfect for someone who likes a natural look and who are already blessed with thick lashes.</li>
            <li> I teach Kindergarten and am constantly on the go, so I think this will be a great mascara to last all day for me.</li>
            <li> Really lengthens and then side two fills it in to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li> I like my make up routine to be quick, so the 2-step process didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.</li>
            <li> The first brush didn&#x27;t do much, and then the second brush added a little more, but I honestly get better lashes with my telescopic mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But be careful it will clump if ya put on too many layers !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stoked that I got it free and will continue to use it, but once I use it up, I will go back to my normal favorite mascara - the orange Lash Blast, also by Covergirl.</li>
            <li> After the first wand, I noticed huge length to my eyelash while the second wand adds volume and that beautiful dark color!  </li>
            <li> i liked it the first time but the second time when i went out for the day i noticed it was very sticky.</li>
            <li> My lashes look huge, long and full when using Bombshell mascara!</li>
            <li> I probably wont repurchase this particular mascara, but I love the other CG mascaras. :)</li>
            <li> Cool new product!</li>
            <li> very very sticky.</li>
            <li> I have lashes that are very straight and do not hold a curl well.</li>
            <li> VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use mascara very much</li>
            <li> I just opened my Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast mascara in Very Black, and am really happy with it so far!!!</li>
            <li> The wand was very easy to use and apply, however it did take quite a bit of product to get the long lashes I desired.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, but it&#x27;s never difficult to get off!</li>
            <li> it added a good amount of volume, but it did get just a little clumpy sometimes.</li>
            <li> I was excited for a new mascara</li>
            <li> First, this mascara, I would say, is very much waterproof.</li>
            <li> find the formula to be very dark and of a good viscosity.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it</li>
            <li> is my process, first I curled my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The first side is ok, but as soon as I go to put the second side on, it just clumps.</li>
            <li> Normally I love Covergirl, but this time they definitely missed the mark.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it I notice that one or two of my lashes would fall off</li>
            <li> Side one did curl the lashes pretty well</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely lengthens more than volumizes.</li>
            <li> but it gives my lashes so much volume!</li>
            <li> After the 2nd coat it looked even better ..</li>
            <li> It held up really well all day!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily!</li>
            <li> I used it specifically on a hot weekend, sweating through a horseback riding day and then a day at the pool.</li>
            <li> And this mascara really coats the sparse lashes I have, spread them out, and lengthen them!  </li>
            <li> It thickened my lashes, but not in a pretty way.</li>
            <li> really plumps up the volume!</li>
            <li> I was pretty scared to try this product</li>
            <li> first step lengthens my lashes&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> second step made it more thicker</li>
            <li> The second side plumped up my lashes and I feel really confident in this product, just after one use.</li>
            <li> I love the two separate brushes that helps to give your eyelashes a different look.</li>
            <li> Next time I use it I will be sure to have purchased the makeup remover.</li>
            <li> But step 2 really helped!</li>
            <li> Love the effects, just think if the brush was smaller an thiner</li>
            <li> the first time i tried it i thought it was a two part mascara (which its not)</li>
            <li> I love the double wand.</li>
            <li> and I actually really like it!</li>
            <li> And makes glop-eyes more likely.</li>
            <li> The second side if definitely more for nights out (which I use in combination with the first).</li>
            <li> But they do make my eye lashes look pretty.</li>
            <li> At first I was kind of skeptical because most of the reviews weren&#x27;t so hot , but then I tried it for myself and if you apply it lightly</li>
            <li> After putting on the first coat, my eyelashes stuck together.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to rest the back of the want on the palm of my hand, almost like a pencil (</li>
            <li> I will be attending next week though :)</li>
            <li> This mascara really carries the curves!</li>
            <li> It really lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> The first day I used it</li>
            <li> I  am not an avid mascara user</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear mascara much except for Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash mascara once in a while for church or when I go out with my husband.</li>
            <li> I have tried many department store and drugstore mascaras for my short blond lashes.  </li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product to every girl.</li>
            <li> I curled them first with an eyelash curler</li>
            <li> This stuff really stays on!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara last night compliments of Influenster completely free!</li>
            <li> From the first moment I put on this mascara</li>
            <li> It really stays put!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I played with it and did several layers</li>
            <li> It left some on, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> First you apply the #1  mascara that will give volume to your lashes and then you apply the #2 to seal the lashes.</li>
            <li> The difference between my naked eyelashes and the ones with the mascara is visible , the first pic has more length and definition.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Amazed with the results!</li>
            <li> Also it does not clump up is pretty is to take off with baby oil.</li>
            <li> Adds fullness and volume to make your eyes really POP!</li>
            <li> I love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who asks!</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t my first go to</li>
            <li> Thanks you influenster for allowing me to try it!</li>
            <li> I love how they&#x27;re is 2 different sides to this.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I look for in a mascara is if it  makes the lashes longer and this did just that.</li>
            <li> If I closed my eyes or even blinked my eyes kind of stuck together.</li>
            <li> I recommend letting the hot water in the shower run over your face and then use an eye makeup remover to get any residue off.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look much fuller!</li>
            <li> However I ended up really liking it!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want from a mascara.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the first week</li>
            <li> be wiping it off more in the future to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> I think that I will use them both together most of the time, but I can see myself only doing one side from time to time as well.</li>
            <li> Will be using this when I need that bigger lushious look. :)</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was my fault</li>
            <li> I have used multiple covergirl mascaras that I love</li>
            <li> I would rate it a lot higher.</li>
            <li> The first step is curved and allows you coat every lash evenly.  </li>
            <li> It even stays on pretty well while swimming .</li>
            <li> It has great lengthening ability in my opinion, but it was too thick and made my lashes stick together...</li>
            <li> After using side one the first time, I was already pleased with the appearance of my lashes, and the look only improved once I used side two.</li>
            <li> However, my curl still only lasts a couple hours at most.</li>
            <li> The wands are very short, I will guess from top to bottom it is around 1.5 inches (maybe 2 inches</li>
            <li> (I wore it for over 9 hrs and no issues) even in hot sunny days when you might be sweating.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I enjoyed this product and will probably purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it, I had to walk around granite warehouses with no air conditioning for 4 hours...</li>
            <li> First of all, I like the color of the mascara tube.</li>
            <li> Thanks Influencer!</li>
            <li> If you are an expert mascara applier, want heavy super long eyelashes, and don&#x27;t mind taking 15 minutes to clean just your eyelashes, this might be a great product....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I had never tried a double brush mascara before, and it is definitely an interesting experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying different brands and this is one I may have to purchase more than once.  </li>
            <li> I love how there are two different types of wands.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a sacrifice that I&#x27;m willing to make.</li>
            <li> I lost eyelashes for real, people!</li>
            <li> The second brush gave them a fuller look and more volume.</li>
            <li> At first I was kinda iffy because of the way the bottle was shaped</li>
            <li> I got this in my first influenster VoxBox.</li>
            <li> Overall its a ok mascara .</li>
            <li> So, yeah, it works pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact the first time I tried it I stabbed myself in the eye.  </li>
            <li> I like this mascara only because it makes my eyes show more</li>
            <li> Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> Really made my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> which was a surprise the first time I poked myself-</li>
            <li> My eyes really POPPED!</li>
            <li> Never have I used a mascara that made my eyelashes pop so much!</li>
            <li> Thanks Covergirl!</li>
            <li> The first end is rubber which I&#x27;ve never tried before,</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> eyelashes, but overall I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> but I really like this!</li>
            <li> Received this to try as part of my Influenster VoxBox -- really like it!</li>
            <li> I can use just one side or both sides to really amp it up!</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely isnt my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I decided to use my simple mascara when I am in a hurry, and the COVERGIRL bombshell mascara when I am going out and want to look sexy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite mascaras now.</li>
            <li> It does actually help my lashes to curl up more, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it a lower score.</li>
            <li> I just tried this today and &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; is pretty much exactly what I have to say about it.</li>
            <li> mostly made it think and a tiny bit clumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it as backup but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice by any means.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says, Bombshell Curvaceous.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy this product again :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that it was waterproof, but I will be interested to see how it does at the pool on 4th of July.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!  </li>
            <li> However upon trying the dual system first applying the curve then the thickening mascara</li>
            <li> The first is for curling and volumizing.</li>
            <li> must say it works very well!</li>
            <li> It really has staying power!</li>
            <li> really makes my eyes pop!  </li>
            <li> I initially thought this would be more of a primer/mascara duo</li>
            <li> My lashes on top stuck to my tiny lashes on bottom.</li>
            <li> and at first can be kinda sticky till it dries.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> The first time I screwed up and did two coats of the Step 1</li>
            <li> I’m one of those people who love the “spider” look of my eyelashes, and this mascara not only has one but two mascaras to give me that look.</li>
            <li> I really love that it has the two different brushes, allowing you to hit your  lashes from every angle.</li>
            <li> First thing I didn&#x27;t like were the mascara wands, I found them to be bulky</li>
            <li> Besides the weird smell, its pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> As far as removing the mascara as long as you have a good waterproof makeup remover</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my lashes more noticeable, but is a lot of work to get off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back to my outstanding Lancome duo--Hypnose Drama and L&#x27;Extreme--&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, the long lasting mascara is great until you have to take it off.</li>
            <li> The mascara is okay overall</li>
            <li> A few of my friends loved this mascara so I&#x27;ll be giving it to one of them since they asked to have it.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I do makeup wise everyday is my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something that will last through a good gym workout and make my lashes look long (they are not) and full (they are not).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, creates thick full lashes.</li>
            <li> Stays on long, and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> Overall, this mascara is a great long wearing lengthening mascara!</li>
            <li> Thus far, I have had zero problems with clumping or smearing, plus it behaves just like waterproof mascara, so I&#x27;m good to go all summer long!</li>
            <li> the wand is short and the container is bulky making application less than ideal.</li>
            <li> I like how well it stays, but it went on super thick and clumpy, so it took a lot of time for me to get it looking good.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to remove with a little coconut oil (I prefer to use natural products when I can)&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad</li>
            <li> It was somewhat similar to Elf&#x27;s mascara which is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have naturally long eye lashes that curl on their own, but this mascara gave it a nice little boost that my eye lashes needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m already a fan of the lashblast formula and large, plasticy brush and was pleased overall with this product as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who wants full lashes</li>
            <li> It have me a rich black color, flake free and tons of volume!</li>
            <li> I was actually using the original bombshell before I received this in my voxbox from influenster!</li>
            <li> I also had best results with scraping off a lot of the mascara from the second wand since it was so heavily coated, being brand new and all.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t work fast enough, it does get a bit clumpy, but it made my lashes HUGE!</li>
            <li> I recently received this product to try for free complimentary of Influenster...</li>
            <li> :) The only thing i really didnt like was side one bristles.</li>
            <li> While I do think it looks good once on my lashes, it is very sticky and heavy feeling to me.</li>
            <li> gotta say it worked really well probably better than the regular brushes.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Influenster recently and thought I&#x27;d love the second side because it had a fibery brush versus the first side, which was the plasticy, curved brush.</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s great ad worth a little extra effort</li>
            <li> I received this totally free to try and review from Inflenster&lt;br /&gt;While it does make them super long  </li>
            <li> I wear mascara and eye liner pretty much every day</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is pretty reasonable.  </li>
            <li> girl bombshell mascara really makes your eye lashes look full and fabulous all day long</li>
            <li> It is just as great as the more expensive brands I have tried!</li>
            <li> could not believe HOW much thicker and longer my lashes looked after just ONE application with the first step.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my long lashes look.</li>
            <li> Keep it real people ;)</li>
            <li> I ended up really liking this mascara (I&#x27;m wearing it now), but the first couple of times I used it, I had to get used to it.</li>
            <li> - if you use this mascara it is pretty much a must have to use a oil based eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> I love longer lashes because I don&#x27;t have long ones and they enhance your looks.</li>
            <li> If you want a mega volume boost, do a little more of step 1; if you&#x27;re feeling like you&#x27;d like to accentuate more length, do a little more of step 2.</li>
            <li> really like it, this is the first time i&#x27;ve ever tried Covergirl mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for a good mascara that lengthens, curls and volumizes my lashes for the past year.</li>
            <li> (I even skipped my usual eyelash-curling step, and got good results).</li>
            <li> I did have a little bit of the clumping issue others mentioned, but I found I was able to fix it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I recently got this in an influenster box and although it is a decent mascara I feel Covergirl has better (clump crusher).</li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of mascaras and this one holds its own against even more expensive</li>
            <li> have very straight lashes that can and do go unnoticed, it takes a lot to make them look nice.  </li>
            <li> but this was so shiny it reflected white and made it look like the full areas of my lashes had holes!</li>
            <li> Definitely a must buy for those of you seeking those luscious and full lashes!</li>
            <li> I love how long and separated my eyelashes look with this product and it stays put ALL day!</li>
            <li> I love that there were two different brushes with this mascara, because I was able to get the volume from one side and the intensity from the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars due to my very own personal unliking.</li>
            <li> I probably would use this for a special occasion when I have a little more time to get ready.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the mascara itself, or if it&#x27;s the fact that my eyes are super sensitive when it comes to mascara.  </li>
            <li> and like it, it&#x27;s easy enough to put on</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a problem for me given that my skin is super sensitive with make up.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t like my make up easy to remove.</li>
            <li> it just seems like a dry brush to comb your lashes to give them more separation ....</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t come off as easy as they say.</li>
            <li> I have three rows of lashes and find it difficult to find a great mascara for naturally full lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and last all day without clumps.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is easy enough to take off</li>
            <li> I could see myself using this on a daily basis easily.</li>
            <li> I curled my lashes as normal (they usually only stay curled for a couple of hours at most)</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t work better than the ones without primer, plus it made my lashes feel dry.</li>
            <li> Both steps were easy to use and I would use it next time</li>
            <li> Very decent mascara.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that there are 2 steps, rather than the easy mascara you apply once when you&#x27;re running out the door in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The color is dark and gives such a great curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never loved Cover Girl mascaras, but I recently tried this mascara and it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li> Loved the step 2, it helped create a long lasting look.</li>
            <li> I would have to press the handle area against my face in order to reach certain area of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I find it is rather large and not that convenient.</li>
            <li> it will smart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new go-to mascara!!</li>
            <li> great mascara and easily removed with cold cream or make-up wipes</li>
            <li> It is a great solid black, and stays.</li>
            <li> Performing step 1 that second time helped better distribute the mascara that was laid down for volume, and it helped add more length while avoiding clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of COVERGIRL mascaras and buy more expensive brands, but when I received this complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes, I fell in love!</li>
            <li> The tube is too bulky and the wands are too short, it ran a LITTLE bit in very humid hot conditions, but it applies great and gives an amazing false lash look, change the tube and I&#x27;ll be a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> For a quick and on the go day, I will normally just throw on some mascara to make my eyes a little wider and more pronounced, and this really did the trick!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and it dries pretty quickly between the first and second coat.  </li>
            <li> received this mascara courtesy of Influenster.com and am writing this review for product testing purposes - that said, the product has been tested and approved by this particular user!</li>
            <li> While there are some things I loved about the product (bold color, dramatic lashes) the negatives outweighed the positive.</li>
            <li> then I use two and my lashes are super long and bold.</li>
            <li> but side two did clump the lashes a little bit, but overall it did make my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit more time to do both steps every morning, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> The shade of black is dark and bold and it provides great, even coverage.</li>
            <li> The product is hard to take off but with a good oil based makeup remover it should come off.</li>
            <li> Even if you use a good oil based remover it is still somewhat hard to get it all off.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the two steps was necessary but there actually is a huge difference when you apply both.</li>
            <li> This mascara actually makes my lashes look like huge faux Kim Kardashian lashes, without having to glue anything over my eyeball.</li>
            <li> Overall though, a great product that I will add to my everyday routine.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes stay curled throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this mascara.</li>
            <li> nothing really separates.</li>
            <li> I also really soak the cotton pad with remover which may be another reason.  </li>
            <li> also use Lancome Drama waterproof mascara and would rate the Cover Girl just as highly!</li>
            <li> The mascara is not marketed as waterproof, but takes some time to remove with my makeup wipes, so it could probably withstand some light water although I have not personally tested it as such.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like how it&#x27;s dual tipped.</li>
            <li> I diodes not clump or anything I agree on it being sticky, but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> Thanks covergirl for making a product that is in everyone&#x27;s price range.</li>
            <li> It goes on without any clumps and very evenly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the chunkiness of the tube, but I don&#x27;t really see the need for the &amp;#34;2-step&amp;#34; process.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really made my lashes look thicker though.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes stand out and really accents my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really you guys should check it</li>
            <li> It does however make lashes pop and curl really well.  </li>
            <li> Although it has the curved wand it really didn&#x27;t help curl my lashes.</li>
            <li> I really like the formula of this, but one shortcoming, literally.</li>
            <li> but i absolutely recommend this if you dont mind the difficulty of removing it.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to testing this product</li>
            <li> It really lengthens and defines lashes well and doesn&#x27;t cake on like some defining mascaras.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pump up the volume of my lashes that much.</li>
            <li> I tried this today, I like the two steps - that really seems to make a difference in the plump/long lash look.</li>
            <li> I have really been liking the curve and length that this product is giving me.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> COVERGIRL wanted to give us a product that embodied a bombshell, and I have to say I really think it lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> I really like the step one brush, it really gets between each lash to amplify and separate.</li>
            <li> it stays on really well</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil to get it off and it does really well</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look much longer.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have a lot fuller lashes than I really do.</li>
            <li> This mascara really lasts.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from Influenster.com for testing purposes, and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I felt like it really did curl my lashes and make them look fuller, longer and darker.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want it as intense</li>
            <li> I like how much fuller they looked</li>
            <li> It really did lift and define my lashes while making them look voluminous.</li>
            <li> I typically only wear mascara on a day-to-day basis because my eyelashes are so light.</li>
            <li> That is even when I don&#x27;t build the mascara up much.</li>
            <li> Yet, it is very durable.  </li>
            <li> and I really like how it defines my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t clump them.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I found it to work really well.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really separate the hair that well.</li>
            <li> This mascara was definitely better than I expected.</li>
            <li> once I have been asked if my eyelashes were real or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does not wear off throughout the day, does not smear, and even stayed put through a very vigorous workout in a non air conditioned place.</li>
            <li> Mascara is my absolute must when venturing out</li>
            <li> and I feel like it made my eye lashes look much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to get it off but as far as making your lashes look great, it definitely does that.</li>
            <li> I have been a Maybelline mascara for years and this didn&#x27;t really change my mind.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t add much curl.</li>
            <li> Thanks covergirl and influenster</li>
            <li> it really add volume and lenght to my lashes.this</li>
            <li> thanks cover girl and Influenster.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I got this prodcut from Infuenster and I think the whole two sided mascara is overrated.</li>
            <li> It really helped to make my lashes pop.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very big and doesn&#x27;t fit well in my make up bag that I carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very unattractive.</li>
            <li> so much ive never had a mascara that doubled the length of my eyelashes like this.</li>
            <li> Really provides length and curl plus has endurance.</li>
            <li> With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this Covergirl mascara, which I received complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes, and they are very... unnoticeable on their own and even when i am using a lot of different brands of mascaras.</li>
            <li> and it really thickens them.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for some help with my shirt, blond, straight lashes.  </li>
            <li> I like this product it works very well and holds curl.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I found it to be very clumpy on my eyelashes though.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> it really makes my lashes fuller and longer and its not playing when it says its waterproof.</li>
            <li> not so much the feeling.</li>
            <li> When you look from the front, there is still not too much difference</li>
            <li> and it also is very sticky</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> To begin with I want to say that I am really picky about my mascara.</li>
            <li> You absolutely need to use makeup remover to get it out of your eyelashes and</li>
            <li> It really helped darken and curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it is that it doesn&#x27;t really come off too well with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> and this mascara really pops up my lashes.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;bleeds&amp;#34; onto my skin (I have very oily skin)</li>
            <li> but I have used this product before and really like it.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t volumize much, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look thicker.</li>
            <li> Really brings out your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying I&#x27;m very picky with my mascaras.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> when using both i really cant tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I do like this product even though the whole things is to bulky and really dont feel the need when using it to use both sides because i cant see any changes.</li>
            <li> I had very noticeable longer thicker fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li> This mascara really curled my lashes and gave them a ton of volume, and</li>
            <li> There are two different wands in the tube, however I honestly don&#x27;t see much difference after adding the second step.</li>
            <li> It thickens my lashes really well</li>
            <li> When you are ready to take it off, it takes a lot of work with an oil based cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This mascara really is the BOMB.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes i feel its lasting feature is important than getting is washed away with oil based liquid.</li>
            <li> That really helped define and separate my lashes.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is having to buy make up remover that isn&#x27;t oil free</li>
            <li> Then it dries SO fast</li>
            <li> But the color is intense and it does give volume which I like.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> All in all, it does thicken and lengthen like it says but takes to much time to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> , I ended up really liking the mascara.</li>
            <li> Stayed on really well.</li>
            <li> I must say that I really do like this mascara.</li>
            <li> This really gives you the maximum bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> It pumps up my lashes so much.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it off very well with removers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara very often.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am really picky when it comes to mascara</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It also wears very well.</li>
            <li> Using both sides clumps my lashes too much (hence the 4 stars).</li>
            <li> I got this in an Influenster box, and though I have no brand loyalty for mascara, I do tend to really like Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> Mascara can really change the look of your eyes</li>
            <li> I received this for free for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li> It also makes it feel like there isn&#x27;t much makeup in the tubes</li>
            <li> The plus side is that this stuff it really water proof.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much curling with Step 1....</li>
            <li> and I have yet to find a mascara that really lengthens and makes them noticeable without spending a lot of time curling and layering lots of product onto them.  </li>
            <li> To really test it, I didn&#x27;t curl my lashes ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really got nothing to say about this stuff.</li>
            <li> Overall like the look and enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara for the stay put factor.</li>
            <li> and was very eager to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m very picky about mascara</li>
            <li> and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I got it early today as a complimentary test product from Influenster</li>
            <li> Thanks to influenster</li>
            <li> Also I didn&#x27;t really follow the instructions for taking it off with an oil based makeup remover</li>
            <li> This mascara made my lashes appear much longer and fuller without looking clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I got this product to try compliments of influenster, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t much for using mascara before I tried this</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this mascara for ladies with similar lashes to my own.</li>
            <li> Lastly, this does remove nicely with regular makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love curvy, dark lashes and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The formula was nice in that I could build a few coats to increase the intensity to my liking.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I liked the first and second coats, but it got crispy and dry.</li>
            <li> I live in the south, where it&#x27;s hot and humid during the summer.</li>
            <li> It is a good mascara, it gives big eyelashes just not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Very good product, and you can really make a dramatic look with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very waterproof and you&#x27;ll need actual make remover to clean it off.</li>
            <li> most other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> Mascara is my one key makeup item, so I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good, but a bit gimmicky.</li>
            <li> When applied normally, my lashes look thicker and longer, and they did not clump!  </li>
            <li> mascara is a good deal larger than your normal mascara and has two wands attached to the center part and two reservoirs of mascara.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> It plumps the lashes way better then the other mascaras out there.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t flake like so many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once its on it doesn&#x27;t flake off like many other brands I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I felt that it worked as well as the other CoverGirl Lashblast mascaras, which I really love and added a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> personally use covergirl mascara, so i was excited to recieve this product.</li>
            <li> On the other hand if you already love layering mascara this won&#x27;t bother you one bit.</li>
            <li> The product is double ended and contains two kinds of mascara which you layer for a unique look.</li>
            <li> There are other mascaras from this brand that work alot better.</li>
            <li> This mascara tends to clump more often than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I give it a four star because it does not come off easily but other than that it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Alone, the two mascaras do very little, but together they do give me a nicely curled, intense look.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants full looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I love that its double ended and is not rough on the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> So, if youre willing to put in the extra work to take it off, its worth it 100%.</li>
            <li> the extra clean up since it dramatically changes the look of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and really makes my lashes look long and curvy.</li>
            <li> After a full day of swimming, and NO running of the mascara I really put it to the test and the only thing that removed it was an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this mascara for like a working girl in a professional setting or a girl who likes a bold but natural make up</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara especially with long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I Find the coverage and the shape of the want very helpful on the hard to reach areas but what i live most of all is the durability and makes my eyelashes stay nice and curled for a long time.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s very easy to apply although I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my everyday mascara</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good, however, it could use some slimming down.</li>
            <li> : the # 1 side lays down a nice mascara that seems to thicken up the lashes, the side# 2 curves the lashes and seal it in making it near indestructible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good, however, it could use some slimming down.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s defiantly worth it to spend a few extra bucks on COVERGIRL&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara, I just absolutely love this item!</li>
            <li> I liked how it made my eyes look, very dramatic, would be lovely for a night out</li>
            <li> So I only use it for special nights out</li>
            <li> but I do feel like the black was more intense</li>
            <li> This one really thickens and lengthens much more than a typical waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have super straight and short lashes.</li>
            <li> The last two times I wore it, I was short on time, so only used the #1 side, which seemed to make my lashes look just as good.  </li>
            <li> Give full eyelashes that last all day.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> but I did not see as much volume than my normal length.</li>
            <li> Also looked very shiny, normally I like a glossy coat of mascara</li>
            <li> However, you have to use a true make-up remover to remove this product (I generally only use face wash); however, that is also a testament to the staying power of the mascara throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous definitely gave me the full volume i was looking for.</li>
            <li> But soaking for at least 5 seconds using Almay oil-free eye makeup remover worked wonders and I&#x27;ve found it removes more cleanly and easily than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either, just middle of the road.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the fact that this clumps super easily, and feels incredibly heavy on.</li>
            <li> Amazing made my lashes look full and dramatic.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and long lasting too.</li>
            <li> I will say that the 2 times I used the mascara #1 side only, it seemed to remove more easily, but not totally sure about that</li>
            <li> Made my whole day a little better...</li>
            <li> My new fav!</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li> It took my lashes to new lengths!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and work long, hot, 12-hr shifts and this mascara can stand the test!!</li>
            <li> the tube is too big.....makes it too hard to handle.....as far as the mascara ....does not go on as good as i like......</li>
            <li> Love the curved wand, really helped open up my eyes and elongate my lashes and the flat wand</li>
            <li> It makes them seem much fuller and lively.</li>
            <li> The mascara didn&#x27;t run or flake and love black under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t achieve the amount of volume that I typically like and ended up putting a coat of my favorite mascara on over it.  </li>
            <li> I just had to be careful when applying because it clumps easily.</li>
            <li> While I had no problems removing it, that may be because I only use removers for waterproof eye makeup and only two top brands - Lancome and Clinique.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras all from different brands.</li>
            <li> I received it in my Influenster Box to try :) Definitely gives my short lashed some length and volume!</li>
            <li> But it is decent.</li>
            <li> im really particular about mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my lashes look so long and full.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a decent mascara.</li>
            <li> What is nice is you could use one side wait until it&#x27;s empty and then use the second side.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the CoverGirl Bombshell Curvaceous mascara in a VoxBox provided Influenster.com.</li>
            <li> I have super short eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have always been searching for a product that will not only enhance my top lashes, but provide the definition for my lower lashes and this definitely helped.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the wand is kind of clunky and makes it harder to control application.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> I love that it has 2 different wands for different effects.</li>
            <li> Glad I got to try this product and will definitely buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again though because it&#x27;s a decent price and works well.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a decent, well-priced performer that is convenient to get then give this a shot.</li>
            <li> It did give decent volume though.</li>
            <li> Out of the various mascaras I have received recently this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> only thing I wish it did a better job of was making my individual lashes look thicker.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy it again and the price is very reasonable!</li>
            <li> and I was impressed by how long and thick it actually made my lashes.</li>
            <li> Great dark black color.</li>
            <li> SO many people are complaining that it is hard to get off, but i found it easy when I used a simple eye make up remover!</li>
            <li> Also I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you buy an oil-based eye makeup remover to remove this mascara.</li>
            <li> Before trying this mascara, I had high hopes it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascera!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> All in all if someone were to ask for a mascara recommendation this would go high up on my list.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was highly recommended after the #surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy again if they changed their packaging to something a little more application-friendly and sleek.</li>
            <li> All in all, really great product if you are looking for some serious drama and lasting ability!</li>
            <li> I like the product, it can be kind of sticky and can also be hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara, however it was hard to remove even with waterproof makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> so it was kind of hard to use because of the size.</li>
            <li> I liked the mascara, it stayed on all day, but was hard to take off when I wanted to.</li>
            <li> Almost as quickly as I applied it, my lashes fell flat as well as my hopes.  </li>
            <li> The first wand is fine, but for as big as the tube is, there&#x27;s not much to go around and the wands are really short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble getting it to come off, but overall I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually care for waterproof, too hard to remove, but this great mascara!</li>
            <li> This is like concrete on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I was impressed and shocked.</li>
            <li> While it looks GREAT it is extremely difficult to get off and makes your eyelashes brittle.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara for everyday use.</li>
            <li> To me it is like a normal mascara, but with a 2-step process.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it now and use it everyday</li>
            <li> They look long and full.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally one to say, why make it two steps?  </li>
            <li> and he said, &amp;#34;your eyelashes aren&#x27;t as clumpy...and look longer&amp;#34; and his normal response would have been, &amp;#34;am I supposed to notice something different&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I’m not gonna be completely harsh on this mascara because I did love it when I would pair it with falsies</li>
            <li> I recently received this mascara complimentary form Influenser for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it curled or made my lashes look any thicker than my normal mascara,  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look long and full.  </li>
            <li> It was a lovely everyday type of mascara.</li>
            <li> Normally I use waterproof just for the staying power</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to higher end brand mascaras like Dior or bare minerals</li>
            <li> making my lashes look full, curved and long.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I think is worth mentioning is that this stuff won&#x27;t budge off your lashes.</li>
            <li> It make my lashes so full, bolld and long, I have tried all brands of mascara</li>
            <li> I felt like the double application was really worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off all over my face during a normal work day.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with Step 1 because I usually have to separate my lashes because they are so thick.</li>
            <li> I probably wont purchase again just because most mornings I do a five minute makeup routine and this does not fit into my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to do one eye at a time though because I waited too long between 1 &amp; 2 so one of my eyes was clumpy when I used the second brush.</li>
            <li> but overall it wasn&#x27;t bad.i received this product complimentary for testing purposes from influenster.</li>
            <li> It makes your eye lashes full and long without making them look like spider lashes.</li>
            <li> Most of the mascara ended up staying clumped on my lashes for a few days.</li>
            <li> I feel like the first step really lengthens my lashes and the second step adds volume.</li>
            <li> I received a full-size Bombshell Curvaceous complimentary from Influenster &amp; COVERGIRL in my #SurfsUpVoxBox, and I will definitely purchase another when mine runs out</li>
            <li> Even my husband, who is the most unobservant human being in the universe when it comes to my makeup noticed how long my eyelashes</li>
            <li> Like any waterproof product,  takes some work to remove but the time is well worth this amount of definition and volume at the same time.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use make up remover to take it off (or even just lotion on a cotton round).</li>
            <li> in which I normally just put on eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I normally use high-end sample mascara freebies from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I normally use covergirl mascara that is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love how long lasting the mascara is.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> The application is really easy, and washes off very quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lashes like previous mascaras!</li>
            <li> I just recently tried the new Perversion Mascara from Urban Decay, and this Cover Girl mascara is far better.</li>
            <li> i received a sample of this product from influenster and this is the best mascara that i&#x27;ve ever had it holds up well for hours and gives my eyelashes a dramatic look that i can&#x27;t get with other brands</li>
            <li> I wanted more volume and a deeper black, but I am finding this is just clumping my eyelashes together!</li>
            <li> The first side basically made your lashes look longer and less clumped while the second side added more color.</li>
            <li> I love the dramatization that the black brings to my eyes!</li>
            <li> This was, as other posters have mentioned, somewhat hard to remove with regular remover but is a great product!</li>
            <li> Formula is ok but is very sticky and takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> The key for me was to make sure that I didn&#x27;t leave any time at all to let step 1 dry before applying step 2.</li>
            <li> The liquid seems build able, though it would wait for it to dry before trying a second coat.</li>
            <li> Typically, I am strictly a Benefit Cosmetics mascara kind of girl but this CoverGirl Bombshell mascara definitely lived up to my mascara standards.</li>
            <li> I love the curve brush on one end and the straight brush on the other and how the 2nd one coats and makes it stick – waterproofing.  </li>
            <li> Third, right after applying Step 1, I applied Step 2:</li>
            <li> I am even wearing it into the next day right now.</li>
            <li> The upper right photo is</li>
            <li> I already have very long and full lashes</li>
            <li> and I love the very black because it gives them a sense of being fuller, and it stretches out my lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love this mascra,and i am very picky when it comes to mascara this totally adds volume to your lashes as it goes on evenly theres no clumping which is a big big plus!</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I received this mascara free from the Surf&#x27;s Up Voxbox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its fabulous.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews with it not coming off.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, it works really well since my lashes are pretty blond and are thin.</li>
            <li> I really live this product</li>
            <li> This mascara claims to curve, volumize, and define your lashes with their new two part</li>
            <li> Id recommend this product to anyone looking for some new mascara.</li>
            <li> This new mascara (or new to me because I have never seen it before) was the bomb as the name suggests.</li>
            <li> and I can live with that.</li>
            <li> and then I try a new mascara</li>
            <li> This is seriously my new go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> so I am always picky about trying out new mascara.</li>
            <li> What I liked about this mascara is that it dries soft and not crispy and hard.  </li>
            <li> generally don&#x27;t bother using mascara since i live in a warm climate and usually in the pool.</li>
            <li> but with this mascara its much harder to clean</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it goes on smoothly, lasts, and makes my eye lashes look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes</li>
            <li> I have been trying many mascaras lately and was very nervous about trying this one after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> no clumps, quick dry time.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are naturally long, so I usually look for mascara with good volume and separation.</li>
            <li> It has to dry moderately quick so that when I look up from applying it, I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> I liked the color, how long it stayed on, and how dark it made my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> The volume is a nice, casual amount, not crazy night time.</li>
            <li> I count on it for big, clump free lashes that have been lasting me through the sweat &amp; tears of the World Cup so far!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, as unlike other mascaras I have used in the past in looked good throughout the day and into the evening.</li>
            <li> The price range is very reasonable and it&#x27;s a definite go-to!</li>
            <li> It is long lasting but easily removable as well.</li>
            <li> Since it is long lasting, this is not something you can remove easily</li>
            <li> It dried pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find that the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara did that pretty instantly.  </li>
            <li> Orginally, I was skeptical of the multi-layer function of this mascara, but after using the ends one after another like suggested, my results were amazing!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get this anywhere near your eyes without bumping into your face!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster to try, and WOW!</li>
            <li> I have pretty moderate lashes but with Bombshell Curvaceous, my lashes are luscious!!</li>
            <li> I like the dual brushes, and how the first brush actually curled my lashes.</li>
            <li> I would buy this mascara if it only had the first formula.</li>
            <li> The first brush separated and curled my lashes while the second brush layered on the mascara and lengthened my lashes.</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this mascara!</li>
            <li> The only issues I have are: my eyes are still pretty watery, but this mascara does not advertise itself to be hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> The first brush helps to put mascara on each lash and the second makes them fuller!</li>
            <li> with this mascara, 1-2 coats is enough because with the first coat, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I used the first side then the second</li>
            <li> There is a lot of product, double that of many other mascaras, but that led to a bulky product.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Cover Girl, for finally making exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this was that it was really sticky!</li>
            <li> It stays on and it doesn&#x27;t rub off even in the hot Southern California weather.</li>
            <li> The tube is pretty big</li>
            <li> First off I didn&#x27;t like how big and bulky it is.</li>
            <li> Covergirl has always been known for their inexpensive yet with professional looking make up make up results &amp; they still got it!</li>
            <li> Each eye I switch wands so I can get the second mascara on before the first dries.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no clumping on the bristles, and the small amount product on the end of the brush doesn&#x27;t leave lumps of product on your lashes like most brushes do.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money !</li>
            <li> I even slept with it on and it looked the same as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty solid.</li>
            <li> It was actually pretty simple!!</li>
            <li> As soon as you open the tube, the smell is the first thing you notice.</li>
            <li> Its pretty massive.  </li>
            <li> Oh and the bottle itself, is pretty big!  </li>
            <li> So far I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I love the double wand and it doesn&#x27;t clump together like many other mascara that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the first wand.</li>
            <li> If you want super long, curly lashes, spend the extra money on Benefit or Urban Decay Super Curl.</li>
            <li> it is easy to take off with a little soap and water or water by itself.</li>
            <li> The black color is intense and bold and it volumes and DOES NOT clump.</li>
            <li> I Recieved this product free from Influenster, Hands Down</li>
            <li> This mascara make my lashes dark, long, full and bold.</li>
            <li> The wand was very stiff and put on a very light coat.</li>
            <li> Stays clump free and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I typically buy $30 mascara but got this one for free from influenster.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I actually adored the first side.</li>
            <li> but once I put on the first coat and then flipped it and did the second, wow what a difference and enhancement it made.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I liked the results, dont get me wrong.</li>
            <li> It does not get full stars because I have found mascaras that do the same thing without having to use two different wands.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the difference between other mascaras I used and this one, this one last much more longer and also make my lashes much longer, I will be purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> Love the double wand, curling and volumising brush and then the intensify brush make such a great duo, I have very thin, sparse eyelashes and the usual suspects as far as volumising mascaras never really make my eyes pop, they just clump and look spidery, this one is much better than any I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> but alas, I love it!</li>
            <li> This product makes my lashes look 3 times as full and voluminous than any other.</li>
            <li> All in all not a bad mascara at all just doesn&#x27;t work well for me, I would choose one of the other Covergirl mascaras before I pick this one up.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply doesn&#x27;t smudge last all day long!!!</li>
            <li> or I can use the second wand for extra bold lashes.  </li>
            <li> I  would like it if the wand was a different shape and that the container wasn&#x27;t so large.</li>
            <li> but they quickly fell back down after I applied my first coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> I have really light lashes and a little leftover doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the mascara to anyone who has little to no eyelashes or light colored.</li>
            <li> However, like other reviewers, I am not sure if the side 2 really makes the whole thing better.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is sometimes when I use it, it&#x27;ll clump a bit and requires a little more time to fix.</li>
            <li> I have also seen this in many drugstores so it will not be hard to find.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes do look a bit more longer using this and taking it off isn&#x27;t so hard since I use olive oil to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> I loved the product a lot it just at moments went on a little clumpy and felt heavy when it did</li>
            <li> Covergirl&#x27;s new bombshell mascara is easy to put on but very messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything and this is by far the craziest mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like the double applicator!</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised when I found this mascara inside for me to test.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li> my lashes were long, curly, and really, well, bombshell-esque!  </li>
            <li> I like that it has two different wands but wish the whole thing was thinner.</li>
            <li> It held up to my expectations as far as waterproof goes.</li>
            <li> I like my lashes to be soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> For me, it seems the curved side really adds length and the regular side adds volume.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it was the fact that it is much like a waterproof mascara and does require the use of an oil makeup remover.</li>
            <li> the wand is too short and the mascara was VERY clumpy.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I think the trick is really in the 2 different application brushes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li> The second step really adds length and separates the lashes.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the mascara, it really defines and separates,</li>
            <li> I really like the double end of it.</li>
            <li> but I think if you just used one you really could not tell the different.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the two wands, but they are both short and just don&#x27;t feel very intuitive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t come across a lot of mascaras that really impress me, but this one definitely does.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST make sure to put on mascara.</li>
            <li> I am cheap, so I prob wouldn&#x27;t buy it or use it everyday, but I will use it for dates and nights out.</li>
            <li> My lashes are naturally curly</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a mascara that was reasonably priced that actually did what was promised...</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised by the mascara.</li>
            <li> And I really really like it actually.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about</li>
            <li> I like a natural look</li>
            <li> I really dig the Bombshell Curvaceous, as it definitely adds some va-va-voom to my peepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also found the whole wand to be a bit clunky, but I have tiny carny-sized hands ...</li>
            <li> mascara is also a stubborn beast to get off when just washing your face, and since I like to keep oils / makeup removers away from my v. sensitive eyeballz, I&#x27;ll just have to settle waking up looking like a $2 whore.</li>
            <li> I have lashes like I did in my early 30s</li>
            <li> It also has a chemical-like smell so if you have a sensitive nose, be warned.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m liking the results.  </li>
            <li> I used three pads of remover for each eye before it was completely off.  </li>
            <li> I really like the volume of this mascara, it separates my lashes and lengthens at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I was admittedly surprised about that.</li>
            <li> I have naturally sparse lashes that want to point downwards.</li>
            <li> look and the complete review on my blog.</li>
            <li> However I find that if I combine it with a second mascara, I can really achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li> My lashes also looked fuller and longer, thicker and made my eyes just completely pop.</li>
            <li> Is not clumpy or flaky and doesn&#x27;t irritate my usually sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Really well, actually.</li>
            <li> i was surprised by the size</li>
            <li> Could be that my eyes are just sensitive, or it could be that it contains a harsher chemical.</li>
            <li> A 2- step process with professional results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see the difference after applying the second step.</li>
            <li> Bombshell Curvaceous is a two part system mascara, with a volumizing and curling top coat, and a secondary intensifying coat.  </li>
            <li> Take my advice, do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> For me, it seems the curved side really adds length and the regular side adds volume.</li>
            <li> but if I can&#x27;t use my current eye makeup remover I really don&#x27;t see the point of bothering...</li>
            <li> The second just felt like too much.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes but with this mascara it makes them look full as well as add extra length.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it would have been nice if the brush length was longer.  </li>
            <li> I thought the hassle of having two different wands would get on my nerves, but the results are completely worth the extra step.  </li>
            <li> but, It definitely gives my lashes a long and full look.</li>
            <li> My lashes are full and dark.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have used that makes my lashes long and full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not a make up person, the only time I wear make up is when I have to get dressed up to go somewhere nice</li>
            <li> Even though my lashes don&#x27;t look outrageously thick or voluminous I am really satisfied with how well it has stayed on my lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not AMAZING but definitely not horrible.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews before trying it was scary but I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes, however they are very straight.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up liking this mascara more than my previous one!</li>
            <li> I am always curious about new mascaras because of my pretty pitiful lashes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for black glue in a tube, you have come to the right place!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are already very long, so this makes them look really full without making them clumpy, even with multiple coats from two wands.</li>
            <li> The up side is that it is super long lasting.</li>
            <li> so I mean its ok.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;d definitely choose other Covergirl products over this one.</li>
            <li> This time I used the 2nd side first and the 1st last and WOW!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in the color &#x27;very black&#x27; for free from Influenster for testing purchases.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear mascara, but when I do they are easy to remove.</li>
            <li> When I used this the first problem was it didn&#x27;t dry for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Makes your eyelashes look long and thick, I love it!</li>
            <li> I liked the product, it wasn&#x27;t heavy and clumpy like other mascara</li>
            <li> In general I don&#x27;t like a lot of mascara because my eyes are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty big around and hard to get a comfortable grip on</li>
            <li> For someone with barely any lashes to begin with, it&#x27;s nice to have something that actually accentuates my lashes without looking like I&#x27;ve tried too hard.</li>
            <li> Thought at first it would be a little much.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as what I expected from CG the #2 made it weird and clumpy if you added too much!</li>
            <li> No clumps, no mess.  </li>
            <li> If the two wands were a little longer, it would be a good contender with the type of mascara I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> The dark color was nice but it made my eyelashes look a little spidery and it flaked off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The colors very black, and it&#x27;s pretty much easy to use like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I wear waterproof mascara on a regular basis and have never had anyone mention anything in particular about it.  </li>
            <li> I really like how dark and, yes, intense it looked all day.</li>
            <li> Its very big, and with a tremor I need to balance my hand on the bridge of my nose as I apply eye makeup to steady my hand.  </li>
            <li> Its bitter sweet because it last all day and is water proof.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to others to try, its unique from every other brush application out there.</li>
            <li> For a generic brand (as opposed to CK, Benefit, M.A.C) it was a decent mascara.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly, meaning my eyes don&#x27;t get those black streaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long lasting mascara and worth trying.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to any girl who loves a strong dark eyelash!</li>
            <li> I am unsure about the first step because it seemed very dry and didn&#x27;t seem to be putting anything on my lashes.</li>
            <li> they where full, dark and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks CoverGirl!</li>
            <li> and I really like how it makes my eyelashes look, but it is super hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Overall I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, especially if you want to feel glamorous!!</li>
            <li> Every time I try something new, I through it away after a few times and always go back to my original.  </li>
            <li> I generally use clear.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from Influenster and I am not totally pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascara because I have long lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara does add length and separates the lashes, but since my lashes are already long and separated, that doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It really makes your eyelashes look long and voluptuous</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes and it made them look much longer giving a fuller look.</li>
            <li> Since I have thin short lashes, this really pleased me!  </li>
            <li> normally I have to use three different types of mascara to achieve the look I get with just this one product!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like having to do this extra step and have yet to see any primer that made a difference.</li>
            <li> Two-step mascaras have never really been my first choice</li>
            <li> However, I could not give it the full 5 Stars because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of how &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to take off and it last all day.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to remove, but not impossible.</li>
            <li> When I put it on the first time it was okay, but the second time it was very clumpy, very heavy, and very messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other drug store products that cost less than this product and give much better results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to a waterproof mascara, and if you try too hard to rub it off, I&#x27;ve read many reviews of where people have lost their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love how it gives me eyelashes since mine are short, but i dont like that its kinda hard to remove and sticky.</li>
            <li> After a mishap with a curling wand a few years ago, I have a hard time getting a good curl to my lashes.</li>
            <li> It really is waterproof and stays for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My eyes were instantly big, bright and extra dramatic.</li>
            <li> But it did dry fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being Asian, I have very short, straight lashes.  </li>
            <li> I actually double both this mascara and the yellow volume one together to make a very dramtic look.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my lashes look big and doesnt really clump.</li>
            <li> The two wands is a really neat idea, especially with two different formulas.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much different from side 2, but I don&#x27;t have full or dark lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> My only point of contention is the second step can get sticky if you take to much time applying it</li>
            <li> it really LASTS-in spite of our humid Southern weather, I had it last ALL day, including beach time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for length and volume since I have small eyes and want them to really pop, so the pretty packaging and hype drew me in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better mascaras, but I do rank this top 3.</li>
            <li> Overall I love how thick and curly they look</li>
            <li> The first wand is what columizes , lengthens , and primes the eyelashes and the second wand really deepens your eyes and brings out that dark eyelashes!</li>
            <li> One of the major negatives of this product for me is the fact that to get off, you must use an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li> First step to volumize lift and curl, second step to amplify and intensify lashes as well as to seal the mascara to keep it on all day long!</li>
            <li> The first step makes your lashes extra long!</li>
            <li> It was too hot to wear any other makeup</li>
            <li> I used to put baby powder on my lashes, this would lead to some major clumping.</li>
            <li> The other end added fullness where the first end added length.</li>
            <li> I love how thick my lashes become after using step 2!</li>
            <li> The only thing that kind of sucks is how hard this stuff is to remove, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The second step is a dark, intensifying topcoat that gives bold, noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump, the design is slightly awkward because of the double ended brush, but it is easily accommodated.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to apply but it was worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Although I thought the packaging was a little ackward, a little too big, I really liked the sealant.</li>
            <li> the tube is a bit overly large &amp; it&#x27;s kind of awkward to hold the first few times.</li>
            <li> And I generally just don&#x27;t care for that type of brush.</li>
            <li> The sttick is incredibly thick/too wide and the brushes are short, which makes it awkward to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li> I usually stick to the same mineral mascara I&#x27;ve been using for years, but I received this mascara free from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Overall I enjoy it but not sure if I would repurchase</li>
            <li> This really extended my already long lashes which I dident even think was possible.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were so long and pretty all day long.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and really makes my lashes look defined.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute and definitely catches your eye especially since there are not many double sided mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the two step process did not take longer than my traditional mascara product (with two coats) and that this waterproof mascara was truly that!</li>
            <li> and I can say that I have never used a mascara with the double wand action.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how big the tube is</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you have to use a lot of make up remover to remove it completely.</li>
            <li> The two step process is not heavy or clumpy, it actually feels like you have no mascara on.</li>
            <li> but that apparently did not help.  </li>
            <li> The 1st wand gave a natural lift but the 2nd want just made it clumpy</li>
            <li> It goes on well and stays all day with barely any flaking off.</li>
            <li> it has the same effect, but it&#x27;s not nearly so heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> As far as the application, I did see a difference between Step 1 and Step 2 - Step 2 definitely maximizes the look!  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely zero issues with it coming off/running off/flecking off during the day, even when I spent it at the beach/pool.</li>
            <li> Then after you screw it back in, you unscrew the second wand &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; and apply to lashes with the straight wand to add volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an instant change.</li>
            <li> It packs lashes big enough for a fancy event, but simple enough that as your only makeup you look fresh for summer.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the packaging to be honest but as soon as I tried product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better; I&#x27;ve had worse.</li>
            <li> It wastes my time, but this was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Liked it at first, but didn&#x27;t like the second step of the mascara, and very difficult to remove..</li>
            <li> If you love the look of false lashes, but don&#x27;t have the time or patience to apply them, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love the false eyelash look</li>
            <li> If I get in a hurry, I can get a little clumping from mascara, but still less than most brands.</li>
            <li> This mascara is also pretty waterproof so even after a dip in the pool it wasn&#x27;t running down my face.</li>
            <li> So if you’re planning on re-curling your eyelashes after applying the mascara, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you wait till your mascara dry</li>
            <li> I opened the packaging and got right down to business!</li>
            <li> FINALLY Covergirl has made it all possible with their new Bombshell.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Covergirls&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara to anybody looking for a new daily mascara - especially for the summer!</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Very Black color to anyone with dark hair and eyes as I think it created a stunning contrast.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes</li>
            <li> Very Black complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have used waterproof mascaras in the past and as long as you use a makeup remover, it was fine.</li>
            <li> since I really didn&#x27;t have a problem with removal the other</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only mascara so far that makes my lashes long and lush.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was worried after seeing other people claim that it made them very clumpy.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if I either can&#x27;t read or if the mascara is actually hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> I also received this mascara for free from Influenster and even though its hard to remove, I like it enough that I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I would love it if they could sort of combine the qualities of both side 1 and 2, just to make it a little less time consuming, but each side works for what it&#x27;s intended to!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that fact though especially because it can last multiple days which means I can go without having to apply new mascara.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to use only side 1 to create a more natural look, but brush 2 definitely gives me a dramatic eye.</li>
            <li> I initially didn&#x27;t expect to like this mascara at all, since my lashes are pretty dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> This mascara has staying power and the second coat definitely adds some WOW to your lashes.</li>
            <li> It definitely adds volume but you have to be careful how much you apply because it can get clumpy.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how sticky it feels when it&#x27;s not completely dry.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look extra thick &amp; it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super into trying different kinds of drugstore mascaras, and this one really fills out my thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read in several of the reviews that the users had major problems removing the mascara.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly more time consuming to go through two rounds of mascara and having to switch sides of wand in between, but I usually put on two coats of other mascara anyway, so it really isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> I will say though, it definitely has some major staying power.</li>
            <li> It is one of the first mascaras that made my eye lashes look a little fuller, but not the bombshell look as promised.</li>
            <li> I am not familiar with mascara, so this was one of the first ones I tried.</li>
            <li> I only wear mascara at work, no other make up.</li>
            <li> When I tried to add more mascara the next  morning, the left overs made it clumpy and weird- huge eyelash mess!</li>
            <li> If you buy a product because you want your lashes to look full, it shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to get off that your lashes fall out.</li>
            <li> First thing first, I have sad Asian girl lashes that are not only short, but stick straight.</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara in Very Black from Influenster, complimentary for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li> It took me multiple tries with eye make-up remover to get it off, so by the time this was all done, I had missing eyelashes, huge red/black rings around my eyes and STILL had eyelashes stuck together.</li>
            <li> This mascara promises curl and intense dark finish all day, and it delivers.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but due to my short and straight lashes, I only really use one side or the other.</li>
            <li> When I applied the second wand and formula, it took it to a whole other level.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clump and made my lashes look natural and long.</li>
            <li> but my lashes look long and lush.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Cover Girl’s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara, but after just a few swipes it may find a permanent place in makeup collection.</li>
            <li> and/or wet for a longer than normal amount of time, but</li>
            <li> The mascara fills them in and makes them look thick and full.</li>
            <li> If you want your eyes to pop and your lashes to be full and thick, this mascara does not do the job.  </li>
            <li> it gives me full eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t look clumply, the only downside is that it takes a little while to dry.</li>
            <li> Most likely not as dramatic difference as side one.</li>
            <li> Adds so much volume and length to my lashes without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes do much longer and fuller than other mascaras I have tried!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of coats where as with other ones I do!</li>
            <li> The only issue is removing it - this product is VERY waterproof and you have to work pretty hard at getting it off!</li>
            <li> No scary black eyes!</li>
            <li> So, save a little extra time, have oil based eye make up remover, and have super long lashes!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about mascaras to begin with because I have super short lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara extends the eyelashes without making the eyelashes super hard.</li>
            <li> I have very straight lashes that rarely There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product at all, I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> other than that - I&#x27;d highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Target, but didn&#x27;t pas as much as this, about 50% less.</li>
            <li> Prevents clumping and isn&#x27;t too heavy on bottom lashes if you only use the first one.</li>
            <li> the very black color really made them pop!</li>
            <li> I have little blonde lashes and after the first step I was amazed at how big my lashes looked ..</li>
            <li> It is a little too large and bulky for me.</li>
            <li> I think the package is a little to large</li>
            <li> You end up getting mascara all over because the wand is not long enough.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like to find a mascara that makes you look just a little more special, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Covergirl Bombshell!</li>
            <li> I did notice some clumping/stickiness when I moved to step 2, but this was resolved by allowing each coat to dry completely before moving on to the next coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that this mascara really made my eyelashes less clumpy, and definitely made them look longer.</li>
            <li> The standard black worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> The second coat really made the black pop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rather large tube of mascara and really one that I could take in a small makeup bag with my other essentials.</li>
            <li> I like that you can build it up as little or much as you want</li>
            <li> is a little too much for me.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s clever having the two sides but pretty unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It makes my short lashes look a little longer and much fuller.  </li>
            <li> I mainly look for volumizing and dark color when I shop for mascara because even though I&#x27;m only 33, both my eye lashes and eye brows are turning white.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it&#x27;s extremely humid where I live</li>
            <li> The two step setup is a little weird since the brushes are on the center piece, but once you get a feel for it works great.</li>
            <li> While the product went on easily and made my eyes look very pretty, my eyes are currently itching like crazy!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot about it (good and bad) and wanted to give it a try for myself.</li>
            <li> This is both a good thing (in that it doesn&#x27;t come off throughout the day) and a bad thing</li>
            <li> That is both a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be a good way to make my lashes look bigger and fuller, and in a way it did but only because it clumps so bad</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the experience of wearing it more than a few days so not sure about the long wear usage.</li>
            <li> I like that both steps create a full thick and long look.</li>
            <li> The only down fall to this , besides apply to much and clumps appearing , would have to be how long it takes to take the product off.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too wet or too dry, it definitely gives you sky high curving eyelashes, and the &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; is just that.  </li>
            <li> The advertising does not lie - my eye lashes definitely looked very curvy, long and black.</li>
            <li> it takes a few tries to get the right amount on.</li>
            <li> but this mascara reminded me of the old maybelline tube I used to get that had one side that was white and the other black, that i used to use in high school</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the wand inside the first few times because of how large it is</li>
            <li> It claims to give extreme volume with an intensifying top coat for big sexy bombshell lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is the extreme volume base coat.</li>
            <li> It makes for very pretty long, thick, luscious lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have that or if it doesn&#x27;t work well on your skin, other good options include Vaseline/Aquaphor and Ponds Cold Cream</li>
            <li> I find the straight brushes always inevitably cause me to clump my mascara because I miss the small short lashes.  </li>
            <li> I had to completely scrub my face and start again which was extremely aggravating.  </li>
            <li> First off, the wands are way too short which makes it hard to get to the corner lashes.</li>
            <li> I love the way I can know have long eyelashes without having to wear fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> But after I applied the first step I already knew this mascara wasn&#x27;t going to be thick enough to truly make my eyes shine.</li>
            <li> After the first step, I thought for sure I was going to hate it.  </li>
            <li> Use the the other side for more dramatic color.  </li>
            <li> Okay so this mascara is DRAMATIC!</li>
            <li> I like that it is smudge-proof, but it is pretty hard to get off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It can be a pain at first and is hard to get off if you make a mistake.</li>
            <li> The first brush is hard-</li>
            <li> It comes off the wand too thick and dries very quickly, not giving you enough time to wipe off of skin easily.</li>
            <li> I have very thin long eyelashes, I am also allergic to most make up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes in big ugly clumps,which I&#x27;m glad!</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t have much luck with others.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes so this wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me until i used it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In fact, I have been using the same brand mascara for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> it did last long and helped my lashes look voluminous</li>
            <li> do a second coat BUT don&#x27;t forget to wiggle the brush and to not wait too long in between coats.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and makes my lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it did not leave any clumps and left my eyelashes long and separated.</li>
            <li> but it also didn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> but just didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I like to wear this on a bare face with minimal make up, because it makes your eyes</li>
            <li> I like that it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> it made most of my eyelashes fallout it&#x27;s really irritating waste of money for such a s***y product</li>
            <li> I actually had someone ask me if I was wearing false eyelashes because this mascara made my lashes look THAT LONG and FULL.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned at first about how thick the tube is-</li>
            <li> The formula is overall nice, and i like the dark and dramatic shade of black.  </li>
            <li> it is the only one I have used that actually makes my lashes look like they are fake lashes makes them look big and full.</li>
            <li> The wands are really short so that it&#x27;s very hard to get to the right angle</li>
            <li> My short, stubby lashes look long and curvy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, I let my lashes dry for like several seconds</li>
            <li> Another downside would be that the formula is difficult to remove, but I use a cleansing oil and that takes it off easily-</li>
            <li> It separated my lashes well if I allowed one coat to dry before moving on to the next coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to let my mascara dry and do a second layer, but I don&#x27;t have to anymore!</li>
            <li> (hey, free mascara), but unfortunately pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to take a lot off with a piece of toilet paper before putting it on.  </li>
            <li> This clearly isn&#x27;t from what I looked like after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> Alas, I didn&#x27;t make it more than a few hours before I busted out the hand mirror to give my lashes a lift.</li>
            <li> As a woman who wears false lashes often this came really close to re-creating that look with my natural lashes.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes because mine look so full and long when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I generally use other drugstore brand mascaras, but I had never tried one with 2 separate coats to apply.</li>
            <li> The 2-step mascara application is new to me since I&#x27;ve only used the usual mascaras.</li>
            <li> The wand is also really large and hard to handle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it made my lashes look super dark and thick.</li>
            <li> personally think its worth the extra work with the eye make up remover, as the reviewers are correct, this is extremely difficult to remove with regular face soap -</li>
            <li> however as some other reviewers have mentioned it is possible to experience some lash clumping during the 2nd step.</li>
            <li> The other thing I personally didn&#x27;t like was that the actual tube with the mascara is about the size of my thumb.</li>
            <li> Second, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the appearance of my lashes comparing this to any other Covergirl mascara I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> IT GIVES YOU THAT NATURAL EYELASH LOOK WITH A LITTLE VOLUME.</li>
            <li> and I thought maybe I&#x27;m just using too much coat or combing my lashes out too hard</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to take off even with really oily make-up remover.  </li>
            <li> The formula was very clumpy and hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof so it definitely stays put, but this means that it&#x27;s pretty tough to get off.</li>
            <li> The only drawback was when doing my left eye, because the wand felt a little short</li>
            <li> The brush wands were not long enough and I would get black spots on my nose from where the wand would hit my face.  </li>
            <li> The container is a much larger diameter than the normal mascara, and I found that it was hard to put on because of the size of the handle.</li>
            <li> I got this in a promo from Influenster and although the double step is a little tedious and it&#x27;s not completely waterproof (more water resistant)</li>
            <li> The overall size of the tube is too wide and I found it hard to really get in close to my lashes to apply.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the way my lashes looked, but the feeling was too uncomfortable to tolerate.</li>
            <li> Both the mascara formula and the applicators do not allow for a lot clumps, it evenly coats and separates each lash creating a bold but NOT overly dramatic look.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes long and fuller.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;d look long and curly</li>
            <li> Long or you can choose the curvy side.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t clumpy and it makes your lashes look long and defined.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t mind removing it with makeup remover you will like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> And amazingly long lashes.</li>
            <li> You need a make up remover to get it off, but it isn&#x27;t something I mind at all considering how long it stays on.</li>
            <li> I have an oil based makeup remover and still have trouble getting it completely off.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look fuller and longer, and I already have long lashes.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that this stuff stays on for a long time</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look extremely long.</li>
            <li> The product stays on for a long time</li>
            <li> The first wand makes your lashes thin and long and the second wand plumps up your lashes.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my eyelashes look long and full, when they&#x27;re normally pretty boring.</li>
            <li> and it made them aweseomely long</li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> but it took a long time for it to come</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY EYELASHES LONG</li>
            <li> My eyelashes do not stay curled for a long time and this mascara did not help with that at all.</li>
            <li> I have really long lashes</li>
            <li> It stays with you for long wear too.</li>
            <li> This lasted me all day long and into the night and did not budge.</li>
            <li> I have wide eyes, so the wand is too short!</li>
            <li> It stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives you amazingly long lashes.</li>
            <li> The two formulas work really well together, and my lashes have never looked so thick and long.</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s long lasting qualities, it&#x27;s harder to remove.</li>
            <li> Not a huge WOW factor going on with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a good working mascara, though the need to use an oil based makeup remover is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> This definitely beats a lot of high end mascaras that I have tried in the past!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes clumped very easily, and it was impossible to fix after that.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a mascara that will give my lashes volume and hold my curl at the same time and this mascara did both, it is definitely my new fav</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product above other mascaras in the drugstore!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this product in the future and I will start looking at other Covergirl products that I can buy as well!</li>
            <li> Typically, I buy make-up counter mascara, because I like the higher quality I usually get.  </li>
            <li> As stated in previous reviews, my only dislike about this product is the actual removal.</li>
            <li> I mean really something that I can not throw in my purse or make-up bag.  </li>
            <li> only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have is that because it goes on pretty thick, it is a little harder to scrub off, but for me thats not a big issue.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the wand is a little too short.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long they might just blow you away!</li>
            <li> My lashed definitely look longer when I used it compared to my other mascara.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes long, and it doesn&#x27;t clump at all!</li>
            <li> The other upside is that this mascara is only $10 tops.</li>
            <li> The two wands were a bit tricky since I am used to only one wand but other than that</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that  it takes a little extra effort to get it off.</li>
            <li> I personally only use one end or the other.</li>
            <li> I might give the other option a try in the future.</li>
            <li> It makes it a little more difficult getting on without messing up.</li>
            <li> My lashed are already long, but with this mascara, my lashes are fuller and even longer!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it takes forever to actually get it off even using makeup remover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of wearing this product, it didn&#x27;t flake off at all during the day once, which is definitely an improvement from other mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> I didnt mind that there was two steps, as long as I get the desired effect, and I did!</li>
            <li> However, this just may be due to my straight/thick lashes and could possibly work well for others.</li>
            <li> I must say it does give long thicker lashes!</li>
            <li> The mascara was a little more difficult to remove and required an oil-based product.</li>
            <li> I agree it is a little messy to put on, and the mascara is intense</li>
            <li> btw... lasts ALL day long!</li>
            <li> It seems like any other regular mascara that you can buy form anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of cover girl and have several of there other mascaras.</li>
            <li> But I took some time the other day to actually put this mascara on</li>
            <li> Overall it looks nice on my lashes but is very difficult to remove and a few of my lashes fell out with removal.</li>
            <li> My lashes may not be as thick and full as I would like for them to be, but at least now I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed by them when I got out in public.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a very long time</li>
            <li> right or wrong - it works for me), and with how bulky-wide  and long the wand is it&#x27;s not possible.  </li>
            <li> I apply #1 then #2, without letting the mascara dry in between coats.</li>
            <li> : The formulation of this mascara seemed rather dry to me.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit to dry, but if you&#x27;ve ever worn mascara before, you know that&#x27;s just how it is.</li>
            <li> (feels durable when I felt them dry on my lashes).</li>
            <li> It also takes forever to dry and flakes.  </li>
            <li> middle portion of the container is the one holding the wands, which was a bit uncomfortable because you need to hold this huge container and it makes it a bit less manageable.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a two step process (and the product takes a while to dry), this one requires some patience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just dark enough and keeps my lashes looking long all day.</li>
            <li> Once it dried, my eyes became red and itchy, obviously its not hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> so slow and steady is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> but kind of annoying for daily</li>
            <li> Like borderline tough to get off, which is exactly what I wanted bc my eyes get watery</li>
            <li> Finally, what troubled me most was that my lashes felt very stiff.</li>
            <li> I wish the effect on my lashes was a little more dramatic, but who wants lashes that look dramatic if they&#x27;re clumpy and smudged?</li>
            <li> only issue with the mascara is that because of the tube style (being a double-barreled tube), the wands were shorter so there was less clearance between the top of the tube and the mascara brush so it would bump into my nose and side of face often during application - just a little uncomfortable but NOT a deal breaker for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little more difficult to apply then expected.</li>
            <li> This mascara was also easy on my eyes ( I wear contacts and have had issues in the past with mascara flaking &amp; irritating my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical at first since I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s so hard to get off, but I used an oil based eye makeup remover and had no problems.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews</li>
            <li> I do not really wear any other makeup regularly.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s not worth the buy, just get the Maybelline falsies--</li>
            <li> I like how you can use Side 1 if you just want a simple everyday look without making your lashes look too crazy or you can use side 2 to give you more volume.  </li>
            <li> This mascara had me slightly confused at first as I almost coated my hand when taking out one of the wands.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed that this mascara wasn&#x27;t in my VoxBox, so I purchased my own.</li>
            <li> It leaves eyelashes full, and you don&#x27;t have to wear any fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I do not like is that the wand lengths are not very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The only down side I found was that it&#x27;s not water proof.</li>
            <li> The wand is actually a little weird since the tube is pretty thick and the wand is short, but not tedious.</li>
            <li> and you have long lasting mascara that won&#x27;t run down your face at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> when it did dry, it didn&#x27;t move!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit trickier than most mascaras I use when trying to remove it as well but nothing impossible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my lashes clumping into a big blob of black.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s waterproof, but a couple hours later the bottom of my eyes have black smudges.</li>
            <li> I also had no problem with it sticking to my upper eye lid and tinting it black.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that side 2 isn&#x27;t small enough for my bottom lashes</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this when I can just get the Elf makeup for the same price.</li>
            <li> But the next day, when trying to reapply, it was clumpy - not all of the previous days</li>
            <li> Not only does it make your lashes look extra curly and luscious, but I&#x27;m too lazy at night to always take my makeup off</li>
            <li> I accidentally blinked and had to wash my entire face to get a black dot of it off below my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look bigger than my previous mascara, with just one swipe.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to remove like a waterproof mascara, and didn&#x27;t look better than my usual mascara that washes away with soap n water.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t black enough for me.  </li>
            <li> and I will admit that I was super skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little annoyed with the short wands, but after repeated uses I have gotten used to them</li>
            <li> And let one coat dry a little before adding a second.  </li>
            <li> I always mess up the standard mascaras &amp; can never achieve &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; eyelashes so to speak.</li>
            <li> My lashes are twice as long than with any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried from the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> It is also very long lasting and does not seem to smudge once it has dried.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction was that the wand was awkward, but I quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li> they feel way too short and are a little of a challenge to use because of it...</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the wand was a little bulky to use, but it is not that big of a deal.  </li>
            <li> only problem is that it&#x27;s a little sticky on the lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are short and clumpy, so to add a little dimension with a lot of definition and separation, I will take that in a mascara.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little too short for me</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to try it because I only use almay</li>
            <li> but it made them a little blacker and bigger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than what I&#x27;m used to, and the wands are a bit short (since there are two of them), but once I figured that out</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get little spots off my skin where my lashes hit above my eye with just water</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I wish the color pay off was a little stronger.  </li>
            <li> I had little to now clumping and my lashes instantly looked fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> A little more awkward.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that is is EXTREMELY hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that the wands are very short, which makes it hard to apply without smudging and needing to touch-up.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that because of the design the wands are short and I find it hard to apply on some areas and have to keep readjusting my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, but I did  have very high expectations for it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this mascara when my other runs out!!</li>
            <li> While this mascara isn&#x27;t the worst one I&#x27;ve tried, it wasn&#x27;t particularly great either.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it isn&#x27;t entirely waterproof.</li>
            <li> My only complaint and reason for 4 stars is that the wands need to be longer, applying to my left eye (over my nose)</li>
            <li> It also has a really dark, pigmented color that makes eyelashes super dark and dramatic.</li>
            <li> You will also need to visit the cleaning aisle for Simple Green and a package of scouring pads for removal.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> So that was expected.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea behind this mascara.</li>
            <li> So just be careful when removing it.</li>
            <li> It seems to take about three tries to remove it all.</li>
            <li> these are very greasy leaving behind a film around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The packaging is chunky and therefore not very travel-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost harder than waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about this mascara was that it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is fine-my problem is with the wide barrel that you hold in between the two brushes when you apply.  </li>
            <li> I like not having to reapply my mascara after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> [OMG - no thanks]</li>
            <li> Apply carefully and check your look between layers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person</li>
            <li> but then when I put on the second one it was sticky, clumpy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product, but be careful.  </li>
            <li> Although be careful if you get it too close to your eye lid</li>
            <li> but it was not really.</li>
            <li> I had fuller, thicker lashes in only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have false lashes on, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> While the deep black color and staying power are positives, it is just too clunky to use!</li>
            <li> The reasons I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars are: the wand is quite big, and it takes a little longer to apply than some other mascaras.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it is a little tougher to get off than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though, so I only use a little bit each day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep playing with it in hopes that maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong and it&#x27;ll end up working right one day.</li>
            <li> I usually like a little more volume to my mascara, but am definitely keeping this in my arsenal because of the crazy definition it gives my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few other brands/types of mascara but out of the ones I&#x27;ve used this one doesn&#x27;t stand out.</li>
            <li> But it does make my lashes long and not super clumpy.</li>
            <li> It is not quick to smear, although it will by the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> You will need eye makeup remover to get it off, but that&#x27;s typical for any long wear makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, too, like I can actually feel the weight on my eyelashes, unlike other mascaras.</li>
            <li> The first wand was no problem, but the second one seemed to make it a little difficult.</li>
            <li> There are a few downfalls however: it&#x27;s really difficult to get off, I often smudge my mascara after putting it on and I just use a q-tip to clean things up</li>
            <li> I personally think that this mascara might work for people who already have really long and pretty eyelashes which (very sadly) isn’t me.</li>
            <li> Usually I would find it uncomfortable to put on &amp; wear mascara, but this one was quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> Beware the 2nd step is a bit messy and takes a few minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> This mascara not only creates long and thick lashes, but you can guarantee it to stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I have thin eye lashes and was worried this mascara would leave them looking clumpy but instead it makes them look thick, full, and making the lower lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> Gives my lashes a little va va voom Ive been wishing for for a long time.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other options.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clumpy like other mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have always been used to my other mascara</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, at first, about this mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara, unlike other mascaras that I like, is not waterproof.  </li>
            <li> how one wand curls and the other one thickens.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look fuller, thicker, and longer while also keeping them from sticking together like other mascara brands.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I have a mascara that I like</li>
            <li> It did smudge a bit towards the end of the day but nothing other than Lancôme waterproof smudges on me.</li>
            <li> I guess some of the other reviewers noted this as well.  </li>
            <li> It was given to me to try and out and review, and I was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> Usually when there is a 2 step mascara you end up with clumpy results after the second step.  </li>
            <li> I had to make due with the makeup remover that I had and it took a while to get this off.</li>
            <li> do agree with other reviewers that the wands could be longer, but, I will adjust.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> On the other hand, while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and Covergirl.</li>
            <li> Just received this product  yesterday and tried it out and kinda satisfied &amp; kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave it 3 stars and not more is because of the width of the tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long-lasting and doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have to buy a lot of mascara, but this would be one I would consider buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have small eyes and short eyelashes  </li>
            <li> I usually tend to just grab the cheapest mascara possible</li>
            <li> They make my short lashes look longer and slightly curled (without the hassle of an eyelash curler) and the color is very much BLACK to make my lashes stand out and make my eyes (hazel) pop!</li>
            <li> The other problem that I had was my lash tips would brush together and snag every so often.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no clumps!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever use any other brand.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical at first because I always believed theyre no mascaras out there</li>
            <li> They usually get clumped up, run off later throughout the day, or don&#x27;t make my eyes look fuller.</li>
            <li> One side is meant to give you volume while the other is to intensify.</li>
            <li> Yes, it wasn&#x27;t the easiest to remove, compared to other waterproof, including any of Covergirl&#x27;s other lines.</li>
            <li> is doesn&#x27;t make my lashes clumpy however if you are looking for extreme volume</li>
            <li> but I find it pretty difficult to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> And even when I opened it and noticed there was a want at each end, one for lengthening and the other for thickening.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty dang skeptical.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the Bombshell Curvaceous is going on my shopping list, and probably some make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually just stick with only step one and run out the door.</li>
            <li> You can lengthen your lashes with one end and thicken them with the other, leaving you with lashes that stand out.</li>
            <li> I did find this mascara to be &amp;#34;stickier&amp;#34; than other mascaras I have used.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a problem for anyone else, personally it didn&#x27;t affect my opinion or its effects.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s family thought it was a tampon I was leaving around with my other make-up.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does its job .</li>
            <li> I like how there are two sides, so you could choose one or the other functions depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> I admit my eyes water a lot, but the other covergirl waterproof mascara works.</li>
            <li> Once I was finally satisfied with my application, which took 4 times longer than usual because it was so difficult to apply and unclump, my eyes felt very heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Since that is my main goal, I would say the mascara is average but not great.</li>
            <li> It applied well to the upper lashes, but got a little messy on the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> It is a very wet formula,</li>
            <li> It did however make my eyelashes very dark and very long.  </li>
            <li> mascara had come off when washing my face and adding the new layer made it even worse.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are: 1) the tube is fat and the wands are stumpy so it can be awkward to hold and get to the lashes in the corners of your eyes; and 2) it leaves smudges if you don&#x27;t let your lashes thoroughly dry before doing a lot of blinking, which was also kind of awkward.</li>
            <li> I simply started by adding a few coats with side 1 and then moved onto side 2, adding a few coats as well.  </li>
            <li> It gives me full dark lashes with crazy volume and length.</li>
            <li> I look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out of my current one.</li>
            <li> I truly gave it a fair trial, I used it a few times and each time I hated it even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it takes quite a while to dry, and the brush/applicator makes for a little clumsy application if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> I have suffered with thyroid disease for almost ten years now, and unfortunately one of the symptoms of this disease is thinning eyebrows and eyelashes, so I have used numerous mascara brands over the years to try and pump up what little lashes I have left.</li>
            <li> The mascara tube is big and hard to put it on compare to their other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that it can be quite sticky/messy until it dries completely,just have to be very careful to not get it on your face because once it&#x27;s there the color is quite hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The wand applicator is weird and one of the sides should have a primer that is white or clear instead of two black liquids.</li>
            <li> but still that was NOT right.</li>
            <li> But because this mascara is supposed to last all day long it almost acts like a waterproof mascara, it&#x27;s very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> (it is waterproof so it has staying power, it is just a little rough to come off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually had a hard time getting the mascara off my lashes with my makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is how hard it is to get off.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is it is REALLY hard to remove</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes longer and thicker, but the only thing I dislike is how hard it is to remove.</li>
            <li> That being said, I would definitely wear this to the beach or pool, but probably not every day since it is hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only problem I have with this product is that it is hard to take off.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to find for me, as I have tried multiple mascaras and I feel like I have nothing on after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get off as if there is some different type of wax in it to try to hold the separated lashes.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the second side, it went on clumpy and was hard to get off because it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard for me to find mascara that actually adds volume to my eyelashes the way it should and this item did just that!</li>
            <li> , however it is really hard to get off, even with the proper eye makeup remover it doesn&#x27;t want to budge.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to pull back with out pulling an eyelash with them.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the wand is a bit short making it hard to get into the outer edges of you</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first with the two sided wands</li>
            <li> I like how it works, but the wand is SO big that it&#x27;s hard to apply without feeling awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only flaw is that it was a bit hard to get off, but other than that, I like it!</li>
            <li> but as a person who has to wear glasses its not fun.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this doesn’t do much to curl my lashes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is sticky.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is water proof so it has to be taken off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The only negative to me is the smell of the mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara adds length, which makes my lashes look really spidery and weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative thing I could say is because of a design flaw.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it is very difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> They only complaint that I have about this mascara is that it is oil based.</li>
            <li> The second coat goes on thick and seals in the color for all day wear.</li>
            <li> I love and hate this mascara.</li>
            <li> So when I use it I look like I have fake eyelashes on because how thick and full the mascara makes them look.</li>
            <li> This mascara completely annihilated my poor eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and they do last all day curly and thick.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the mascara gets a bit clumpy, so be careful of that by checking the wand and removing any clumps before applying.  </li>
            <li> The thick tube and short wands made application tricky.</li>
            <li> I was expecting big, luscious, thick eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I took a shower to test out its &amp;#34;waterproofness&amp;#34; and although there was a little black color running I would say its extremely minimal.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a whole five stars is because it is almost impossible to remove from my lashes when I wash my makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It never ran down my face or smudged.</li>
            <li> This is now my go to mascara hands down.</li>
            <li> I was a bit let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hardcore CoverGirl Lashblast fan, so I&#x27;m always a little intrigued by other CoverGirl mascaras.</li>
            <li> Other than that....loved it!</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about what mascara I use, and this passed all my test!</li>
            <li> I was not interested in trying this mascara at all after reading reviews, but after trying it I&#x27;m now a fan and would recommend this mascara to any make up junkie!</li>
            <li> My problem with this mascara is that its extremely sticky!</li>
            <li> , I tried some on my daughter who has black hair and dark brown eyes.</li>
            <li> So I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about this mascara at first, but the other day I gave it another try.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is a little hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The wands were a little hard to use because they are so big.</li>
            <li> I was reading a few of the other reviews, and I agreed and disagreed with a lot that was said.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s jet black</li>
            <li> For a girl seriously loves makeup, I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I personally do not care for it, they are too short and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I typically use an oil based remover, so I have had no problems removing this product.</li>
            <li> and I do have some lash-blast mascara Black .  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even slightly look like what they advertise it will.</li>
            <li> It gets all of my lashes unlike previous mascaras that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically wear eye makeup</li>
            <li> This mascara has a slight odor</li>
            <li> Everything else I have found either doesn&#x27;t deliver, or does... but leaves me with black mascara chunks under my eyes by mid-day.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this over my LoreaL Voluminous Carbon black.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the wands are really short, and it is difficult to remove if you don&#x27;t have an oil based makeup remover with you.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup, I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a mascara that gives me those giant, thick lashes that I want.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use mascara.</li>
            <li> It is the blackest black.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a little hard for me to get used to is that the handle is a little bit shorter to grasp than what I am used to.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell since my eyelashes are fairly long already, but they were slightly longer after using this product.</li>
            <li> Initial thoughts are that the mascara tube is a bit heavy since there are two ends and the curling wand is a little hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is VERY hard to remove, so probably something for occasional use when I know I will be at the pool.</li>
            <li> I also find applying the mascara to be a bit awkward due to the large size if the tube and the shortness of the wands.  </li>
            <li> Stayed on for a long time and wasn&#x27;t too hard to get off with an oil based makeup cleaner.</li>
            <li> It definitely adds length and volume to my lashes (which are naturally blonde and very thin).</li>
            <li> I work 12 hour shifts and have so much trouble with mascara leaving dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use mascara because I feel that it pulls my lashes &amp; makes them feel weird -</li>
            <li> My lashes are long, thick, curvy, and well-defined.</li>
            <li> I have long thick lashes as it is.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes look long &amp; thick</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look long, thick, and curvy.</li>
            <li> Every time I blinked I ended up with little bits of black on my face.</li>
            <li> The # 1 side brush is a little weird and adds a lot of mascara way too much for my short thin lashes.  </li>
            <li> I hardly see a difference from any other mascara that I use, other than it stays.</li>
            <li> My only small issue is that it seems really hard to get off before bed.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes thick and long !  </li>
            <li> and I must admit it really does give a very dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> so it is very difficult to remove if you don&#x27;t have the right stuff to do so.  </li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t care for 2 step mascaras because they tend to be clumpy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times since then and it is slightly growing on me.</li>
            <li> I do wish the wands were a little longer because it is a little tricky to get in tight spots around the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Some people are having difficulty removing this, however I massage in a little coconut oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too short and the handle is too wide, making it very difficult to get to the inner lashes.</li>
            <li> I did try it and wore the mascara for a little while.</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptical about it</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the packaging is a bit bulky!</li>
            <li> I dont care for the fact that it takes an oil based makeup remover to remove and the tube is a little bulky for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I was a little on the scared side to try this from all the eyelash losing horror stories I have read about this product.  </li>
            <li> I tried eye makeup remover, face wash, taking a shower, eye makeup remover again, and I could still feel little clumps on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> However, it does clump a little.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit of a struggle to keep it clump-free when applying and my lashes wanted to stick together.</li>
            <li> I received this little beauty and a voxbox and it has worked wonders</li>
            <li> A little tricky to get used too</li>
            <li> after application dries a little use</li>
            <li> However it does tend to clump a little and the wand itself, being so fat, is a little bulky.</li>
            <li> While it does add a curl and a little bit of length to my lashes, it doesn’t add any noticeable volume.</li>
            <li> it was a little work.</li>
            <li> was a little tricky as was getting to the corner of each lash.</li>
            <li> It does require a little elbow grease to remove.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with the thickening and clumps with other mascaras</li>
            <li> takes a little effort to take it off at night.</li>
            <li> I dont typically use waterproof mascaras for the exact reason that its very difficult to remove as this one was.</li>
            <li> be a far less expensive alternative to my Lancome mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Second it&#x27;s very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I felt a heavy residue on the lashes still, and my eyelashes are way less full than they used to be because the removal process made lots of them fall out :(</li>
            <li> I tend to give up easily (due to my previous experiences) but not with this mascara!!</li>
            <li> It is a little trickier to remove, but my Neutrogena Oil-Free makeup remover handles the job, you just have to hold the remover soaked cotton ball on your eye for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how hard it made my lashes (it actually made them rock hard</li>
            <li> It DID make my lashes look full-ish and very dark</li>
            <li> I am pretty particular with my mascaras as I have the worst trouble with racoon eyes after an hour.  </li>
            <li> Really hard to use the applicator because the part you hold is SO WIDE.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, since it&#x27;s waterproof, but it really wasn&#x27;t hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the price and it was a bit hard to get off.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes of googling the facts, it turns out you just have to be really careful taking it off like using oil to take it off and don&#x27;t rub too hard.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the tube is so thick that it makes it hard to hold when applying.</li>
            <li> I got mine complimentary from influenster for testing purposes, I think the retail price isn&#x27;t bad though.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it has a really bad chemical smell, which makes me nervous putting this near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> You have to lose a few eyelashes trying to get it off.</li>
            <li> it was the tacky, heavy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy mascara and was hesitant to try this two step process.</li>
            <li> I also do not necessarily enjoy the two sided mascara.</li>
            <li> I have thin, short lashes, so I found a pronounced difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this being a difficult makeup to take off, but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay mascara for a few years now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time anymore with anything else</li>
            <li> my lashes too a toll because of the harsh removal method needed.</li>
            <li> I have given up on mascara just because I never see any difference and after a few hours it would smudge</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy either.</li>
            <li> If I need an everyday look</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the wands are on the smaller size which can make application slightly difficult.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my eyes are naturally sensitive as well so this product irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> and i got quite a few compliments on my lashes cos Boy</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how heavy it is</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have been very pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> I dont have to worry about it getting messy.</li>
            <li> Will definitely keep using this and recommend to anyone with thin lashes.</li>
            <li> so I have trouble finding one I can use</li>
            <li> Step 2 just seems to be too heavy for my lashes to hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to women whom may have short, thin lashes and want to give them some volume.</li>
            <li> Not happy with overall performance of this product!</li>
            <li> I often have trouble with my eyelashes sticking together, but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this product.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing it for an everyday look</li>
            <li> Also, I have trouble taking the mascara</li>
            <li> TOTAL GAME CHANGER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the packaging however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the 1st step brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge mascara wearing, when I do wear it</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge makeup fan, but this did the trick for a wedding</li>
            <li> I am all about trying new products, especially for my eyelashes, but I was disappointed by the results.</li>
            <li> i usually don&#x27;t put any mascara on my bottom lashes but after applying to my corner lashes after a few blinks there was black on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I did end up reusing the mascara because it is durable and does make my lashes slightly longer, I usually skip curling my lashes when using this mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i tried it feels really stiff on my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I have fuller lashes, but it makes my lashes terribly stiff.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> This is a very very black mascara, to which it lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> The color I received is Very Black.</li>
            <li> The color I got was very black.</li>
            <li> I received the color very black.</li>
            <li> warned that this acts as a waterproof mascara and does not easily come off with just soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Its not easy</li>
            <li> I hate trying to clean up smudges, and I don&#x27;t like looking clumpy.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer mentioned, it can be a little awkward to hold-you have to unscrew #1, use it, screw it back on, unscrew #2, use it, and screw back on before repeating the process (if you do each eye separately like I do, at least).</li>
            <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t clump and I felt my lashes were a little longer than usual.</li>
            <li> It will smear a little and is a little hard to take off.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very small and not very noticeable, this mascara makes my eyes POP!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that having two things to use would make any difference, but I could actually tell that it added a lot of volume!</li>
            <li> only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I encountered with this mascara was that it was still a little difficult to remove, even with makeup remover, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how hard it is to remove, though an oil-based remover does work; its just less convenient removal than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Its not easy to stow in a small purse.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product if you use fake lashes would provide a nice base for application.&lt;br /&gt;another</li>
            <li> the only downfall I see is that it is very hard to get off!</li>
            <li> I mean it didn&#x27;t look horrible, it just wasn&#x27;t amazing</li>
            <li> If I had to list any cons it&#x27;d be that it is a little hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d a little hard to take off though</li>
            <li> After trying to get my rogue clump, the pain from pulling out eyelashes made me blink a little too hard, then I had the lash imprint all under both eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d a little hard to take off though</li>
            <li> The short, fat wands are a little awkward to use, and it takes a little effort to remove.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this mascara is that it can be a challenge to use because you get very little space and control over the brush because it&#x27;s so close to the part you hold.  </li>
            <li> I also apply this non-waterproof mascara to my bottom lashes and very little smudging occurred after 12 hours of wear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i decided to give it a try, its a little on the thick side</li>
            <li> , it separates your eyelashes with very little clumping, and even with watery eyes like mine</li>
            <li> Fully coated my lashes and gave them the curve I was going for with very little clumping.</li>
            <li> The other reason it does not get 5 starts is how hard it is to get off!</li>
            <li> It makes them thick without being messy.</li>
            <li> My only compain is it is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would buy this product myself.</li>
            <li> I have to say the second step mascara smells pretty awful</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I received a waterproof version (not sure if they come in non-waterproof) and it was an asset to my makeup bag when I went on a beach vacation.</li>
            <li> It left my lashes clumpy and sticky and it was extremely difficult to remove even with the recommended oil-based make up remover.  </li>
            <li> I usually do a 2 step process, so this makes it easier.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t like drug store mascara</li>
            <li> Usually I go for a black-brown shade.</li>
            <li> I buy, but this one is not fitting what I thought.</li>
            <li> I dont usually buy waterproof</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to put on my falsies I usually wear.</li>
            <li> and I usually have a stinging sensation in my eyes for a while.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s usually water deters me from using it.</li>
            <li> I usually don’t wear mascaras</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble lately with clumpy mascara</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy it, received as a promotion from # influenster</li>
            <li> and I will probably stick to my usual mascara.</li>
            <li> The fat tube and the small area to hold it by arent as idea.</li>
            <li> When you wash it off make sure you have an oil base eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> and this was sticky, clumpy and just not cute at all.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of waterproof because its so difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I have tried different mascaras and was skeptical about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually when I put on waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would give up my Make Up Forever</li>
            <li> The dual brushes are way too short, making the mascara difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I usually buy what ever catches my eye in the store.  </li>
            <li> it worked wonders for my small lashes</li>
            <li> Usually towards the end of the day, I rub my eyes a lot</li>
            <li> The wand is a bit small for my liking, but I think it will grow on me.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I have not been a fan of Covergirl mascara ever in the past</li>
            <li> It is weird to use such a small wand.</li>
            <li> but it is very heavy and clumpy.</li>
            <li> It does not clump for me and works well with my very thin and short lashes!</li>
            <li> I have very thin and short lashes and  COVERGIRL</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I found was it is a bit difficult to remove</li>
            <li> Turning the wand toward the eye to get to the inner lashes is awkward and somewhat messy.</li>
            <li> I think it is maybe too thick and heavy for my delicate lashes.</li>
            <li> I had read some negative reviews of this product prior to trying it myself, but I think those people must have been doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> there was not very good separation with the brush</li>
            <li> I will likely still use lashes from dramatic night time uses but will be using this product alone during the day and under my falsies at night!</li>
            <li> The color is &#x27;very black&#x27; and they aren&#x27;t lying!</li>
            <li> This is not easy to get off of your lashes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will be that bad, since it&#x27;s not a thick mascara.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this, but I was totally disappointed.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I hate waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> : the mascara is a little tough to wash off</li>
            <li> The way the applicator is set up, it if hard to get the brush to my outer lashes.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit hard to get off</li>
            <li> But even with an oil-based remover, it&#x27;s really hard to remove.</li>
            <li> it is extremely hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> But it is so hard to get off</li>
            <li> The reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 is because of how hard it is to take off.</li>
            <li> It is also really hard to get off -- even when using eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I will agree, it is hard to remove UNLESS you use makeup remover.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers were saying it was too hard to get off?</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It can hold a curl, it was hard to blend</li>
            <li> I did find that it was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The brush is hard and spiny.</li>
            <li> I used eye makeup remover but still had a hard time.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it 3 stars aside from the already mentioned is that its so darn hard to take off</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to get off</li>
            <li> even then, it is hard to get it out.</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time taking it off.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is HARD to remove - even with oil.</li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s REALLY hard to come off</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really hard to take off just used makeup wipes and it came off.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get off the skin, doesn&#x27;t want to wipe off.</li>
            <li> I sneezed really hard and mashed them all up.</li>
            <li> lot of people have said that it is hard to get off, but I used oil-based remover that I use for my waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> The mascara is hard to take off too.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time applying it without clumping.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to apply, and it clumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little confused about step</li>
            <li> Also, the wand can be a little difficult to get really close to the base of your lashes since it&#x27;s a little bulky.  </li>
            <li> As I was pulling my eyelashes off, I pulled out at least four of my eyelashes out</li>
            <li> The tube is enormous and awkward.</li>
            <li> This mascara works well, but my biggest complaint was the chunky packaging.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m running late to work I</li>
            <li> I will use it again for a crazy night out but not for my daily use.</li>
            <li> I twisted the #1 tube and the brush was broken off in the container, tried the #2 tube, same thing!</li>
            <li> I see a lot of negative reviews, and I do agree with the issues.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look curlier, longer, and darker, but they still look pretty thin, :-(.</li>
            <li> I slowly had to pull my eyelashes from the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flakes&lt;br /&gt;Dries slowly (i find it is under my eyes for awhile after applying so</li>
            <li> I just bought Maybelline false eyelash mascara a few months ago.</li>
            <li> it made them look thick and fuller.</li>
            <li> Curly and thick.</li>
            <li> Not as thick looking as I wanted but</li>
            <li> It caused my eyelashes to clump together and felt thick.</li>
            <li> Also, post shower my lashes were still thickly coated fully with the mascara</li>
            <li> I think that they need to reevaluate the product to not be so sticky and thick.</li>
            <li> Second I applied Step 1: the extreme volume base coat.  </li>
            <li> this mascara is heavy duty and seriously needs to be taken off before bed!</li>
            <li> It gives my eyelashes extra curve and volume without making them look fake!</li>
            <li> I mean, this mascara works</li>
            <li> the only thing i dislike about the product is that it is extremely difficult to remove!</li>
            <li> When they say waterproof, they mean it</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is that it&#x27;s really difficult to remove!  </li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> Only negative it is very difficult to remove, even with baby oil or eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it very difficult to apply this mascara simply because the packaging is so bulky.</li>
            <li> I have very small lashes and have been looking for a mascara that makes them stand out.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I hated it and it would have earned 1 star because of it.</li>
            <li> I usually use M.A.C. mascara but haven&#x27;t found a way to go without false lashes as well as product.</li>
            <li> It also made my eyelashes feel very heavy which I&#x27;d never experienced before with mascara.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Trying to separate clumped lashed was next to impossible, even with a toothpick.</li>
            <li> I like that the primer is black, so applying step two is not as difficult.</li>
            <li> They seriously look like I had lash implants.</li>
            <li> But I will say, if you can avoid or comb through the clumpiness, this stuff seriously lasts.</li>
            <li> So it has some serious staying power.</li>
            <li> It has some serious staying power.</li>
            <li> I kept smudging mascara on my lids, and it was next to impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to remove with makeup remover, and it didn&#x27;t come off so my eye swelled up the next day.</li>
            <li> (seriously, you&#x27;ll need to use makeup remover or your lashes</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> If you want a subtle touch of mascara, neat and no clumping this is for you.</li>
            <li> but it was still a little difficult to remove</li>
            <li> , it is a little bit difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> The first thing is that this mascara is so awkward to hold!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little difficult to remove, but using oil based removers or coconut oil, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> That is hard to do because I have thin lashes.</li>
            <li> and sorry I wasted $9 on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not good.</li>
            <li> The very worst thing about this mascara is the size and shape of the two brushes is awkward and really hard to use - and this is coming from a frequent user of double sided mascara.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it is very hard to get off.</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t waste my money buying it from the store because I would be pissed if I had spent $10 on it and it was broken!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clumpy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling like hard bricks either!</li>
            <li> Its almost like it glued itself to my eyelashes which is not a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> and I had dark &amp;#34;circles&amp;#34; in a few hours because of it. :(</li>
            <li> I actually bought this mascara after being disappointed that I did not receive it in my Inflluenster VoxBox.</li>
            <li> but I have to say I was left disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still tedious because I don&#x27;t usually wear waterproof.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant that it would not own up to all the claims it made, but it met them and beyond!</li>
            <li> my usual mascara/ false lash combo!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get off even with makeup removers.</li>
            <li> It took a littlebit to get used to it because it is very hard to get off if smeared.</li>
            <li> but it is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> This mascara, thought not water proof is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The mascara does not fade throughout the day, but is very hard to remove at night.</li>
            <li> I want to say this mascara is VERY VERY HARD to get off.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time taking it off.</li>
            <li> it was very hard to remove even with makeup remove.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is VERY hard to remove, even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It is also very hard on my lashes.</li>
            <li> It can seriously hold a curl and gives me the dramatic eyelashes that I want, without the clumps.</li>
            <li> However, this stuff is TOUGH to get off by itself without makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The mascara was a bit tough to remove even though it isn&#x27;t even a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> The texture of the mascara is very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> The wand is also very thick.  </li>
            <li> they MEAN it!</li>
            <li> When they say waterproof, they mean it!</li>
            <li> It gave the look of wearing fake eyelashes without the mess of trying to put fake ones.</li>
            <li> The wand was hard and was uncomfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> But I also hate how short the brushes are.</li>
            <li> if you want thick fake looking eyelashes</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes so thick that it looks like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Seems like an unnecessary step.</li>
            <li> It can become clumpy, however ALL mascara does this, and if you just apply a thin layer, it seems to work out well.</li>
            <li> I get tired of having mascara clump up or not make my eye lashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> tried it out just before a sweaty, steamy baseball game, I&#x27;m a spectator, not a player, and it didn&#x27;t run or smudge</li>
            <li> The product is thin and doesn&#x27;t add the volume that you would expect with a 2 part application.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> Its water proof, makes my thin eye lashes look fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> and I would be annoyed at that</li>
            <li> The mascara is not too thick and not to thin where you have to keep reapplying for fullness!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great</li>
            <li> Absolute WORST mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse, it feels like glue soon after you use step two.</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I have thin eyelashes and wanted the look of thicker ones.  </li>
            <li> You get some serious curve and plush with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Not beautiful.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make them look real thick though, they look thin and defined, but I like that because I don&#x27;t want my lashes looking like one mass across my eye.</li>
            <li> cue dramatic hair flip and eye wink</li>
            <li> This mascara does what it says it will do which is make dramatic bombshell lashes</li>
            <li> While I will keep the mascara in my collection to use when I want really dramatic eyelashes on a night out - it won&#x27;t be the one I reach for every morning.</li>
            <li> It makes lashes appear longer and dramatic.</li>
            <li> When coming from some wear and you’re tired or just utterly lazy like me, oil based mascara tend to become very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say is, if you accidentally get it on your face, you&#x27;ll need makeup remover to get it off!</li>
            <li> I also found it very difficult to build up the coats of mascara, which is something I usually do.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really ideal for taking out with you for touch ups but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of girl who has always had trouble with mascara and the times that I&#x27;ve used it I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes used to be very thick &amp; long but hence age is a nasty girl &amp; it takes work for me to get them that way again.</li>
            <li> One problem is that even with an oil based makeup remover, it was still a bit difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I just couldn&#x27;t make this product work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second coat did help and the product isn&#x27;t horrible..</li>
            <li> Sadly, after having a kid and entering my 30s, something changed and my lashes just didn&#x27;t curl like they used to.</li>
            <li> In my research, I either had to buy an expensive department store brand</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Downfall to it was that it was difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> It also was difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It will take some getting use to with the way they pop out at the ends, I felt like I was holding it wrong</li>
            <li> (weird comment i know).</li>
            <li> And it is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> However, the second step is terrible!</li>
            <li> Sadly, my lashes didn&#x27;t keep the curl.</li>
            <li> (I ended up with some mascara on my eyelids, which is difficult to touch up if you&#x27;ve already put on eyeshadow).</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to take off though.</li>
            <li> and I found myself having to switch my hands up because I&#x27;d opened it on the wrong end.</li>
            <li> This mascara can be difficult to remove without an oil based remover, so heed the directions.  </li>
            <li> but sadly I have to say that this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> If you have thin eye lashes this is the mascara for you!</li>
            <li> so I was a bit skeptical about this</li>
            <li> and it was broken!</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks me if I have fake eye lashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive but stands up to the expensive ones you pay for in the dept stores.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it is quite difficult to remove, but if you follow the instructions and use an oil based make-up remover, you should have no problems.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this mascara won&#x27;t be changing my opinion.</li>
            <li> You have to use oil of some sort to take it off of your eyelashes and even still it is difficult.</li>
            <li> and all my attempts have failed.  </li>
            <li> You also have to use oil-based makeup remover to take this mascara off, but it&#x27;s just so difficult to get all of it.</li>
            <li> I decided to immediately take it off because it was to the point where I was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I Am now obsessed with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> ,maybe I had the wrong makeup remover</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to take off</li>
            <li> That being said, it is difficult to get off . . .</li>
            <li> When I was applying it it made my eyelashes sticky and made it feel weird like sticking to my skin.</li>
            <li> but it definitely isnt the worst.  </li>
            <li> though it was going to be difficult to put on the Mascara</li>
            <li> Bot boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not impressive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I got this</li>
            <li> &amp; I never felt uncomfortable with the feel.  </li>
            <li> WTF covergirl?</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes longer and bolder than my expensive mascara.</li>
            <li> It looks like I took the time to put false lashes on when I&#x27;m wearing it!</li>
            <li> , almost makes it look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes when I&#x27;m not!</li>
            <li> but I did find it hard to remove which is a wee bit annoying.</li>
            <li> It gives you very dramatic color, volume and</li>
            <li> I hate to get false eyelashes because they are uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> : Let me just start by saying that this packaging is so incredibly inconvenient.</li>
            <li> The one disappointment is the length of the dual-ended wand.</li>
            <li> and it became awkward.  </li>
            <li> I used eye makeup remover, cold cream, moisturizer, soap and water</li>
            <li> the applicator is a bit awkward.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid I would get it all over my lid.</li>
            <li> They will clump like crazy, and you&#x27;ll have to remove and start over.</li>
            <li> The stick is well made, so my fingers don&#x27;t get dirty after putting on mascara.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was a tad bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Then, when I went to take it off - it was so difficult to get off!  </li>
            <li> I heard a lot of hypes going on this mascara, needless to say I was pumped to try it out!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to those looking for something to add volume without making their eyelashes look fake!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed, I can&#x27;t go anywhere without using it!</li>
            <li> But alas i was dissapointed again!!</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with this mascara!</li>
            <li> I would defiantly recommend this, it is a game changer!!</li>
            <li> It is also very difficult to remove with an oil based remover.</li>
            <li> It was also very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It is also very difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> I was very sad about it</li>
            <li> and I have a very difficult time finding something that gives me volume while lifting my lashes.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that this mascara is practically impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> this is almost impossible for me to get off.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s impossible to separate them.</li>
            <li> but I had to tell the world about how bad this mascara is.  </li>
            <li> All of my products didn&#x27;t help, I hurt the skin around eyes, was pulling my eye lashes, it was bad.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s nevessarily bad, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out for me either.</li>
            <li> but it made my lashes clump terribly bad and</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad by any means, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that stands out to me.</li>
            <li> Despite what I&#x27;ve read about the bad smell and burning sensation</li>
            <li> But was surprisingly disappointed in this mascara, I didint like the thickness of the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I am so beyond disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It also has to be removed with an oil based remover. :(</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found that the wand was very awkward to use when applying.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, yes it does what it says but you will have to work like crazy to get it off.</li>
            <li> but I hate that when I go to remove it, it doesn&#x27;t want to come off.</li>
            <li> I hate using eyelash curlers bc</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> BUT I will never have to use it again, because I can&#x27;t get the crap off.</li>
            <li> Who on earth would create this awful substance?!</li>
            <li> The worst thing about this mascara for me was that it doesn&#x27;t come off!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews but I had to tell the world about how bad this mascara is.  It does not wash off. I have had it on now for two days, not by choice. I can&#x27;t get it off no matter what I try. Now my eyelashes are clumped together and sticky. Who on earth would create this awful substance?! I hope it washes off soon. I threw it right in the garbage and sorry I wasted $9 on this. There are plenty of other options. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> great mascara and easily removed with cold cream or make-up wipes</li>
            <li> The way the applicator is set up, it if hard to get the brush to my outer lashes.  Other than that I like the mascara.  It works nice and removes easily</li>
            <li> Did anyone actually TRY to use this before they out it on the market?! Tube is too FAT and wands are too SHORT. You can&#x27;t get this anywhere near your eyes without bumping into your face! #mascarafail</li>
            <li> The first day I used it I swore that it was the best mascara I had ever used. The second day I used it the mascara clumped and is still clumped a week later! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wash out mascara from my eyes for two days. All of my products didn&#x27;t help, I hurt the skin around eyes, was pulling my eye lashes, it was bad. Yesterday I went to the store to buy oil based cleanser and finally washed it out. Even oil based cleanser wasn&#x27;t working well.</li>
            <li> This is a two-step process. It claims to give extreme volume with an intensifying top coat for big sexy bombshell lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is the extreme volume base coat. It has a curve brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is the intensifying coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my process, first I curled my eyelashes. Second I applied Step 1: the extreme volume base coat.  Third, right after applying Step 1, I applied Step 2: the intensifying coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, I let my lashes dry for like several seconds and then I curled my eyelashes again. And Boy Oh Boy, my eyelashes literally got stuck onto my eyelash curler. I slowly had to pull my eyelashes from the eyelash curler. As I was pulling my eyelashes off, I pulled out at least four of my eyelashes out and my eye literally felt like it was bleeding or something but it wasn&#x27;t. So if you’re planning on re-curling your eyelashes after applying the mascara, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you wait till your mascara dry so you won’t pull any lashes out like me. I love how there is no fallout with this mascara. My eyelashes stay curled throughout the whole day. I don’t have to re-curl my eyelashes! The mascara does lengthen the lashes. It does help define &amp; separate the lashes. And lastly there are no clumps. The this mascara does not give volume as it claims. Also I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you buy an oil-based eye makeup remover to remove this mascara. It is a pain in the butt to remove this mascara with just a non-oil based eye makeup remover or even with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> This is the best my eye lashes have ever looked.  The only draw back is that is is EXTREMELY hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have used it before but, when I ordered it from here.. It was covered in some sort of jell. It sort of smelled like hair dye. I kept it because it was on the outside of the product but still that was NOT right.</li>
            <li> Terrible, yes it does what it says but you will have to work like crazy to get it off. If you buy a product because you want your lashes to look full, it shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to get off that your lashes fall out. Ridiculous. I have used waterproof mascaras in the past and as long as you use a makeup remover, it was fine. This is like concrete on your lashes. By the time I managed to get most of it off, my eyelids were bright red. I have never had a problem like this with a product. I am pretty easy to please and this is the first time I ever wrote to a company to complain about a product.</li>
            <li> If you wish to have your lashes glued together, please try this product. You will also need to visit the cleaning aisle for Simple Green and a package of scouring pads for removal. First application was somewhat smooth; first removal, not so much. Not only did my top and bottom lashes stick together upon every blink throughout the day, I&#x27;m pretty sure they all fell out when I attempted to remove the mascara. The product lasts all day...and every consecutive day thereafter. I would not recommend this product to a friend, or even an enemy.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this mascara. I am a mascara lover and go to is the orange tube of Covergirl Lashblast (not the waterproof kind) I love that mascara. I don&#x27;t know why but this mascara reminded me of the old maybelline tube I used to get that had one side that was white and the other black, that i used to use in high school so I think for nostalgia sake I bought this tube.  It&#x27;s really not good. The first side is ok, but as soon as I go to put the second side on, it just clumps. I have spider eyelashes. nothing really separates. The worst thing about this mascara for me was that it doesn&#x27;t come off!!! What do they put in this thing? mascara cement? I could wash my face three times, take a shower, use olive oil and makeup remover and still have some left over mascara on my eyelashes. That just bugs me like no tomorrow so I will never buy this one again. I will stick with my other Covergirl mascara, you know the good one.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this mascara a while back and finally opened it to use last week.  WOW!!  I wear waterproof mascara on a regular basis and have never had anyone mention anything in particular about it.  The first time I wore this particular mascara, I cannot tell you how many friends commented on how great my lashes looked - thicker and longer.  Since I have thin short lashes, this really pleased me!  I have worn it several times since and always get compliments.  The last two times I wore it, I was short on time, so only used the #1 side, which seemed to make my lashes look just as good.  As I&#x27;ve aged (I&#x27;m 69 now), I&#x27;ve found that my eyes have gotten a bit sensitive and this mascara did not irritate them at all.  I&#x27;ve read in several of the reviews that the users had major problems removing the mascara.  While I had no problems removing it, that may be because I only use removers for waterproof eye makeup and only two top brands - Lancome and Clinique.  I also really soak the cotton pad with remover which may be another reason.  I will say that the 2 times I used the mascara #1 side only, it seemed to remove more easily, but not totally sure about that since I really didn&#x27;t have a problem with removal the other times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Lancome Drama waterproof mascara and would rate the Cover Girl just as highly!</li>
            <li> Worst mascara ever. I&#x27;ve used everything and this is by far the craziest mascara. I even went to beauty school so I&#x27;ve been though all sorts of products. This does not come off your eyelashes. You have to lose a few eyelashes trying to get it off. Not even make up remover takes it off. Just don&#x27;t lol.</li>
            <li> both ends of the applicator can be used to curl your eyelashes and apply the color.  It is a little more difficult to apply then expected.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation in this product is excellent, but aside from that I have nothing good to say about it. I bought it thinking it would be a good way to make my lashes look bigger and fuller, and in a way it did but only because it clumps so bad even the ole&#x27; safety pin trick wouldn&#x27;t help. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the formula, the bristles, the brush shape, the shortness of the brush, or the fact that it is a two step system but it is AWFUL. Normally I love Covergirl, but this time they definitely missed the mark.</li>
            <li> I received this as a complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I never wear eye makeup because I just don&#x27;t think it looks good on me, well after trying this Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara I will be adding it to my every day routine! It&#x27;s not clumpy like other mascaras I have tried. I like that I can curl my lashes and then darken them. I recommend this to anyone who wants the perfect lash!</li>
            <li> I received a sample from influenster. I am MORE than happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t smear. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my lashes clumping into a big blob of black. It makes them thick without being messy. I love the ease in using. The dual wand is the best part!</li>
            <li> Using just the first formula is makes my lashes look amazing, the second formula makes them look all clumpy. Its also a huge pain to get off, oil or not.&lt;br /&gt;Received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing it makes my eyes stand out.  Everbody says I look great with it on. ITS THE BOMB</li>
            <li> I received this in my Influenster Surfsupvoxbox to try it out and I thought it was a so-so product.  When I first tried it I notice that one or two of my lashes would fall off and I thought maybe I&#x27;m just using too much coat or combing my lashes out too hard but the more I used it one or two more lashes would fall off and that got me scared so I stopped using it.  What I liked about this mascara is that it dries soft and not crispy and hard.  I like how you can use Side 1 if you just want a simple everyday look without making your lashes look too crazy or you can use side 2 to give you more volume.  What I don&#x27;t like about this mascara is that it can be a challenge to use because you get very little space and control over the brush because it&#x27;s so close to the part you hold.  I would have to press the handle area against my face in order to reach certain area of my lashes.  I also don&#x27;t like how sticky it feels when it&#x27;s not completely dry.  Overall for the sake of my lashes I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently received this product for free from Influenster and it is a pretty good product. Side one did curl the lashes pretty well but side two did clump the lashes a little bit, but overall it did make my lashes look great. One problem is that even with an oil based makeup remover, it was still a bit difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I received this mascara free from the Surf&#x27;s Up Voxbox from Influenster. However, all opinions are my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already a fan of the lashblast formula and large, plasticy brush and was pleased overall with this product as well. It has 2 ends, one for curling/definition with a plasticy lashblast brush, and another for darkening and intensifying with a traditional spoolie brush. It was not clumpy, even using both ends. I apply #1 then #2, without letting the mascara dry in between coats. The mascara is not marketed as waterproof, but takes some time to remove with my makeup wipes, so it could probably withstand some light water although I have not personally tested it as such.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely lengthens more than volumizes. I usually like a little more volume to my mascara, but am definitely keeping this in my arsenal because of the crazy definition it gives my lashes. Like another reviewer mentioned, it can be a little awkward to hold-you have to unscrew #1, use it, screw it back on, unscrew #2, use it, and screw back on before repeating the process (if you do each eye separately like I do, at least).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It made my eyelashes so much more noticeable. It also made them look a lot longer than they actually are. I would recommend using this product. The wands and product are so nice. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster to try, and WOW! It&#x27;s so great with the dual ends and clump free formula. I love it a lot. Not only that but it gives my lashes so much volume! Would def. recommend (:</li>
            <li> I got this product compliments of influenster and I have to say, I love it. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight which I love, and it really is waterproof. My lashes were fuller, longer, and had a beautiful curl. I am not a fan of mascara and very rarely use it. You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
            <li> I got this free in my Influenster  surfsupvoxbox and I love it ! I have little blonde lashes and after the first step I was amazed at how big my lashes looked .. After the 2nd coat it looked even better .. But be careful it will clump if ya put on too many layers !</li>
            <li> I really like the double applicator! I think it makes my lashes look more full...But I do prefer a one step process, but overall I would DEFF recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like how it&#x27;s dual tipped. I would give it a 4 star rating if the holding wasn&#x27;t so big. Other wise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Bombshell Curvaceous is a necessity! I count on it for big, clump free lashes that have been lasting me through the sweat &amp; tears of the World Cup so far! It packs lashes big enough for a fancy event, but simple enough that as your only makeup you look fresh for summer. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> So I just received my first Influenster box for free from influenster.com and I was pleasantly surprised when I found this mascara inside for me to test. I loved it! I&#x27;m always looking for ways to make my eyelashes look bigger and thicker and this mascara does just that!</li>
            <li> I received this from influenster as a gift. I freaking absolutely love it! I use one and my lashes are volumizes by two coats then I use two and my lashes are super long and bold. I diodes not clump or anything I agree on it being sticky, but I don&#x27;t really mind. When removing it I just use coconut oil and boom I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> My lashes clump together and don&#x27;t look very full. But with this mascara they look awesome! Thanks covergirl for making a product that is in everyone&#x27;s price range.</li>
            <li> This mascara made a huge difference in my lashes. I love the brushes, and it&#x27;s not clumpy. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the tacky, heavy feel to it. I like my mascara to be light, I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m wearing it, but with the lashes this gives me I&#x27;m willing to overlook it on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;This gets a B+</li>
            <li> I also received this product complimentary from Influenster. I don&#x27;t like heavy mascara and was hesitant to try this two step process. I was pleasantly surprised. No clumps. Loved the plastic wand for step one! Went on great! I thought it was worth having to use true makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> I receive this in my Vox box from Influenster. I love that it is easy to use but you still get great results! My lashes look great with this product! The only negative thing I found was it is a bit difficult to remove but that will not stop me from using it!</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle this mascara from influenster and I Love it!!  It gives great curves and length!!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I recently got this in an influenster box and although it is a decent mascara I feel Covergirl has better (clump crusher). I don&#x27;t like having to use both sides of the mascara but do like that they have different uses. Overall it looks nice on my lashes but is very difficult to remove and a few of my lashes fell out with removal.</li>
            <li> Although this mascara took some getting used to. I eventually saw that this product worked. It have me the length I desire all while not clumping my eyelashes together. The only downside I had to this mascara was the smell. It did give me bombshell eyes though and made then longer.</li>
            <li> Before trying this mascara, I had high hopes it. Sadly, I just couldn&#x27;t make this product work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING: Let me just start by saying that this packaging is so incredibly inconvenient. I&#x27;ve found it very difficult to apply this mascara simply because the packaging is so bulky. I really had to get creative to get all of my lashes coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FORMULATION: The formulation of this mascara seemed rather dry to me. My eyelashes clumped very easily, and it was impossible to fix after that. I also found it very difficult to build up the coats of mascara, which is something I usually do. Not to mention that this mascara is practically impossible to remove. Even with an oil-based eye makeup remover, I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff off and lost some eyelashes in the process ):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: This mascara retails for around $9-10, but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. Unless you&#x27;re looking for an absolutely waterproof mascara for swimming or just a hot summer day, it certainly isn&#x27;t the kind of mascara I&#x27;d wanna wear on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!! Makes my lashes look so full,long,and curled without curling them! What more could you want? Lol deffinetly will buy again!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a sample from influenster. I tried it right away, and I really like it! It made my lashes long and fuller. It didn&#x27;t rub off or run. It held up really well all day! I highly recommend this mascera!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl lash blast is still probably my favorite mascera, but I love bombshell for a special occasion, or if I have a bit more primping time since it does take a bit longer to apply (totally worth it though!)</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary to test out from Influenster, and I must say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I tried it the first time without curling my eyelashes just to see what kind of lift it might provide, and it was entirely successful. This mascara definitely lengthens, adds volume, and provides a great curl to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints would be the incredibly bulky packaging and how hard it is to remove, though an oil-based remover does work; its just less convenient removal than I prefer.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to try through Influenster to test it out and I will admit that I was super skeptical.  I am a &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit addict and have to say, I think I might like this more! It isn&#x27;t too wet or too dry, it definitely gives you sky high curving eyelashes, and the &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; is just that.  It is slightly more time consuming to go through two rounds of mascara and having to switch sides of wand in between, but I usually put on two coats of other mascara anyway, so it really isn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;ve had no problems with getting the mascara to come off with my makeup remover (or just soap and water) but it also stays on really well through the day (or more! I admit I&#x27;ve gone to bed without taking it off and waking up in the morning with my eyelashes still looking pretty good)</li>
            <li> I received a full-size mascara from influenster for testing purposes! Covergirl mascaras are always a win, but this one has got to be my favorite. It also stayed on the next day without giving me &amp;#34;racoon eyes!&amp;#34; Score!</li>
            <li> Bombshell Curvaceous mascara makes my eyelashes look amazing! My only compain is it is difficult to remove. It is very hard to get off even with makeup removers. And I feel like I am ripping out my own lashes to get the mascara off. Good mascara, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster to try out and I enjoy it! I like products that lengthen my lashes, and even if there is no volume I go over with a volumizing mascara to add definition. I might repurchase when I run out! Though I love trying new mascaras every time</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a free sample from Influenster with my SurfsUpVoxBox. I am in love with this mascara. It goes on without any clumps and very evenly. I have pretty moderate lashes but with Bombshell Curvaceous, my lashes are luscious!! They look like I have on fakes without the fakes. My new fav!</li>
            <li> This mascara was sent to me by Influenster for testing purposes.  I&#x27;m one of those people who no matter what type of mascara I try it always ends up smudging or making me look like a raccoon by noon. I like the idea of this product that it builds volume first then adds bold blackness to the lashes.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the packaging however. I find it is rather large and not that convenient. Although, I am quite impressed by its staying power.  Even though my lashes don&#x27;t look outrageously thick or voluminous I am really satisfied with how well it has stayed on my lashes. I give this product a 3 out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Here is a picture of me with the mascara on.</li>
            <li> I received this in my influenster voxbox to test and I love it! It make your eyelashes huge and makes your eye pop!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster for testing purposes, and I actually liked it. It worked well for me and gave my lashes a lot more volume. It was a little tricky to remove, but not impossible.</li>
            <li> I dont think I would have tried this but I got it as a trial and LOVE it.  I have always been used to my other mascara but this one does wonders.  Goes on well and does not clump!  I went swimming with it and it did not run!  Very much worth it!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for everyday wear!  It gives the perfect length and curves lashes! I love this product and use it daily!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Gives my lashes a little va va voom Ive been wishing for for a long time. Cant wait to show it off.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free for testing purposes from Influenster, and boy am I glad that I did! I live in the south, where it&#x27;s hot and humid during the summer. This mascara is waterproof, so even at the beach in the rain yesterday with 87 degree humid heat, this mascara went NOWHERE! And on top of that, my lashes look super full and long and amazing. This is a must have in my beauty bag!!!!</li>
            <li> awesome mascara for someone like me with short eye lashes! i like the way it elongates my lashes and makes them look more full!</li>
            <li> I usually stick to the same mineral mascara I&#x27;ve been using for years, but I received this mascara free from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox for testing purposes. Used it this morning and I actually like it more than I thought I would! The 2-step process really works great. My lashes are long, thick, curvy, and well-defined. My only complaints are: 1) the tube is fat and the wands are stumpy so it can be awkward to hold and get to the lashes in the corners of your eyes; and 2) it leaves smudges if you don&#x27;t let your lashes thoroughly dry before doing a lot of blinking, which was also kind of awkward. But it did dry fast. I will definitely keep using it and consider purchasing in the future when this tube runs out!</li>
            <li> I got this free for testing purposes from Influenster, but ended up loving it!  My job requires a lot of walking around in the heat and sometimes I find myself sweating off my makeup.  But not with this! It stayed on all day and had my lashes looking great.  It was a bit hard to get off (I had to go buy remover for it) but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product through Influenster and I absolutely love it. I used it specifically on a hot weekend, sweating through a horseback riding day and then a day at the pool. It never ran down my face or smudged. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from influenster for testing and reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this mascara OK but over all I prefer the covergirl clump crusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds length&lt;br /&gt;Adds volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Flakes&lt;br /&gt;Dries slowly (i find it is under my eyes for awhile after applying so I have to let it set before I can finish my makeup for the day.)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, at first, about this mascara but after one use, I was sold!  This mascara, unlike other mascaras that I like, is not waterproof.  Many not waterproof mascaras tend to smudge through the day and give me raccoon eyes.  However, this mascara after a 12 hour day, did not budge.  I actually had a hard time getting the mascara off my lashes with my makeup remover wipes.  I had to let the wipes sit over my eyes for about a minute for the mascara to dissolve in to the wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being Asian, I have very short, straight lashes.  And this mascara really coats the sparse lashes I have, spread them out, and lengthen them!  This mascara has quickly become one of my favorite mascaras.  I also apply this non-waterproof mascara to my bottom lashes and very little smudging occurred after 12 hours of wear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I was given this mascara by Influenster!***</li>
            <li> I just received the Covergirl Bombshell mascara in my influenster voxbox! I totally love it! It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes my lashes look amazing! Definitely would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I loved it! No clumping and super results.  My eyelashes looked great they where full, dark and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks CoverGirl!</li>
            <li> I received this from influenster and it is amazing. You can use it for a range of looks; it works great for any occasion. It also has a nice design and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it goes on smoothly, lasts, and makes my eye lashes look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes and then I feel like a bombshell!!!</li>
            <li> Maxing mascara I just received from @influenster to review! Made my lashes do much longer and fuller than other mascaras I have tried! I will definitely keep this as my go to product</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary through INFLUENSTER. I love it! It is long lasting. But I also hate how short the brushes are. It&#x27;s kind of awkward to put on. Overall I love it though and recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster for my free sample. I am not sure I would buy this product myself. The first wand was no problem, but the second one seemed to make it a little difficult. It didn&#x27;t really want to adhere to my lashes and when it did, it was kind of clumpy. I am all about trying new products, especially for my eyelashes, but I was disappointed by the results. It thickened my lashes, but not in a pretty way.</li>
            <li> I received these products free for testing purposes from Influenster , I really loved the end results of this product and how there are no clumps. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the inconvenience of two applicators.</li>
            <li> Cool new product! I wouldn&#x27;t pay the price for it just cause I have better mascaras that are cheaper. Got it in an influenster box.</li>
            <li> After receiving this mascara complimentary from Influenster, I decided to take a chance and try it on a night out. To my surprise it not only goes on well and with great color, but does not even clump! I would definitely purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product. I already have full eye lashes and always enjoy highlighting my finer quality... This product falls a bit short. I loved the larger sized container as it makes it easier to locate amongst my drawer of products.. But after I applied the first step I already knew this mascara wasn&#x27;t going to be thick enough to truly make my eyes shine. The second coat did help and the product isn&#x27;t horrible.. I just prefer a thicker variety with more &amp;#34;la la la&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love how side one coats all the fine lashes and side 2 really plumps up the volume! Great separation of lashes and no irritation at all! I have sensitive eyes and this mascara is perfect for the dramatic falsie look which is perfect for day or transitioning to the evening! I received this complementary from Influenster to try out!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara for everyday use. Both sides do different things, but makes my eyelashes look amazing! It does not clump either. Would definitely buy it again and the price is very reasonable!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it not only lengthens, but it also fans out my eyelashes so they look full and pretty. :) I wear mascara and eye liner pretty much every day so I am always looking for the best items to use. I would recommend this brand to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> I received this free to test from Influenster in my surfs up voxbox and I LOVE it. I&#x27;m not at all sure why I&#x27;ve seen some reviews say that it&#x27;s clumpy bc it&#x27;s truly not. If I could submit a pic of my eyes with one eye nakey and one eye with this mascara, I would bc it&#x27;s a HUGE difference. You get length and fullness. It does take a bit to dry, but if you&#x27;ve ever worn mascara before, you know that&#x27;s just how it is. All in all, will be switching to this from now on.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from influenster and I was soooo excited. When I put it on the first time it was okay, but the second time it was very clumpy, very heavy, and very messy. Every time I blinked I ended up with little bits of black on my face. I can feel it all day while it&#x27;s on too.</li>
            <li> I received this Bombshelling mascara for free from Influenster for testing purposes. It&#x27;s OKAY. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s nevessarily bad, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out for me either. I like the chunkiness of the tube, but I don&#x27;t really see the need for the &amp;#34;2-step&amp;#34; process. It doesn&#x27;t make (my) lashes super huge looking. To me it is like a normal mascara, but with a 2-step process. I will still use this, but I may or may not purchase it.</li>
            <li> I received this through influensters surfs up vox box and was super excited to try it! It took a littlebit to get used to it because it is very hard to get off if smeared. However once I got the hang of it I absolutely loved it. It did not rub off and smear once on which was great for goin out at night and for all day wear! I absolutely love it now and use it everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only mascara so far that makes my lashes long and lush.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to remove with some makeup remover.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I received this item for free through Influenster&#x27;s Surf&#x27;s Up VoxBox. The mascara bottle is huge, and it takes up so much room in my make up box. I think it&#x27;s really cool how one wand curls and the other one thickens. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really necessary to use both. The texture of the mascara is very thick and sticky. I don&#x27;t think it really made my lashes look thicker though. I like to remove my make up in one step with a face wash specifically designed to remove make up. Oil-based remover irritates my eyes and feels so gross to use. But even with an oil-based remover, it&#x27;s really hard to remove. I&#x27;m stoked that I got it free and will continue to use it, but once I use it up, I will go back to my normal favorite mascara - the orange Lash Blast, also by Covergirl.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras all from different brands. Bombshell curvaceous by covergirl is by far the best. It makes my eyelashes look wonderful. This does not clump up like most other mascaras do. It is easy to come off when needed. It does not irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect over all!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free last week from Influenster to try and love it!  The color is strong and it does exactly what it says it will.  Make sure you have something that will help you take it off at night it is def. waterproof.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing. It makes my eyelashes stand out and really accents my eyes. I really live this product</li>
            <li> Received this to review from vox box. I loved how the product went on. It was not clumpy and separated well. I did a picture of my regular covergirl mascara and the bombshell. There was a definite difference. I liked this product however when I took it off it it left a glue like residue. I did not use an eye makeup remover just regular face soap. I will try a remover next time</li>
            <li> For the price, the is the best I have found. I love how the first step lengthens and separates my lashes and step two adds volume and plump. It does take a little bit more time to do both steps every morning, but it is so worth it. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I love the way this Mascara makes my lashes look.  They look long and full.  The only downside is the wand is a little too short.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free from Influenster and I must say I really like this product. I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara,  but I think that may change now because this made my lashes pop and didn&#x27;t smear under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After hearing all these rumors about eyelashes falling out I was pretty scared to try this product but after a few minutes of googling the facts, it turns out you just have to be really careful taking it off like using oil to take it off and don&#x27;t rub too hard. So i decided to give it a try, its a little on the thick side so you have to be careful.  I don&#x27;t know if i would buy it but its worth a try if you want thick fake looking eyelashes</li>
            <li> I received the full-size courtesy of Influenster, and was excited to try it! While I do like the way this makes my lashes look, overall it&#x27;s a hassle to do two things. The tube is enormous and awkward. Alone, the two mascaras do very little, but together they do give me a nicely curled, intense look. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the fact that this clumps super easily, and feels incredibly heavy on.</li>
            <li> This product was sent out complimentary via #Influenster. I love the product packaging and design. I am a big fan of Covergirl mascara. I love how it has the two sides and that it helps curl your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Specially when you are out partying all night!!</li>
            <li> Omg I love my cover girl bombshell curvaceous mascara. I got it from influencer for testing purposes. I love the way I can know have long eyelashes without having to wear fake eyelashes. Really you guys should check it</li>
            <li> This mascara is really good, but not great.  It is extremely hard to take off even with really oily make-up remover.  It does however make lashes pop and curl really well.  My lashes are not really long and this mascara really does a good job of creating length and curve to my lashes.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this. the packaging is kinda big and clunky but it&#x27;s the best drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this mascara after being disappointed that I did not receive it in my Inflluenster VoxBox. I had read nothing but awesome things about it and wanted to give it a try. I absolutely love it! It makes my lashes so thick that it looks like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. Definitely recommend it for a dramatic look. Although it has the curved wand it really didn&#x27;t help curl my lashes. It was a little tricky to apply but it was worth the effort. And I recommend using makeup wipes to remove it! It definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes so this wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me until i used it!&lt;br /&gt;I love how it is a two step process&lt;br /&gt;The first step lengthens my lashes&lt;br /&gt;The second step made it more thicker&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say the second step mascara smells pretty awful&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the product was a 9.5/10&lt;br /&gt;I love the way I grab for that mascara more than the ones I have now.</li>
            <li> I really like the formula of this, but one shortcoming, literally. is the length of the wands... they feel way too short and are a little of a challenge to use because of it... It the different brushes and the formula though.  If you don&#x27;t mind shorter wands, go for it.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara from Influenster for testing and I have been very impressed. This mascara went on very easily and feels light, but also adds great volume and length to my lashes. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> The color is &#x27;very black&#x27; and they aren&#x27;t lying! It&#x27;s jet black and I love it! Makes my lashes appear fuller and longer &amp; lasts all day. Only downfall is that it can be quite sticky/messy until it dries completely,just have to be very careful to not get it on your face because once it&#x27;s there the color is quite hard to remove. *I received the mascara complementary from Influenster for testing and review.*</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough great things about this mascara! Everyone asks if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes because mine look so full and long when I wear it. I love it and it is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara to test from Influenster. It has been one of the best mascaras that I have tried. It doesnt clump up and goes on smoothly and evenly. It makes my lashes look fuller, thicker, and longer while also keeping them from sticking together like other mascara brands. It has also given my lashes much more volume. It is long lasting but easily removable as well. Overall a product that I would recommend and also purchase myself.</li>
            <li> I received this COVERGIRL Bombshell Mascara from Influenster for testing purposes and reviews. I just bought Maybelline false eyelash mascara a few months ago. I read so many good reviews, but I don&#x27;t like it. It says it&#x27;s waterproof, but a couple hours later the bottom of my eyes have black smudges. This COVERGIRL Bombshell Mascara won&#x27;t smudge like Maybelline. Also I like that one side of brush is a rubber brush and won&#x27;t put clumps on my eyelashes. I love this COVERGIRL Bombshell mascara, it gives my eyelashes volume.</li>
            <li> This mascara has really nice length and makes your lashes soooo long! It is a very nice mascara! I love it! The only downside is how hard it is to get off. So use  a good makeup remover with it!</li>
            <li> I originally received a complimantary sample from influenster for testing purposes and I fell in love ever since. My new favorite mascara!!! For a girl seriously loves makeup, I would definitely recommend the product. I have long lashes but with this mascara it makes them look full as well as add extra length. I also had no problem with it sticking to my upper eye lid and tinting it black. Its an AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this, but I was totally disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the mascara itself, or if it&#x27;s the fact that my eyes are super sensitive when it comes to mascara.  It irritated my eyes and ugh, it was just terrible.  :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and like it, it&#x27;s easy enough to put on and my lashes look great (hint: use a eyelash curler for better results). It is a bit tricky to remove and requires actual make-up remover. However I am happy with the results!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this mascara to friends &amp; strangers to use!  I&#x27;m amazed that when applied it was completely clump free!  I&#x27;m so glad that I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I just opened my Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast mascara in Very Black, and am really happy with it so far!!! Easy to apply, and I didn&#x27;t need to use a billion coats. I like the dual brushes, and how the first brush actually curled my lashes. I was impressed and shocked. The second side plumped up my lashes and I feel really confident in this product, just after one use. Thank you Influenster and Covergirl for the chance to sample this awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Maybelline mascara..for years! I tried Covergirl Bombshell one time and absolutely fell in love! My lashes were defined, shiny, full, incredibly long and had great curl! Yes, there&#x27;s an extra step BUT it&#x27;s well worth it! And the BEST part, I didn&#x27;t look like a raccoon at the end of the day. The mascara didn&#x27;t run or flake and love black under my eyes. It was very easy to remove with a little coconut oil (I prefer to use natural products when I can)&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad influenster.com let me try this great product before buying. Although,  I would pay them for it in a heartbeat.  This is truly an amazing mascara!  I can&#x27;t wait to get my Bombshell look again :) I&#x27;m a stay at home mom so it doesn&#x27;t happen often.  But when it does, look out! My lashes are so long they might just blow you away!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary tube from Influenster [...] for testing and review purposes.    I received a waterproof version (not sure if they come in non-waterproof) and it was an asset to my makeup bag when I went on a beach vacation. I like the two step application process; it eliminates the need for a second coat.    I will probably buy another tube when my complimentary tube runs out.</li>
            <li> Great product! I received this sample from influenster and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I&#x27;m not a huge mascara wearer but always love a good one!  Love the curved wand, really helped open up my eyes and elongate my lashes and the flat wand helped give my lashes that extra umph of volume.  Didn&#x27;t smear or smudge or flake onto my face.  Would definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara for testing purposes from Influenster in my Surf&#x27;s Up Vox Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally don&#x27;t bother using mascara since i live in a warm climate and usually in the pool. I figured i would see how it would hold up to a quick swim in the pool. I was not disappointed. It didn&#x27;t run and still looked great. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of mascara and very rarely use it. But, I got this product compliments of influenster and I have to say, I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight which I love, and it really is waterproof. My lashes were fuller, longer, and had a beautiful curl.You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and was super excited to get one for free from Influenster. It makes my eyelashes look AMAZING and it lasts all day! What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m really glad I got it for free in my surfs up voxbox from Influenster. It may very well be my new favorite.  It distributes very evenly , adds length, and separates lashes nicely. It lasted all day and I had only one problem with it. I dont typically use waterproof mascaras for the exact reason that its very difficult to remove as this one was. It may be that I didnt use a makeup remover but i absolutely recommend this if you dont mind the difficulty of removing it.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes via the surfsup voxbox from influenster.  The packaging is cute and definitely catches your eye especially since there are not many double sided mascaras out there.  Super excited to tru this ad I&#x27;ve heard so many things about it and it was free.  Unfortunately I was a tad bit disappointed.  Side #1 meant to lengthen and curl your lashes worked great for me however side #2 wasn&#x27;t the greatest.  It&#x27;s meant to intensify the look but it made my lashes clump terribly bad and it is extremely hard to remove.  I like the product but I will not continue to use side 2 as I don&#x27;t like clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara a couple of months ago, and just received another one from INFLUENCER is review...I love this mascara! Its an awesome two in one; I sometimes use each end individually; each brush is different... or use them together for super volume and pretty lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have is that because it goes on pretty thick, it is a little harder to scrub off, but for me thats not a big issue.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best out of all the Covergirl brands! It makes my lashes look amazing. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and ll buy again for sure :) !</li>
            <li> I was lucky  enough to receive this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and it did wonders on my lashes!! I honestly haven&#x27;t found a mascara that ACTUALLY makes them look fuller, thought it did clump just a tad bit but nothing crazy. Once I curled my lashed with the mascara, they looked beautiful! i also love the fact that its water proof and quite easy to take off with the right makeup removal. If you want good mascara that isn&#x27;t going to hurt your wallet, definitely buy this! Trust me, its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in the color &#x27;very black&#x27; for free from Influenster for testing purchases. This mascara makes my lashes voluminous and beautiful! I will definitely be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with the definition and length that this mascara was able to achieve. Most often, I buy a salon quality/higher name brand mascara. I received this mascara free for testing purposes from Influenster. The mascara goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump, the design is slightly awkward because of the double ended brush, but it is easily accommodated. This is a very very black mascara, to which it lives up to its name. However, the best feature of this mascara is that even though it is waterproof, it is easier to removes and causes less irritation with removal than my normal mascara.</li>
            <li> The product works like it says it does by making your eye lashes voluptuous. But it is so hard to get off it makes me not want wear it sometimes but it is good other than that</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from influenster to try out.  I really liked it and it is very waterproof, which makes it great to use at the pool or beach.  One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the wand was a little bulky to use, but it is not that big of a deal.  Overall this mascara is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this free off of influenster. The formula is light, which is good. Prevents clumping and isn&#x27;t too heavy on bottom lashes if you only use the first one. It does offer great volume like it says.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little sticky on the lashes.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  Great lightweight bouncing curvaceous eyelashes. Easy to apply doesn&#x27;t smudge last all day long!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I was really looking forward to testing this product but I have to say I was left disappointed.  It left my lashes clumpy and sticky and it was extremely difficult to remove even with the recommended oil-based make up remover.  It DID make my lashes look full-ish and very dark so i may use it for a night out, but for daily use I will stick with my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras i have ever owned! it makes my lashes full! I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I recently received this product to try for free complimentary of Influenster... I was skeptical at first because I have a mascara that I like and I usually don&#x27;t have much luck with others. This one was great though! It went on very easily (once I got used to the brush) and it didn&#x27;t clump! Only flaw is that it was a bit hard to get off, but other than that, I like it! I would recommend.</li>
            <li> * I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing and review purposes.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this mascara! I was pleasantly surprised that the two step process did not take longer than my traditional mascara product (with two coats) and that this waterproof mascara was truly that! No runny mascara on this rainy day for this gal! With that being said - be sure to use an oil-based makeup remover to fully remove this product at night. It&#x27;s THAT good! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. It gives your eyelashes amazing length and volume. I love the two separate brushes that helps to give your eyelashes a different look.</li>
            <li> i received a sample of this product from influenster and this is the best mascara that i&#x27;ve ever had it holds up well for hours and gives my eyelashes a dramatic look that i can&#x27;t get with other brands</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara!! I received it in my Influenster Box to try :) Definitely gives my short lashed some length and volume!</li>
            <li> Really great mascara. Stays on all day and applies easy. No clumps! It applies evenly and quickly. It really lengthens and defines lashes well and doesn&#x27;t cake on like some defining mascaras. So happy I got this item complimentary in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> **I received a full size tube of this mascara from Influenster for free for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this mascara. I have been on the search for a good mascara that lengthens, curls and volumizes my lashes for the past year. Once upon a time, my lashes were amazing...one coat of mascara and they&#x27;d look long and curly - like I was wearing falsies. Sadly, after having a kid and entering my 30s, something changed and my lashes just didn&#x27;t curl like they used to. In my research, I either had to buy an expensive department store brand or I had to use 2 drug store brands to get the effect I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this mascara, I found what I was looking for...my lashes were long, curly, and really, well, bombshell-esque!  The mascara lasted all day - no flaking or smudging as it is similar to a waterproof formula. Removal was OK - I used a makeup remover that said it could be used on waterproof makeup but it was still a little difficult to remove so I will use an oil based remover next time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the mascara is that because of the tube style (being a double-barreled tube), the wands were shorter so there was less clearance between the top of the tube and the mascara brush so it would bump into my nose and side of face often during application - just a little uncomfortable but NOT a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this mascara and I would purchase this in the future. Va va VOOM!</li>
            <li> Covergirl is always my go-to brand when not using a pricey-er one at Sephora or Ulta. It is super cost effective and does exactly what it says it is supposed to do. I actually double both this mascara and the yellow volume one together to make a very dramtic look.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of testing the CoverGirl Bombshell Curvaceous mascara courtesy of a VoxBox  provided Influenster.com. I loved the volume and length of my normally skimpy eye lashes. It was also very pigmented which made it very black, which I absolutely loved! I wore it all day without touch ups, no bleeding or smudging.This is a go to mascara!</li>
            <li> Ok. So I received this mascara on influenster box for review. I have to say this did not beat my holly grail of all mascara, Lancôme hypnosis. But it is decent. I like that it has two different wands but wish the whole thing was thinner. I&lt;br /&gt;Tube is BIG..... It did smudge a bit towards the end of the day but nothing other than Lancôme waterproof smudges on me. So that was expected. It does not clump at all after I coated my lashes for three times. So that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> I received the CoverGirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. As a mascara junkie I am ALWAYS on the hunt for the perfect product to make my lashes long and gorgeous. This product did the trick! It&#x27;s dual wand sides allowed me to customize the look I wanted. Both ends have different type of brush so that&#x27;s good for lengthening and also for adding volume. The only downside is that it is a little hard to remove. I did not have the recommended CoverGirl remover and so my lashes felt the pain. Next time I use it I will be sure to have purchased the makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample and I can say that I have never used a mascara with the double wand action. I personally do not care for it, they are too short and difficult to use. I also do not need length for my lashes but I would recommend for someone with fine, shorter lashes. All in all not a bad mascara at all just doesn&#x27;t work well for me, I would choose one of the other Covergirl mascaras before I pick this one up.</li>
            <li> This mascara is okay. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the 1st step brush. It didn&#x27;t pump up the volume of my lashes that much. And I generally just don&#x27;t care for that type of brush. But step 2 really helped! That was my favorite part. Not a huge WOW factor going on with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this and highly recommend buying. I was able to try for free through influenster.com. I will be buying this in the future!</li>
            <li> I received a free mascara for testing purposes from Influenster, but all opinions are my own. I tried this today, I like the two steps - that really seems to make a difference in the plump/long lash look. I&#x27;ve worn it all day and no smudges! Very good product, and you can really make a dramatic look with it!</li>
            <li> I had tried the Bombshell Volume mascara and I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.  So, when I received the Curvaceous mascara courtesy of Influenster.com, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be thrilled.  Luckily, I was wrong.  Both brushes are nice and the formula is great.  The only thing that I do not like is that the wand lengths are not very comfortable.  I don&#x27;t know that I would buy this for myself, but I will definitely use this mascara in my rotation!!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I love this mascara! I was a bit skeptical about the packaging to be honest but as soon as I tried product I forgot all about it. It made my lashes look fuller and longer. I would defiantly recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox but I am repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I received Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous from Influenster to try. While this mascara did a really good job of creating the full lashes look and would look great for parties, it is a little bit difficult to apply. I feel that it clumps around the eyelashes. Since this is the first time I used this type of mascara, maybe it&#x27;ll get better with use. But I did love the results.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free for testing from @Influenster in my #surfsupvoxbox.  I typically don&#x27;t care for 2 step mascaras because they tend to be clumpy and heavy.  However this mascara is different.  I have really been liking the curve and length that this product is giving me.  And best of all it doesn&#x27;t clump and look spidery.  Some people are having difficulty removing this, however I massage in a little coconut oil and it all melts away.</li>
            <li> Omg!! Amazing made my lashes look full and dramatic. I love it. Highly recommend to anyone who wants full lashes</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary item in my SurfsUpVoxBox from Influenster for testing purposes. I love the formula - it&#x27;s clump free, very buildable, and makes lashes look almost perfect. Great staying power, especially with hooded lids in heat and high humidity - no smudges or transfer! The one disappointment is the length of the dual-ended wand. It&#x27;s too short and the handle is too wide, making it very difficult to get to the inner lashes. Turning the wand toward the eye to get to the inner lashes is awkward and somewhat messy. Make the wand longer and thinner and this will be a perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great. I received it complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes in my Surf&#x27;s Up VoxBox, and I was excited to try it right away. I was a little skeptical that having two things to use would make any difference, but I could actually tell that it added a lot of volume! I feel like a lot of waterproof mascaras tend to be clumpy, but this did a great job of separating lashes and making them look longer and fuller without sticking together. I&#x27;ve stuck with the same mascara for years, but I will definitely be using this from now on as well!</li>
            <li> Very good! Definitely makes my lashes look big and doesnt really clump. Stays on all day. Only drawback is it is REALLY hard to remove</li>
            <li> I absolutely love COVERGIRL PRODUCTS. But was surprisingly disappointed in this mascara, I didint like the thickness of the brush itself. Found the product was heavier then most others. Color was great. Love the effects, just think if the brush was smaller an thiner it could really have a greater impact,</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to test this out because I absolutely loved this mascara. I usually do a 2 step process, so this makes it easier. I no longer have to purchase two separate kinds of mascara to get the look I want. The reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 is because of how hard it is to take off. I even used my Neutragena eye makeup remover pads and had left over residue for 3 days. However, I love the mascara so much that I will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> I received my bombshell curvaceous mascara for free in my #surfsup vox box from Influenster. I love it! It looks like I took the time to put false lashes on when I&#x27;m wearing it! I will say though, it definitely has some major staying power. Make sure to have a good make up remover for when you want to take it off!</li>
            <li> Great mascara, no smudging, no running, and totally waterproof! Just make sure you read the instructions and use an oil based remover when taking it off! Makes your eyelashes look long and thick, I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. My lashed definitely look longer when I used it compared to my other mascara. That is hard to do because I have thin lashes. I think I have found a winner with this one. The two step process is quick and easy and keeps it from clumping together. I got to try this product for free from Covergirl and Influenster. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> i loved this mascara. the first time i tried it i thought it was a two part mascara (which its not) So i ended up making my eyelashes gross. When i used it properly I really enjoyed it. :) it makes my lashes look amazing. Long or you can choose the curvy side. :) The only thing i really didnt like was side one bristles. It kinda hurt when i put it on....&lt;br /&gt;I got this item for free as a tester from influenster.com</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from @influenster as an item in my trial box.  I am not one to try different types of mascara.  In fact, I have been using the same brand mascara for as long as I can remember so I was a bit nervous to try this one, especially because it has two different sides to it and it is waterproof.  When I tried it, I could not be more impressed with how full my lashes looked!  They were bold and full of life besides what is given from my lash curler. I would recommend this mascara to anyone.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> this is a good product. needed eye make up remover to take off but came off easy! will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara, it&#x27;s not what I normally buy, but i decided to give it a try and i LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that i can get the best of 3 worlds, use one of the fabulous brushes, or use both for an EXTREME curvaceous blast of beautiful lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this mascara, I have lash confidence and I am excited to wear it all summer long!</li>
            <li> I like this product but it&#x27;s not hypoallergenic. That&#x27;s a problem for me given that my skin is super sensitive with make up. I did try it and wore the mascara for a little while. I like the double brush on this mascara. The colors very black, and it&#x27;s pretty much easy to use like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Received this product in an Influenster Vox Box, and I love it. It&#x27;s just dark enough and keeps my lashes looking long all day.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lash Blast Mascara! I used to watch ANTM only to say the Covergirl slogan. Easy, Breezy, Beautiful. Covergirl. *cue dramatic hair flip and eye wink* I love Covergirl products and Lash blast is one of my favorite mascara&#x27;s out there. This mascara had me slightly confused at first as I almost coated my hand when taking out one of the wands. But the end result was simply amazing. No clumping, lots of volume and  it even looks good through the lenses of my glasses.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster for testing purposes. I really enjoyed the step one of this mascara. It separated my lashes and left them in a great curl. But step two is way too clumpy! I immediately has spider legs for eyelashes and was dealing with a flaky formula. It is also very difficult to remove with an oil based remover. I would buy this mascara if it only had the first formula.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff for free in a review website, I like this stuff a lot. I&#x27;m picky with my mascara but this stuff didn&#x27;t disappoint. The brushes are nice it goes on nice. Stats on. Haven&#x27;t washed it off yet so I can tell you if that&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely fabulous. It doesn&#x27;t clump and is very easy to apply. It gives my eyelashes extra curve and volume without making them look fake! It&#x27;s so awesome. Thank you Influenster for the free sample!! I love being able to try a product without having to buy it and risk not liking it.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. I love the double wand. It definitely enhances the quality of your lashes when applied. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will repurchase</li>
            <li> I just got this mascara and I actually really like it! It&#x27;s the best they have done so far. I didn&#x27;t think the two steps was necessary but there actually is a huge difference when you apply both. It almost looks like you have falsies on!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this! This is now my go to mascara! It does make my lashes longer and thicker, but the only thing I dislike is how hard it is to remove.</li>
            <li> A good mascara is a necessity for every girl so getting it to try for free from Influenster is amazing. I was surprised how big the tube is but I also feel it&#x27;s a good value with the 2 different looks you can get from this product. It held up to my expectations as far as waterproof goes. I wasn&#x27;t a raccoon after getting caught in the rain, it was smooth going on and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample in my Surfs Up VoxBox from Influenster. Mascara is my one key makeup item, so I was so excited to try it. The packaging is quirky: a wand at either end. This makes the wands too short. I like more room to play. The first coat was pretty good, if a touch clumpy. I don&#x27;t understand the point of the second part. To darken and shine? Seems like an unnecessary step. And makes glop-eyes more likely. It has good staying power. Overall, pretty good, but a bit gimmicky. I&#x27;ve had better; I&#x27;ve had worse.</li>
            <li> I really was excited to receive this for testing purposes. The initial sight of the product was a big of a turn off I must say! It is a little too large and bulky for me. I also do not necessarily enjoy the two sided mascara. I like the idea though of having one wand for curling and one for amplifying the fullness. One of the major negatives of this product for me is the fact that to get off, you must use an oil based makeup remover. Other than that, I think this product is great for summer. COVERGIRL wanted to give us a product that embodied a bombshell, and I have to say I really think it lives up to its name. Just isn&#x27;t the right mascara for me!</li>
            <li> I love the first side, it is reminiscent of the lash blast mascara (my go to mascara) and works by itself for a day to day clean look. I like that the second side makes my lashes seem darker and thicker. The second side if definitely more for nights out (which I use in combination with the first).</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Influenster to try.  I liked it and found that it did what it said.  I have thin, short lashes, so I found a pronounced difference.  I did have a little bit of the clumping issue others mentioned, but I found I was able to fix it pretty quickly.  It is a very wet formula, so slow and steady is the way to go.  And let one coat dry a little before adding a second.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This mascara does what it says it will do which is make dramatic bombshell lashes but it is very heavy and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product in my Influenster box. I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot about it (good and bad) and wanted to give it a try for myself. After a mishap with a curling wand a few years ago, I have a hard time getting a good curl to my lashes. This product solves that problem. The curved wand gives my lashes a great, professional looking curl. The second coat goes on thick and seals in the color for all day wear. I wear contacts and have not had problems with flaking or sensitivity issues. I typically use an oil based remover, so I have had no problems removing this product. This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this free from influenster for review. I was not impressed. The wand was hard and was uncomfortable to apply. The formula was very clumpy and hard. I like my lashes to be soft to the touch. It was also very difficult to remove. I did enjoy the way my lashes looked, but the feeling was too uncomfortable to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I received this from influenster and I enjoyed trying out I was excited for a new mascara I liked it but I didn&#x27;t love it it did last long and helped my lashes look voluminous and it is waterproof</li>
            <li> this is a great mascara it made my lashes longer thicker and curled them wirhout a lash curler and the top coat made them even longer and waterproof but it came off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenter for test purposes. I like the product, it can be kind of sticky and can also be hard to get off. But they do make my eye lashes look pretty.</li>
            <li> This mascara is one of the best kinds I have ever tried! It makes my lashes long, and it doesn&#x27;t clump at all! I love it. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends. I like the two different brushes. Very different than anything else that is on the market.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea behind this mascara. First step to volumize lift and curl, second step to amplify and intensify lashes as well as to seal the mascara to keep it on all day long! This mascara definitely does not budge; no smudging, no smearing, no fall off. It&#x27;s great if you are looking for an all day wear. I really like the step one brush, it really gets between each lash to amplify and separate. But because this mascara is supposed to last all day long it almost acts like a waterproof mascara, it&#x27;s very hard to remove. You definitely need a makeup remover because water will just not take it off. Overall, this mascara is a great long wearing lengthening mascara!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. I got it today as a complimentary test product from Influenster and I fell instantly in love. For me, it seems the curved side really adds length and the regular side adds volume. I love how each brush can be used separately or together for added drama. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of 2 step mascaras that claim to add volume but this one is it. The price is reasonable and the mascara is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> So, when appled correctly it makes my lashes look fantastic! I like that it stays on really well but it is a pain to get off. I use coconut oil to get it off and it does really well but it&#x27;s still tedious because I don&#x27;t usually wear waterproof.</li>
            <li> I heard of this product through Influensters , so I decided to go out and  purchase it for myself . At first I was kind of skeptical because most of the reviews weren&#x27;t so hot , but then I tried it for myself and if you apply it lightly it actually is really amazing and there will be no clumps. The only down fall to this , besides apply to much and clumps appearing , would have to be how long it takes to take the product off. Other than that , it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Cover Girl’s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara, but after just a few swipes it may find a permanent place in makeup collection. The first brush separated and curled my lashes while the second brush layered on the mascara and lengthened my lashes. I had some clumping when applying the second coat. Overall the product truly made my eyes pop, but I think I find myself only using this mascara when going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary through Influenster and I usually don&#x27;t like drug store mascara but this one is pretty amazing. It isn&#x27;t clumpy and it makes your lashes look long and defined. It stays on all night and doesn&#x27;t flake off like most mascaras. The only thing about this mascara is that you need oil based makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl bombshell curvaceous mascara in my Influenster VoxBox for testing and review. I used it this morning, and I have to say that it&#x27;s just alright. The first brush didn&#x27;t do much, and then the second brush added a little more, but I honestly get better lashes with my telescopic mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this being a difficult makeup to take off, but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet. I don&#x27;t think it will be that bad, since it&#x27;s not a thick mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara for the price. I love it! I would use&lt;br /&gt;it before a lot of the more expensive brands like&lt;br /&gt;m.a.c. It&#x27;s about the same and a lot cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the waterproof if you&#x27;re like me and&lt;br /&gt;rub your eyes a lot.</li>
            <li> i received this complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I love this masacra it is the only one I have used that actually makes my lashes look like they are fake lashes makes them look big and full. It does not clump and makes them curl up on there own . and I love the more natural curve in the brush love love love it!!</li>
            <li> When I tell you guys this is amazing... MY god! Side 1 pushed my lashes up. It looked as if I had tightlined my water line.... Then side 2 added the... Umph that I needed. I haven&#x27;t needed to put on falsies in a while! Yes... Its quite chunky(packing wise) but its all worth it. The only downside is that side 2 isn&#x27;t small enough for my bottom lashes and I somehow get it everywhere.</li>
            <li> This product does add a lot of volume, separates lashes, but it makes your top lashes stick to your bottom lashes (very sticky). It is also really hard to get off -- even when using eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I will agree, it is hard to remove UNLESS you use makeup remover. Once you do, it comes off very easily. Personally, I don&#x27;t like my make up easy to remove. I want it to last all through the day. It makes my eyelashes look much longer. It can become clumpy, however ALL mascara does this, and if you just apply a thin layer, it seems to work out well.</li>
            <li> I get tired of having mascara clump up or not make my eye lashes look fuller. FINALLY Covergirl has made it all possible with their new Bombshell. This is now my go to mascara hands down.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product I would purchase. I received from Influenster to sample and review. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it was the fact that it is much like a waterproof mascara and does require the use of an oil makeup remover. Other than that I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like many others on here, I received a free sample of this mascara through Influenster for review purposes. The color I received is Very Black. Usually I go for a black-brown shade. I love and hate this mascara. What I love is that it really does make my lashes look fuller and curled, even without using the curler. It looks like I have a lot fuller lashes than I really do. However, I do agree with many others that the clumping is an issue. I think that all 2 part mascaras should come with directions and of course this one did not. I had to play around with it a bit to figure out the best way to put it on and avoid spider eyes. The key for me was to make sure that I didn&#x27;t leave any time at all to let step 1 dry before applying step 2. I also had best results with scraping off a lot of the mascara from the second wand since it was so heavily coated, being brand new and all. Trying to separate clumped lashed was next to impossible, even with a toothpick. Additionally, I put the stuff on well over an hour ago and still feel like my lashes are occasionally sticking together when I blink. I did end up with a result I am satisfied with and I will continue to use it but I can&#x27;t see myself buying more to replace it once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely adds volume to my lashes. As long as you don&#x27;t mind removing it with makeup remover you will like this mascara.  To me is the only downfall since I normally don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara, but this is great for &amp;#34;girls night out getting all dressed up&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster for testing and review purposes. This mascara really lasts. It&#x27;s waterproof so it definitely stays put, but this means that it&#x27;s pretty tough to get off. I think that it is still worth it. It makes my lashes look longer and fuller. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants full looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Has totally blown me away this time. Mascara with no clumps!! And amazingly long lashes. The other upside is that this mascara is only $10 tops. I will definitely be using this mascara again &amp; I&#x27;m so glad Influenster gave me the opportunity to test it out for them, for free! I have also seen this in many drugstores so it will not be hard to find. Definitely on my makeup wishlist.</li>
            <li> I recently received this from Influenster for a product review. I was not impressed with it. After putting on the first coat, my eyelashes stuck together. I will no longer use this product</li>
            <li> My review for this produce was fantastic .&lt;br /&gt;First time using a mascara n I think I fell in love :))</li>
            <li> This mascara works great for me. The two wands is a really neat idea, especially with two different formulas. My eyelashes are already very long, so this makes them look really full without making them clumpy, even with multiple coats from two wands. The only bad thing is that it is very hard to get off. It&#x27;s similar to a waterproof mascara, and if you try too hard to rub it off, I&#x27;ve read many reviews of where people have lost their eyelashes. So just be careful when removing it.</li>
            <li> Received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster (love these guys and COVERGIRL for participating!) in my SurfsUpVoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a make-up guru and need all the help I can get when it comes to make-up tools and tips.  I found that the wand was very awkward to use when applying.  I like to be able to rest the back of the want on the palm of my hand, almost like a pencil (right or wrong - it works for me), and with how bulky-wide  and long the wand is it&#x27;s not possible.  HOWEVER -- the difference between with and without is killer!  When I apply my mascara I use now I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but wow!  I definitely feel like a bombshell in this mascara!</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Received it in my vox box from influenster and it was awesome made my lashes long long and perfect!! When it was all done was easy to clean away no mess!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I received this as a free sample from Influenster.com for testing purposes, and I will definitely buy it again. I&#x27;m a fan of big eyelashes and this dual wand brush delivers the big look.</li>
            <li> I got this in my voxbox as well . I was a little sceptical about it becuase im really particular about mascara. But I loved it it made my lashes look like falsies I was really impressed.  I was a little confused about step two tho I didn&#x27;t think it made a difference it just seems like a dry brush to comb your lashes to give them more separation ....</li>
            <li> This mascara is great, doesn&#x27;t clump, and makes eyelashes look longer!  Definitely something I will continue using.  Was given this free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster. I felt like it really did curl my lashes and make them look fuller, longer and darker. The container is a much larger diameter than the normal mascara, and I found that it was hard to put on because of the size of the handle. I&#x27;m sure with a little getting used to, I could manage to put it on my lashes instead of my eyelids and nose. I had to use makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> So I received a voxbox from Influenster and got to try a sample of Covergirl Bombshell for free! I liked how it made my eyes look, very dramatic, would be lovely for a night out or if I was planning to be around water. However, this stuff is TOUGH to get off by itself without makeup remover. I would love it if I were going to the beach, but I&#x27;m not one for using waterproof every day. I will use this when I go on vacation and for the bachelorette party I will be attending next week though :)</li>
            <li> I got this mascara to try in a Voxbox from Influenster and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d stack up against my high end brand mascaras but I was not disappointed! Bold, clump free, sky high lashes, I was even asked if I was wearing falsies the first time I wore it!  Definitely will be purchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster to test and review. Already being a fan of CoverGirl mascara, I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it to the test! I applied two coats and was very pleased. It did everything it promised. My lashes had volume, length and added curl. The shade of black is dark and bold and it provides great, even coverage. I personally prefer my lashes to have separation and definition, so I always use a lash brush after applying mascara. The brush glided through with no problems or flaking. If I had to list any cons it&#x27;d be that it is a little hard to remove. More like a waterproof mascara. The up side is that it is super long lasting. All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> After receiving this complimentary mascara (for testing purposes) from Influenster , here is my review!!&lt;br /&gt;Great mascara!!! Give full eyelashes that last all day.&lt;br /&gt;One downside is removing this mascara. I feel like I have to almost pull my eyelashes out to remove it!</li>
            <li> I received  this item free from Influenster to test and I absolutely love it. The first step makes your lashes extra long! And the second step gives your lashes incredible volume. I also love the curve of the first brush, it makes it easier to apply the mascara and really lifts lashes up.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of the Influenster VoxBox, and while I was totally stoked that this was a full size freebie - when I tried it on, I wasn&#x27;t so happy.  It was a giant pain in the butt to put on - the wand is too short and the mascara was VERY clumpy.  Then, when I went to take it off - it was so difficult to get off!  I guess some of the other reviewers noted this as well.  Overall, I will not use this one again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it works wonderfully. The two wand system is easy to use. I have been given so many compliments since using this product it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Influencer. This is a great product. I use it every day now.</li>
            <li> This two-step mascara claims that step one will add loads of volume, thickens, and curls lashes. The second step is a dark, intensifying topcoat that gives bold, noticeable lashes. I like this mascara but find that I only need step one to get great coverage, curl, and color.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara! It&#x27;s super waterproof, which I love and it doesn&#x27;t flake off like many other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. I really liked the two wands, though I wish the handles were longer!</li>
            <li> This mascara really carries the curves! The first step lengthens and curves your lashes and the second top coat intensifies and sets the mascara! It really lasts all day too! You need a make up remover to get it off, but it isn&#x27;t something I mind at all considering how long it stays on. If you don&#x27;t want it as intense you can always just use one side as well! I have used many different kinds of mascaras and this one holds its own against even more expensive ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara free from Influenster to try and review.  In general I don&#x27;t like a lot of mascara because my eyes are very sensitive.  While the product went on easily and made my eyes look very pretty, my eyes are currently itching like crazy!  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes I think this would be great for you but if you do watch out.  I have not tried to remove it yet but I have heard it is a bit challenging to remove.  I did like the brushes and the size but I will not be buying this.</li>
            <li> I recalling enjoyed trying out this product courtesy of influenster. I like how much fuller they looked and it was easy to use. The curved brush was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer of using 2 different types of mascara at a time to get the best outcome. This product allows you to do that without carrying around as many products. I received this mascara complimentary from influenster for testing and I love it! It is a great solid black, and stays. I am even wearing it into the next day right now. (it is waterproof so it has staying power, it is just a little rough to come off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a length formula and a volume formula and they do just that. I think the trick is really in the 2 different application brushes. I will definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster.  It was given to me to try and out and review, and I was skeptical at first.  There are 2 steps to this mascara application.  After the first step, I thought for sure I was going to hate it.  Usually when there is a 2 step mascara you end up with clumpy results after the second step.  NOT SO!  When applied normally, my lashes look thicker and longer, and they did not clump!  I didn&#x27;t have top lashes sticking to bottom lashes.  They totally made my eyes pop!  I will definitely be sticking this in my make-up go-to bag!</li>
            <li> This mascara worked great!  My only complaint was that it would have been nice if the brush length was longer.  I&#x27;m normally one to say, why make it two steps?  It wastes my time, but this was worth it.  The first day I used it I asked my husband if he could tell something different about my make up and he said, &amp;#34;your eyelashes aren&#x27;t as clumpy...and look longer&amp;#34; and his normal response would have been, &amp;#34;am I supposed to notice something different&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s saying something.  A great product!</li>
            <li> I love it and think its great but as a person who has to wear glasses its not fun. It lengthened my eyelashes to the point that they kept hitting my glasses and left mascara marks all over!! If I didn&#x27;t have glasses though I would definitely wear it!</li>
            <li> I got this mascara complimentary from Influenster to review, and I&#x27;m glad to have received it. It&#x27;s a great mascara for lengthening and volume. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and have not after long wear (which is great as I am sensitive by the end of the day). It doesn&#x27;t smudge, budge, or crumble either. The curl isn&#x27;t as great as it can be, but I think if you have thinner lashes than myself it&#x27;ll work well. I&#x27;d recommend a curler prior to application because this mascara will keep them curled (feels durable when I felt them dry on my lashes). The volume is a nice, casual amount, not crazy night time. The liquid seems build able, though it would wait for it to dry before trying a second coat. The wand is actually a little weird since the tube is pretty thick and the wand is short, but not tedious. Overall, I recommend this for just enough oomph to get a way with day or night.</li>
            <li> May be the complimentary genies swiper not swiping.. swipered by lash-blast mascara in my Vox Box  via Influenster .com because I did not get my free sample of the lash blast in my SurfsUpVoxBox.  But lucky for me I am a product junkie and I do have some lash-blast mascara Black .  The cool think is I can still give my opinion about the product .  You get to test cool products and give your honest opinion about them . How cool is that ?The number one and obvious one is the curvature of the brush works well for me I find the straight brushes always inevitably cause me to clump my mascara because I miss the small short lashes.  The Lash-blast solves that issue by design.  The mascara itself is pretty reasonable.  I  am not an avid mascara user but when I do for special occasions I put the mascara on and people always notice  and say they make your eyes pop Pow.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mascara! It really did lift and define my lashes while making them look voluminous. Though it was a pain to take off! I had to make due with the makeup remover that I had and it took a while to get this off. On the plus side, I wore it to the beach and it did not smudge at all. That was the first time I had a mascara stay on at the beach! I was really disappointed that this mascara wasn&#x27;t in my VoxBox, so I purchased my own. Glad that I did!</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara after receiving it from Influenster for testing completely free. I was pleasantly surprised by this mascara! I have sensitive skin and allergies. I typically only wear mascara on a day-to-day basis because my eyelashes are so light. I do not really wear any other makeup regularly. I actually ended up liking this mascara more than my previous one! I like that you can build it up as little or much as you want, it separates your eyelashes with very little clumping, and even with watery eyes like mine I did not end up with any smudges under my eyes by the end of my 9-hour workdays. I have now been using this mascara for about two weeks and am happy with the results. The only issues I have are: my eyes are still pretty watery, but this mascara does not advertise itself to be hypoallergenic. It is also very difficult to wash off. I have makeup wipes and liquid face wash and neither seems to remove all the mascara in just one wash. It seems to take about three tries to remove it all. That is even when I don&#x27;t build the mascara up much. This is both a good thing (in that it doesn&#x27;t come off throughout the day) and a bad thing (it won&#x27;t come off even when I want it to).</li>
            <li> I received the Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara from influenster for testing purposes.There is 2 Steps to this mascara 1 to volumize and curl 2 to intensify,easy to apply does not clump and the leaves your lashes looking beautiful curled. The tube is rather big but i guess that will make for easy finding in your purse.Downfall to it was that it was difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It makes my lashes stand out and stays clump-free for the most part. I&#x27;ve used better mascaras, but I do rank this top 3. It really separates the lashes and makes your eyes look bright and open. Price is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Influenster. Honestly, it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; mascara. I like it and will use it until its gone, but I don&#x27;t feel its worth the money they charge for it. I am short on time in the morning as it is, why buy a product you have to apply twice. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love cover girl bombshell mascara really makes your eye lashes look full and fabulous all day long</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara, It seperates and give lots of volume! The only complaint I have is the packaging is a bit bulky! It stays on for a very long time</li>
            <li> I got this mascara free with Influenster...I usually don&#x27;t wear mascara much except for Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash mascara once in a while for church or when I go out with my husband. I don&#x27;t like to wear mascara because I don&#x27;t like the way it smears if you cry but not this mascara. I love the fact that this mascara is waterproof.. You will need to take it off with makeup remover... The two wands were a bit tricky since I am used to only one wand but other than that I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my eyelashes look, and like another reviewer stated, when they say water proof they MEAN it! I have an oil based makeup remover and still have trouble getting it completely off. That being said, I would definitely wear this to the beach or pool, but probably not every day since it is hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I received my covergirl bobmbshell curvaceous waterproof mascara complimentary for testing purposes from influenster.</li>
            <li> I love it. It adds great volume to my lashes. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up.  Most just Mascara. And I love this. Received  it for product testing via Influenster  and I use it every day. Must buy.</li>
            <li> Love the way it gives volume to my eyelashes i am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I received this for testing purposes from Influenster. Overall a good product. Have enjoyed using it and the way it makes my lashes look. Didn&#x27;t get 5 stars because of how big and bulky it is.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as what I expected from CG the #2 made it weird and clumpy if you added too much!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free through influenster. I like how well it stays, but it went on super thick and clumpy, so it took a lot of time for me to get it looking good. once I did though it looked great!</li>
            <li> This is a truly great mascara.  I have tried many department store and drugstore mascaras for my short blond lashes.  This one really thickens and lengthens much more than a typical waterproof mascara.  Yet, it is very durable.  I love it!  It was sent to me as a complimentary review sample from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received a this mascara free as a part of a Voxbox from Influenter. I really like how it makes my lashes look so long and full. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that  it takes a little extra effort to get it off.</li>
            <li> I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara free from Influenster for review.  I really liked this mascara.  You definitely can see a big difference from no mascara, to the Step 1, and then to the Step 2.  It made my eyelashes look longer and darker.  I would definitely buy it again.  The reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was because while I did like the mascara, I don&#x27;t think it went above and beyond my expectations.  It did a great job, but didn&#x27;t do anything amazing to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this out like many others with Influenster and while I wasn&#x27;t wowed by it, it still actually did a goo job of pumping up and filling in my eyelashes. I have been using Mary Kay mascara for a few years now and I really like how it defines my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t clump them. This one did that with side 1 and side 2 just kind of pumped up the volume a bit. I liked it but it just seemed like a hassle to use two sides.</li>
            <li> I like this, never got this but after i get... work a lot for me... thanks</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in a voxbox for testing purposes from influenster. I was really excited because I had heard great things, and have yet to find an amazing mascara for my eyes, I was sslightly impressed but not blown away by it. It is one of the first mascaras that made my eye lashes look a little fuller, but not the bombshell look as promised.</li>
            <li> I got this from influenster and I really like how it makes my eyelashes look, but it is super hard to get off. It&#x27;s nice if youre going out and don&#x27;t want it to come off but kind of annoying for daily</li>
            <li> Receive this product totally free for testing purposes from Influenster. I really enjoy this product! I like the 2 sides combo.</li>
            <li> I received this from #influenster in their #surfsupvoxbox! I found it to work really well. but it is very hard to remove. I will use it more to see if i will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> It made my lashes look so big! It was a pain to take off though....</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my lashes look longer and fuller . I would most definitely recommend this product to every girl. So far best masscera I have ever gotten !</li>
            <li> I received this mascara to review as part of my influenster VoxBox! I love it! The first brush helps to put mascara on each lash and the second makes them fuller! Will be buying it after this one runs out for sure!!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product from influenster and I really like it. It makes my lashes stand out and appear fuller. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it the brush.. It doesn&#x27;t really separate the hair that well. Other than that this is a great product by COVERGIRL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a mascara snob. Influenster gave me this and honestly for a drugstore brand, it&#x27;s works pretty well! My light lashes are darkened nicely and seem longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Thanks to @influenster I recieved a covergirl Bombshell mascarra in their #voxbox to try out, I’m More than grateful for the opportunity to try out new products. But in my honest option this mascara wasn’t one of my favorites. It honestly didn’t do much to my eyelashes. I personally think that this mascara might work for people who already have really long and pretty eyelashes which (very sadly) isn’t me. I’m not gonna be completely harsh on this mascara because I did love it when I would pair it with falsies or if I would use another mascara with it, which is something I always do anyways (I’m still in the hunt for the one I can use on its own) so I mean its ok. I give it a solid 7 out of 10.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING mascara. It makes my lashes look 100% fuller and longer. It stays put no matter what is going on in my day. No smudging or moving. Plus it keeps my lashes curled all day too (which is good for this girl with straight lashes). Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> I just tried this and I love it, there is no mascara like it that creates lashes that stand out. Don&#x27;t waste your time anymore with anything else, this is the best, it creates full lashes, I love it.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a decent mascara. It is definitely going to stay put! I dont care for the fact that it takes an oil based makeup remover to remove and the tube is a little bulky for my taste.  But not a bad product!</li>
            <li> If you want full beautiful eye lashes then this is the mascara for you!! I absolutely LOVE the way it makes my eyelashes look. Definitely a must buy!!</li>
            <li> This mascara was definitely better than I expected. I like that the primer is black, so applying step two is not as difficult. The second step really adds length and separates the lashes. If you like clumpy type volume, this mascara is not for you. I actually do not like the clumpy look, so I love this mascara! Definitely wearable to the office every day.</li>
            <li> I received my Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox and I was glad I got it. Ever since I saw a review on how great it was from a YouTuber (BargainPrincess) I wanted this mascara! Overall I like the mascara, it really defines and separates, but I did not see as much volume than my normal length. I took before and after pictures and I could see the different in length. It applied well to the upper lashes, but got a little messy on the lower lashes. It also was difficult to remove. I used soap and water, then makeup remover, and it still took some scrubbing before it was all gone. But overall I like the mascara for the definition I get from it. My lashes are short and clumpy, so to add a little dimension with a lot of definition and separation, I will take that in a mascara.</li>
            <li> Covergirl bombshell mascara is the bomb, no pun intended. I really love the way it highlights your natural lashes and enhances your beauty. It doesn’t clump, and seems to effortlessly glide over your lashes to create a gorgeous look. I am planning on switching mascara brands now, and am loving the way I look with this mascara!</li>
            <li> This mascara works well, but my biggest complaint was the chunky packaging. The overall size of the tube is too wide and I found it hard to really get in close to my lashes to apply. the wands are short and stubby. I&#x27;d buy again if they changed their packaging to something a little more application-friendly and sleek.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I was given this mascara by Influenster for testing purposes and I love it! I am a mascara snob! This definitely beats a lot of high end mascaras that I have tried in the past! I don&#x27;t think I would have tried it otherwise but now I cannot stop raving about it! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> the product did produce a nice lash, but at the cost of ripping my eyelashes out to remove it. It is waterproof and needs to be removed with a waterproof remover pads. these are very greasy leaving behind a film around my eyes. I needed to go over and over before getting it all off. then the greasy film effected my eyes. everything was blurry for the next several hours. my lashes too a toll because of the harsh removal method needed.</li>
            <li> I recently received this mascara complimentary form Influenser for reviewing purposes. I am always curious about new mascaras because of my pretty pitiful lashes. This mascara claims to curve, volumize, and define your lashes with their new two part system.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is a good deal larger than your normal mascara and has two wands attached to the center part and two reservoirs of mascara. The 1 side features a curved wand with short plastic bristles. This side is good at separating the lashes. The 2 side is made of the traditional nylon bristles, but it has a unique tapered cone shape that is able to reach all of the lashes and thicken and darken them.&lt;br /&gt;I find the formula to be very dark and of a good viscosity. I find this mascara is great at darkening and thickening my lashes. Unfortunately this doesn’t do much to curl my lashes. I curled them first with an eyelash curler but they quickly fell back down after I applied my first coat of mascara. I think it is maybe too thick and heavy for my delicate lashes. I also find applying the mascara to be a bit awkward due to the large size if the tube and the shortness of the wands.  This didn’t flake or smudge at all during the day. This stuff really stays on! The only way to remove it is with an eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> I was sent this mascara complimentary from Influenster! Must say it was very easy to apply, made my lashes larger and more volume and just easy to use! Bravo Cover Girl! This is a great product!!</li>
            <li> It works great! I really like the double end of it. It is easy to apply and makes your eyes a pop! I got it from Influester!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I love it!! My lashes have never looked better. I&#x27;ve never experimented with two different layers of mascara and now I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> i had a chance to try this mascara for free. this is by far the best. this alone has given me more compliments on my eyes and eyelashes than anything else. more than once I have been asked if my eyelashes were real or not. thank you Covergirl)&lt;br /&gt;the color is very rich. when I apply it, it coats every strand with its dark, beautiful goop that makes my eyelashes look sexy, long, and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have never had an issue with clumping or my eyelashes looking like they have fused into two pointy lashes. we all know that when applying mascara, you have to wiggle it all the way through to avoid clumps. with this mascara, 1-2 coats is enough because with the first coat, it gets the job done. want even fuller darker lashes? do a second coat BUT don&#x27;t forget to wiggle the brush and to not wait too long in between coats.&lt;br /&gt;it does not wear off throughout the day, does not smear, and even stayed put through a very vigorous workout in a non air conditioned place. i would definetly recommend this mascara to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for a drug store priced mascara. A lot of reviewers were saying it was too hard to get off? I didn&#x27;t have this problem, I remove my eye make up with organic coconut oil and it came right off. It&#x27;s good but I feel like it&#x27;s a lot of coats and work to get to a good look</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes appear longer. My only complaint is it is sticky. The color I got was very black. It was true to color.</li>
            <li> I received this Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous mascara from INFLUENSTER to review and I am blown away. This mascara instantly gave my lashes volume, it also made them look thicker. I didn&#x27;t need to use my eye lash curler after applying this mascara because it created long-lasting curl. Buy this mascara it is amazing.. cannot say enough good things! you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I received Bombshell mascara from influenster surfs up vox box! I have used it a few times and am pretty happy with it.  It I&#x27;d a little hard to take off though</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.  I received the color very black. I liked this mascara! I used the first side then the second but I think if you just used one you really could not tell the different. What is nice is you could use one side wait until it&#x27;s empty and then use the second side. This would be better use for your brush.</li>
            <li> I received a full size version of this mascara from Influenster.com for testing purposes. The first thing is that this mascara is so awkward to hold!! It&#x27;s pretty big around and hard to get a comfortable grip on so it was not the easiest to work with. Then of course there are 2 sides-side 1 is supposed to curl and voluminous and side 2 is for intensity. I didn&#x27;t think it curled or made my lashes look any thicker than my normal mascara,  but I do feel like the black was more intense so that was nice. Once I got it on, it seemed stick and/or wet for a longer than normal amount of time, but when it did dry, it didn&#x27;t move! It stayed on perfect until I used an oil based makeup remover. Awesome! Overall, I would not buy this mascara. While the deep black color and staying power are positives, it is just too clunky to use! Plus, I do not like the 2 step process. Mascara is my absolute must when venturing out and I like to just swipe it on and go if needed. No fuss. And this product does not fall into that category.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a free sample and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  I like the idea of the two wands, but they are both short and just don&#x27;t feel very intuitive.  My lashes are big and amazing, but I get more smears than I normally would.  It is a true stay-put formula.  It&#x27;s all I can do it get it off!  :)  Typically, I buy make-up counter mascara, because I like the higher quality I usually get.  The quality of the mascara itself is wonderful, but I don&#x27;t love the packaging.  If the two wands were a little longer, it would be a good contender with the type of mascara I usually buy.  However, as is, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it on my own.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes look amazing! I have very small lashes and have been looking for a mascara that makes them stand out. This mascara was able to do that..it made them look thick and fuller. I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I received bombshell mascara complimentary from influenster.com and I love it! Put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day! I definitely will buy this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this after a mention in a #influenstervoxbox. It is awful. My lashes stuck to my eyelids. Its sticky, clumpy, and a nightmare to get off. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even slightly look like what they advertise it will.</li>
            <li> This is an overall good product it is kind of big to hold in your hand however, it is a easy applicable would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the CoverGirl Bombshell Curvaceous mascara in a VoxBox provided Influenster.com. Great volume . Great black color.  I don&#x27;t usually care for waterproof, too hard to remove, but this great mascara!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara last night compliments of Influenster completely free! I put this on this morning and my oh my... my lashes are looking awesome! No clumping, or that &amp;#34;stuck together&amp;#34; look. They seriously look like I had lash implants. Made my whole day a little better... a total MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> I found this mascara easy to use.  It makes my lashes look long and full.  I received this complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I always buy CoverGirl mascara products, so I was thrilled when I received the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster to test. It is very easy to use and does give your eyelashes a fuller look. Only problem I have with this product is that it is hard to take off. But on the bright side of that, the mascara stays on very well throughout the day! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara, however it was hard to remove even with waterproof makeup remover.  I don&#x27;t believe it was marketed as a waterproof mascara, but other than that it&#x27;s a very nice mascara.  I received this mascara for testing purposes from Influenster.com</li>
            <li> I received my cover girl bombshell curvaceous by lash blast mascara complimentary from influencer for testing purposes. Since I have received this mascara, I have used it every day and I absolutely love it. It gets all of my lashes unlike previous mascaras that I have tried. Id recommend this product to anyone looking for some new mascara.</li>
            <li> I love Cover Girl mascara products, so when I received the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster to try I was excited. It does give your eyelashes a more longer voluminous look. The product is hard to take off but with a good oil based makeup remover it should come off. But because of that you don&#x27;t have to worry about your mascara flaking throughout the day! I I would recommend this to family/friends.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara! Needed a replacement for my old discontinued brand, and this worked perfect!! I received the product complimentary from Influenster for testing, but I have added it to my shopping list so I can have backups! I was very impressed with the coverage I got and I feel like it made my eye lashes look much longer and fuller. That&#x27;s hard to find for me, as I have tried multiple mascaras and I feel like I have nothing on after application. Would recommend this to anyone looking for more coverage and the appearance of longer eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I received the CoverGirl Bombshell Mascara complimentary from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox for testing purposes. This mascara definitely volumized my lashes and made them look fuller. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t come off as easy as they say. It took me a couple of tries to get it off but as far as making your lashes look great, it definitely does that.</li>
            <li> I received my COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous from @Influenster completely free for testing and review purposes. I love the fact that it is waterproof because I can look great without smudging when at the beach or pool with my summer camp kids! I love that my #SurfsUpVoxBox came with this product. I do wish the wands were a little longer because it is a little tricky to get in tight spots around the corners of my eyes. Other than that it is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I got the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara in my Influenster voxbox for testing purposes. I heard a lot of hypes going on this mascara, needless to say I was pumped to try it out! First thing first, I have sad Asian girl lashes that are not only short, but stick straight. I have given up on mascara just because I never see any difference and after a few hours it would smudge everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s look at the pros. First, this mascara, I would say, is very much waterproof. I see people complaining about it, but, honestly, you should expect (and hope) that your mascara doesn&#x27;t move! It would take me a while to take everything off, but that&#x27;s perfectly fine for me. Second. I do see volume and length that this mascara gives. It looks like I have false lashes on, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the cons. The wands are really short so that it&#x27;s very hard to get to the right angle and you risk smearing mascara on your face. Also, this mascara makes my lashes spidery and it does clump up quite a bit. The packaging is chunky and therefore not very travel-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I probably would choose this mascara for special occasions when I want that amped up look. Good job Covergirl!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product through a complimentary testing service called Influentser, and it was by far the best thing I recieved. Orginally, I was skeptical of the multi-layer function of this mascara, but after using the ends one after another like suggested, my results were amazing! I actually had someone ask me if I was wearing false eyelashes because this mascara made my lashes look THAT LONG and FULL. I will definitely be purchasing more of this once I run out!</li>
            <li> Received this prouduct free for testing through Influenster and totally love it. It plumps the lashes way better then the other mascaras out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few other brands/types of mascara but out of the ones I&#x27;ve used this one doesn&#x27;t stand out. I have very straight lashes that rarely There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product at all, I plan on continuing to use it. It just doesn&#x27;t stand out in any special way to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> From the first moment I put on this mascara I knew I was going to love it!  The way it went on my lashes I knew it was going to be a good waterproof mascara.  I love the two ends of the wand.  It will take some getting use to with the way they pop out at the ends, I felt like I was holding it wrong and it became awkward.  The mascara didn’t clump when I put it on – it went on smoothly.  I love the curve brush on one end and the straight brush on the other and how the 2nd one coats and makes it stick – waterproofing.  My eye lashes look longer, fuller and bombshellish!  I love this product!  **Note:  I received this sample of Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by LashBlast Mascara for free /complimentary from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I really like Covergirl&#x27;s Bombshell mascara!! It extended my lashes and definitely stays put all day! You must use an oil based eye makeup remover like it says, or else it will not come off entirely. The only criticism I have is that the wands are very short, which makes it hard to apply without smudging and needing to touch-up. Overall, the product works great!</li>
            <li> I recieved a complementary product from Influenster in my surf&#x27;s up VoxBox. I have long thick lashes as it is. I felt that this product just made my lashes clumpy and sticky. I don&#x27;t like the two brushes thing, I feel like one is sufficient. I personally only use one end or the other.</li>
            <li> I recieved this mascara for testing purposes from Influenster. It really stays put! Just came inside after walking to work in a downpour, and my lashes still look fabulous! I like the two different brushes, very quick and easy to use once you get used to the tube, which is pretty bulky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t come across a lot of mascaras that really impress me, but this one definitely does. The curled wand in step 1, curls your lashes and adds length; step two also adds volume - basically everything I want in a mascara! It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy either. Great product! :)</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara! I am so picky, but this mascara is not clumpy and lasts all day. At first I was annoyed that there were two steps to put it on, but now I am willing to do it because the mascara is so great!</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Influenster recently and thought I&#x27;d love the second side because it had a fibery brush versus the first side, which was the plasticy, curved brush. I was surprised that I actually adored the first side. It was a lovely everyday type of mascara. It was nice for defining, but not quite spectacular. The second side ended up being sort of clumpy and goopy. I wasn&#x27;t a fan. There is a lot of product, double that of many other mascaras, but that led to a bulky product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary from my #SurfsUpVoxBox Via #Influenster . I don&#x27;t wear mascara often but that may change.. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of how the 2nd application went on but I managed. I&#x27;m still a huge fan of this product. The one thing I would change is the bulkiness. I def can&#x27;t carry it around in my makeup bag in my purse!</li>
            <li> Love the dual sides! If I need an everyday look I&#x27;ll just use #1, if I want some more flare I&#x27;ll use both :) Stays on long, and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> Covergirl has met my expectations once again. This is mascara is amazing and makes my lashes full and long. Makes my eyes pop and stand out, i def. recommend trying this mascara if you haven&#x27;t already!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I don&#x27;t typically wear eye makeup but whenever I do, I always make sure to put on my&lt;br /&gt;Bombshell curvaceous. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is sometimes when I use it, it&#x27;ll clump a bit and requires a little more time to fix.</li>
            <li> I got this from influenster for testing purposes. I&#x27;m a huge mascara addict! If I&#x27;m running late to work I AT LEAST make sure to put on mascara. That said, I keep several tubes at one time trying to find &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; one. Curvaceous is great because it is just perfect for my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; days. I&#x27;m sure if I played with it and did several layers then it&#x27;d be good for a dressy full face, but I love that it gives just enough curve on one swipe to get the job done. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster from their Surfs Up Vox Box. I have been a Maybelline mascara for years and this didn&#x27;t really change my mind. The dark color was nice but it made my eyelashes look a little spidery and it flaked off throughout the day. It was super easy to take off though.</li>
            <li> This mascara not only creates long and thick lashes, but you can guarantee it to stay on all day. In fact, it&#x27;s hard to get off. I don&#x27;t mind that fact though especially because it can last multiple days which means I can go without having to apply new mascara. Yes, I am one of those people :) Busy life calls for desperate measures. Great product and very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great new mascara I usually only get cover girl brand and most of them are good but this work works great!</li>
            <li> I was given this product from Influenster for purposes of reviewing.  I was a little on the scared side to try this from all the eyelash losing horror stories I have read about this product.  But I put it on my lashes anyway.  Let me tell you, this mascara has definitely bombshelled its way into my Top 3!  It makes my lashes look fuller and longer, and I already have long lashes.  I dont have any problem in taking this mascara off.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my new favorite.I love it.It applies on easy.And my eyelashes look fabulous amazing.Love it! I have recommended this to my friend&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvacous free in my voxbox from influenster for testing purposes. Overall the mascara works really well it gives nice plump lashes that really show up. The only thing that is a little hard for me to get used to is that the handle is a little bit shorter to grasp than what I am used to. The the product as a whole is great . Just make sure you have a good eye make up remover because it a little bit more water resistant.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara!  It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and it dries pretty quickly between the first and second coat.  It is perfect for a more intense eye, or for a simple day look.  It also hold up well against water so you can wear it to the beach or wherever.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and very worth it.  I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that this acts as a waterproof mascara and does not easily come off with just soap and water.  Invest in an oil-mased makeup remover if you are going to purchase this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to be for review from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday when it was 95 degrees out. It was too hot to wear any other makeup but my eyelashes looked fantastic. It stayed looking great all day. When I showered, it did give me a teeny bit of raccoon eyes but it came off extremely easily with a swipe of makeup remover. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara Very Black complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes. @Influenster @CoverGirl #bombshelling</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this mascara that I received from Influenster for testing purposes. It provides quite a bit of volume without being clumpy. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that because of the design the wands are short and I find it hard to apply on some areas and have to keep readjusting my hand.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. I have been a die-hard Lancome user for many years but this mascara works just as good! I have not been able to find a drug store brand that has compared and I finally have. Would recommend it to anyone looking for beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I received this in an Influenster VoxBox for testing and review purposes. I was very pleased with the product. It adds volume to my lashes and stays on through out the day. I didn&#x27;t have any issues or complaints.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara if you can even imagine for free from Influenster, for testing purposes and I am pleased to say that I&#x27;m so happy that I was one of the lucky ones who got it. It goes on easily and stays put all day, for lush, beautiful bombshell lashes. I know personally waterproof scares me a bit, but not this one. It came off really gently and easy with my oilbased makeup remover.I&#x27;d have to say this certainly was one of the best things in the #surfsupvoxbox.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of COVERGIRL mascaras and buy more expensive brands, but when I received this complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes, I fell in love! The first wand separates every lash flawlessly and the second adds volume without clumping. It stays well throughout the day (but isn&#x27;t waterproof!). I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok let start off by saying I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this CoverGirl Bombshell curvaceous mascara at all. It can hold a curl, it was hard to blend and it clumped my eyelashes if I tried to do more the 3 coats. Thanx to Influenster that send this to me completely free. I will not be purchasing in the future, on the bright side A few of my friends loved this mascara so I&#x27;ll be giving it to one of them since they asked to have it.</li>
            <li> This mascara does wonders for my eyelashes as well as staying all day. I enjoyed the two sided applicator which seemed to make my eyelashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> this works great! it does not look clumpy like traditional mascara does. I like the two sided brush, but i don&#x27;t think you need to use both.&lt;br /&gt;**received complementary from influenster for testing purposes**</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara, Stays on long, and is clump free! stays on all day! love this product! and will continue to use it! I got it free courtesy of influenster!</li>
            <li> This mascara makes your lashes POP! I tried this through Influenster (which was free) and I love it. I&#x27;ve always been a Covergirl-kinda girl and I&#x27;m just as impressed as ever by their make-up. The only negative is that the wands are on the smaller size which can make application slightly difficult.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in the mail from Influenster and I&#x27;m considering just buying like three more. This mascara is one of the best drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used! My lashes look 10x better with just two coats. The only thing that kind of sucks is how hard this stuff is to remove, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually love every COVERGIRL mascra I buy, but this one is not fitting what I thought. I wanted more volume and a deeper black, but I am finding this is just clumping my eyelashes together! It&#x27;s really hard to get off as if there is some different type of wax in it to try to hold the separated lashes.</li>
            <li> COVERGIRL bombshell is amazing! No nasty clumps and I still get the look I&#x27;m going for. Perfect for going out or just going to work.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster and i really liked it. I dont usually buy waterproof but i would definitely  buy this again!!</li>
            <li> I really love CoverGirl cosmetics, so this was a great product to receive from the influenster voxbox. I did get this product for free for review purposes, but I have always bought CoverGirl mascaras as my preferred drugstore mascara. This is a pretty good product. I still like the CoverGirl Lash Blast clump clusher a bit better because it gives nice long, separated lashes. This is a close second.</li>
            <li> I also received this product free for testing curiosity of the #surfsupvoxbox from&lt;br /&gt;Influenster. The tube is big, but that&#x27;s because it has TWO wands! You can&#x27;t expect it to be smaller and give you the same results. With that being said, I love this product. I&#x27;ve always used an oil based make up remover, so removing the mascara was easier for me. After the first wand, I noticed huge length to my eyelash while the second wand adds volume and that beautiful dark color!  No clumps, or smudges. I could also suggest the wand be a tad bit longer, and maybe a waterproof version, but over all this mascara gives me the perfect POP to my eyes for a night out!</li>
            <li> I was given this mascara by influenster and I love it! It made my lashes longer and thicker. My only complaint is that it is water proof so it has to be taken off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for testing purposes complimentary of Influenster. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in how curled this mascara makes my lashes because I already have a good natural curl. However, this mascara does a really good job of volumizing my lashes and separating them to give a really full look. After using this mascara for a week I still haven&#x27;t noticed any clumping.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for testing purposes from Influenster. I was skeptical, since it&#x27;s waterproof, but it really wasn&#x27;t hard to get off. I used Neutrogena oil-free makeup remover and then washed with my regular face wash. It left some on, but that&#x27;s ok. I have really light lashes and a little leftover doesn&#x27;t hurt. This mascara didn&#x27;t clump and I felt my lashes were a little longer than usual. Not fuller, but longer. I am cheap, so I prob wouldn&#x27;t buy it or use it everyday, but I will use it for dates and nights out. -jTorrez</li>
            <li> I would recommend the mascara to anyone who has little to no eyelashes or light colored. The mascara fills them in and makes them look thick and full. My eyelashes are short, thin and and light. So when I use it I look like I have fake eyelashes on because how thick and full the mascara makes them look. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster to test it out. My lashes are naturally curly so it didn&#x27;t add much curl. It did add volume and made my eyes pop more than most mascaras I have tried. Unfortunately my eyes are naturally sensitive as well so this product irritated my eyes. It did what it was supposed to do though and I would recommend it to those looking for something to add volume without making their eyelashes look fake!</li>
            <li> Got this in my influenster box love it so going to but it  next time! Thanks covergirl and influenster</li>
            <li> I love love love my Cover Girl mascara but this one just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I didn&#x27;t like that it was basically a waterproof or that there were two steps. I will use it again for a crazy night out but not for my daily use.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from the Influenster VoxBox for review purposes. This mascara completely annihilated my poor eyelashes. Let&#x27;s start off with the actual mascara itself. The formula they use is way to watery for me and I like to be able to build up my mascara but I tried both sides and could no get it to build. Next thing the tube is so big and bulky who would want to carry it around? I will say that it does come with a lot of product. My last thing on this is that it does not come off. I used eye makeup removing wipes, makeup remover, baby oil, and even soap and water and still had it on later. So in conclusion I will end with it isn&#x27;t worth the 10+ dollars</li>
            <li> I received my free COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous from Influenster in the voxbox.  I love this mascara it really add volume and lenght to my lashes.this will be my mascara from now on. thanks cover girl and Influenster.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the second side, it went on clumpy and was hard to get off because it was waterproof. Side one was fine though.</li>
            <li> I am not familiar with mascara, so this was one of the first ones I tried. Side one made my lashes look awesome! I didn&#x27;t notice much different from side 2, but I don&#x27;t have full or dark lashes to begin with, that might just be on my end and not the product. I&#x27;ll definitely consider buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl #curvaceous #bombshelling mascara in my #surfsupvoxbox about a week ago and it looks beautiful on. It makes my lashes look extra thick &amp; it goes on so smooth. I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I never seen a 2 step mascara before so I had to check the instructions before attempting to use this &amp;#34;device&amp;#34;. First you apply the #1  mascara that will give volume to your lashes and then you apply the #2 to seal the lashes. The difference between my naked eyelashes and the ones with the mascara is visible , the first pic has more length and definition.I probably would use this for a special occasion when I have a little more time to get ready.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fairly long, but not very dark so anything to help see them is great.  This mascara which i got as part of my #surfsupvoxbox from @influenster for free, was just the ticket for my fair lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out just before a sweaty, steamy baseball game, I&#x27;m a spectator, not a player, and it didn&#x27;t run or smudge and i got quite a few compliments on my lashes cos Boy, did they look long!&lt;br /&gt;I like the 2 step process.  First you apply the curling lash mascara, on a nice silicone, lash separating wand,  then the thickening lash mascara and your lashes will look amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with other reviewers that the wands could be longer, but, I will adjust.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I like this #Bombshell mascara a lot, I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> So I got this free in an Influenster VoxBox, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but I won&#x27;t be buying it. Step 1 is fine (doesn&#x27;t do much lifting and curling) but nothing special. Step 2 gets clumpy. But I will say, if you can avoid or comb through the clumpiness, this stuff seriously lasts. You may have to work to get it off at the end of the night (definitely need an oil-based remover) but it won&#x27;t fade or go raccoon while you&#x27;re wearing it. So that&#x27;s good. Also, not a fan of the design the fat tube with 2 ends means the wands are short and stubby.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for testing purposes from Influenster. I think this is a pretty good mascara for the price. I don&#x27;t think the packaging is great- the tube is a bit overly large &amp; it&#x27;s kind of awkward to hold the first few times. The mascara goes on clump free and my lashes stay curled all day. I like that it is smudge-proof, but it is pretty hard to get off at the end of the day. It&#x27;s almost harder than waterproof mascara and you have to use a lot of eye makeup remover to get it all. Overall though I like it and I like the way it makes my lashes look. I will probably buy in the future!</li>
            <li> I was reading a few of the other reviews, and I agreed and disagreed with a lot that was said. I did find that it was hard to remove. I tried eye makeup remover, face wash, taking a shower, eye makeup remover again, and I could still feel little clumps on my eyelashes. On the other hand, while it&#x27;s on. I really like it. It does a great job at volumizing my lashes, and it does stay on and I don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes. I also received this mascara for free from Influenster and even though its hard to remove, I like it enough that I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> So after trying this compliments of influenster, I&#x27;m torn. Great coverage,  length, and lash separation. With that said... nothing bombshell about it. The brush is hard and spiny. The product is thin and doesn&#x27;t add the volume that you would expect with a 2 part application. I also didn&#x27;t prefer the water proof formula. I might give the other option a try in the future.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I rec&#x27;d this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I LOVE it. It doesn&#x27;t clump and my lashes look mah-velous.</li>
            <li> product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I LOVE the first side the brush it nice and it goes on really nice, I don&#x27;t how ever like them both together. I also don&#x27;t like how heavy it is (weird comment i know).</li>
            <li> I got this prodcut from Infuenster and I think the whole two sided mascara is overrated. I mean, this mascara works but I dont see a difference using the two sides over just using a traditional type of mascara.</li>
            <li> Loved it. This was great for me. My eyelashes are big but not unless I put on mascara. I loved the two steps since I already do this with two other mascaras. The tube is a bit bulky and the wands could be longer, yet I really liked it!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this mascara for free from Influenster.  I really loved the waterproof aspect and it came off easily with an oil based remover.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Normally I use waterproof just for the staying power but this is just as good.  Looks great hours after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I received this complementary from Influenster in my Surfs Up Vox Box for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product. It really helped to make my lashes pop. I was worried after seeing other people claim that it made them very clumpy. I did not experience this. The packaging is very big and doesn&#x27;t fit well in my make up bag that I carry in my purse. And it is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I received this to try via INFLUENSTER i liked it the first time but the second time when i went out for the day i noticed it was very sticky. Wouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a sample from Influenster. I have three rows of lashes and find it difficult to find a great mascara for naturally full lashes. This one was PERFECT! The brushes separated and lengthened my lashes perfectly. I would definitely recommend this mascara for ladies with similar lashes to my own.</li>
            <li> I received this in A Vox Box from Influenster for testing purposes. I really like it. It goes on smooth and does not fade, run or clump during the day. I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Amazed with the results! I Find the coverage and the shape of the want very helpful on the hard to reach areas but what i live most of all is the durability and makes my eyelashes stay nice and curled for a long time.</li>
            <li> This may be the worst mascara I have ever used. I am a mascara junkie and pride myself on good products and technique. The first step of this product is great, very simple easy to use primer/base. However, the second step is terrible! For starters, it is very sticky after two light coats, my lashes were all clumped together and spidery. Very unattractive. I tried to comb through the clumps and ended up with mascara on my eyelid (the clumps didn&#x27;t move) and even with makeup remover and a q-tip i couldn&#x27;t get the mascara off of my eyelid! very very sticky. Also looked very shiny, normally I like a glossy coat of mascara but this was so shiny it reflected white and made it look like the full areas of my lashes had holes! Once I was finally satisfied with my application, which took 4 times longer than usual because it was so difficult to apply and unclump, my eyes felt very heavy and sticky. The worst part of this mascara is the removal, Its been 3 days since my application and I still cant get it off. It wears longer than waterproof mascara, and not in a good way, i tried many times to remove with eye makeup remover and cleanser and it wouldn&#x27;t budge and frankly it hurt. I lost many of my lashes in the removal. I am so beyond disappointed in this product. Please do not buy!</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary from  Influenster for testing and review purposes. First of all, I hate waterproof mascara. I like being able to remove my makeup who just face wash. This mascara, thought not water proof is very hard to remove. Second of all, it doesn&#x27;t add enough volume as I would like. It&#x27;s adequate for day use, but not for a bold night look.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara.  It lengthens and separates without the clumps.  I love the curled wand because it makes applying the mascara easy.  I just recently tried the new Perversion Mascara from Urban Decay, and this Cover Girl mascara is far better.</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster and I really liked it. It made my lashes look longer and really full.</li>
            <li> I usually use department store brands like Clinique , but for a drugstore brand mascara this was good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love it so much ive never had a mascara that doubled the length of my eyelashes like this. It also locks in and I can go a couple days with the same coat on.</li>
            <li> The mascara does not fade throughout the day, but is very hard to remove at night. You will definitely need make up remover.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara courtesy of Influenster to try and review and I really liked it! The brushes are a little too short for me but I&#x27;ll get over it in order for some good mascara. I also like how defined my lashes look when I use it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is that it starts to flake after a few hours but most mascaras do that anyway. Overall, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was able to try Covergirl&#x27;s Bobshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara thanks to Influenster! I was excited to try it bc i haven&#x27;t found a great mascara that will keep my lashes curled. Most just straighten them out. So I curled my lashes applied step one then applied step two. Sadly, my lashes didn&#x27;t keep the curl. However, they do seem fuller. I&#x27;ll keep playing with it in hopes that maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong and it&#x27;ll end up working right one day.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! The curled lash option has become my go to! I use it all the time, daily wear, for work, and even now for my dates!</li>
            <li> The one thing that I do makeup wise everyday is my eyes. I love my mascara and eye-shadow and am always looking for the next great thing. This new mascara (or new to me because I have never seen it before) was the bomb as the name suggests. It stays forever (waterproof with removal by an oil based remover) and gives your lashes volume and a nice curve. I have really enjoyed using this mascara. My only point of contention is the second step can get sticky if you take to much time applying it so just don&#x27;t take too much extra time. Thank to Influenster I was able to try this product complimentary.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara courtesy of Influenster.com. I absolutely LOVE it! I&#x27;ve used other brands and Covergirl. So far this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.  Really provides length and curl plus has endurance. This one I&#x27;ll buy again and again. Thank you Covergirl and Influenster!</li>
            <li> I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes. I absolutely love it. I can never get my eyelashes to look good and with this they actually do. They stand out and people notice. :)</li>
            <li> Personally, I tend to be a mascara snob. My favorite mascaras are high-end brands, and I rarely experiment with new cosmetics you can find at the drugstore. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this Covergirl mascara, which I received complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first brush end is for creating a curled eyelash look, and the applicator does a great job of creating that curl (I even skipped my usual eyelash-curling step, and got good results). The second end intensifies the color and the thickness of the lashes. It&#x27;s a waterproof mascara as well, and lasted through a shower, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it takes quite a while to dry, and the brush/applicator makes for a little clumsy application if you&#x27;re not careful (I ended up with some mascara on my eyelids, which is difficult to touch up if you&#x27;ve already put on eyeshadow).</li>
            <li> I also received this product from influenster and I really like it. I felt like it gave me good length and volume and stayed on a long time. My Mary Kay oil free eye makeup remover took it off easily though even though it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I had received my product from Influenster for testing and to review it. It was somewhat similar to Elf&#x27;s mascara which is by far my favorite! My eyelashes do look a bit more longer using this and taking it off isn&#x27;t so hard since I use olive oil to remove my makeup. Overall, I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this when I can just get the Elf makeup for the same price.</li>
            <li> i got this for my wife as a gift and she loved how it work and it made her sexy</li>
            <li> Yowza! This is an amazing mascara that I got in my #SurfsUpVoxBox from @influenster and if it wasn&#x27;t free I&#x27;d buy it for sure. It gives great length and thickens without being clumpy. I&#x27;m also very particular about how a product smells and if it has a strong smell even if its a great product I won&#x27;t use it. This mascara has a slight odor but it goes away after a moment or two and I can live with that. All in all if someone were to ask for a mascara recommendation this would go high up on my list. Lastly, this does remove nicely with regular makeup remover. It doesn&#x27;t require extra work or additional products to take it off.</li>
            <li> Just received this product  yesterday and tried it out and kinda satisfied &amp; kinda disappointed but the pros are makes your eye lashes longer and coverage is good for a whole day the cons are it clumps and it&#x27;s not waterproof would love if it was waterproof..... But overall very satisfied with  the product I wouldn&#x27;t complain too much :)</li>
            <li> I was sent this mascara to test and review by Influenster.  Things I like... it takes my very light lashes and makes them show up!  This mascara volumizes and lengthens.  Things I don&#x27;t like... it&#x27;s two steps.  I guess i&#x27;m just lazy, but I&#x27;d much prefer an all-in-one!  Overall, I would recommend this to others.  It is just as great as the more expensive brands I have tried!</li>
            <li> I go this complimentary from Influenster in my SurfsUpVoxBox. I have been trying many mascaras lately and was very nervous about trying this one after reading all the reviews. I have to say it is one of my favorites. It goes on great and really does make my eyelashes look longer and adds a perfect curl. Also it does not clump up is pretty is to take off with baby oil. I have not tested out the water proof but I am pretty sure it is great at that too.</li>
            <li> I got this product through Influenster in a VoxBox and I love it! the Curved wand for step one helps amazingly with giving my eyelashes volume! I love how thick my lashes become after using step 2! I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this mascara is wonderful and i love how it looks on my lashes they pop i love the color and the feel and texture that they give to my lashes</li>
            <li> I got this product through Influenster and LOVE it! It defines my eyes and doesn&#x27;t clump. Great product and will def recommend to friends :-)</li>
            <li> I received this for free as a sample. And well it didn&#x27;t really work that great on my lashes. I have super short eyelashes and I look for lengthening mascaras. But yeah I love that it has two brushes.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras.... I love how you get 2 applicators and goes on easy no clumping.</li>
            <li> This is one brand I trust and love! I love the texture and the way it looks after applied! I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara. Adds fullness and volume to make your eyes really POP! Best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes, and they are very... unnoticeable on their own and even when i am using a lot of different brands of mascaras.This is not the case with bombshell curvaceous though! They make my lashes and blue eyes pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this complimentary from influenster for testing and reviewing purposes in the surfs up voxbox.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to test courtesy of Influenster. I have to admit this mascara leaves my eyelashes curly and it really thickens them. Although I have to be honest it does not lengthen them. Overall I love how thick and curly they look and they do last all day curly and thick. If you love mascara that leaves your eyelashes full and curly definitely try this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! I have been searching for something that will last through a good gym workout and make my lashes look long (they are not) and full (they are not). I finally found it!! Would definitely recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> Definitely a must buy for those of you seeking those luscious and full lashes! I have always been searching for a product that will not only enhance my top lashes, but provide the definition for my lower lashes and this definitely helped. For once, I can say I actually have bottom lashes that you can see. A much more cost effective product than splurging on high end makeup that doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I think this is a really good product!! I would love it if they could sort of combine the qualities of both side 1 and 2, just to make it a little less time consuming, but each side works for what it&#x27;s intended to! Side 1 does a wonderful job of curling and separating the lashes, while side 2 makes them look more thick and full; side 2 gives the impact! I love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who asks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to higher end brand mascaras like Dior or bare minerals but I figured I would give this a try. I find that is okay, it isn&#x27;t my first go to but it gets the jobs done. I don&#x27;t like the two side brush. But it does make my lashes long and not super clumpy.</li>
            <li> I got this in a VoxBox and I was so excited to try it! The first time I put it on I could tell how good of quality is was. It went on so easily, and the brush never gives clumps.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I really love this mascara! If you love the look of false lashes, but don&#x27;t have the time or patience to apply them, this is the product for you. This mascara goes on in a two-step application and lasts all day. Removal requires an oil-based product, but so worth it! If you&#x27;d like to find a mascara that makes you look just a little more special, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Covergirl Bombshell!</li>
            <li> I really like this it makes my lashes look great everyone should use this it&#x27;s the only kind I will use</li>
            <li> I loved the mascara, it gave the va va boom i needed. I loved the product a lot it just at moments went on a little clumpy and felt heavy when it did but that was easily fixable by using the brush to remove the clumps. Over all it is a great mascara that goes on easily and quickly and lasts a long time. Will definitely use this product again! Thanks you influenster for allowing me to try it!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara thanks influenza tear you rock ! It made my lashes thick and long !  Gorgeous and sexy!</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for some help with my shirt, blond, straight lashes.  I have yet to find a mascara that was reasonably priced that actually did what was promised... making my lashes look full, curved and long.  Everything else I have found either doesn&#x27;t deliver, or does... but leaves me with black mascara chunks under my eyes by mid-day.  Well, this mascara actually does what was promised.  My lashes have never looked better.... MY HUNT IS OVER!!!! Thank you, Cover Girl, for finally making exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> In love!!! Makes my blue eyes pop!!! Super easy to use and shape is automatic! Testing for covergirl via influenster.</li>
            <li> I love how they&#x27;re is 2 different sides to this. It&#x27;s a big size and easy to fit in hand. Easy to use too. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the double wand, curling and volumising brush and then the intensify brush make such a great duo, I have very thin, sparse eyelashes and the usual suspects as far as volumising mascaras never really make my eyes pop, they just clump and look spidery, this one is much better than any I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I like this product it works very well and holds curl. It really is waterproof and stays for a very long time. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I look for in a mascara is if it  makes the lashes longer and this did just that. It also makes the lashes fuller, thinker and longer.  It&#x27;s easy to use and last all day without clumps.  #bombshelling @COVERGIRL complimentary of @Influenster for product testing.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress how wonderful this mascara is. It does it&#x27;s job, length and thickness. I showed my mom and she automatically stole my mascara. Now I have to purchase another one. Now it is the mascara that I will be using for my upcoming wedding. Give it a try. It does not clump for me and works well with my very thin and short lashes!</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about this mascara was that it was waterproof. I like to be able to wash my makeup off without using oiled based products. But it did make my lashes full and beautiful! I got this product to test from Influenster!</li>
            <li> This mascara was just okay for me.Not the best and not the worst. My eyelashes are short so it was kind of hard to use because of the size. I received this mascara in a influenster vox box, I was happy to receive it but I wasn&#x27;t that happy using it!</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as a tester in an Influenster Box and I love it! It makes my lashes longer and fuller and doesn&#x27;t clump or flake throughout the day. The only reason I have it 4/5 is because it wasn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this as a trial to review. I love the way the product looks when finished. My eyelashes are full and beautiful. It stays on. No flaking or running which i Love! Esp when i am working out! The only reason i gave it 3 stars and not more is because of the width of the tube. It makes it a little more difficult getting on without messing up. A little more awkward. However, the more i use it the more i am getting used to it making that issue null and void.</li>
            <li> i got this product in my SurfsUpVoxBx from influenster.&lt;br /&gt;i tried it feels really stiff on my lashes. step one is fine but step 2 didn&#x27;t go on smooth. it required lots of brushing and separating to get them to look spread out. you need a good eye makeup remover to take it off completely. It is not water proof. it takes a few tries to get the right amount on. too clumpy for my taste. i usually don&#x27;t put any mascara on my bottom lashes but after applying to my corner lashes after a few blinks there was black on my bottom lashes. i would recommend this product if you use fake lashes would provide a nice base for application.&lt;br /&gt;another tip is using lotion of Vaseline to smooth out clumps after application.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from influenster for testin purposes. It made my lashes look great! Curly and thick. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this 2 step mascara. Love how it lengthens and makes your eye lashes pop. I usually do eye shadow and eyeliner first but decided to try the mascara alone.  I love how it makes my eyes look:) also no clumping here:)</li>
            <li> I got this item through voxbox for free. I must say, I love it! I have been buying two sets of mascara for years and using it to do what this one mascara does. Will be buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in my Influenster  SurfsUp VoxBox this month. At first I was a little annoyed with the short wands, but after repeated uses I have gotten used to them and it is not an issue. I love how long and separated my eyelashes look with this product and it stays put ALL day! Just make sure you use an oil based make up remover because it acts like a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I got this product in a Voxbox from Influenster to test and I enjoy it, but I do think the size could be an issue at some point. It&#x27;s a rather large tube of mascara and really one that I could take in a small makeup bag with my other essentials. I also agree that the wands could be a bit longer. Perhaps they could think about making it longer and thinner. As far as the actual mascara, I thought it was great!</li>
            <li> every now and then I try a new mascara but I always go back to Maybeline great lash.  Most recently I got covergirl bombshell curvaceous for free from Influenster and I love it.  I may never go back to great lash.  Although this mascara costs more, it gives me the option of a normal clump free look or I can use the second wand for extra bold lashes.  It isn&#x27;t clumpy and doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day.  It is a bit difficult to take off though.</li>
            <li> I love mascara, and was thrilled to get this product in my free vox box from influenster. I honestly was surprised with how wonderful my lashes ended up looking with just step 1! With both steps I look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out of my current one.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mascara. It&#x27;s a bit bulky to handle and I found myself having to switch my hands up because I&#x27;d opened it on the wrong end. Anyway, I used the 1 side to build up the volume and it worked great. No tugging or clumping. The 2 side is to build the color, which it did great. Been wearing it for six hours and it hasn&#x27;t budged. Pretty great product.</li>
            <li> This was in my Surfup Voxbox! I absolutely love it, I was aiming to try it out but lucked up on getting it in my box. I love it♡</li>
            <li> I have loved &#x27;Cover Girl&#x27; since I was a teenager (many eons ago), and that love has grown even more since receiving the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara from Influenster. I have suffered with thyroid disease for almost ten years now, and unfortunately one of the symptoms of this disease is thinning eyebrows and eyelashes, so I have used numerous mascara brands over the years to try and pump up what little lashes I have left. I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I was highly skeptical when I received the Bombshell mascara, because I had honestly lost hope of anything working to make my eyelashes look beautiful and full again. Needless to say, I have been very pleasantly surprised at the results. My lashes may not be as thick and full as I would like for them to be, but at least now I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed by them when I got out in public. So thank you, Cover Girl for a great product (and a renewed self-confidence).</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a Cover Girl product in my Influenster Surfs Up Vox Box to test! This mascara worked so well with my eyelashes.  It have me a rich black color, flake free and tons of volume! It&#x27;s always hard for me to find mascara that actually adds volume to my eyelashes the way it should and this item did just that! Nicely done Cover Girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! I think it makes my eyes pop the way I want. It is also water proof which makes this girl happy. The best part of this is I got this 100% free from my Influenster side. Thanks for letting me try this awesome product</li>
            <li> I got this in my VoxBox and I love it!! I get volume and length from both sides!! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara in my Vox Box from Influenster.com to try out. Cute packaging and unique idea! I found it to be very clumpy on my eyelashes though. It has great staying power but I did find it hard to remove which is a wee bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Covergirl keeps on coming out with great mascaras. Thus one once again is great and sturdy for summer fun and splashing in the water.</li>
            <li> I give it a four star because it does not come off easily but other than that it does exactly what it says. I like to use this over my LoreaL Voluminous Carbon black. They go great together and it comes off better than on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I loved the volume and the curl in this mascara. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this was that it was really sticky! If I closed my eyes or even blinked my eyes kind of stuck together. LOVED it besides that.</li>
            <li> Received this in my Influenster box and I really like it. It didn&#x27;t clump and made my lashes look natural and long. Only complaint is the price and it was a bit hard to get off.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AS A SAMPLE AND I&#x27;M LOVING MY EYES! EVERY LASH IS PERFECTLY COATED AND NO UGLY CLUMPS! BEAUTIFUL LONG LASHES I&#x27;M HAPPY TO SHOW OFF EVERYDAY! THANK YOU COVERGIRL</li>
            <li> I am totally in LOVE with the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara! My eyelashes are very small and not very noticeable, this mascara makes my eyes POP! I used eye makeup remover but still had a hard time. I recommend letting the hot water in the shower run over your face and then use an eye makeup remover to get any residue off. Beware the 2nd step is a bit messy and takes a few minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous free from Influenster and tried it for the first time yesterday. I love the false eyelash look it gave me without having to apply falsies. It did not clump, and the coverage stayed on throughout this humid Alabama heat. I sweated most of the day, but my mascara still looked great later in the day.</li>
            <li> I received the Bombshell Mascara in my Voxbox from Influencer.  I was super excited to try it, as I have always loved Covergirl products. I love the curved brush and the way the mascara goes on. I am unsure about the first step because it seemed very dry and didn&#x27;t seem to be putting anything on my lashes. Once I applied step two, I loved the look and had on complaints. When I went to take the mascara off at night, I could not get it to come off. I used eye makeup remover, cold cream, moisturizer, soap and water and it was still stuck to my lashes. I love the look, but I need to know how to get the mascara off better besides loosing my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product through influenster. I usually am a huge advocate for cover girl make up. However I am not fond of the double sided wands. They are too short. I do love the large fat wand though. That is the only wand that works for my eye lashes. My lashes are already long and all I need it a wand to separate them and the large rounded wand works best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Clinique mascara fan my whole life. After trying the Covergirl Bombshell mascara that i received from try Influencer, I think I&#x27;ll be switching. I like the two step approach. My eyelashes looked fantastic! I didn&#x27;t even need to put on my falsies I usually wear. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like how dark and, yes, intense it looked all day. I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to go back and redo my makeup 100 times. It stayed fresh all day for me. Any makeup that will make my day easier is great in my book and this certainly did that with how easy it was to get the look I wanted and it stayed all day!</li>
            <li> i received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and i&#x27;m so glad i did .. it really makes my lashes fuller and longer and its not playing when it says its waterproof. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Waterproof and perfect for summer!! Makes my lashes look much fuller!</li>
            <li> I tried the bombshell mascara after seeing it was included in a Influenster voxbox that I did not receive. I&#x27;m still torn on how I feel about it. The primer &amp; mascara are very easy to use, &amp; you do need more of a light hand to apply it, but the end result is very heavy lashes. It felt similar to wearing falsies. I like the LOOK they give you, but not so much the feeling.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I initially didn&#x27;t expect to like this mascara at all, since my lashes are pretty dark to begin with. However I ended up really liking it!  The two formulas work really well together, and my lashes have never looked so thick and long. My only issue is that the wands are really short, and it is difficult to remove if you don&#x27;t have an oil based makeup remover with you.</li>
            <li> Got to try this product for free from Influenster and definitely love it.  It is waterproof and perfect for the beach.  It stays on even after a whole day and my lashes sure looks thicker and fuller with it.  The only downside is that you have to use a lot of make up remover to remove it completely.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised by the mascara. I did end up reusing the mascara because it is durable and does make my lashes slightly longer, I usually skip curling my lashes when using this mascara. It stays on and it doesn&#x27;t rub off even in the hot Southern California weather. I even wore it to the Beach once and it didn&#x27;t come off or rub off. I wasn&#x27;t inside the water though. I don&#x27;t think it gives you a ton of volume for being a 2 step mascara I&#x27;ve seen better results on a one step and cheaper mascara. The reason why I gave it 3 stars aside from the already mentioned is that its so darn hard to take off and I usually have a stinging sensation in my eyes for a while. That&#x27;s usually water deters me from using it. I probably would not repurchase, thankfully I got it for free.</li>
            <li> Overall good mascara. I liked the look of my lashes after applying both steps. It didn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling cemented; they were still flexible and felt fairly light. It&#x27;s long-lasting and doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day like some other brands. It&#x27;s easy to take off with just some make-up remover. Only drawback is that the wand is kind of clunky and makes it harder to control application.&lt;br /&gt;Got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes, and I must say I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara after a VoxBox I received sent it out. I didn&#x27;t get it in my box, but I was intrigued, so I went to purchase it on my own. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, but I did  have very high expectations for it. It isn&#x27;t bad by any means, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that stands out to me. The only thing I think is worth mentioning is that this stuff won&#x27;t budge off your lashes. I used three different kinds of makeup remover and washed my face and it was still lurking around TWO DAYS LATER. Some people might love this, I didn&#x27;t. When I tried to add more mascara the next  morning, the left overs made it clumpy and weird- huge eyelash mess! If you&#x27;re concerned about staying power, though, this is your guy!</li>
            <li> Covergirl has done it again! With the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara my lashes feel amazing! It&#x27;s not clumpy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling like hard bricks either! Very lightweight and easy to apply! I am obsessed, I can&#x27;t go anywhere without using it! The price range is very reasonable and it&#x27;s a definite go-to! I received it complimentary from Influenster and have already bought another tube! :)</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary item from influenster for review. I usually don’t wear mascaras so I tried it without any expectation. I have short lashes + inner double eyelid  thus I never feel like any mascara can make any difference. After I tried this I feel like there is a difference. When you look from the front, there is still not too much difference but if you look from the side there is obvious difference which makes me happy. This product makes me want to try mascara more now, which I think says a lot. However, like other reviewers, I am not sure if the side 2 really makes the whole thing better. Most likely not as dramatic difference as side one.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary by Influenster and I gotta say I love it. It makes my lashes look fuller even without the mascara on I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes look longer and fuller. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara! I was actually using the original bombshell before I received this in my voxbox from influenster! I for one have no eyelashes it seems and this gives me just enough to be able to show mine off! Thank you :) wonderful product</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I received it complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. It makes my eyes pop. It does not smudge so you don&#x27;t end up looking like a raccoon by the end of the day. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara from Influenster and was excited to see if it really made my eyes &amp;#34; pop&amp;#34;.  I was not disappointed.  The step 1 side went on smooth and did not clump at all.  It dried pretty quickly.  Step 2 was just as easy: no clumps, quick dry time.  This mascara was also easy on my eyes ( I wear contacts and have had issues in the past with mascara flaking &amp; irritating my eyes.  The formula did come off easily with make up remover (I use almay&#x27;s version).  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> the ONLY mascara you need! Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe HOW much thicker and longer my lashes looked after just ONE application with the first step. Add the 2nd? MAN, my eyeslashes looked way better than they did when I was a kid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the color? Super intense- you just can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it really LASTS-in spite of our humid Southern weather, I had it last ALL day, including beach time!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I was able to check out this new mascara courtesy of @influenster as part of my #surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li> This mascara has a lot going for it.  You apply this is 2 steps.  Step 1 is for volumizing and curling the lashes.  The curved brush is great for reaching all lashes.  Step 2 intensifies and locks in the look.  This mascara can be difficult to remove without an oil based remover, so heed the directions.  After a few uses the mascara gets a bit clumpy, so be careful of that by checking the wand and removing any clumps before applying.  I consider this a very good mascara for the price.  I did receive this COVERGIRL mascara from complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complements of Influenster for testing purposes.  This is a very good mascara, I love that it is water resistant, so even when my eyes water from allergies I dont have to worry about it getting messy.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mascara, especially for the price! It adds volume and length to lashes without being clumpy. It is not quick to smear, although it will by the end of a long day. Definitely a great value mascara!  *i received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from Influenster for testing purposes.  I thought the hassle of having two different wands would get on my nerves, but the results are completely worth the extra step.  This delivers great coverage and drama.  Exactly what I want from a mascara.  If I get in a hurry, I can get a little clumping from mascara, but still less than most brands. You do have to take time to make sure that it gets washed off.  However, that means that it does last all day.</li>
            <li> I like the length and volume I get from this mascara but I don&#x27;t think it is easy enough to take off and it also is very sticky so when I blink my lashes stick together. Overall I enjoy it but not sure if I would repurchase</li>
            <li> I am like literally in love with this product!! I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product because of 2 reasons . Reason 1 it&#x27;s really hard to get off I put it on the first week I gout it I thought the packaging looked great and everything but when I put it on a couple hours later I used Olay makeup remover and I couldn&#x27;t take it off I had the mascara on for 4 days with out it coming out ð­ and reason number 2 it made most of my eyelashes fallout it&#x27;s really irritating waste of money for such a s***y product</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I got to try it as a product of Infuenster Surf&#x27;s up #Voxbox. It is long lasting and makes my lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product compliementary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this mascara and liked it. I like that it&#x27;s waterproof and that it makes my eyelashes look amazing. But, I didn&#x27;t like that it made my eyelashes stick together.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says ! Makes eyelashes curlier and fuller! I have thin eyelashes so I definitely am loving this product!  a must get!!!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influensterfor testing and I have to say I will buy this product when I finish this mascara. It make my lashes so full, bolld and long, I have tried all brands of mascara and I am glad I found one I love. It is smooth and does not clump.</li>
            <li> I am a proud mascara junkie and I can honestly give this product two thumbs up! I got this in a VoxBox from Influenster to test out and review it and I am happy I got this! My lashed are already long, but with this mascara, my lashes are fuller and even longer!</li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl mascara, however this one wasn&#x27;t my favorite.  (I received it free courtesy of Influenster and CoverGirl, so it was definitely worth the try.)  It definitely makes your eyes pop and it doesn&#x27;t smudge off, both big pluses, however it is really hard to get off, even with the proper eye makeup remover it doesn&#x27;t want to budge.  One time I blinked and it got on my skin when I was applying it and it would not come off.  I had to completely scrub my face and start again which was extremely aggravating.  Also, the wand can be a little difficult to get really close to the base of your lashes since it&#x27;s a little bulky.  With that being said, it looks great on so you have to weigh your priorities of what&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from influenster. I like the fact that this stuff stays on for a long time but I hate that when I go to remove it, it doesn&#x27;t want to come off. Its almost like it glued itself to my eyelashes which is not a pleasant feeling. I do not recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t like to take forever to take your makeup off.</li>
            <li> This is part of the Surfs Up Vox Box campaign, but I did purchase the mascara on my own. Overall, I like how it made my lashed look. Def. a bit more &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34; then some of the other mascaras I use, but it&#x27;s not over the top. I could see myself using this on a daily basis easily. However, it does clump a little. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but I&#x27;ll def. be wiping it off more in the future to see if it helps. I usually don&#x27;t have to buy a lot of mascara, but this would be one I would consider buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble lately with clumpy mascara and I was overjoyed to receive this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. My lashes have never looked so good! I love that there were two different brushes with this mascara, because I was able to get the volume from one side and the intensity from the other. I think that I will use them both together most of the time, but I can see myself only doing one side from time to time as well.</li>
            <li> True to their word of waterproof.first time I used it was at the beach, this stuff didn&#x27;t come off in the ocean!!! Not sure I would buy it, received as a promotion from # influenster</li>
            <li> Maybe I am not savvy enough with mascara but this fancy set up just makes my eyelashes clumpy and sticky.</li>
            <li> This product was received complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from a 2-step mascara but this product does the job. Both steps are easy to apply...however as some other reviewers have mentioned it is possible to experience some lash clumping during the 2nd step. I found this to be the case both times that I used the product. You have to be really adept at lash separating to fix the problem. This mascara really does make your eyes pop though and does a nice job of coating the lashes. It is also very long lasting and does not seem to smudge once it has dried. If you are looking for a long lasting mascara this is it, just keep in mind that you may need to play around with it at first to get the perfect 2-step system going. I love CoverGirl mascara products so it&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from the Influester Program for testing and review. I already was a huge fan of CoverGirl and use their products among others. To begin with I want to say that I am really picky about my mascara. I am the type of person who finds one that works and keeps going back and buying that one product over and over again. This will become one of those mascaras. I loved the way my eyelashes popped and curled when I applied the Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara by Lashblast. I give this two big thumbs up or rather 5 stars for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge mascara wearing, when I do wear it I generally use clear. I got a tube of this as a product review item and so I tried it. I loved it. The two step setup is a little weird since the brushes are on the center piece, but once you get a feel for it works great. Definitely does what it says it does. Will be using this when I need that bigger lushious look. :)</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this product. On one hand its great because it NEVER comes off. So if you&#x27;re swimming or at the beach this is perfect. On the other hand, it takes forever to actually get it off even using makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara compliments of Influenster for testing purposes. My first impression was that the packaging is bulky and excessive. If you want a thin mascara that will fit into your makeup bag, this is not it. However, I did fall in love with this mascara. It can seriously hold a curl and gives me the dramatic eyelashes that I want, without the clumps. Brush 1 is my favorite- it is silicone and grabs all of my eyelashes. Sometimes I like to use only side 1 to create a more natural look, but brush 2 definitely gives me a dramatic eye. Another downside would be that the formula is difficult to remove, but I use a cleansing oil and that takes it off easily- so make sure to use an oil-based product when removing this mascara. Overall, I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great long wearing and waterproof mascara. I got this in my VoxBox for review and loved it. (please note i recieved this product and no cost to me and my reviews and feelings are my own and not influenced by any outside source). I have purchased this product after receiving it to try and i love it! the only thing i dislike about the product is that it is extremely difficult to remove!</li>
            <li> I received it complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I have never tried a double sided mascara before until this one. The first side basically made your lashes look longer and less clumped while the second side added more color. I liked the color, how long it stayed on, and how dark it made my eyelashes look. BUT 9/10 times when I would put on the second side, it would smudge under my eyes. I believe that the shape of the brush made it so that whenever I would put it on my bottom lashes it would leave marks on my skin. At first I thought it was my fault but it kept happening. Also, this mascara stays on for awhile. Even after washing my face and using makeup remover sometimes it was still on. So it was not my favorite and I will probably stick to my usual mascara.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorites! I see others complaining about application and removal but I have not had any issues and I have removed it while washing my face in the shower. I find my lashes look full (and feel full too), look longer and after removal I do not feel like my lashes have not been damaged. This will be my new mascara until something better comes out!</li>
            <li> Creates lots of volume and makes your eyelashes pop. Loved the step 2, it helped create a long lasting look.</li>
            <li> Bombshell mascara is perfect if you don&#x27;t mind a heavy feel to your eyelashes. I prefer using step 1 and skipping step 2 because of how it makes my eyelashes feel. It&#x27;s also a little difficult to remove, but using oil based removers or coconut oil, etc. does the trick!</li>
            <li> I loved the way the product worked and made my lashes really stand out. I felt like the double application was really worth it. However, the design of the packaging was not the best. The fat tube and the small area to hold it by arent as idea. However, the product is work the $$. (This product was provided FOC via Influenster)</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this for influenster.  While I did not receive it in my voxbox I wanted to be able to complete the challenge so I bought some.  This mascara is pretty good although I would not purchase it again.  While it looks GREAT it is extremely difficult to get off and makes your eyelashes brittle.  You absolutely need to use makeup remover to get it out of your eyelashes and even then, it is hard to get it out.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara from Influenster for testing purposes and really enjoyed this product. I have thin eye lashes and was worried this mascara would leave them looking clumpy but instead it makes them look thick, full, and making the lower lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> I like the dual purpose of this item. I found it to work nicely and was happy with the product. It really helped darken and curl my eyelashes. I bought it at Target, but didn&#x27;t pas as much as this, about 50% less. I am reviewing this product for Influenster, but I did purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is fine-my problem is with the wide barrel that you hold in between the two brushes when you apply.  Its very big, and with a tremor I need to balance my hand on the bridge of my nose as I apply eye makeup to steady my hand.  There was no way I could do this with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Covergirl &amp; wish I could have tried it for FREE through Influenster, they have amazing VoxBoxes! I did go out &amp; buy it myself &amp; I&#x27;m in love. Separates, lengthens &amp; thickens your lashes. Must have!</li>
            <li> DISCLOSURE: I received this mascara complimentary for review and testing purposes by Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara was a downfall in my honest opinion. It didn&#x27;t help my lashes in any way.It was a pain to remove it at the end of the day. There are much more better mascaras out there in the beauty market than this. I personally prefer the Covergirl Lash Blast (the orange tube) over this one.</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara comes as a 2-step process instead of one. I always mess up the standard mascaras &amp; can never achieve &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; eyelashes so to speak. Hard to tell since my eyelashes are fairly long already, but they were slightly longer after using this product. Usually I would find it uncomfortable to put on &amp; wear mascara, but this one was quite comfortable. Overall, easy application &amp; fairly great results, especially if you have shorter lashes :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: easy application, good results &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;CONS: price ($11.99 at CoverGirl)</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara.  The primer (step 1) went on perfectly.  I did notice some clumping/stickiness when I moved to step 2, but this was resolved by allowing each coat to dry completely before moving on to the next coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara gives great length, volume, and intensity.  It separated my lashes well if I allowed one coat to dry before moving on to the next coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara lasted all day and I didn&#x27;t have any flaking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little difficult to remove.  You definitely need an oil based eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very happy!</li>
            <li> I received Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara in the SurfsUp Voxbox through Influenster. I love this mascara! Tons of volume and length.</li>
            <li> It makes my short lashes look a little longer and much fuller.  I do have to use a good makeup remover to remove when needed however it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for a very reasonable price. I was very happy with the way my lashes looked after using this mascara.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. This is the best waterproof mascara I have ever used.  I love how it doesn&#x27;t clump up my eyelashes. When you wash it off make sure you have an oil base eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> So I received my Covergirl Bombshell mascara from influenster. (I got it for free for testing purposes.) And I really really like it actually. I tried it after I curled my eyelashes and it worked a lot better than the first time I used it. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t really come off too well with makeup remover wipes. But I do like it.</li>
            <li> I got this product to test from influenster and while I like the formula its not the mascara for me. I find even with an oil based remover this is almost impossible for me to get off. I dont like having to scrub at my eyes to remove my makeup! I have used multiple covergirl mascaras that I love but sadly I have to say that this is not one of them. I say if you love a waterproof mascara that isnt going to budge then definitelt give it a try!</li>
            <li> Covergirl&#x27;s bombshell curvaceous mascara is absolutely AMAZING! I received the product for VoxBox testing purposes and I loved it. I have small eyes and short eyelashes  and this mascara really pops up my lashes. I will definitely recommend this product to friends!</li>
            <li> I got this free from Influenster for testing purposes. My first thought was that it made my lashes fabulous! But the next day, when trying to reapply, it was clumpy - not all of the previous days mascara had come off when washing my face and adding the new layer made it even worse. This is not easy to get off of your lashes!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I generally use other drugstore brand mascaras, but I had never tried one with 2 separate coats to apply. I really like this mascara, as unlike other mascaras I have used in the past in looked good throughout the day and into the evening. My eyelashes weren&#x27;t as full at night as they were in the morning, but they still looked fuller and made my eyes look brighter than if I had not been wearing any mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of wearing this product, it didn&#x27;t flake off at all during the day once, which is definitely an improvement from other mascaras I have tried. However, you have to use a true make-up remover to remove this product (I generally only use face wash); however, that is also a testament to the staying power of the mascara throughout the day. I also waited about 30 seconds between coats and found that that resulted in the best application. Overall, I would recommend this product above other mascaras in the drugstore!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I love Covergirl eye makeup products and was very excited to try this new mascara. While I do think it looks good once on my lashes, it is very sticky and heavy feeling to me. It was a little bit of a struggle to keep it clump-free when applying and my lashes wanted to stick together.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I recieved it free from infuenster.com and i love the product! Its water proof, makes my thin eye lashes look fuller and longer. If you have thin eye lashes this is the mascara for you!</li>
            <li> I received this free from influenster. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it at all. I like a natural look and this was sticky, clumpy and just not cute at all. The wand is also really large and hard to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of mascara, yet I wear it and don&#x27;t mind trying it. I received this complimentary product to try and review from Influenster. I hardly see a difference from any other mascara that I use, other than it stays. I have to remember to not put it on my lower lashes. It &amp;#34;bleeds&amp;#34; onto my skin (I have very oily skin) and I had dark &amp;#34;circles&amp;#34; in a few hours because of it. :( I removed it with a cream eye-makeup remover, and it came off just fine.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from influenster, and it does give a great look, with a few tweaks on tube design I would rate it a lot higher. The tube is too bulky and the wands are too short, it ran a LITTLE bit in very humid hot conditions, but it applies great and gives an amazing false lash look, change the tube and I&#x27;ll be a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> Influenster gave me the opportunity to try this product for free. I love how it makes my long lashes look. I hate using eyelash curlers bc they break my lashes, but with this mascara there&#x27;s no need for them. It&#x27;s not hard to take off and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I did not receive this product through influenster but I have used this product before and really like it. I love that it has 2 different wands for different effects.</li>
            <li> The thick tube and short wands made application tricky. I would rather have a 1-step mascara with an easy applicator. I also had a hard time taking it off. I had to double-check if it was waterproof. It hardened on my lashes and took forever to get off.</li>
            <li> This mascara does the job, but I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the formula is great, but the brushes are WAY TOO SHORT.  You end up getting mascara all over because the wand is not long enough.  The first step is curved and allows you coat every lash evenly.  The second step clumps very easily and does not brush out well.  It also takes forever to dry and flakes.  I</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this mascara, I recieved it in my voxbox from influenster!  I usually tend to just grab the cheapest mascara possible but it&#x27;s defiantly worth it to spend a few extra bucks on COVERGIRL&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara, I just absolutely love this item! Not only does it make your lashes look extra curly and luscious, but I&#x27;m too lazy at night to always take my makeup off and it still looks amazing on the second day!</li>
            <li> Its okay. Not a big fan of waterproof because its so difficult to remove. I also like mascara better when it has one wand and no two because I think it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This literally does NOT. EVER. COME. OFF. I have huge clumps on my lashes that no amount of makeup remover will take off!! This is the worst makeup product I have ever tried - do not buy it!! I&#x27;d spend triple the money just for someone to tell me how to get the awful stuff off!</li>
            <li> This thing stays on forever! It&#x27;s actually very difficult to take off. Doesn&#x27;t flake. Do not put a lot of the second coat on though or it will clump.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! SO many people are complaining that it is hard to get off, but i found it easy when I used a simple eye make up remover! It made my eyelashes actually visible unlike some mascaras! I got it from Influenster in a VOXbox, and because it was complimentary and i was asked to review it, i was sceptical! but alas, I love it!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from influenster for testing purposes! I love it!! My lashes have never looked better. I have always layered two different mascaras, so this is perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> I got this for free from Influenster and I am not totally pleased with it. I liked the first part of it, it separated my lashes well and kept them from clumping which I loved but the second step wasn&#x27;t great. It didn&#x27;t add enough volume, only length. The tube also didn&#x27;t allow the entire wand to be coated in the mascara so it wasn&#x27;t that easy to use. I will continue to use it, it just isn&#x27;t a holy grail product for me.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara courtesy of Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxbox for testing purposes. I really do love this product. My eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from Influenster for review in their summer Surfs Up Vox Box. I am very picky about mascara because I have long lashes but they are sparse. I mainly look for volumizing and dark color when I shop for mascara because even though I&#x27;m only 33, both my eye lashes and eye brows are turning white. This mascara does add length and separates the lashes, but since my lashes are already long and separated, that doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me. The color power is good, and it easily hides my white lashes. However, it doesn&#x27;t volumize much, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look thicker. Since that is my main goal, I would say the mascara is average but not great. However, if you are looking for something that lengthens and separates, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product it. I got in the #SurfsUpVoxBox from #Influenster  and I just love it. I love how my eyes has popped more with this product. My lashes looks longer and thicker with this product. I just can not get over how my eyes has popped with this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product from #Influenster &#x27;s #SurfsUpVoxBox. I already have long lashes so I was a bit skeptical about this product-- but it was great! Really brings out your eyes. Will use again!</li>
            <li> I got this product for testing purposes from Influenster. I love this stuff! The 1 side of the wand doesn&#x27;t clump up your lashes and makes them super long and the 2 side of the wand makes them more voluminous! It doesn&#x27;t come off all over my face during a normal work day. It even stays on pretty well while swimming .</li>
            <li> Although I thought the packaging was a little ackward, a little too big, I really liked the sealant. I like not having to reapply my mascara after only a few hours. This lasted the entire day and still looked great.</li>
            <li> This mascara is everything i&#x27;ve ever dreamed of!! The tube is pretty big but it packs alot. I love that its double ended and is not rough on the eyelashes. This mascara extends the eyelashes without making the eyelashes super hard. It is also waterproof which is amazing! And easily comes off with an oil based remover. I love it. It&#x27;s my new go-to mascara!!</li>
            <li> I really loved this mascara! It not only lengthens your lashes but also thickens. This is one of the blackest mascaras I&#x27;ve found and also is easy to remove with makeup remover!</li>
            <li> This mascara was pretty awesome! I used it for a wedding I was in. Normally I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes but this mascara made my eyes look much bigger! I love the two sides and they work well together and it comes off easily with makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I recieved the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara from Influenster free for testing purposes. Upon recieving the item, I loved the packaging. It is bright and appealing to the eye, and really made me want to try it out even more! I opened the packaging and got right down to business! For a quick and on the go day, I will normally just throw on some mascara to make my eyes a little wider and more pronounced, and this really did the trick! I didnt mind that there was two steps, as long as I get the desired effect, and I did! I noticed that this mascara really made my eyelashes less clumpy, and definitely made them look longer. I would DEFINITELY recommend this, and will be buying some when I run out! Thanks for another great product Covergirl!</li>
            <li> I got the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes. I love trying new mascaras but I haven&#x27;t ventured into the realm of waterproof mascara in some time. I can tell you that this one is definitely waterproof. To some extent it is also makeup remover proof. So it has some serious staying power. Once I got the hang of getting it on without getting it everywhere, it was awesome. Definitely gave my lashes a boost and didn&#x27;t run. Loved it.</li>
            <li> I always keep two types of mascara wands on hand to get length and curl. This was a great idea and well executed. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t flake like so many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this in my Surf&#x27;s Up sample box from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this mascara free in my voxbox from influenster. I was really excited to try it out, but I didn&#x27;t love it. The wands were a little hard to use because they are so big. I liked the mascara, it stayed on all day, but was hard to take off when I wanted to. It almost felt like a waterproof mascara. I only used cleanser, so maybe it is easier to take off with makeup remover. All in all, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> So i received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and fell IN LOVE. My eyelashes look thicker and it goes on smooth. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster to test and review. I have to start off by saying I&#x27;m very picky with my mascaras. My eyelashes are naturally long, so I usually look for mascara with good volume and separation. This mascara was probably my favorite drug store mascara that I&#x27;ve ever tried, it will probably be my new go-to mascara when I need something quick and cheap. It has great lengthening ability in my opinion, but it was too thick and made my lashes stick together... there was not very good separation with the brush and I had to go back with a different one to get the separation I needed. This mascara also did not wash off with just water and mild soap, which I prefer. I don&#x27;t like most eye makeup removers as they tend to be too oily feeling for me so this was big downer. Overall, I liked the product, and as I said before will probably use it as my go-to when I need a cheap/quick mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this free for reviewing purposes from influenster.... and it was broken! I twisted the #1 tube and the brush was broken off in the container, tried the #2 tube, same thing! I was very sad about it and I probably won&#x27;t waste my money buying it from the store because I would be pissed if I had spent $10 on it and it was broken!!!</li>
            <li> This is literally the STRONGEST Mascara I have EVER USED!!! Last for HOURS! Good stuff! I would recommend especially if you are a woman on the go!</li>
            <li> I liked this product. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference with step 1, but after applying step 2, my lashes looked longer and more full. The standard black worked very well for me. I loved how my lashes looked! I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I love this product it works great and doesn&#x27;t clump very easily. I highly recommend this product to others. This product is amazing I love it !!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this complementary from the surfs up voxbox and I love it! I was a little scared to try it because I only use almay but I am now only using this one! I love this! Everyone always asks me if I have fake eye lashes I love the way it makes my eye lashes look. I definitely recommend this mascara you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my #Bombshell mascara from @influenster#SurfsUpVoxBox complimentary for testing purposes. This product makes my lashes look 3 times as full and voluminous than any other. Once its on it doesn&#x27;t flake off like many other brands I&#x27;ve tried before. Will definitely keep using this and recommend to anyone with thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous mascara for testing purposes from my #SurfsUpVoxBox by Influenster. I loved this product from the moment I put it on my lashes. They make my short lashes look longer and slightly curled (without the hassle of an eyelash curler) and the color is very much BLACK to make my lashes stand out and make my eyes (hazel) pop! I will definitely be buying this product in the future and I will start looking at other Covergirl products that I can buy as well!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup, I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a mascara that gives me those giant, thick lashes that I want. I&#x27;m somewhat picky, though. It can&#x27;t be sticky. It can&#x27;t be clumpy &amp; make my lashes look like tarantula legs hanging off my face. It has to dry moderately quick so that when I look up from applying it, I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I&#x27;m picky. This mascara actually makes my lashes look like huge faux Kim Kardashian lashes, without having to glue anything over my eyeball. [OMG - no thanks] That may not necessarily be what YOU want in a mascara, but it&#x27;s perfect for me &amp; I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for testing purposes though Influenster, but that has not weighed my review in any way. This is seriously my new go-to mascara. Thank the makeup Gods &amp; Covergirl I found it &amp; it&#x27;s not $30!</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot, and how it makes my lashes look. However, I could not give it the full 5 Stars because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of how &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; it is. I have excellent make up remover and this stuff is HARD to remove - even with oil. So, if youre willing to put in the extra work to take it off, its worth it 100%. I get many compliments on my lashes with this mascara</li>
            <li> Just got Cover Girl Bombshell Curvaceous Complementary from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox for testing purposes. I really like this product. My eyelashes look amazing. Glad I got to try this product and will definitely buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hardcore CoverGirl Lashblast fan, so I&#x27;m always a little intrigued by other CoverGirl mascaras. I really dig the Bombshell Curvaceous, as it definitely adds some va-va-voom to my peepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t find the brushes separated my lashes as well as the LashBlast brush does. I also found the whole wand to be a bit clunky, but I have tiny carny-sized hands ... so that&#x27;s kind of a personal problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is also a stubborn beast to get off when just washing your face, and since I like to keep oils / makeup removers away from my v. sensitive eyeballz, I&#x27;ll just have to settle waking up looking like a $2 whore. It&#x27;s cool. They have an app for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> My lashes look amazing when I use this mascara! My lashes have tons of length and volume!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes in big ugly clumps,which I&#x27;m glad!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes and so far am very impressed. It definitely adds length and volume to my lashes (which are naturally blonde and very thin). After using side one the first time, I was already pleased with the appearance of my lashes, and the look only improved once I used side two. I had read some negative reviews of this product prior to trying it myself, but I think those people must have been doing something wrong. The reasons I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars are: the wand is quite big, and it takes a little longer to apply than some other mascaras.</li>
            <li> It really makes your eyelashes look long and voluptuous but it&#x27;s really heavy feeling because you have to put so much mascara on. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d wear every day but it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;ll keep in my bag for a night out!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of allergies to mascara so I have trouble finding one I can use I got this mascara from an influenster voxbox I had a wedding to go to the next day I used this mascara and loved it it held up in the heat and sweat and the tears on top of that it did not irritate my eyes like most mascaras I love it and will continue to use bombshell volume mascara</li>
            <li> I received this little beauty and a voxbox and it has worked wonders it&#x27;s amazing in every way I love that it&#x27;s double-sided</li>
            <li> This mascara is incredible! I have tried many many two step mascaras and was never as impressed as I am by this one. The two step process is not heavy or clumpy, it actually feels like you have no mascara on. It&#x27;s so lightly and fresh feeling, non sticky, no smudge and easy tomalley, not to mention my lashes are like 300% longer than before.....</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster and was in love with it the first time I tried!  My lashes are twice as long than with any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried from the drugstore.  No clumps, no mess.  Even though there are 2 steps, just as easy as any 1 step mascara and well worth it!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster for product review. I have very long lashes, however they are very straight. I curled my lashes as normal (they usually only stay curled for a couple of hours at most) and I was very excited to try this mascara in hopes that it would be the solution to my lash lifting issues.  I placed Step 1 on and I was immediately excited. It went on smooth and separated and lengthened my lashes beautifully. I was impressed with Step 1 because I usually have to separate my lashes because they are so thick. Then I placed Step 2 as the finishing layer. Almost as quickly as I applied it, my lashes fell flat as well as my hopes.  Step 2 just seems to be too heavy for my lashes to hold a curl.  However, this just may be due to my straight/thick lashes and could possibly work well for others. As a compromise, I am now just using Step 1 which in my opinion is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far. However, my curl still only lasts a couple hours at most.</li>
            <li> Got this in my Influenster box to test which I was so excited about.  I love side 1, but side 2 doesn&#x27;t do much.  It just makes my lashes flaky so I only use side 1.  Great length with one coat.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes. It I shard to get off and is crunchy. 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara normally I have to use three different types of mascara to achieve the look I get with just this one product! def recommended to my friends!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It makes my eyelashes look extremely long. I really like it. The only down side I found was that it&#x27;s not water proof. Other than that it goes on very smoothly. It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but mascara I have to wear. My eyelashes are so light I need to accentuate them &amp; this is perfect. I love the curved side because I don&#x27;t have to use a curler. I&#x27;m all about quick &amp; easy &amp; this is it. It&#x27;s not thick &amp; it doesn&#x27;t clump like so many others I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s inexpensive but stands up to the expensive ones you pay for in the dept stores. If you want a great mascara that is a good price then get this one.</li>
            <li> I received the CoverGirl Bombshell Curvaceous for testing/reviewing purposes courtesy of Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight lashes that can and do go unnoticed, it takes a lot to make them look nice.  I have tried different mascaras and was skeptical about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The middle portion of the container is the one holding the wands, which was a bit uncomfortable because you need to hold this huge container and it makes it a bit less manageable.  The wands are very short, I will guess from top to bottom it is around 1.5 inches (maybe 2 inches but doubt it).  Since it has 1 and 2 imprinted on the bottles, there is no confusion as to which one you should apply first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is amazing.  You can notice a bit of a difference with the application from container #1 and can see an even bigger change after you apply mascara in container #2.  The product stays on for a long time (I wore it for over 9 hrs and no issues) even in hot sunny days when you might be sweating.  Since it is long lasting, this is not something you can remove easily but I was able to take it off with liquid eye make up remover without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to women whom may have short, thin lashes and want to give them some volume.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, but it&#x27;s never difficult to get off! Great for a night out but not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. First off I didn&#x27;t like how big and bulky it is. Second it&#x27;s very hard to remove. Caused me to lose tons of lashes upon removal. Not happy with overall performance of this product!</li>
            <li> I love it is amazing product i love it! Wowwwww is great NICE GOOD MY EYES LOOKS GREAT AND AMAZING,&lt;br /&gt;I only used this amascara and my face change</li>
            <li> I got this product for testing purposes and i like brush one because of its shape but when using both i really cant tell much of a difference. I do like this product even though the whole things is to bulky and really dont feel the need when using it to use both sides because i cant see any changes.</li>
            <li> I recieved a complimentary tube of the Covergirl Bombshell mascara from Influenster in my #SurfsUpVoxBox.  It is wonderful and I love it.  I have lashes like I did in my early 30s (15 years ago).  It is awesome stuff.  Make sure you use an oil based makeup remover like the one from Covergirl to remove it.  Saturate your lashes and let it sit for a few minutes before gently wiping it off.  You will love your lashes using this mascara!</li>
            <li> Pretty ingenious! I love when my eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; &amp;  the new Bombshell Curvaceous Lashes by  Covergirl does just that! My eyelashes used to be very thick &amp; long but hence age is a nasty girl &amp; it takes work for me to get them that way again. The double ended wand is a wonderful tool which helps speed up my application, it brings my eyelashes up and out, without a lot of fuss! Covergirl has always been known for their inexpensive yet with professional looking make up make up results &amp; they still got it! If you enjoy having people compliment your &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34; eyes, try Bombshell Curvaceous Lashes!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a two step process (and the product takes a while to dry), this one requires some patience. That said, once it&#x27;s on and dry, it&#x27;s a great mascara. It also has a chemical-like smell so if you have a sensitive nose, be warned. It&#x27;s definitely very black and provides great coverage and volume.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this mascara for free from Influenster for testing purposes.  My initial reaction was that the wand was awkward, but I quickly got used to it.  The mascara itself did a great job of separating my lashes and increasing their volume.  I often have trouble with my eyelashes sticking together, but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this product.  As others have mentioned, it is quite difficult to remove, but if you follow the instructions and use an oil based make-up remover, you should have no problems.  All in all, I enjoyed this product and will probably purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li> I received the Cover Girl Bomshell Curvaceous mascara from Influenster to test it out. I love the product, it made my eyelashes look big and beautiful. There are a few downfalls however: it&#x27;s really difficult to get off, I often smudge my mascara after putting it on and I just use a q-tip to clean things up but with this mascara its much harder to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;another thing...the size, it&#x27;s really big so if you like to toss some makeup in your bag and take it with you this mascara might not work. All that being said I really LOVE the look of the product on my eyes and I find that it&#x27;s worth the extra clean up since it dramatically changes the look of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup. But what I do love is a good mascara. I have tried so many kinds. This by FAR is the best. Better than Mary Kay! I love it!</li>
            <li> I received a full size tube from Influenster. I had very noticeable longer thicker fuller lashes.  I will def buy this when the time comes. Only negative it is very difficult to remove, even with baby oil or eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary tube of Covergirls&#x27; s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara from Influenster to test. What did I love most about it? It wasn&#x27;t clumpy on either wand, it didn&#x27;t cl UK my on my eyelashes and it didn&#x27;t smudge. I wish the effect on my lashes was a little more dramatic, but who wants lashes that look dramatic if they&#x27;re clumpy and smudged? It&#x27;s a good solid choice for mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This review is my own thoughts. I like this mascara.  It is like have two great mascaras in one.  The first wand makes your lashes thin and long and the second wand plumps up your lashes.  It makes for very pretty long, thick, luscious lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is that the wand is to fat for me to hold comfortably.  I have carpal tunnel so this may not be a problem for others.  The wand is also very thick.  Also you have to switch wands a lot.  Each eye I switch wands so I can get the second mascara on before the first dries.  Not convenient when you are in a hurry.  I probably wont purchase again just because most mornings I do a five minute makeup routine and this does not fit into my normal routine.  But it does give you great lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Adds so much volume and length to my lashes without weighing it down. Stays clump free and long lasting!</li>
            <li> This is mascara is okay. I did receive this product from Influenster to test out. When I first got it I hated it and it would have earned 1 star because of it. I have used it a few times since then and it is slightly growing on me. Pros...it&#x27;s black and looks good if you can get the hang of it. Cons...It can be a pain at first and is hard to get off if you make a mistake. I accidentally blinked and had to wash my entire face to get a black dot of it off below my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! The first time I wore it, I had to walk around granite warehouses with no air conditioning for 4 hours... Needless to say, my make-up was pretty much gone, but this mascara stayed put! The only bad thing I have to say is, if you accidentally get it on your face, you&#x27;ll need makeup remover to get it off! It will not rub off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using this and so far I&#x27;m liking the results.  COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara is the best mascara i ever use i love how it douset smear and some other mascara.I have very thin and short lashes and  COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous  would make them longer and fuller and curvaceous. I think it&#x27;s the best brush ever, there&#x27;s no clumping on the bristles, and the small amount product on the end of the brush doesn&#x27;t leave lumps of product on your lashes like most brushes do. I love how this fell is the best i ever tried and i hope others fell the same do.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara! I was pretty skeptical at first since I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s so hard to get off, but I used an oil based eye makeup remover and had no problems. This mascara really curled my lashes and gave them a ton of volume, and the very black color really made them pop! The mascara is surprisingly lightweight, and it doesn&#x27;t feel any heavier than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used. It applied very nicely, and there was no clumping which is always a bonus! I definitely recommend this to anyone, especially anyone with light or thin eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast complimentary free from Influenster for testing purposes. I love mascaras and is probably one of the beauty products I use the most because I haven&#x27;t been blessed with long lashes. First of all, I like the color of the mascara tube. The 2-step mascara application is new to me since I&#x27;ve only used the usual mascaras. I like how it gives volume and length to my lashes but doesn&#x27;t clump. Most mascaras I&#x27;ve tried which is meant to volumize clumps and the end point is unnatural looking lashes. I also like that it&#x27;s very easy to apply although I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my everyday mascara, I will definitely use this on a night out with hubby. :) Just make sure to have an oil-based make-up remover because it is kind of hard to take off. :)</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary tube of COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara from Influenster to test and review. I had to buy an oil-based eye makeup remover so I could remove it. I think it&#x27;s a pretty great mascara! It really makes my eyelashes look long and full, when they&#x27;re normally pretty boring. There are two different wands in the tube, however I honestly don&#x27;t see much difference after adding the second step. The short, fat wands are a little awkward to use, and it takes a little effort to remove. I am giving it 4 stars because it makes my lashes look amazing, and doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li> Well I received this mascara from influenster for free to try out and review. I must say it does give long thicker lashes! BUT you just use a eye makeup remover for it to come off. It did not wash off using my face wash. It will not budge for days if needed. I think the package is a little to large it would be nice if it was slimmer and not such a fat container. Al in all great mascara. Great dark black color.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It thickens my lashes really well, almost makes it look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes when I&#x27;m not! Very easy to apply and long lasting too. I love the easy two step process! Overall I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Influenster. I tried it today and I have to say I love it. It makes my lashes look bigger than my previous mascara, with just one swipe. I used to let my mascara dry and do a second layer, but I don&#x27;t have to anymore! I love the topcoat, too! It&#x27;s waterproof, which I love.</li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed with the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous. I received this mascara from Influenster to try out and I am so glad I was able to do so. I like the duo application system. The first one is great from separating the lashes and giving them length and curl  then the second part is awesome for volume which is something my lashes NEED. it works great and the packaging is super cute. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a whole five stars is because it is almost impossible to remove from my lashes when I wash my makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for free from Influenster.  I am pretty particular with my mascaras as I have the worst trouble with racoon eyes after an hour.  This mascara did stay on my lashes so that is great and made me happy.  The issues I have are that first the tube is HUGE.  I mean really something that I can not throw in my purse or make-up bag.  The other problem that I had was my lash tips would brush together and snag every so often.  I made sure to put on a light coat but that apparently did not help.  I will continue to work on a thinner application as I do like that it does not run.</li>
            <li> I received the  COVER GIRL bombshell mascara from Influencer!  And Omg! I fell In love with my eyes. I didn&#x27;t need eyeliner after applying this. It is the only brand I will continue to purchase. Thanks Influencer!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Covergirl&#x27;s new bombshell mascara is easy to put on but very messy.  It clumps and gets on my eyelids easily before drying and then doesn&#x27;t remove without an oil based cleanser from the eyelids.  Usually when I put on waterproof mascara I can still remove it from my eyelids before I&#x27;m done applying it.  When you are ready to take it off, it takes a lot of work with an oil based cleanser.  I used three pads of remover for each eye before it was completely off.  It also made my eyelashes feel very heavy which I&#x27;d never experienced before with mascara.  It did however make my eyelashes very dark and very long.  If you are an expert mascara applier, want heavy super long eyelashes, and don&#x27;t mind taking 15 minutes to clean just your eyelashes, this might be a great product.... I received the product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what was advertised.  It was difficult to remove like a waterproof mascara, and didn&#x27;t look better than my usual mascara that washes away with soap n water.</li>
            <li> This is a 2-step &amp;#34;mascara system&amp;#34; that includes a primer. I normally don&#x27;t like having to do this extra step and have yet to see any primer that made a difference. Unfortunately, this mascara won&#x27;t be changing my opinion. I felt that it worked as well as the other CoverGirl Lashblast mascaras, which I really love and added a lot of volume. However, it didn&#x27;t work better than the ones without primer, plus it made my lashes feel dry. It also has to be removed with an oil based remover. :(</li>
            <li> Looks good, doesn&#x27;t clump but the tube is way to fat and the wonds are too short. A little tricky to get used too</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free as a part of the Influenster testing program. I was highly disappointed. Bombshell makes my top and bottom lashes stick together! I definitely would not recommend it. If you want super long, curly lashes, spend the extra money on Benefit or Urban Decay Super Curl.</li>
            <li> I really like the volume of this mascara, it separates my lashes and lengthens at the same time. I got to test this product from Influenster, and it&#x27;s a really great product!! The application is really easy, and washes off very quickly, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lashes like previous mascaras! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This mascara really is the BOMB.  I have used the same brand of waterproof mascara for the last 32 years.  Every time I try something new, I through it away after a few times and always go back to my original.  I received this Covergirl Bombshell Mascara FREE in my influenster surfsup voxbox to try for free and I will definitely use this and buy more.  What a difference it made!  Love how it went on and washes off easily for being waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have lashes that are very straight and do not hold a curl well. With this mascara, however, my lashes appeared full and curled. I liked the two step process, as I think it helped to create a fuller lash look. The mascara was a little more difficult to remove and required an oil-based product. I liked the staying power, which didn&#x27;t smear or run throughout the course of my day. Overall, one of my favorite mascaras! I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> so, i don&#x27;t use mascara ever but i bought this one to review it for influenster. now i may not be a fan of mascara, but this mascara is fantastic in my opinion (maybe its because i dont use it lol). i used it twice last week, i loved how it curled my lashes since i love the look and it made them aweseomely long, i look forward to buying this great product in the future. hopefully one day theyll figure out how to make eyelashes not look so clumped when using it. but what else do i expect putting makeup on them lol i love this product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying something new, and when I received a free sample of COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous By Lashblast Mascara from Influenster I was pretty excited.  I had never tried a double brush mascara before, and it is definitely an interesting experience.  Pros:  A quality product from a great brand.  I was not disappointed by my Bombshelling look that this mascara gave my lashes.  And it does last.  I have worn it on various types of occasions in different weathers and environments, and it lasts.  I&#x27;m an eye rubber, and no smearing.  Wore it to a movie (yes, I cried) and no running.  So on that hand, it&#x27;s amazing!  Cons:  the applicator is a bit awkward.  The handle is fat and the wand is short, so getting it to where it needs to go is a challenge until you get used to it.  Another con ... getting used to it.  This is not your mother&#x27;s mascara - you need to take your time and follow the steps.  Wipe the applicators first (always a good tip anyway.)  Apply carefully and check your look between layers.  Soon,  you&#x27;ll be Bombshelling!</li>
            <li> I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous by lashblast mascara totally free for testing purposes from Influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;It was awesome and i enjoy using this product! It has power to give volume in lashes and also the same time gives intensity . When they say waterproof, they mean it and i washed my face adn could feel it still on my lashes.. NICE ! That being said, make sure you follow the instructions for removal. Its not easy but i use make up remover liquid to remove it. Sometimes i feel its lasting feature is important than getting is washed away with oil based liquid.With just 1-2 steps i feel pretty important. I would recommend it greatly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I fell in love with this mascara! It makes my eyes look amazing and they stand out. It adds volume and curve to your lashes...the only downfall I see is that it is very hard to get off! Always a plus, thanks to Influenster for letting me try this product free!!</li>
            <li> I received COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous Lashblast Mascara complimentary of Influenster to try out. While there are some things I loved about the product (bold color, dramatic lashes) the negatives outweighed the positive. The very worst thing about this mascara is the size and shape of the two brushes is awkward and really hard to use - and this is coming from a frequent user of double sided mascara. While I will keep the mascara in my collection to use when I want really dramatic eyelashes on a night out - it won&#x27;t be the one I reach for every morning.</li>
            <li> I have to edit my review because after a several weeks, it destroyed my eyelashes. I stopped using and don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was highly recommended after the #surfsupvoxbox and I received the shampoo and conditioner from NYM beach babe instead which I love! However, I really enjoy this product as well and it pairs perfectly with the volume the NYM Beach Babe texturizing shampoo and conditioner gives you! It has some serious staying power. When they say waterproof, they mean it! That being said, make sure you follow the instructions for removal. It is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! Got mine from influenster.com and had so many compliments on my make up, even though all I had on was bombshell curvacious mascara!</li>
            <li> For a drug store find, I love this mascara!  I&#x27;m always trying different brands and this is one I may have to purchase more than once.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is that it&#x27;s really difficult to remove!  I guess that can be a pro and a con.  :)</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes so I am always picky about trying out new mascara. Influenster sent me a complimentary tube of Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous and I was absolutely thrilled with the results. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it made my lashes look super dark and thick. I love how there are two different types of wands. That really helped define and separate my lashes.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing. This mascara make my lashes dark, long, full and bold. It is Smooth and clump free. I will definitely purchase this mascara.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t curl your eyelashes very much, but it gives great volume and length. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Received this item free compliments of an Influenster Surf&#x27;s Up Voxbox and LOVED it! They make my eyelashes look fabulous! And it stays on for a great length of time and is definitely waterproof!</li>
            <li> I got this product as a sample from Influenster as a part of my Surf&#x27;s Up VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use mascara very much but I enjoyed trying this out. It was pretty easy to put on and it didn&#x27;t clump up or anything. I liked the way it made my eyelashes pop. I already have very long and full lashes but it made them a little blacker and bigger. Both steps were easy to use and I would use it next time I go out to put on a bit of mascara. I would recommend based on price and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t curl or lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> I first received this product through  complimentary Influenster for testing purposes. I instantly fell in love with it! It makes my eyelashes look awesome and full! The only downfall is having to buy make up remover that isn&#x27;t oil free but that&#x27;s a sacrifice that I&#x27;m willing to make. Besides, Covergirl makes their own. I will most likely be purchasing this again :)</li>
            <li> This is a disaster in a tube. I was looking for length and volume since I have small eyes and want them to really pop, so the pretty packaging and hype drew me in. Never again. If you are looking for black glue in a tube, you have come to the right place! There are a number of flaws with this mascara. First off, the wands are way too short which makes it hard to get to the corner lashes. The first step is pretty easy and the applicator is nice, but the second step...Lord...beware. I felt like my eyelashes were being coated in bat guano. My top lashes started sticking together, then they started sticking to my bottom lashes and I felt like spiders had spun webs on my face to try to keep my eyes shut. Then it dries SO fast and it is so sticky, it&#x27;s impossible to separate them. You can&#x27;t separate them with your fingers because the second you try to remove a clump, this mascara glue will stick to your fingers and it&#x27;s hard to pull back with out pulling an eyelash with them. I lost eyelashes for real, people! If you want waterproof, this is it. Nothing takes this stuff off. After trying to get my rogue clump, the pain from pulling out eyelashes made me blink a little too hard, then I had the lash imprint all under both eyes. That was a HUGE disaster. It took me multiple tries with eye make-up remover to get it off, so by the time this was all done, I had missing eyelashes, huge red/black rings around my eyes and STILL had eyelashes stuck together. NEVER. AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free from @InfluensterVox in my #surfsupvoxbox and I loved it! I think it is fantastic and I will definitely purchase in the future #bombshelling # contest</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst mascaras I have tried. It was way too clumpy and my eyelashes stuck together. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my Cover Girl BombShell Curvaceous Mascara by LastBlast that I received complimentary from @Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes. Gives my eyelashes more volume and makes them look longer. The packaging for the product is very pretty and girly also. #SurfsUpVoxBox</li>
            <li> Love this new mascara! Makes your lashes look like you have falsies on!!</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good, however, it could use some slimming down. Being able to choose between the sides is a great selling point!</li>
            <li> I rated this mascara 4 stars only because is a hassle to remove. You have to use oil of some sort to take it off of your eyelashes and even still it is difficult. Its bitter sweet because it last all day and is water proof. I like that both steps create a full thick and long look.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best Mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the way you apply it. It makes me lashes look long and beautiful. The only issue is removing it - this product is VERY waterproof and you have to work pretty hard at getting it off!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara i&#x27;ve owned. it creates gorgeous lashes without needing a eyelash curler, and doesn&#x27;t create clumps.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of negative reviews, and I do agree with the issues.  However, my eyelashes have never been longer!  I agree it is a little messy to put on, and the mascara is intense so it is very difficult to remove if you don&#x27;t have the right stuff to do so.  That being said, if I have an oil based eye make up remover (this is required to use this mascara) I absolutely love this mascara.  So, save a little extra time, have oil based eye make up remover, and have super long lashes!  after application dries a little use the q-tip and oil remover and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think its worth the extra work with the eye make up remover, as the reviewers are correct, this is extremely difficult to remove with regular face soap - I was admittedly surprised about that.</li>
            <li> I applied this mascara 5 days ago and there&#x27;s still mascara stuck to my lashes !!!!!! I tried make up remover, lotion, soap, everything !! It is HORRIBLE!! I threw it in the trash! Do not waste your money ! Just put super glue on your lashes it&#x27;ll be the same thing as this junk !</li>
            <li> First off I just want to say I love cover girl products, but this product is just ok in my book. I want to say this mascara is VERY VERY HARD to get off. I usually don&#x27;t wear mascara, but when I do they are easy to remove. I thought a wipe would do the trick and it didn&#x27;t. I had to use a oil based makeup remover to remove it. But the color is intense and it does give volume which I like. I probably wont repurchase this particular mascara, but I love the other CG mascaras. :)&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE- I purchased the makeup on my husbands account. just in case :)</li>
            <li> I love how full my lashes are! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.Highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this! No clumping &amp; goes on smooth. Will buy this again sometime soon. Cover girl never let&#x27;s down!&lt;br /&gt;#got it free</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fullness and definition this mascara gives my eyelashes. The only negative to me is the smell of the mascara. Thus far, I have had zero problems with clumping or smearing, plus it behaves just like waterproof mascara, so I&#x27;m good to go all summer long!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It is one of the best drugstore brand I bough. Aimlove the fact that there are two wands.</li>
            <li> I Recieved this product free from Influenster, Hands Down this was the best mascara i have ever used, i love it! it gives me full eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t look clumply, the only downside is that it takes a little while to dry.</li>
            <li> I received this Covergirl mascara in my #surfsupvoxbox from Influenster. I was a bit skeptical at first. After all, I haven&#x27;t worn mascara in probably about ten years. Alas, I didn&#x27;t make it more than a few hours before I busted out the hand mirror to give my lashes a lift. Bam! The curvaceous part sure is right. I was impressed with how much this stuff made my lashes stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For good measure, I tried some on my daughter who has black hair and dark brown eyes. I&#x27;m a redhead so that could be why I wasn&#x27;t completely wowed with the color, BUT this color looked absolutely amazing on my daughter! I would definitely recommend this brand of mascara. I would recommend the Very Black color to anyone with dark hair and eyes as I think it created a stunning contrast. Thanks Influenster!!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  It leaves eyelashes full, and you don&#x27;t have to wear any fake lashes.  Keep it real people ;)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that would add volume and length to my lashes and this mostly worked. Not as thick looking as I wanted but nice length, however, it is a pain in the butt to get off makeup remover or not. Also, it clumps easily so watch out. All in all, it does thicken and lengthen like it says but takes to much time to put on and take off. Wont be buying again for those very simple reasons.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara after reading about it in a magazine.  WORST MISTAKE EVER!  I have tried unsuccessfully to remove the mascara with eye make up remover, soap, lotion, etc. and all my attempts have failed.  I am on day 4 and still have clumps of mascara on the eyelashes that I have remaining (I&#x27;ve lost several eyelashes as I tried to physically pull off the clumps myself).  Save your precious eyelashes and DO NOT buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I love it. It does take extra work to remove it but my lashes look long and lush. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives me a glamourous look for any special occasion. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing it for an everyday look but, It definitely gives my lashes a long and full look. btw... lasts ALL day long!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster. I ended up really liking this mascara (I&#x27;m wearing it now), but the first couple of times I used it, I had to get used to it. It&#x27;s a little thicker than what I&#x27;m used to, and the wands are a bit short (since there are two of them), but once I figured that out, I ended up really liking the mascara. It stays on well, and doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day. It also made my lashes seem fuller, so that&#x27;s always a big plus!</li>
            <li> I received Covergirl&#x27;s Bombshell Mascara courtesy of Influenster in the Surf&#x27;s Up VoxBox, and I was excited to try it. I currently use Covergirl&#x27;s Volumizing Mascara and love it, but I have to say that I enjoy that one much more than Bombshell. The concept of a two-step application is interesting, and step 1 works nicely. But once you put the actual mascara on with step 2, your lashes are left feeling overly sticky and they just clump together. You also have to use oil-based makeup remover to take this mascara off, but it&#x27;s just so difficult to get all of it. Overall, it&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;d definitely choose other Covergirl products over this one.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster so I could test &amp; review the product. The first brush worked great on its own to give my lashes some pop. The second brush gave them a fuller look and more volume. Be sure to do one eye at a time though because I waited too long between 1 &amp; 2 so one of my eyes was clumpy when I used the second brush. The tube is a bit big so it&#x27;s not really ideal for taking out with you for touch ups but at home or in a bag would work great. I didn&#x27;t see anywhere on the package that it said waterproof but I couldn&#x27;t get little spots off my skin where my lashes hit above my eye with just water so be sure to have an oil based remover on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this water proof mascara. At first I was kinda iffy because of the way the bottle was shaped but then once I got used to it everything was good. I can definitely see the difference between other mascaras I used and this one, this one last much more longer and also make my lashes much longer, I will be purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> I received this for testing purposes and I am very pleased. It definitely made my lashes fuller and curly. My only concern is that it is a little tougher to get off than other mascaras. But overall, I was happy with this mascara! :)</li>
            <li> I got this in my influenster box to review but i actually purchased it days before i knew i was gonna be getting the surfsup voxbox. My first impression was that i LOVED the mascara! It went on smooth pumped up my lashes and gave so much volume. I have long lashes but they aren&#x27;t as full as i would like. Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous definitely gave me the full volume i was looking for. It looked like i had falsies on without the hassle of putting them on. I love that it lasted all day and looked amazing right up until i took it off. I will be recommending it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara for the price.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I wish the color pay off was a little stronger.  It just wasn&#x27;t black enough for me.  But, the brushes on both ends kept my eyes lifted and separated with both applications.  Absolutely no clumps!</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster. It&#x27;s a good product, creates thick full lashes. However it does tend to clump a little and the wand itself, being so fat, is a little bulky. I would buy it again though because it&#x27;s a decent price and works well.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster as a trial, the mascara is excellent. I had little to now clumping and my lashes instantly looked fuller and thicker. I love the dramatization that the black brings to my eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person but when I received this via Influenster I was excited since I do like to wear mascara. I tried it for the first time the other day and it make my eyelashes look awesome! I highly recommend it to others. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the price. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had gotten via Influenster.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to curl my lashes after using this!  Easy to use and it makes my lashes look so full!!!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for testing purposes from Influenster. I&#x27;ve never used a COVERGIRL mascara or a double wand before so I was excited to try it and it did not disappoint! The advertising does not lie - my eye lashes definitely looked very curvy, long and black. Both the mascara formula and the applicators do not allow for a lot clumps, it evenly coats and separates each lash creating a bold but NOT overly dramatic look. I would absolutely recommend this mascara for like a working girl in a professional setting or a girl who likes a bold but natural make up look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: the mascara is a little tough to wash off so I recommend a good make up remover or some oil to help take it off.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It is easy to apply and makes your eyelashes look amazing. I am so happy to have recieved it in the mail via Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Love getting length and volume in one mascara!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had to buy two different brands and now I can rely on one that makes my lashes look great!!</li>
            <li> So I received this mascara as part of an influenster VoxBox and I was really excited to try it.  The first want was fine, but then when I put on the second one it was sticky, clumpy and heavy.  It made my eyelashes stick to my face every time I would blink. I decided to immediately take it off because it was to the point where I was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever... Won&#x27;t ever use any other brand. Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I tried Covergirl&#x27;s Bombshell mascara but wasn&#x27;t won over by it. First, the wands are too short; I couldn&#x27;t reach all my lashes in order to get good coverage on them. Second, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the appearance of my lashes comparing this to any other Covergirl mascara I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Finally, what troubled me most was that my lashes felt very stiff. I was conscious of the rigid fringe around my eyes all day which doesn&#x27;t make for a very happy me...</li>
            <li> I recieved this mascara in my VoxBox by Influenster and i was very excited to try it.I have naturally sparse lashes that want to point downwards.So i was hoping a mascara that was named curvaceous would change my eye makeup routine.But alas i was dissapointed again!! The 1st wand gave a natural lift but the 2nd want just made it clumpy and it looked like i had 4 lashes.It might be perfect for someone who likes a natural look and who are already blessed with thick lashes.Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I got this in my first influenster VoxBox.I like that its two mascaras but the one on side 1 was the one i liked the most. Overall its a ok mascara .</li>
            <li> I recently started back wearing contacts. I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster to test and review. I wanted to show off my eyelashes. So I thought I&#x27;d give this mascara a shot, and it did just that! Step 1 curls your lashes and makes them look fuller. Then Step 2 darkens them and seals in the mascara so it lasts all day. Someone asked if I had on falsies. So, yeah, it works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants very bold and noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li> Love Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast! I love how side one separates and makes my lashes individualize, then curl and then BAM, side 2 lengthens and makes my lashes long and gorgeous! Bombshell Curvaceous is a must have in your maximum beautiful eye makeup! I received my Bombshell mascara free to try from Influenster for testing purposes and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I Am now obsessed with this mascara.  I work 12 hour shifts and have so much trouble with mascara leaving dark circles under my eyes. I only wear mascara at work, no other make up. I wore this on an extended work weeken and it was awesome. I got it thru influenster as a free trial and I am hooked</li>
            <li> I received a full sized product free from Influenster for testing purposes.  I love the way it makes my eyelashes fuller with more volume.  My only problem with it is that the wands are too short.  As a matter of fact the first time I tried it I stabbed myself in the eye.  I ended up going to the doctor and got some ointment and a patch.  I recommend this product, but be careful.  I wish they would make the wands longer.  Another point worth mentioning is that it does act like a waterproof mascara and doesn&#x27;t just wipe off easily.  They recommend using an oil based remover.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara only because it makes my eyes show more and it&#x27;s the darkest mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.the things I don&#x27;t like about it is it&#x27;s REALLY hard to come off,maybe I had the wrong makeup remover but it took a long time for it to come off.it didn&#x27;t make my eye lashes curl but overall it wasn&#x27;t bad.i received this product complimentary for testing purposes from influenster.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS MASCARA FROM INFLUENSTER FOR TESTING PURPOSES. I LOVE THIS MASCARA. IT GIVES YOU THAT NATURAL EYELASH LOOK WITH A LITTLE VOLUME. IT MADE MY EYELASHES LONG AND IT WAS NOT CLUMPY! I WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS MASCARA IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this item from influenster for testing purposes and I was skeptical at first because I always believed theyre no mascaras out there that I&#x27;d like. They usually get clumped up, run off later throughout the day, or don&#x27;t make my eyes look fuller. Til I received this! My eyes look bigger and it lasts all day. I would buy with my own money and highly recommend.  Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, it works really well since my lashes are pretty blond and are thin. It makes them seem much fuller and lively. I love using this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t run very easily. Over the summer I love to go swimming this is the perfect mascara since it stays in place. The only problem is taking it off at night. I had a very hard time taking it off. That is both a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Received this from influenster for testing and review purposes. I have to say I really liked it. Volumizing with no clumps. Really made my eyes pop! Stayed on really well. I even slept with it on and it looked the same as when I first put it on. Wasn&#x27;t really hard to take off just used makeup wipes and it came off. My only complaint is it isn&#x27;t entirely waterproof.Took a shower while having it on and came out looking like a racoon.lol. but other than that I enjoyed and probably will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this Macara. I got it free from Influenster in my SurfsUpVoxBox. I love the how it volumizes and enhances my eye lashes. I would totally recommend buying it. Check my bombshelling  look and the complete review on my blog. [...]</li>
            <li> I was not overly impressed with this mascara.  I felt it left my lashes crunchy feeling.  The brush wands were not long enough and I would get black spots on my nose from where the wand would hit my face.  I didn&#x27;t think the #1 added anything to the mix...&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes...</li>
            <li> I got this product from Influenster for free so I am leaving a review. I&#x27;m not the best at judging make up products but I feel like this is an okay mascara. I like the feel of the tube in my hand. It feels pretty solid. It has two ends. One side is meant to give you volume while the other is to intensify. For what it&#x27;s for, it does an okay job. Maybe not the best, but I like it okay.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing feels great on my lashes and I love the very black because it gives them a sense of being fuller, and it stretches out my lashes. This is a must have in your makeup bags. The 2 sides feature is great you can have either a glamorous Hollywood look or a cute and subtle look.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster in the surf&#x27;s up voxbox for testing purposes. I must say that I really do like this mascara. The packaging of the product is very cute and feels good in the hand. It goes on well and stays all day with barely any flaking off. However, it can become clumpy. I like that there are two different wands to create volume and to intenstify the look, however the wands could be longer to make it even easier to apply. When it says it works like a water proof - that wasn&#x27;t a lie! It can be difficult to take off but I used the covergirl oil based makeup remover and it came off just fine. Overall I like this mascara and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just got to try some of this out for free thanks to the Influenster VoxBox, and I absolutely love this mascara! I&#x27;m super into trying different kinds of drugstore mascaras, and this one really fills out my thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in my #surfsup #voxbox and I did not like it. It caused my eyelashes to clump together and felt thick.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster to try and review, which was really neat! I like that there are two parts to the mascara, makes me feel like I have better control of how much goes on. That being said, it is difficult to get off . . . follow directions and use an oil-based make remover and you should be fine. I teach Kindergarten and am constantly on the go, so I think this will be a great mascara to last all day for me.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influensters voxbox and I finally used it yesterday and today and I do not like it. The mascara tube is big and hard to put it on compare to their other mascaras. When I was applying it it made my eyelashes sticky and made it feel weird like sticking to my skin. Maybe I would have to get used it to.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned at first about how thick the tube is- I thought it would be like drawing with a marker. NOPE! It was actually pretty simple!! The first brush is hard- which was a surprise the first time I poked myself- but it was awesome for keeping them separated! I was super impressed by the way this stuff separated the lashes. There was definitely NO spider lashes (clumpy). It did add length but not fullness.</li>
            <li> So I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about this mascara at first, but the other day I gave it another try. This time I used the 2nd side first and the 1st last and WOW! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me and how my lashes are, but it&#x27;s perfect. I love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! Even though it&#x27;s a bit stubborn to take out, it makes my lashes look amazing! :)</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this mascara! It makes your eye lashes full and long without making them look like spider lashes. You truly can put on as many coats as you like of the first side without your eye lashes getting clumpy. I will never buy another mascara. This is the best!</li>
            <li> This mascara really is wonderful. It turned my going out look in to something fit for the stars. I used to put baby powder on my lashes, this would lead to some major clumping. This gives me the look I want, and skips all the lumps. I will be using this for all my bombshell nights!</li>
            <li> Goes on good &amp; seems to last. Love it! I haven&#x27;t had the experience of wearing it more than a few days so not sure about the long wear usage.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complementary from Influenster for testing purposes. Initial thoughts are that the mascara tube is a bit heavy since there are two ends and the curling wand is a little hard to maneuver. Other than those issues, the mascara formula and wands were great! My eyelashes were lengthened, separated, and thickened. My eyes really POPPED!</li>
            <li> This mascara delivers what it promises--BOMBSHELL eyelashes! Never have I used a mascara that made my eyelashes pop so much! Thanks Covergirl! Love the product!</li>
            <li> Does great stuff for my lashes. Really lengthens and then side two fills it in to make it look more natural. I love it, and once it dries, it&#x27;s not overly sticky!</li>
            <li> I love how innovative this piece is to begin with (double wand stick), and the color stands out strong. However, I did notice it get kind of clumpy after multiple uses but other than that - I&#x27;d highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with this mascara! Such a wonderful product and I love the formula! Covergirl never ceases to amaze me. Love!</li>
            <li> The first end is rubber which I&#x27;ve never tried before, gotta say it worked really well probably better than the regular brushes. Although be careful if you get it too close to your eye lid it will smart. The other end added fullness where the first end added length. Really enjoyed this product, would purchase it.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster and I really like it! My eye lashes went KAPOW... My lashes look huge, long and full when using Bombshell mascara! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very decent mascara. It&#x27;s not AMAZING but definitely not horrible. The first step has a nice brush that separates your lashes &amp; lengths them well. The second step is suppose to volumize them and make them darker which I don&#x27;t feel it did amazingly on. All in all, it&#x27;s a great basic mascara to lengthen and darken your lashes. It&#x27;s a bit trickier than most mascaras I use when trying to remove it as well but nothing impossible.</li>
            <li> I got this in a promo from Influenster and although the double step is a little tedious and it&#x27;s not completely waterproof (more water resistant) I like this mascara.  I&#x27;m not sure I would give up my Make Up Forever or some of the L&#x27;Oreal mascaras but if you&#x27;re looking for a decent, well-priced performer that is convenient to get then give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to test in an Influenster VoxBox and I can honestly say this is the best mascara I have ever used! It made my eye lashes pop and it didn&#x27;t run or smudge. This is a great product and I will definitely be buying it when I run out!</li>
            <li> This really gives you the maximum bang for your buck. The mascara feels light,smooth and smudge free. I was amazed how big my lashes looked. I love how you get two brush applicators in one. not only it covers but it voluminousness your lashes for a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Okay so this mascara is DRAMATIC! If you want a mascara that really brings out your eyes, you will love covergirls bombshell curvaceous mascara! The first wand is what columizes , lengthens , and primes the eyelashes and the second wand really deepens your eyes and brings out that dark eyelashes! - if you use this mascara it is pretty much a must have to use a oil based eye makeup remover this mascara is heavy duty and seriously needs to be taken off before bed! I got this item from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this mascara is that it was truly waterproof and it came off easily with makeup remover. I also like the fact that it did not leave any clumps and left my eyelashes long and separated. My eyelashes do not stay curled for a long time and this mascara did not help with that at all. If your eyelashes are easier to manage, this mascara will do wonders for you. I was able to try this mascara for free through Influenster.</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I love this mascara! It pumps up my lashes so much. Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Would definitely recommend and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a while now, I do like it a lot. However I find that if I combine it with a second mascara, I can really achieve the look I want. Alone it&#x27;s a good mascara, but nothing that REALLY stands out until I combine it with another mascara for a second layer. I always have to use baby oil to remove it- just showering/washing won&#x27;t do the trick!</li>
            <li> I got this for free from Influenster and Covergirl.&lt;br /&gt;When I got word, I was told that it was going to be a struggle to remove it and that I&#x27;d need an oil-based remover to remove it. From personal experience, I didn&#x27;t need to have oil-based at all. Yes, it wasn&#x27;t the easiest to remove, compared to other waterproof, including any of Covergirl&#x27;s other lines. But soaking for at least 5 seconds using Almay oil-free eye makeup remover worked wonders and I&#x27;ve found it removes more cleanly and easily than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can safely say that the lashes I got with it were AMAZING. My lashes are curled naturally, and this mascara curled them even more. When you wear glasses, having that helps A LOT. My lashes also looked fuller and longer, thicker and made my eyes just completely pop. It was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two steps. You don&#x27;t have to do both steps, I&#x27;ve found, as well. It&#x27;s wonderful when you&#x27;re in a real hurry and barely have time to put on mascara, period.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from Influenster and love it! It gives me great length and volume. I love the brushes for step 1 and 2, and there&#x27;s no clumping. It&#x27;s a great mascara for day or night looks, and it lasts all day. I would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in my most recent VoxBox, and I’m not really impressed. While it does add a curl and a little bit of length to my lashes, it doesn’t add any noticeable volume. The dual brushes are way too short, making the mascara difficult to use. I kept smudging mascara on my lids, and it was next to impossible to remove.  Lastly, it has a really bad chemical smell, which makes me nervous putting this near my eyes. As soon as you open the tube, the smell is the first thing you notice. Overall, I don’t recommend purchasing this mascara at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary tube of Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara for testing and review purposes from influenster in my Surf’s Up Voxbox.</li>
            <li> It seems like any other regular mascara that you can buy form anywhere. I got it for testing purposes from influenster.com and its not something i would buy. i would rather something from sephora.</li>
            <li> I recieved this mascara from Influenster for free to review. Honestly, I really like this mascara, as it is one of few that does not smudge on my under eye aria. It is a little trickier to remove, but my Neutrogena Oil-Free makeup remover handles the job, you just have to hold the remover soaked cotton ball on your eye for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. makes me actually look like I have lashes!</li>
            <li> Awesome drug store find</li>
            <li> It is okay.  I received this free to try from Influenster.  I would consider myself a &amp;#34;mascara snob&amp;#34;.  This was okay, definitely worth trying again.  I didn&#x27;t achieve the amount of volume that I typically like and ended up putting a coat of my favorite mascara on over it.  It did give decent volume though.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary of Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes. After using it a couple of times I have to say it&#x27;s my favorite mascara. It&#x27;s easy to use and love that it gives you volume on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I liked the first and second coats, but it got crispy and dry. I couldn&#x27;t get it off very well with removers. found out later it is supposed to be waterproof. I had used waterproof removers as well. it added a good amount of volume, but it did get just a little clumpy sometimes. it seems nice, but I don&#x27;t think its for me.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free from influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> While this mascara isn&#x27;t the worst one I&#x27;ve tried, it wasn&#x27;t particularly great either. My biggest complaints are that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, and leaves lashes clumpy. The 2 step process sounds like it should do something really amazing for your lashes but really doesn&#x27;t do any better if even as good as other mascaras in the same price range.</li>
            <li> This mascara is ok I like that is doesn&#x27;t make my lashes clumpy however if you are looking for extreme volume this isn&#x27;t it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this mascara free from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I would definitely purchase again. I have short lashes, so it helps in adding length and some volume. As stated in previous reviews, my only dislike about this product is the actual removal. I tried removing it with my wipe makeup remover and it only removed some of the mascara. Most of the mascara ended up staying clumped on my lashes for a few days. *I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara very often. I hate trying to clean up smudges, and I don&#x27;t like looking clumpy. This stuff made me look like I had amazing lashes! I loved it! It was pretty easy to use. I still had some clumps, but I also didn&#x27;t use a lash comb at all. I got it complimentary from influenster for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This mascara has staying power and the second coat definitely adds some WOW to your lashes. As others have said, the wand is a bit short making it hard to get into the outer edges of you eyelashes, but overall I am pleased with this product. I received this from Influenster to test.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my lashes feel and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it I just wish it had a bit more length.</li>
            <li> I feel like the first step really lengthens my lashes and the second step adds volume. My lashes weren&#x27;t clumpy or heavy after this which was pretty surprising after two steps! I usually only use 1 coat of mascara but I really like this! A+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this mascara to review complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  Thanks Influenster!!</li>
            <li> I love  this mascara and I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for one problem and that is removing it. Even if you use a good oil based remover it is still somewhat hard to get it all off.  I still think it&#x27;s great ad worth a little extra effort so I would recommend this to my friends . My lashes look great when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! The first step made my eye lashes super curly and full. Step 2 lengthened and darkened my lashes. It goes on smooth and clump free. I am really picky when it comes to mascara but I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to test out bombshell by Influenster.com and covergirl. I liked the product, it wasn&#x27;t heavy and clumpy like other mascara but it also didn&#x27;t last as long and I had to reapply more often. All in all the mascara worked like it said it would, it added volume and length like it was supposed to but just didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes and I really like it. It&#x27;s a great mascara, it goes on well and really made my eyes pop. I did notice that it got clumpy really easily and that it smudged off onto my skin a lot. These things are easy to fix but is a bit of an annoyance. For me it came off with ease with water after a shower loosened it up. Overall I think it&#x27;s a really great drugstore mascara! I like the concept of the two sides a lot.</li>
            <li> I have very short, stubby lashes. I&#x27;ve tried all types of mascara. I received this mascara in my Influenster VoxBox complimentary to try and review. I WILL be purchasing this! My short, stubby lashes look long and curvy! It also wears very well. I&#x27;m a nurse and work long, hot, 12-hr shifts and this mascara can stand the test!!</li>
            <li> I this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I actually liked it!  I am by no means a one brand girl and after this I probably still won&#x27;t be either.  I usually buy what ever catches my eye in the store.  In fact currently residing in my makeup bag I have Rimmell, Almay (plum), Revlon, Avon, Covergirl, and Maybelline mascara.  I like all of them for different things so I get around to using them all.  This however could feasibly replace all but my Almay plum mascara because well who can give up plum mascara when it makes your brown eyes pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the # 1 side lays down a nice mascara that seems to thicken up the lashes, the side# 2 curves the lashes and seal it in making it near indestructible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The # 1 side brush is a little weird and adds a lot of mascara way too much for my short thin lashes.  I had to take a lot off with a piece of toilet paper before putting it on.  After that though it added a nice layer of mascara to my top lashes.  The # 2 side made what I already put on with the # 1 side clump up a bit but was easy to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a pretty good product and while it doesn&#x27;t give me super long lashes it does enhance what I already have!</li>
            <li> I have super straight and short lashes. I&#x27;ve been using Benefits mascara for about six months and while I like it, you still can&#x27;t see my lashes. I received this mascara free courtesy of Influenster as a part of their VoxBox program. I tried it today and I&#x27;m super impressed! There are two parts and each wand is a different size. The smaller wand prepped it and helped me reach each individual lash while the larger brush created a ton of volume. I think I may have found my new favorite mascara. No joke. Loving this so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Loving the way it makes my eyelashes pop i had no clumping the only issue i had was removing the mascara it was very hard to remove even with makeup remove. i dont think i would purshase this Mascara. I recieved this one thur influenster to review !</li>
            <li> Received this to try as part of my Influenster VoxBox -- really like it! Though the brush is a bit bulky, I love how evenly the mascara applies and how it separates my lashes. I&#x27;d probably purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but due to my short and straight lashes, I only really use one side or the other. Using both sides clumps my lashes too much (hence the 4 stars). Easy to remove with baby oil.</li>
            <li> Just when I thought I couldn&#x27;t love anything more than the original Lashblast or Bombshell Volume by Lashblast Mascaras, COVERGIRL went and did this. This mascara is amazing. Lifts, lengthens and brings major lash drama... in a good way! Is not clumpy or flaky and doesn&#x27;t irritate my usually sensitive eyes. I received a full-size Bombshell Curvaceous complimentary from Influenster &amp; COVERGIRL in my #SurfsUpVoxBox, and I will definitely purchase another when mine runs out or it&#x27;s just time to replace with a fresh tube.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this mascara makes my lashes look. It curls, lengthens and adds just the right amount of drama!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for review from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I have short and straight lashes, so I absolutely love any mascara that can give me nice lashes. This mascara definitely adds volume and holds my curl all day! I can use just one side or both sides to really amp it up!</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely isnt my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried but it definitely isnt the worst.  It clumps up and is sticky but if you comb it out before it drys it looks aliright..  I give it a 5 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I love how it gives great volume and length. I didn&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of coats where as with other ones I do! I like that this came out in time for summer when I will be swimming more and having it not melt off in the sun!</li>
            <li> Despite what I&#x27;ve read about the bad smell and burning sensation I happen to like the be a bombshell mascara. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product ... I got this product from INFLUENSTER to try it out ad I&#x27;m really enjoying this product</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free through Influenster for testing purposes. I don&#x27;t typically use mascara. I only wear it if i&#x27;m getting dressed up to go out for the evening. That being said, I found this very easy to use and serves it&#x27;s intended purpose. It goes on pretty easy and stayed on without making my look like a raccoon after a hot, humid night on the water. You will need eye makeup remover to get it off, but that&#x27;s typical for any long wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I love love the covergirl bombshell curvaceous mascara...it worked wonders for my small lashes i would definitely recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I have tried a multitude of different mascaras and I received this mascara from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes and I LOVE it so far!  It coats and curls my lashes just perfectly in just the right shade!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this one all the time now.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on influenster and decided to go out and buy some. I really love that it doesn&#x27;t clump and the waterproof aspect is great for the summer.  I have always been a fan of cover girl and have several of there other mascaras. My only complaint is that it is VERY hard to remove, so probably something for occasional use when I know I will be at the pool.</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER! I&#x27;m a career makeup artist with 12 years under my belt working with a prestige brand. And we have NOTHING that compares to this bad boy!! I have snuffleupagus lashes from Sesame Street and I have a very difficult time finding something that gives me volume while lifting my lashes. I tend to give up easily (due to my previous experiences) but not with this mascara!! It makes me feel like I have lashes for days while avoiding the dreaded Tammy Faye &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got this in an Influenster box, and though I have no brand loyalty for mascara, I do tend to really like Cover Girl. This was, as other posters have mentioned, somewhat hard to remove with regular remover but is a great product! Treat it like a waterproof product when you decide to remove it.</li>
            <li> I just got this product to try and review from Influenster and liked it a lot. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that there are 2 steps, rather than the easy mascara you apply once when you&#x27;re running out the door in a hurry. I decided to use my simple mascara when I am in a hurry, and the COVERGIRL bombshell mascara when I am going out and want to look sexy. It made my lashes longer, and more fuller. Thank you influenster and COVERGIRL!</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara! One of my favorite ones I have, definitely love covergirl! I would buy again and recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, not only was it free from influenster but works great too. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It lengthened my eyelashes and made them pop! Stayed on during a big cry too. No scary black eyes! I received this from influenster for testing and product reviews.</li>
            <li> Okay, so yes-- this does stay. Really well, actually. But once you get to the second part, even using the wand wiggle trick, it clumps and it makes your eyelashes stick together and to your face. It&#x27;s heavy, too, like I can actually feel the weight on my eyelashes, unlike other mascaras. The first wand is fine, but for as big as the tube is, there&#x27;s not much to go around and the wands are really short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received mine through Influenster&#x27;s voxbox program and I was really thrilled to try it (hey, free mascara), but unfortunately pretty disappointed. Overall it&#x27;s not worth the buy, just get the Maybelline falsies-- it has the same effect, but it&#x27;s not nearly so heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I recieved this complimentary from Influenster through their Surfs Up Vox Box.  Mascara can really change the look of your eyes and I rated this 4/5 stars because it gives nice, simple, more natural looking lashes.  If you want your eyes to pop and your lashes to be full and thick, this mascara does not do the job.  I love having this mascara on hand for days that I want a simple, beach-like look, but I do not use this to get dressed up and look great.  You need an awesome mascara with volume and pop for occassions like that.</li>
            <li> I received this for free for testing purposes only. So i got this i was surprised by the size and i though it was going to be difficult to put on the Mascara but it was not really. I have long eyelashes and it made them look much longer giving a fuller look.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite mascaras now. I&#x27;m so glad Influenster sent this product to me to try out. The #1 brush does a great job with lifting my lashes and giving it that great volume I was looking for and the #2 brush does a great job of intensifying the lashes. I would definitely be purchasing this mascara once I&#x27;m done with the one I have.</li>
            <li> i love covergirl, but this product is not the best, it is very clumpy and sticky, i do not recomend it. while i did hear about this product through influenster, i did not recieve it in my surfs up voxbox, i went out and bought it my self.</li>
            <li> I received this Covergirl mascara as part of my Surf&#x27;s Up Vox Box, and I have mixed reviews of it. It does actually help my lashes to curl up more, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it a lower score. The sttick is incredibly thick/too wide and the brushes are short, which makes it awkward to apply the mascara. It also makes it feel like there isn&#x27;t much makeup in the tubes and I would be annoyed at that if I had purchased it. Also it doesn&#x27;t say waterproof but I find it pretty difficult to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I just tried this today and &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; is pretty much exactly what I have to say about it. I think it&#x27;s clever having the two sides but pretty unnecessary. The first side went on fine but nothing to be super excited about then adding side number 2 mostly made it think and a tiny bit clumpy. I&#x27;ll keep it as backup but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice by any means.</li>
            <li> I have really long lashes so when I&#x27;m looking for a mascara, I look for something that will thicken my lashes and add volume. This mascara adds length, which makes my lashes look really spidery and weird. But on a positive note, the mascara doesn&#x27;t budge at all! Usually towards the end of the day, I rub my eyes a lot and then it gets all over my face but with this mascara, that is not the case! It staid put all day and looked fresh all day as well. So that&#x27;s awesome! But once again, not a mascara for me.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this mascara to begin with. It gave me big beautiful lashes that popped. The con of this waterproof mascara for me, was when I hopped into the shower, my eyes started burning. I took the mascara off, and they quit burning. It happened twice. Could be that my eyes are just sensitive, or it could be that it contains a harsher chemical. I was able to test this product for free using #Influenster in my #Surfsupvoxbox</li>
            <li> I received this mascara to try for free as part of the VoxBox I received from Influensta. I was sooooo excited to try this product. And even when I opened it and noticed there was a want at each end, one for lengthening and the other for thickening. So I put on step 1, which was the lengthening. The wand was very stiff and put on a very light coat. I really liked this part because it really pushes your eyelashes up. The 2nd step was to thicken your lashes. I applied the first coat, it seemed kind of sticky and clumped my lashes together instead of building up the product which I thought it would do. I tried step one over it to try to separate my lashes with no luck. I mean it didn&#x27;t look horrible, it just wasn&#x27;t amazing like I thought it would be. I&#x27;ve tried other drug store products that cost less than this product and give much better results. The plus side is that this stuff it really water proof. Like really waterproof!! Which is obviously a good thing! But I had no issue removing the product with an oil based make up remover.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the mascara, but goodness it&#x27;s a huge tube!  When wearing the mascara I did notice issues with my eyes, I&#x27;m a contact wearer and felt some discomfort on those days.  As far as the application, I did see a difference between Step 1 and Step 2 - Step 2 definitely maximizes the look!  I didn&#x27;t see much curling with Step 1....but I do already curl my lashes as part of my beauty routine.  Bottom line, would I buy it when this tube runs out?  No, I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I received this to try and write a review through influenster. Reading the reviews before trying it was scary but I loved this product. I&#x27;ve been using Clinique for years and this is just as good but at a lower price. Only problem I had was removing it.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this product from Influenster and I absolutely love it. It does exactly what it says, Bombshell Curvaceous. I love longer lashes because I don&#x27;t have long ones and they enhance your looks. I hate to get false eyelashes because they are uncomfortable. But with this Bombshell Curvaceous, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that.  A 2- step process with professional results. I had fuller, thicker lashes in only a few minutes. I absolutely love this mascara. My only small issue is that it seems really hard to get off before bed. Other than that, its fabulous. #BombShelling</li>
            <li> I received this Bombshell mascara complimentary from Influenster. I loved being able to test this product and I will definitely buy it in the future. It made my eyelashes have more curve and length without making them clump together. It stays all day without smearing. Great product !</li>
            <li> Oh I love this! Thought at first it would be a little much. Bot boy was I wrong.  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t clump! It made my eyes pop! Love Love love</li>
            <li> I received COVERGIRL&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara compliments of Influenster in the #SurfsUpVoxBox for testing and I was really impressed with the flair &amp; length it appeared to give my lashes! I didn&#x27;t have to apply multiple coats of the product either, 2 swipes of ends 1 &amp; 2 got the job done! It stays with you for long wear too. Be sure to have an oil based eye make-up remover to get it off though bc I couldn&#x27;t get it off with anything else &amp; even with the oil based remover it was a little work. Will definitely buy this product again :)</li>
            <li> I was not the biggest fan of this mascara. I like my make up routine to be quick, so the 2-step process didn&#x27;t really meet my needs. I also did not like the plasticy feel of the 1st brush. I know it&#x27;s designed that way to help break apart your lashes, but it was not my taste.</li>
            <li> I received this in my surfs up voxbox from influenster for testing purposes. I liked the look that I got from the two step process. I don&#x27;t think I would actually buy this for myself because I like simple things and having to basically apply two different mascaras is a little too much for me. But I have a wedding I&#x27;ll be attending in a couple weeks and will definitely use this in order to get some bombshelling lashes!</li>
            <li> I really love how easy &amp; fast this mascara covers! Great volume in just one coat. Didn&#x27;t really see the difference after applying the second step. Overall, great volume with just the right amount of curl to it!! If the second step would have made a change, I&#x27;d have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Hate it. Really hard to use the applicator because the part you hold is SO WIDE. I can&#x27;t get close to my face with it. And the mascara itself it&#x27;s not impressive. It&#x27;s just regular. Impossible to remove with makeup remover, and it didn&#x27;t come off so my eye swelled up the next day. Awful.</li>
            <li> I received Covergirl&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara through Influenster for a trial, and I am so happy I did! I am very impressed with how the two sides of the applicator worked together to give perfect - full yet defined lashes. I didn&#x27;t have any clumps or stray marks. My only complaint and reason for 4 stars is that the wands need to be longer, applying to my left eye (over my nose) was a little tricky as was getting to the corner of each lash. Overall though, a great product that I will add to my everyday routine.  I didn&#x27;t see that it was waterproof, but I will be interested to see how it does at the pool on 4th of July.</li>
            <li> The 1 to 2 step application process is so effortless! The mascara is not too thick and not to thin where you have to keep reapplying for fullness! I like to wear this on a bare face with minimal make up, because it makes your eyes pop!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I was given this to review as a member of Influenster.  I really like this mascara!  It holds curl well and stays all day.  The wand is a bit small for my liking, but I think it will grow on me.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I received the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about mascaras to begin with because I have super short lashes and I have yet to find a mascara that really lengthens and makes them noticeable without spending a lot of time curling and layering lots of product onto them.  I was very surprised to find that the Bombshell Curvaceous mascara did that pretty instantly.  To really test it, I didn&#x27;t curl my lashes ahead of time.  I simply started by adding a few coats with side 1 and then moved onto side 2, adding a few coats as well.  Surprisingly, the mascara definitely lengthened and curled my lashes without being clumpy.  I&#x27;ve started using this mascara as my daily wear.  For someone with barely any lashes to begin with, it&#x27;s nice to have something that actually accentuates my lashes without looking like I&#x27;ve tried too hard.</li>
            <li> I  received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster. I think this product is great.  I love there there are two  wands in the one bottle.  This mascara is really, really water proof so make sure you have oil based make-up remover or you will be wearing this mascara for days.  Overall, great product and very happy with it! I would purchase next time I need mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary for testing and review from Influenster in my Surfs Up Vox box. I have to admit I have not been a fan of Covergirl mascara ever in the past so I was pretty dang skeptical. I do like this dual step process and I must admit it really does give a very dramatic effect. As a woman who wears false lashes often this came really close to re-creating that look with my natural lashes. Very impressive! The wand is a tiny bit tricky to use as both sides are different but I got the hang of it quickly. I don&#x27;t like how hard it made my lashes (it actually made them rock hard and like they could break off) but that&#x27;s preference more than anything. This does need an oil based remover because it does NOT want to let go. I took a shower to test out its &amp;#34;waterproofness&amp;#34; and although there was a little black color running I would say its extremely minimal. Definitely a water resistant mascara! Also, post shower my lashes were still thickly coated fully with the mascara so that&#x27;s pretty impressive. All in all, really great product if you are looking for some serious drama and lasting ability! Good job Covergirl</li>
            <li> I got this mascara to try out through the Influenster Surfs Up Voxbox program. I was very excited to try this mascara it looked very promising! I was expecting big, luscious, thick eyelashes. However upon trying the dual system first applying the curve then the thickening mascara I was a bit let down. It is a good mascara, it gives big eyelashes just not exactly what I was expecting. Also, I have trouble taking the mascara off which I don&#x27;t like. I checked the packaging to assure it wasn&#x27;t waterproof so I don&#x27;t know if I either can&#x27;t read or if the mascara is actually hard to clean off. All in all, this is a very basic mascara. Nothing entirely special. I like the packaging of it mostly lol!</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous by Lashblast Mascara in Very Black from Influenster, complimentary for testing purposes only. There are two wands and two formulas. The first is for curling and volumizing. I was impressed with how my lashes grew and just popped by only using the first wand. When I applied the second wand and formula, it took it to a whole other level. My eyes were instantly big, bright and extra dramatic. The only drawback was when doing my left eye, because the wand felt a little short and I was afraid I would get it all over my lid. This lasted me all day long and into the night and did not budge. It must be removed with an oil-based makeup remover, or any oil. I used sweet almond oil, and that did the trick!</li>
            <li> I got this in a VoxBox from Influenster and I have to say... it&#x27;s great. It lasts FOREVER (seriously, you&#x27;ll need to use makeup remover or your lashes will be popping for days) and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free of charge for testing purposes from Influenster. I usually use M.A.C. mascara but haven&#x27;t found a way to go without false lashes as well as product. I was skeptical when I got this but I am seriously impressed. I will be using this for day time looks instead of my usual mascara/ false lash combo! It gives me full dark lashes with crazy volume and length. I will likely still use lashes from dramatic night time uses but will be using this product alone during the day and under my falsies at night! Love love love!</li>
            <li> I received this for free for review from Influenster for testing purposes and I Loved it. I love curvy, dark lashes and this was exactly what I was looking for. I was a little skeptical at first with the two sided wands but once I put on the first coat and then flipped it and did the second, wow what a difference and enhancement it made. The best part is you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot to look like a lot. It is found in all department stores and grocery establishments and under 10.00, which is the best part. You will feel like a Bombshell and look like one too!!</li>
            <li> Great mascara to have! Easy to put on and you have long lasting mascara that won&#x27;t run down your face at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!  I normally don&#x27;t use mascara because I feel that it pulls my lashes &amp; makes them feel weird - NOT THIS!  It made my lashes look long &amp; thick &amp; I never felt uncomfortable with the feel.  I highly recommend this, especially if you want to feel glamorous!!</li>
            <li> After seeing all the awesome reviews for this mascara via Influenster (I didn&#x27;t get one in my voxbox...insert frowny face here) I decided to buy a tube myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say it works very well! It took my lashes to new lengths! I mean...I don&#x27;t have eyes like Katy Perry (lol), but it did make my lashes look great! Plus it is affordable and available everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I could say is because of a design flaw.  I have wide eyes, so the wand is too short! The tube kept interfering with my application.  Other than that....loved it!</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this product! It really has staying power! The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it is very difficult to get off. You really have to have a good eye makeup remover in order to get this off without some of your lashes falling out. Besides that, it really has a great look and staying power.</li>
            <li> I love how this mascara doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like a lot of others that I&#x27;ve tried.  Step 1 does a great job of separating my lashes and step 2 really makes my eyes pop!  I had a little trouble getting it to come off, but overall I think it&#x27;s great! Note: I received this mascara via Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It is the blackest black. It keeps the clumps out! Love ittttt! I received this mascara free from influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> Liked it at first, but didn&#x27;t like the second step of the mascara, and very difficult to remove.. it made some of my lashes fall out...</li>
            <li> My lashes are full and dark. Just like i like them.. my mascara last all day with no need to reapply or touch up later.</li>
            <li> I recieved this mascara as part of a voxbox from Influenster!  At first I was amazed at how huge the tube is.  Its pretty massive.  Bombshell Curvaceous is a two part system mascara, with a volumizing and curling top coat, and a secondary intensifying coat.  What I like about Bombshell Curvaceous is how both brush heads are different...guaranteeing that you will get two different effects.  The first coat/brush does a good job of depositing color, volumizing, and the curved brush head does its part in getting those lashes to go up.  You then move on to the second coat and intensifying the look you already have.  It polishes off your lashes, giving length, seperation and awesome thickness.  The formula was nice in that I could build a few coats to increase the intensity to my liking.  I also appreciated that even in warm, humid weather, I experienced no smudging or flaking.</li>
            <li> I initially thought this would be more of a primer/mascara duo but it is 2 different shaped mascara wands to help you get longer looking lashes- this is much more about lengthening than volumizing but it goes on smoothly and looks pretty. My lashes were longer with this than my favorite benefit or make up forever mascaras. I received this free as a trial in my influenster voxbox.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love trying new products and thanks to @Influenster, I was able to try this one for testing purposes. I think Covergirl hit the jackpot with this new formula because this mascara is so amazing for my lashes. The color is dark and gives such a great curl. There is an even application of the mascara over all my lashes with every swipe. It was hard to get the wand inside the first few times because of how large it is but it got easier. The results are so great, I think this is better than Maybelline&#x27;s The Rocket which has been my favorite for a while.</li>
            <li> I received this totally free to try and review from Inflenster&lt;br /&gt;While it does make them super long  and it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin, the wand is too short and the container feels too fat.  Formula is ok but is very sticky and takes a long time to dry.  I don&#x27;t think the brush is good for the lower lashes.  It is hard to get off the skin, doesn&#x27;t want to wipe off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really got nothing to say about this stuff. It&#x27;s not great but it&#x27;s not bad either, just middle of the road. I&#x27;ll stick with my Lashblast for now, after 6 years with that, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d quit looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as a perk from #Influenster in a #voxbox &amp; I am in love! Best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good, however, it could use some slimming down. Being able to choose between the sides is a great selling point!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It gave the look of wearing fake eyelashes without the mess of trying to put fake ones. I would definitely recommend this to any girl who loves a strong dark eyelash!</li>
            <li> This is the mascara I wore on my wedding day and boy am I glad it held up to being water proof! In fact it was so wonderful at being waterproof I wore it again during our honeymoon for our stingray swim. It keeps my lashes looking beautiful through it all. I&#x27;m so happy I got to try this product thanks to Influenster, and you better believe when I am in the market for a new tube of mascara you now what I am picking up :-)</li>
            <li> Absolute WORST mascara I have ever used. The first time I tried it, I liked the results, dont get me wrong. It accentuated my lashes nicely and made them look thicker. BUT I will never have to use it again, because I can&#x27;t get the crap off. Every waterproof mascara I have used was no match for my makeup remover pads. THIS junk, however, has defeated all means of makeup remover. It feels like I super-glued my lashes together. And to make matters worse, it feels like glue soon after you use step two. My lashes on top stuck to my tiny lashes on bottom. WTF covergirl? Take my advice, do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because it was &amp;#34;on my wife&#x27;s list.&amp;#34;  She LOVES this mascara.  Says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the Covergirl Bombshell Curvasceous mascara that I received for complimentary testing purposes from Influenster! It&#x27;s two steps, which I normally don&#x27;t like because it ends up too heavy but worked perfectly in this case. It&#x27;s waterproof too so it&#x27;s perfect for summer. The black color is intense and bold and it volumes and DOES NOT clump. I will purchase this mascara in the future.</li>
            <li> I received Bombshell mascara from influenster surfs up vox box! I have used it a few times and am pretty happy with it. It I&#x27;d a little hard to take off though and at first can be kinda sticky till it dries. Overall like the look and enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  A little goes a long way though, so I only use a little bit each day.  Also, be sure to use a waterproof makeup remover.  Because of it&#x27;s long lasting qualities, it&#x27;s harder to remove.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara for testing purposes from Influenster in my Surf&#x27;s Up Vox Box. I really like this mascara for the stay put factor. It stays on all day, I even watched How to Train Your Dragon 2 with my kids (and cried) and it stayed put and looked just as good as when I first applied it!&lt;br /&gt;I will be using it from now on :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never loved Cover Girl mascaras, but I recently tried this mascara and it&#x27;s awesome.  It really coats and lengthens my lashes without getting clumpy and it stays on all day!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the COVERGIRL Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara. I was hesitant that it would not own up to all the claims it made, but it met them and beyond! It made my eyes beautiful with curved lashes while stilling keeping the natural beauty mixed it. There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about this product! All ladies who would love a natural yet bombshell look should try this amazing product</li>
            <li> Works ok but not the greatest. The curved end works better thAn the straight over all works fine but could be better</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara! I am extremely picky about what mascara I use, and this passed all my test! It does not clump when you put it on, it stays on all day without giving you raccoon eyes, and on top of that it makes your lashes look amazing! I would defiantly recommend this, it is a game changer!! Thanks Influenster for my free sample!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend Covergirls&#x27;s Bombshell Curvaceous mascara to anybody looking for a new daily mascara - especially for the summer! Mine wasn&#x27;t labeled as waterproof, but it mostly worked that way. I had absolutely zero issues with it coming off/running off/flecking off during the day, even when I spent it at the beach/pool. This was my first dual-wanded mascara too, and I was very pleased with its turn out. I&#x27;m definitely one of those people that feels like they have to use both a lengthening AND a volumizing mascara to get what they want, but it&#x27;s all conveniently packed into one tube here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I encountered with this mascara was that it was still a little difficult to remove, even with makeup remover, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip I have to offer to others like me who have basically non-existant lashes: Do the lengthening/curling step 1, the volumizing step 2, and then step 1 again. Performing step 1 that second time helped better distribute the mascara that was laid down for volume, and it helped add more length while avoiding clumps. Try it out!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes from influencers.&lt;br /&gt;I personally use covergirl mascara, so i was excited to recieve this product. I love how it gives me eyelashes since mine are short, but i dont like that its kinda hard to remove and sticky.</li>
            <li> I typically buy $30 mascara but got this one for free from influenster. I am glad I did. It made my eyelashes longer and bolder than my expensive mascara. It also lasted all day without smudging or flaking.The only issue I have is the tube is so thick that it makes it hard to hold when applying. Regardless, I will keep using it and would definitely recommend others to try it if they are looking to change things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-LauraS (John&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look great! A lot better than what I was using before. Got this for free to try and review from influenster</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product in my Influenster Surfs Up VoxBox, and I wasn&#x27;t excited to try it, since I was very loyal to my old mascara. However, this is the best mascara ever. Seriously. Even my husband, who is the most unobservant human being in the universe when it comes to my makeup noticed how long my eyelashes look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip - don&#x27;t touch your lashes while the product is drying. They will clump like crazy, and you&#x27;ll have to remove and start over. I sneezed really hard and mashed them all up. Not beautiful.</li>
            <li> Received this for testing purposes complimentary from Influenster. Love this stuff! Works great and goes on easily! Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I recieved a free sample of this product in my influenster Surfs Up VoxBox and was very eager to try it out. It gives you very dramatic color, volume and it stays on. The second applicant seemed to lock the look in place. This mascara lasted all night! Not for someone who prefers a more natural lash look. Be sure to have your oil based makeup removed on hand when you&#x27;re ready to wash it off - it really does stay otherwise.</li>
            <li> I received this Covergirl Bombshell Curvaceous from @Influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply. You uncap the one that says &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and apply using the curly wand to lashes to add curl. Then after you screw it back in, you unscrew the second wand &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; and apply to lashes with the straight wand to add volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an instant change. After applying the first coat, it felt a bit sticky but pretty good. Then when i added the second coat from the second wand, BOOM! Volume! My tiny lashes were visible! Pretty good product, and I don&#x27;t doubt it one bit since my mother and I are hardcore Covergirl fans! ❤️😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I tried Bombshell Curvaceous!  I use a ton of mascara and need to make sure that I get a bang for my buck.  Curvaceous gives a great curl and color from a drugstore brand!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a big cover girl fan and when I had the chance to try this product for influencer I was very excited and was not disappointed. I&#x27;m the type of girl who has always had trouble with mascara and the times that I&#x27;ve used it I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a mascara that will give my lashes volume and hold my curl at the same time and this mascara did both, it is definitely my new fav</li>
            <li> I received this mascara courtesy of Influenster in my Voxbox. I have to say that I&#x27;m very picky about mascara and I really like this one. It gives you length and volume without being clumpy. I would recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  The first time I screwed up and did two coats of the Step 1 and it made my lashes stick together a bit.  THEN I read the instructions, which say to only do one coat of the Step 1.  This is probably the longest my lashes have ever looked.  It doesn&#x27;t make them look real thick though, they look thin and defined, but I like that because I don&#x27;t want my lashes looking like one mass across my eye.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mascara for any occasion. It is absolutely amazing and the best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge. I recommend this to everyone, and I challenge you to test it against your favorite mascara and try not to fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous mascara!  My lashes look amazing. Like any waterproof product,  takes some work to remove but the time is well worth this amount of definition and volume at the same time. My new favorite eye product!</li>
            <li> I like the result that I get but it is a bit sticky. My lashes kept sticking together and aggravating me. But I liked it overall.  I got mine complimentary from influenster for testing purposes, I think the retail price isn&#x27;t bad though.</li>
            <li> I got this for free to try from Influenster and I love it. It goes on smooth and really makes my lashes look long and curvy. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Love this makes my eyelashes look very full! And I wear less make up because if its beautiful bold curves!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from influenster. Its not a bad mascara, it didn&#x27;t really do much  for volume, but it added some length and lift to my lashes. It went on very smooth, with no clumping really. Overall it is a pretty nice mascara, with good color and definition.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from influenster for testing purposes. I like how it works, but the wand is SO big that it&#x27;s hard to apply without feeling awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people have said that it is hard to get off, but I used oil-based remover that I use for my waterproof mascara and I didn&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t work fast enough, it does get a bit clumpy, but it made my lashes HUGE!</li>
            <li> I got this product free for review from Influenster.  I am not a huge makeup fan, but this did the trick for a wedding I had this weekend.  I definitely would not wear this every day, but it was good for a special occasion.  Stayed on for a long time and wasn&#x27;t too hard to get off with an oil based makeup cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I’m one of those people who love the “spider” look of my eyelashes, and this mascara not only has one but two mascaras to give me that look. They only complaint that I have about this mascara is that it is oil based. When coming from some wear and you’re tired or just utterly lazy like me, oil based mascara tend to become very difficult to remove. One could just use make up remover but I am all about being frugal sometimes and when a mascara is water based it is easy to take off with a little soap and water or water by itself. Other than that, the Bombshell Curvaceous is going on my shopping list, and probably some make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just got my SurfupVoxBox from influenster. I didnt received the mascara with my box but I already have had it,  since it came out and am almost done. I just wanted to post my review since am very happy with the product and will repurchase soon. Great price and the mascara hold on all day, not clumpy, not flaky, makes my lashesh huge and thick.</li>
            <li> Received this product via Influenster free! Love it! Fully coated my lashes and gave them the curve I was going for with very little clumping. Just curl lashes before applying for optimal look.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Influenster to test, and was so excited to try it out after hearing many good things about it. I really love that it has the two different brushes, allowing you to hit your  lashes from every angle. The formula is overall nice, and i like the dark and dramatic shade of black.  I would definitely recommend this to others to try, its unique from every other brush application out there.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. I got it early today as a complimentary test product from Influenster and I fell instantly in love. For me, it seems the curved side really adds length and the regular side adds volume. You can use each brush separately or together for maximum drama. I generally need heated eyelash curlers to get any curl into my lashes but even without a curler, this mascara adds enough curl to look great. The consistency is also great (which is usually a big factor for me). The consistency is perfect for plumping the lashes without wetting them so much that the curl gets relaxed. My new favorite!</li>
            <li> It made my lashes look great! It does not get full stars because I have found mascaras that do the same thing without having to use two different wands. On the other hand if you already love layering mascara this won&#x27;t bother you one bit. The other reason it does not get 5 starts is how hard it is to get off! I know they say to use an oil bases eye makeup remover but if I can&#x27;t use my current eye makeup remover I really don&#x27;t see the point of bothering... It&#x27;s not a bad product by any means, it just requires a bit more extra work.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara! Typically, I am strictly a Benefit Cosmetics mascara kind of girl but this CoverGirl Bombshell mascara definitely lived up to my mascara standards. I will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> So I received covergirl bombshell curvaceous mascara by lashblast totally free through influenster in my surfs up voxbox to test out. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars due to my very own personal unliking. First thing I didn&#x27;t like were the mascara wands, I found them to be bulky and I had difficulty putting on the mascara without getting all over my eyelids. I&#x27;m sure within time I will get used to it more but this review is based on my very first time testing this product out. The other thing I personally didn&#x27;t like was that the actual tube with the mascara is about the size of my thumb. Once again this is just a personal preference. What I did love was that the mascara does what it claims it can do. My eyelashes were intensifyingly volumized and curled. I do think this is a great mascara and even with my very own personal dislikes I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary Bombshell mascara from Influenster for testing and reviewing. This mascara gave me length, but no volume. The mascara is hard to take off too. It comes off the wand too thick and dries very quickly, not giving you enough time to wipe off of skin easily. It also makes your lashes feel like straw.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this mascara. This is the only one I have used that makes my lashes long and full. I think this will be my go to mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> Thanks to influenster I received this mascara free to try and I&#x27;m so glad they did! I was not interested in trying this mascara at all after reading reviews, but after trying it I&#x27;m now a fan and would recommend this mascara to any make up junkie! You get some serious curve and plush with this mascara! Just make sure to use make up remover to take it off (or even just lotion on a cotton round).</li>
            <li> Love Love Love. This is a great mascara!  I got this product complements of influenster I will be repurchasing it when I am out of it!</li>
            <li> I received this fabulous mascara from #Influenster compliments of my #Voxbox. I must say i was very impressed. This really extended my already long lashes which I dident even think was possible. The wand was very easy to use and apply, however it did take quite a bit of product to get the long lashes I desired. Also be sure to have a VERY good eye makeup remover as this does NOT come off.. After a full day of swimming, and NO running of the mascara I really put it to the test and the only thing that removed it was an oil based makeup remover. Overall I loved it and would highly reccomend</li>
            <li> Love this product! Received in my influenster box that I received complimentary for testing purposes! Best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> When I used this the first problem was it didn&#x27;t dry for about an hour. That caused my top and bottom lashes to stick together. The smell of it is terrible. Once it dried, my eyes became red and itchy, obviously its not hypoallergenic. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> All i can say is it doesn&#x27;t work great for my eyes, but stays on and holds. I  would like it if the wand was a different shape and that the container wasn&#x27;t so large. Its not easy to stow in a small purse.</li>
            <li> This mascara is point-blank perfect as long as you&#x27;re only in the application or wearing stage. What&#x27;s important to note is the special technique of washing it off at night. Regular oil-free facial cleanser will NOT get this stuff off. More on this ahead...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara&#x27;s 2-step application is a foolproof and adjustable way to make sure you get your eye look just the way you want it. If you want a mega volume boost, do a little more of step 1; if you&#x27;re feeling like you&#x27;d like to accentuate more length, do a little more of step 2. The two together are absolutely incredible (and I&#x27;m very picky about my mascaras!) - I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who thinks a little extra time in makeup removal is worth the stunning look perfect for day or night, that this mascara provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal tips: What works best is an oil-based eye makeup remover. If you don&#x27;t have that or if it doesn&#x27;t work well on your skin, other good options include Vaseline/Aquaphor and Ponds Cold Cream Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this mascara courtesy of Influenster.com and am writing this review for product testing purposes - that said, the product has been tested and approved by this particular user!*</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster for testing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it, this is the first time i&#x27;ve ever tried Covergirl mascara. My eyelashes were so long and pretty all day long. Also I didn&#x27;t really follow the instructions for taking it off with an oil based makeup remover so it stayed on for a while which is good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not a make up person, the only time I wear make up is when I have to get dressed up to go somewhere nice in which I normally just put on eye shadow. But I took some time the other day to actually put this mascara on (I never wear mascara because I have contacts in all day and normally end up touching my eye lashes and getting it everywhere) and it actually looks really nice. I have naturally long eye lashes that curl on their own, but this mascara gave it a nice little boost that my eye lashes needed. It makes me actually want to wear it more since I now have one (which I received free from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes) to use. Definitely give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I received this free for trial purposes from influenster. Cover girl has always had my favorite drugstore mascaras. This makes my lashes look so big!</li>
            <li> First of this is HUGE for a mascara. Besides the weird smell, its pretty awesome.  Its fine comb will separate all your lashes evenly with the first step.  Use the the other side for more dramatic color.  I usually just stick with only step one and run out the door. It dries rather quick as well. over all I would buy it.  I revived it for reviewing purposes through influenster voxbox.</li>
            <li> I just received this as a tester to review in my Influenster Surf&#x27;s up VoxBox. I was excited to receive a full product as a tester, but I was not all that impressed with the product itself, especially for the price. I think that they need to reevaluate the product to not be so sticky and thick. It made my eyelashes look pasted on and it took a while to remove it once I had put it on.</li>
            <li> the tube is too big.....makes it too hard to handle.....as far as the mascara ....does not go on as good as i like......</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster and CoverGirl for testing/reviewing purposes. That in no way affects my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love the product. You can lengthen your lashes with one end and thicken them with the other, leaving you with lashes that stand out. I did have some clumping issues but it wasn&#x27;t anything I could fix quickly. It&#x27;s also very waterproof and you&#x27;ll need actual make remover to clean it off. I definitely look forward to using this more!</li>
            <li> I received this for testing purposes from Influenster for free.  I personally didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;lashes falling out&amp;#34; problems.  I wore this for 12 hours and was impressed that it did curl and lengthen my already long lashes.  I did find this mascara to be &amp;#34;stickier&amp;#34; than other mascaras I have used.  After 12 hours of wearing it was still tacky before I took it off.  Not sure if this is a problem for anyone else, personally it didn&#x27;t affect my opinion or its effects.  For a generic brand (as opposed to CK, Benefit, M.A.C) it was a decent mascara.  I would likely purchase again if I needed a cheaper mascara.  Oh and the bottle itself, is pretty big!  My boyfriend&#x27;s family thought it was a tampon I was leaving around with my other make-up.</li>
            <li> My thoughts on @CoverGirl Bombshell Curvaceous #bombshelling #mascara which I received for free from the #influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox. The product is double ended and contains two kinds of mascara which you layer for a unique look. The thing is HUGE. I wish it were smaller. Disclaimer: I&#x27;m no pro when it comes to mascara! The first mascara was great. It went on well and wasn&#x27;t clumpy. The second just felt like too much. I had a hard time applying it without clumping. Hopefully as I use it more I&#x27;ll get better. The upper right photo is the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; shot and the bottom two are after. I liked the way it looked. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this myself. I believe it retails for $8 or $9. I normally use high-end sample mascara freebies from Sephora.</li>
            <li> This was a product I received for free from Influenster to test and review. So far I am a fan! I like that it is long lasting. I work 12 hour shifts and I don&#x27;t want my make up drooping by the end. It definitely adds volume but you have to be careful how much you apply because it can get clumpy. Follow the instructions on removing and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! The first one aligns my lashes to keep them looking full. The second one tops the lashes to give them a movie star make up finish. If I want to look more natural I just use the first step. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I received this in my Influenster VoxBox. I like the mascara. It makes lashes appear longer and dramatic. It does require a little elbow grease to remove.</li>
            <li> Adds volume&lt;br /&gt;Applies evenly&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump&lt;br /&gt;Great brush&lt;br /&gt;Length&lt;br /&gt;i love this mascra,and i am very picky when it comes to mascara this totally adds volume to your lashes as it goes on evenly theres no clumping which is a big big plus! its a great brush so when applying its actually giving you length in your lashes,my lashes are light and short but covergirl bombshell curvacecous made my eyes smokin hot! a must buy 4 sure</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara especially with long eyelashes. I liked the separation I got from first coat and the fullness from the second. The second coat really made the black pop. I didn&#x27;t like that it started to clump some after applying a second coat of (2). I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with the thickening and clumps with other mascaras it might just be the sealed style. I did not use an oil based eye make up remover and had no problem removing my eye make up. I washed my face first and then used the Mary Kay eye make up remover and was able to remove my mascara without ripping my eyelashes out like some might have done without an eye make up remover. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Out of the various mascaras I have received recently this one is my favorite. It is easy to apply with the curved brush. It is weird to use such a small wand. It will smear a little and is a little hard to take off. I did receive this mascara complimentary as a tester from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. #SurfsUpVoxBox. I was excited to receive a full size product and couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out.  The first coat went on great, but once I put the second coat on it became sticky and clumpy. My eyelashes actually stuck to my face when I blinked.  Taking it off was also a chore, even with an oil based remover.</li>
            <li> I have very thin long eyelashes, I am also allergic to most make up. It did all it was said to do. My eyelashes looked AWESOME, but I paid for it. Mine is a very rare allergy, (I can&#x27;t even take immunizations) but given a good reason (important night with my guy) I would wear it for the look!</li>
            <li> So I got this item courtesy of influenster for testing purposes and I love it. It definitely intensifies the look of my eyelashes. I do agree it does make my lashes sticky after I out on the second coat but once it dries holy eyelashes. As far as removing the mascara as long as you have a good waterproof makeup remover you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> This mascara made my lashes appear much longer and fuller without looking clumpy.  It applies easy and drys fast. It lasts all day and does require eye makeup remover. Love it and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Got this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster and I really like it! I love the double wand and it doesn&#x27;t clump together like many other mascara that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Will definitely buy this in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this free from #influenster in their #surfsupvoxbox! I loved this mascara! My eyelashes didn&#x27;t clump and it removed easier than my mascara before. I thought the tube was too big but it&#x27;s size makes it easy to find in the bottom of my purse. :) I would highly recommend this mascara and will be buying this when my tube runs out!</li>
            <li> This mascara promises curl and intense dark finish all day, and it delivers. My problem with this mascara is that its extremely sticky! All my lashes stick together, some like that look, i absolutely hate it! BEWARE of removal. I used an eye makeup removal oil and i still couldn&#x27;t get it all off. I felt a heavy residue on the lashes still, and my eyelashes are way less full than they used to be because the removal process made lots of them fall out :( I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this mascara. I truly gave it a fair trial, I used it a few times and each time I hated it even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this mascara free for testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I got this product via influenster. It is a good working mascara, though the need to use an oil based makeup remover is a bit annoying. Other than that it does its job .</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from Influenster for testing. I thought it was a good product on the whole. The stick is well made, so my fingers don&#x27;t get dirty after putting on mascara. It dries quickly, meaning my eyes don&#x27;t get those black streaks. It does a great job of curling and darkening my lashes in a way that is quick and easy. I like how there are two sides, so you could choose one or the other functions depending on your needs. It stays on a long time. Fortunately, I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews with it not coming off. Mine came off in the shower last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish it did a better job of was making my individual lashes look thicker. My lashes look curlier, longer, and darker, but they still look pretty thin, :-(.</li>
            <li> The wands are too short and one side clumps! It does make my lashes look fantastic! I love how much they pop when I wear bombshell!</li>
            <li> I like that this mascara has two brushes. The curved one is ideal for the upper lashes. It makes it easier for me to easily apply mascara to all my lashes. The other brush is good for the lower lashes. This mascara has a formula that does apply smoothly, but then gets sticky and clumpy. I gave it 4 stars because even though i like it i wouldn&#x27;t trade my current mascaras for this one. If you want a subtle touch of mascara, neat and no clumping this is for you. If you are like me and love that intense lash effect then this will not do your eyes justice. I think this is a great mascara if your just looking to have a quick fresh up in the morning when running late. OVERALL this is a good product and i would recommend others to try it. I purchased this product after I saw some lucky friends who received this product in their Influenster vox box complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> i love this mascara! influenster sent this to me for free to test and its amazing. i even went swimming with it and i didnt look like a raccoon afterwards. people say it gets clumpy, but i love the thickness of it!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. I&#x27;ll never go back to my last mascara again. TOTAL GAME CHANGER.</li>
            <li> I received a free cover girl bombshell from influenster for testing purposes and I was impressed by how long and thick it actually made my lashes. I will definitely be purchasing this mascara when my other runs out!!</li>
            <li> I received this complementary from Influenster to sample and review. I am so pleased with this product. It is long lasting and really makes my lashes look defined. The only compliant I might have would be that is takes a little effort to take it off at night.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s a long lasting mascara and worth trying. You will definitely begin to see results when using this. Makes your eyes stand out.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test from Influenster.com  in my #SurfsUpVoxBox. I normally use covergirl mascara that is waterproof. This clearly isn&#x27;t from what I looked like after only a few hours. I admit my eyes water a lot, but the other covergirl waterproof mascara works.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a mascara junkie and have tried just about everything out there. This mascara definitely has staying power and can handle the AZ heat. Unfortunately it is VERY hard to remove, even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Two-step mascaras have never really been my first choice so I havnt bought one in a while. I received one from Influenster and decided to give it a shot. It worked pretty okay. I just had to be careful when applying because it clumps easily. The mascara was a bit tough to remove even though it isn&#x27;t even a waterproof mascara. I would not buy this though. There are other mascaras from this brand that work alot better.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my lashes more noticeable, but is a lot of work to get off.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s amazing how I have curl and add volume with 1 tube. My lashes were more defined and seemed fuller. This mascara is also pretty waterproof so even after a dip in the pool it wasn&#x27;t running down my face. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sexy waterproof look!</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as part of a Birchbox &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; box and was pretty excited to try it. In the end though, it ended up being just okay for me. When I tried to move on the second step, I experienced a lot of stickiness and clumping. Then I noticed excess mascara on my eyelid that had to be removed with eye makeup remover. Overall, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try compliments of influenster, and I really like it. It gives a lot of length and volume. I especially like the first wand. If you like really bold lashes this is great, especially for a night out. My only gripe is that it&#x27;s extremely humid where I live and I think it caused a bit of fall out, but nothing a q-tip couldn&#x27;t fix ^^</li>
            <li> This mascara gives you amazingly long lashes. It lasts all day and there&#x27;s no raccoon eyes with this formula. The drawbacks are 1) You need an oil based make-up remover to remove it, 2) the wand is short and the container is bulky making application less than ideal.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from influencer for free to try and review and I have to say I fell in love with it! I wasn&#x27;t much for using mascara before I tried this and now I wear it every time I wear make up. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and curvy. I will defiantly be buying this in the future!</li>
            <li> This product was hyped on PureWow (an online blog), and I thought it&lt;br /&gt;might be a far less expensive alternative to my Lancome mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried it once, and that was it--it&#x27;s hard to apply, and it clumps.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to my outstanding Lancome duo--Hypnose Drama and L&#x27;Extreme--&lt;br /&gt;which I&#x27;ve worn for decades and which create gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I have thin eyelashes and wanted the look of thicker ones.  It  stays on all day and I have fuller lashes, but it makes my lashes terribly stiff.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a sample in my Surf&#x27;s Up VoxBox from Influenster. I love how long lasting the mascara is. It literally lasts all day without flaking or smudging! It also has a really dark, pigmented color that makes eyelashes super dark and dramatic. This mascara tends to clump more often than other brands I have used. I often had to separate my eyelashes using a comb or hair pin before they looked acceptable. Additionally, the long lasting mascara is great until you have to take it off. Even with oil-based makeup remover, all of the mascara doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> The mascara is okay overall but I have tried way better. The wand applicator is weird and one of the sides should have a primer that is white or clear instead of two black liquids. It is also very hard on my lashes. It makes the feel crunchy. This stuff does not come off unless you use oil based eye makeup remover. It does make the lashes look nice and curled like promised but i think the formula could be better.</li>
            <li> I do like this mascara a lot! But I can not wear it every day. So I only use it for special nights out</li>
            <li> Almost TOO good... Lashes look great, and very very waterproof. Like borderline tough to get off, which is exactly what I wanted bc my eyes get watery and I can end up raccoony easily, but not with this stuff!</li>
