            <li>Also, its a great price!  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m still in search for the perfect all natural/organic liquid eyeliner pen</li>
            <li>The swatch was very impressive!</li>
            <li>Perfect eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>If Physician&#x27;s Formula could change this, it would be the perfect eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li>This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m probably on my 9th one now.</li>
            <li>I have never been so impressed by a make-up</li>
            <li>So this is a rather excellent eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I bought a brown one from another site and it was one of the best eyeliners I had ever used.</li>
            <li>I had heard wonderful things about this mascara</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is incredible!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten an excellent 16 hour use out of one application with zero smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li>and  actually very good</li>
            <li>Truly the best I&#x27;ve found, and great for cat eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for the price!</li>
            <li>Great product and very good seller</li>
            <li>But the line it creates is exceptional!  </li>
            <li>GREAT price.</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT and I will use this from now on.  </li>
            <li>great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price for the product you get.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to update this review to four stars.  </li>
            <li>eyeliner itself is great too.</li>
            <li>I have been using the liner for about a month now and my lashes are looking really great.  </li>
            <li>Great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I found it great buenisimo and durable</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s also just a GREAT eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This works great, the eyeliner and the serum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product if you dont care about the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Great eyeliner, not as long-lasting as I would like, however.  </li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>This one works great...</li>
            <li>I am always searching for a great all-day/waterproof eyeliner and this one comes close to being the one.</li>
            <li>It might be a great product for others</li>
            <li>The brush like pen was great</li>
            <li>The brush part is not too flimsy and I have great control over it.</li>
            <li>Formula never flakes or fades and has a great depth of color.</li>
            <li>Great find.</li>
            <li>amazing applicator!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>it works the best I wish more stores carried it.</li>
            <li>but the price is so much better on amazon, it is a good value!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this product for this reason but it is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>it stays on, doesn&#x27;t burn or flake off, and is very easy to apply!</li>
            <li>I read the great reviews about how this eyeliner is so amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>But I recommend this liner because of its perfect tapered brush tip that blows any felt tip or cheap</li>
            <li>Good pigment and staying power too.</li>
            <li>It went away when I stated using Latisse which I loved.</li>
            <li>and I really loved it until I noticed my eyes started getting itchy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>But the good thing about this is that even if it is not truly waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t smear into raccoon eyes when it&#x27;s coming off from water, sweat or tears.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good buy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner!!!</li>
            <li>The best and most precise brush ever</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as perfect as Dior with a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>Satisfied!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner!  </li>

            <li>is product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Either way, i have never found an eyeliner so amazing as this one.</li>
            <li>precisely so I consider that a win.</li>
            <li>I initially liked this product because it was the way i pictured it to be.</li>
            <li>But this is a nice every day look.</li>
            <li>That so good i love it💞</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as an eyeliner I really liked it.</li>
            <li>excellent product really grow eyelashes ago</li>
            <li>Nice liner</li>
            <li>This one is the absolute  best eyeliner  ever.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice cat-eye look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the eyeliner itself is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>Super happy with the fast delivery and awesome product.</li>
            <li>This is a really good and easy to use eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to control.</li>
            <li>&amp; we feel better about her wearing it more often!</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the price and the good quality of the applicator: it&#x27;s very precise and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>In any case, I am so incredibly thrilled to be able to recommend this again and to use it again.  </li>
            <li>This is best liquid eyeliner by far, and I have tried a lot.</li>
            <li>it looks beautiful at first, but in 30 minutes having to re-apply.  </li>
            <li>By far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great eyeliner, the best even, except as many other reviewers have noted...</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and it lasts almost all day!</li>
            <li>It comes off easy and the tube itself lasts forever!</li>
            <li>The brush-tip pen is very fine</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about my eyelash growth but this is very easy to put on and STAYS where I put it!!  </li>
            <li>Love it the best i ever try so far....</li>
            <li>This was great when I first started experimenting with liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>When I first used the product it worked great</li>
            <li>and it looked great on the first try.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery !!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner so much, it&#x27;s very precise and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>So easy, I bought it for my mother who&#x27;s 63 and never wears eyeliner and even SHE liked it.</li>
            <li>No, I haven&#x27;t turned into a glamour girl, but it&#x27;s certainly improved my appearance  and made my eyes appear more expressive.  </li>
            <li>so I tried it 2 more times to make sure there wasn&#x27;t another factor.</li>
            <li>I recommend to all my friends and they love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear eyeliner for years.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping for the best, but expecting the same results.</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;ve gone without eyeliner for so many years.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush liner which is so much better than the felt tip liners.</li>
            <li>Better to stick to Dermacol liquid eyeliner..</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like most liquid eyeliners do.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has no harmful chemicals in it</li>
            <li>like so many eyeliners do.</li>
            <li>This product is the reason I will never be satisfied with anything but a brush tip liner for cat eyes again.  </li>
            <li>I could tell it would come off if the skin was more oily.</li>
            <li>This time, when I stopped using the Rimmel Serum and started using this one, the lashes did not fall off and still look healthy.</li>
            <li>I am not saying they look like falsies, but they look better than before I started using serums.</li>
            <li>So please! :)</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s probably why since most liners smudge on me).</li>
            <li>Love it and inexpensive</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So glad to have found this.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>You probably won&#x27;t find a better drugstore eyeliner for the cost</li>
            <li>then it works its magic during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most eyeliners  make me look like I have been bawling after my workout.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is extremely outstanding if it&#x27;s a dupe for another brand it will be Dior</li>
            <li>Anyway, still 5 stars as I love the liner</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for more than 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>, it slides smoothly and stays all day !</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my most precious makeup product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Like I have more of them, and they are longer and stronger.</li>
            <li>Yep, definitely MORE lashes.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I know and love.</li>
            <li>just wish it was a more darker</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>~ it doesn&#x27;t change for the better.  </li>
            <li>So I did my research on this product, saw that across the board, on every site that carried it, people overwhelmingly raved about this liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can create really nice and accurate lines with practice.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that my lashes are any more longer or fuller, however, but that is not the reason why I use this product.</li>
            <li>I have anxiety which causes my hands to shake incessantly, which meant until I found this liquid eyeliner, I wasn&#x27;t able to use liquid eyeliner &amp; had to settle for pencil, which never turned out quite the way I like it.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Favorite eyeliner EVER.</li>
            <li>Am still waiting for these magical eye lashes the product guarantees.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>the liner traces pretty good</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not because she has sensitive eyes like mine, but because it is so easy to put on!!!</li>
            <li>The best part is how long just one tube of it lasts!  </li>
            <li>The product arived on time in its original packaging and did not disappoint, it is truly a lengthening mascara!</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s dry it looks awesome and it won&#x27;t smear (unless you rub your eyes or something.</li>
            <li>I have used MANY high end products, and this is as good as, or better than, all of them.</li>
            <li>It gives just as fine and precise of a line, plus it has the added benefit of lash-boosting serum!</li>
            <li>The liner did not come in original packaging, but overall I think this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Easy to control and comes on nice and bold, just how I like it.  </li>
            <li>it looks great and natural.  </li>
            <li>What else is there to say other than it&#x27;s awesome?</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for in an eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I was looking for low/no irritation and easy apply liquid liner.</li>
            <li>this is the eyeliner u should get,applies easy and looks awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so so SO easy to use.</li>
            <li>This liner is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, but...</li>
            <li>Easy to take off with make-up remover.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, but does eventually flake by end of the day.</li>
            <li>Goes on so easily and easy to manage application.  </li>
            <li>It works so easily.</li>
            <li>For me this doesn&#x27;t smudge and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but I can apply it easily and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>While it does not smear just from use, you can easily remove it with a damp paper</li>
            <li>I like that if you make a mistake, it is easy to remove with just water and a q-tip.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use, very smooth, quick drying and</li>
            <li>It stayed on all day which is amazing since I have pretty greasy eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Best liquid eyeliner ever, hands down.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best drugstore liquid eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is the right amount of black, it applies smoothly and evenly, it lasts all day (which is impressive because I work outside in Florida), and the tip doesn&#x27;t fray/deform/whatever after a ton of uses--which means my cat eye is perfect every time.</li>
            <li>the point was so fine that it applied so well.</li>
            <li>Pen is easily controlled and product rolls out smoothly.</li>
            <li>Goes on fine, haven&#x27;t yet noticed results</li>
            <li>It was a wonderful liquid eyeliner except that the black color is watery.</li>
            <li>and it will work just fine.  </li>
            <li>this became a huge problem because instead of having fine lines</li>
            <li>but most importantly, it GLIDES so very very well!</li>
            <li>This will be my primary eyeliner</li>
            <li>The application brush glides on smooth &amp; the tip gives a precise point.  </li>
            <li>I work from home and my dogs don&#x27;t care if I have makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free makeup brand.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays put, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>She has to reapply a couple of times during a show because it wipes off easily, but it&#x27;s easier to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>You can make a realllly precise line with it.</li>
            <li>It makes up for that in the precise application and durable set of the liquid, so I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The finish has a light satin sheen.</li>
            <li>Does not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have to shake more than 20 seconds initially.  </li>
            <li>Even after a long, hot day running around waitressing, it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>The color was very black (ultrablack) which is awesome.</li>
            <li>physicians formula products are generally of good quality and this one is no less.</li>
            <li>The tip is really defined and pointed for a more accurate and precise application and the liquid is smooth and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>Since the formula is more natural and safer than most eyeliners, I don&#x27;t mind the fact it can come off easily.</li>
            <li>For that price I think it&#x27;s a really good product and as good as 20/25 dollars eyeliners I bought from Sephora in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to fix mistakes with this pen as it doesn&#x27;t set quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the actual &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; tip, and for a liquid liner it dries quickly and fairly opaque.</li>
            <li>It is also super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it &amp;#34;boosts eyelash growth&amp;#34;, but it goes on super easy and is very easy to do the &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>See original two-star review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When this product first came out, it was definitely instantly in my top 5 list of fave makeup products ever.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about this eyeliner that I purchased 2.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use it again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it can beat some of the higher end brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the eyelash serum claims, but this is an excellent eyeliner that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever been able to use liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the 10 bucks at the drug store!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really works as lashes enhancer, but it permits me to draw my cat eyes so easily that it&#x27;s now my favourite eyeliner !</li>
            <li>With this eyeliner I was able to have a perfect line on both eyes in ten seconds flat!</li>
            <li>The tip is precise and not too soft it allows a nice application.  </li>
            <li>Great for quick application, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The brush is the best I&#x27;ve found and is so much easier to use than felt or other types of liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>the whites of my eyes turn bright red after wearing this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I have to put another &#x27;real&#x27; liner on top of it to get a liner effect like I would want.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really verify the eyelash boosting part of it&#x27;s claim to fame, but regardless it&#x27;s a lovely eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought it in brown to give as a gift</li>
            <li>Looks good - have only used twice.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>all in one stroke, all without reapplying more make up to the brush because it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>I would say that it stays in tip top condition up to 8 hours, and does not fade away much after that either ....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to love it so much.  </li>
            <li>ELF is what I used before I tried this out, and I love the ELF company and its whole line</li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, yes it had faded somewhat by that point, but it hadn&#x27;t smeared or peeled or flaked.</li>
            <li>This is SO easy to use and create smooth, straight lines with...I&#x27;m just used to using a pencil because it is faster, so I don&#x27;t use this as often.</li>
            <li>It comes of pretty easily, as well.</li>
            <li>The flip side is that it smudges quickly and the color goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>My second most favorite eye-liner.</li>
            <li>Plus, you are more likely to put this on because you&#x27;re already wearing eyeliner on most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it quickly dries up.</li>
            <li>It even survives most of my high intensity Roller Derby practices.  </li>
            <li>Ultra black is a great color and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because the reviews were pretty good, but I had a very different experience.</li>
            <li>AND not only does it make it long, the liquid itself if awesome.</li>
            <li>I really like the easy to apply tip, and for a drugstore eyeliner, I don&#x27;t think you can beat it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my eyelashes, but it&#x27;s still more than worth the money just because it&#x27;s such a fantastic liner.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t imagine who would enjoy this product now, since it doesn&#x27;t provide an opaque line.  </li>
            <li>and i have to say it was so worth</li>
            <li>I rarely have to use a q-tip for fixes when I apply</li>
            <li>; which is always fun to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously worth giving a shot before writing it off.  </li>
            <li>Came in fast, it&#x27;s such a good product</li>
            <li>By far my favorite eye liner.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I&#x27;m sticking to it since it&#x27;s a good product, better than some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Well worth a try.  .</li>
            <li>I am looking for a new doctor in New York and would love to get his contact information!</li>
            <li>so I went back to my other twist up eyeliner, which made me realize even more how great this one is.  </li>
            <li>Great product: very black</li>
            <li>And runs out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>damn why is it so hard to find a good eyeliner!</li>
            <li>really good control compared to other liquid liners I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>but if you store it the right way (Right side up is what worked for me)</li>
            <li>nope this stuff just comes right off...</li>
            <li>luckly it didnt land in the right angle to touch the floor but</li>
            <li>Just the right amount comes out as you use it</li>
            <li>Very easy to put on, it stayed put and actually helped my lashed grow.</li>
            <li>but i love this product in general!</li>
            <li>It lasts almost a full work day, but instead of smudging, it flakes off, which is a quality that I really like.</li>
            <li>At the very least it feels good to know my money isn&#x27;t funding the torture of innocent animals so that I can feel &amp;</li>
            <li>(less if you can find a good sale) and</li>
            <li>On the upper lid it&#x27;s pretty good, but I have wet eyes that water easily under wind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use especially for beginners I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you cap it tightly after each use &amp; it will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>They say it helps your lashes grow more, but I&#x27;m probably not using it often enough to know.</li>
            <li>Wore pretty well throughout the day, didn&#x27;t smudge or transfer into lids....</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>and I prefer it mostly for my upper eyelid</li>
            <li>The formula is exactly what I was looking for, does not smudge when taking it off and does not come off u</li>
            <li>But, I can at least still say that the ease of use and brush tip are still great, hence the two stars.</li>
            <li>I think this is not likely judging by the reviews, most people were not allergic.</li>
            <li>It really does!</li>
            <li>My first one I bought in a fancy mall somewhere in Taiwan or Japan</li>
            <li>The first one i won from Physician&#x27;s Formula</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not like it costs any more than similar liners.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a better lasting product.</li>
            <li>Came fast !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stuck with this eyeliner for a couple of years now, and it will be that way unless I find an equal alternative that does better in waterproofing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and i would recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ve gotten this before.</li>
            <li>overall this is just ok.</li>
            <li>tips for better, longer lasting, results:</li>
            <li>Apply on top of an eye makeup primer, or simply use eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This is great for any type of look, simple liner to cat eye liner (which is what I use it for), its pretty dark but not as bold as gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Each following morning I awoke with bright red eyes and specks of eyeliner in the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li>So easy to use for a perfect line, thick or thin, and makes the flick of a cat eye so so easy.  </li>
            <li>I am sad that this eyeliner has changed into something else; I doubt I will be able to find another eyeliner that will be as good as this used to be.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is very easy to apply, long lasting, and a great ultra black color.  </li>
            <li>so I was a little more than excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write a follow-up if I see positive results.</li>
            <li>Its been one of my favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stoked about how cheap I can get these on Amazon as opposed to the drug store and will definitely purchase more once my current stash runs out.</li>
            <li>I was using it pretty much every day for about 6 months, and it just ran out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and that the line is thin and very easy to apply i</li>
            <li>I always preferred eyeliners with felt pen tips because they are the easiest and most precise way to apply them, giving sharp and crystal clear lines.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily if you rub it with a Q-tip soaked in water, so don&#x27;t expect it to last through the day&#x27;s up and downs.</li>
            <li>The ink is nice and black, and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all once it sets.  </li>
            <li>but I might keep a waterproof backup one for certain events.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s BARBARIC what they do to cats, dogs, monkeys, rabbits, mice, etc, in the name of OUR vanity and societal pressure to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; a certain way.of</li>
            <li>OUR vanity and societal pressure to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; a certain way.</li>
            <li>This shade is good if you&#x27;re doing face art or creating a general outline for something, but its more of a grey than a black.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but this really does help with cat eye.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my eyelashes are thicker or longer thanks to the serum</li>
            <li>but it does not apply very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;To boost the rest of my lashes, I started applying it across the whole lid.</li>
            <li>I give it a five because this eyeliner is so much easier to control and apply.</li>
            <li>As for the lash enhancing effects, i can&#x27;t really tell if there&#x27;s a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I have not noted any lash boosting, but I know it&#x27;s reasonable and stays put.</li>
            <li>the serum has really worked to improve my lash length, thickness, and strength.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I really realized how well this product is working.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The liner applies very well.</li>
            <li>It went on very runny and watery.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really say much for the lash serum benefits....</li>
            <li>I have found it really lengthens the life of my eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to work use a tissue and lightly running it back and forth</li>
            <li>Super black and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t use it enough for it to be effective as a serum.</li>
            <li>It is the blackest black you can imagine, and you can get anything from a super fine line to a thick bold one very easily.</li>
            <li>I like that it glides on easy and lasts all day long</li>
            <li>, I won&#x27;t bother with other brands any more.  </li>
            <li>BUT I still recommend this more than any other drugstore liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>Just a couple of weeks later, my lashes have lengthened significantly.</li>
            <li>This liner lasts and stays put better than any other</li>
            <li>But other than that i love it</li>
            <li>My skin is dry, so that is another reason it does not come off easily.</li>
            <li>I normally cannot make a straight line with liners to save my life, but with this one it&#x27;s much easier.  </li>
            <li>(yes, it lasts that long) just because I refuse to let go of such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The tip makes it easy to do ultra thin to thick liner, and is great for cat eyes!</li>
            <li>While I like that it is designed to have a very strong seal, it is a bit of a trouble to close.  </li>
            <li>I saw this eyeliner being used by a Youtuber that isn&#x27;t good with makeup, and since I am not good with makeup, I tried it.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately no stores near me just carried this product alone.</li>
            <li>I love the way it slides on, the dark color, and the way it stays on.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all, the quality feels right along the lines of way more expensive liners.  </li>
            <li>They are a little longer than most, but there isn&#x27;t much of it.  </li>
            <li>My new fav eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>I have liquid pen-style eyeliners from Tokidoki, Kat Von D, SmashBox, Lancome, etc, and I find myself using this liner the most, even though it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li>Well, another of the winning features of this liner was that the shade Ultra Black was super super black, as you would expect.  </li>
            <li>and I was glad that I didn&#x27;t throw my previous liner away to use over it.</li>
            <li>I now have this in black and brown :)</li>
            <li>decent eye liner,  did not do anything for length</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure about the lasting power, since at the end of the day it&#x27;s definitely flecked off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using make up forever before, as well as urban decay, but I actually like this one better.  </li>
            <li>It applies very easily with a super thin wand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I am still giving it a solid 5-star for being such a solid product for such a great affordable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of liquid liners, all high end, stila, eyeko, Kat von D, and this one trumps all of those.  </li>
            <li>And it is highly pigmented in color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite forgiving and holding a pen was more natural for me than those other applicator wands.</li>
            <li>but I have been pleasantly surprised at how much fuller and longer my lashes have gotten.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this item in the past from Walmart and have always loved the formulation and the lasting power.</li>
            <li>I still have product left, I think I got a fresh one, thankfully.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say for sure if it makes your eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, I put it on in the morning, rode my bike 6 miles to work, went the whole day, rode 6 miles back  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good but not great.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes and find that most cosmetics, even those for sensitive skin, are much too harsh for me.</li>
            <li>The seller I purchased from sent me brown instead of Ultra black, however the brown works well for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>so if you drop it, the brush hairs just go right back to being as pointy as they were before.</li>
            <li>right above my lashes for a defining eye look, and</li>
            <li>I bought the first one in-store, and after wearing a few times, had to come online and buy several more, just in case it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
            <li>But this eyeliner stays on all day long and pretty much even when I sleep in it.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li>I am so very surprised by this eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>Natural makeup is my thing, and if you&#x27;re looking to switch over, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li>The kind where mascara hardly has any effect because you barely have anything to build from.</li>
            <li>This creates a light black color.</li>
            <li>regular black isn&#x27;t very opaque and it&#x27;s almost kind of grey.</li>
            <li>The calligraphy brush style tip makes drawing lines easy and the ultra black shade is a true jet black.</li>
            <li>Wow was I pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing black eye liner on my top lids cat-eye style every day for the last 15+ years.</li>
            <li>For more expensive brands, they last longer but eventually the eyeliner becomes not so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and i liked it so much i was sad when i ran out</li>
            <li>I just ordered a clear one to use when I don&#x27;t want to apply any makeup.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going to give the clear serum</li>
            <li>Clearly there is a design flaw they need to address.  </li>
            <li>said, although my skin is somewhat sensitive</li>
            <li>I was really surprised about that</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, no irritation (and I&#x27;m allergic to everything) and even though I thought the whole &amp;#34;lash booster&amp;#34; growth thing was a gimmick, I think my lashes actually have become longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this off amazon because it was a few cents cheaper, no tax, and free shipping.</li>
            <li>and my lashes are growing back (thanks in part to Rimmel Lash Accelerator...good for eyebrows, too)</li>
            <li>As far as having sensitive eyes I&#x27;d say proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and am a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, my eyelashes are considerably longer.  </li>
            <li>For my upper lashes, it&#x27;s a bit longer, but much fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother to return it because I assumed the product would still work like the old one.</li>
            <li>Nice thin tip.</li>
            <li>However, this particular one- first came in a plastic box that looked like it had been completely ruined due to some sort of heat appied onto the plastic case...</li>
            <li>I hope it doesn&#x27;t take too long for them to get back to normal because I want to gauge my eyes out right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and it is long lasting and not something that runs out or dries up quickly and needs to be replaced often which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>My newest one is just as deep, opaque black and smooth as I remember from my old ones.  </li>
            <li>I usually experience my first symptoms of irritation within the first hour.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that if your eyes tear up often, it washed away a little too easily.</li>
            <li>I received it pretty quickly but was a bit disappointed that it was out of the sealed original packaging so there was no way of knowing whether it had already been swatched or even used on someone&#x27;s eye, which I found to be very unsanitary.</li>
            <li>Now, as for the lash boosting claims, I do have to doubt this; however I have to admit I don&#x27;t use it daily, and maybe that is what you have to do to see any result, but I highly doubt it has Lastisse-like results.  </li>
            <li>The ultra black is just black, at best (Milani&#x27;s Eye Tech Extreme Liquid Liner in blackest black is darker than this eyeliner).</li>
            <li>It sets and wears very well, all day long.</li>
            <li>Ladies, this product is reasonably priced and delivers far more value that all those fancy expensive items which are flogged on t.v.  </li>
            <li>It did work, but once you stop using it, your lashes will grow back as their normal, shorter size.  </li>
            <li>I took off one star because it tends to look shiny in a certain light, rather than dark matte black.</li>
            <li>They were all decent for maybe the first two weeks then the trouble begins.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical about the lash-boosting claims, but I really liked the idea of starting to use a liquid eyeliner daily, so I gave it a shot!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I live the product and the color especially</li>
            <li>It is kinda long wearing but at the same time smudgy if its hot out or if you accidentally touch your eyes.</li>
            <li>in addition to recently moving to the very humid Deep South I assumed the battle would continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This liner is actually better than the comparable Sephora version I used to use, although it is a little trickier to layer and doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a couple of weeks, so not a good judge of the &amp;#34;last enhancing&amp;#34; properties; however, it is the easiest liquid/gel liner I have ever used, it goes on smoothly, stays through ANYTHING until I am ready to remove it, does not bleed or run.  </li>
            <li>No other liner has lasted through watering eyes etc in the corners like this does.</li>
            <li>And my lower lashes are as long as my upper lashes used to be, with a few more rows too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, I have no regrets!  </li>
            <li>a simple eyeliner, it is easy to apply, stays on for about 4-5 hours, usually fades afterward</li>
            <li>ONLY downfall is that it can easily be wiped off because the solution doesn&#x27;t dry like other liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Only thing is I didn&#x27;t get the super black one.</li>
            <li>It (1) does not apply as smoothly as before, (2) smudges throughout the day, and (3) is extremely hard to take off.</li>
            <li>Since writing the original review I repurchased this product for the fourth time (in Ultra Black) to check again if I could make it work, since I stumbled across a couple recent reviews talking about having to shake up the pen</li>
            <li>Because it is placed just under and part of lash line it really fills in any empty spaces and once mascara is applied</li>
            <li>barely works\\&quot; to \\&quot;mascara looks like falsies\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>The first time I did it, I wasn&#x27;t too careful and the entire pen BOUNCED OFF onto the floor!  </li>
            <li>I love that the tip it thin.</li>
            <li>I bought it because i wanted to be able to wear a thin line.</li>
            <li>The product flows very well into the brush tip and as long as you cap it after use, it will last MONTHS, where most pen liners I&#x27;ve had only last a few weeks before they dry up.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave the black line on my eyelid like every other liner I&#x27;ve ever used, but comes off easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Also if you are looking for a striking solid dark black, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>So far the new fave is Kat Von D Tatoo Liner, which is a bit pricier and harder to get.  </li>
            <li>Super messy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a while, and I love the thin applicator pen...</li>
            <li>It is dark and absolutely smudge proof.  </li>
            <li>I did for the first few days.</li>
            <li>I hate all other applicators because they are goopy or don&#x27;t have precision; this one has perfect flow and control.</li>
            <li>if I want just a thin line that enhances my lashes, I get that easily, too.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a different in my lash length or fullness, but I could care less.</li>
            <li>I was able to line my eyes in half of the usual time!  </li>

            <li> The swatch was very impressive!</li>
            <li> Perfect eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> If Physician&#x27;s Formula could change this, it would be the perfect eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li> Great eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m probably on my 9th one now.</li>
            <li> I have never been so impressed by a make-up</li>
            <li> So this is a rather excellent eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I bought a brown one from another site and it was one of the best eyeliners I had ever used.</li>
            <li> I had heard wonderful things about this mascara</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is incredible!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten an excellent 16 hour use out of one application with zero smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li> and  actually very good</li>
            <li> Truly the best I&#x27;ve found, and great for cat eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product and very good seller</li>
            <li> But the line it creates is exceptional!  </li>
            <li> GREAT price.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT and I will use this from now on.  </li>
            <li> great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price for the product you get.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to update this review to four stars.  </li>
            <li> eyeliner itself is great too.</li>
            <li> I have been using the liner for about a month now and my lashes are looking really great.  </li>
            <li> Great eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I found it great buenisimo and durable</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s also just a GREAT eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This works great, the eyeliner and the serum.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product if you dont care about the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, not as long-lasting as I would like, however.  </li>
            <li> Great product...</li>
            <li> This one works great...</li>
            <li> I am always searching for a great all-day/waterproof eyeliner and this one comes close to being the one.</li>
            <li> It might be a great product for others</li>
            <li> The brush like pen was great</li>
            <li> The brush part is not too flimsy and I have great control over it.</li>
            <li> Formula never flakes or fades and has a great depth of color.</li>
            <li> Great find.</li>
            <li> amazing applicator!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> it works the best I wish more stores carried it.</li>
            <li> but the price is so much better on amazon, it is a good value!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product for this reason but it is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> it stays on, doesn&#x27;t burn or flake off, and is very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews about how this eyeliner is so amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> But I recommend this liner because of its perfect tapered brush tip that blows any felt tip or cheap</li>
            <li> Good pigment and staying power too.</li>
            <li> It went away when I stated using Latisse which I loved.</li>
            <li> and I really loved it until I noticed my eyes started getting itchy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li> But the good thing about this is that even if it is not truly waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t smear into raccoon eyes when it&#x27;s coming off from water, sweat or tears.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner!!!</li>
            <li> The best and most precise brush ever</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as perfect as Dior with a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> When i run out you can bet i&#x27;ll be buying more again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing one of my favorite eyeliners !</li>
            <li> is product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Either way, i have never found an eyeliner so amazing as this one.</li>
            <li> precisely so I consider that a win.</li>
            <li> I initially liked this product because it was the way i pictured it to be.</li>
            <li> But this is a nice every day look.</li>
            <li> That so good i love it💞</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as an eyeliner I really liked it.</li>
            <li> excellent product really grow eyelashes ago</li>
            <li> Nice liner</li>
            <li> This one is the absolute  best eyeliner  ever.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice cat-eye look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the eyeliner itself is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> Super happy with the fast delivery and awesome product.</li>
            <li> This is a really good and easy to use eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to control.</li>
            <li> &amp; we feel better about her wearing it more often!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the price and the good quality of the applicator: it&#x27;s very precise and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> In any case, I am so incredibly thrilled to be able to recommend this again and to use it again.  </li>
            <li> This is best liquid eyeliner by far, and I have tried a lot.</li>
            <li> it looks beautiful at first, but in 30 minutes having to re-apply.  </li>
            <li> By far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> This would be a great eyeliner, the best even, except as many other reviewers have noted...</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and it lasts almost all day!</li>
            <li> It comes off easy and the tube itself lasts forever!</li>
            <li> The brush-tip pen is very fine</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about my eyelash growth but this is very easy to put on and STAYS where I put it!!  </li>
            <li> Love it the best i ever try so far....</li>
            <li> This was great when I first started experimenting with liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> When I first used the product it worked great</li>
            <li> and it looked great on the first try.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery !!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner so much, it&#x27;s very precise and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> So easy, I bought it for my mother who&#x27;s 63 and never wears eyeliner and even SHE liked it.</li>
            <li> No, I haven&#x27;t turned into a glamour girl, but it&#x27;s certainly improved my appearance  and made my eyes appear more expressive.  </li>
            <li> so I tried it 2 more times to make sure there wasn&#x27;t another factor.</li>
            <li> I recommend to all my friends and they love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear eyeliner for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for the best, but expecting the same results.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;ve gone without eyeliner for so many years.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush liner which is so much better than the felt tip liners.</li>
            <li> Better to stick to Dermacol liquid eyeliner..</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like most liquid eyeliners do.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has no harmful chemicals in it</li>
            <li> like so many eyeliners do.</li>
            <li> This product is the reason I will never be satisfied with anything but a brush tip liner for cat eyes again.  </li>
            <li> I could tell it would come off if the skin was more oily.</li>
            <li> This time, when I stopped using the Rimmel Serum and started using this one, the lashes did not fall off and still look healthy.</li>
            <li> I am not saying they look like falsies, but they look better than before I started using serums.</li>
            <li> So please! :)</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s probably why since most liners smudge on me).</li>
            <li> Love it and inexpensive</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So glad to have found this.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t find a better drugstore eyeliner for the cost</li>
            <li> then it works its magic during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most eyeliners  make me look like I have been bawling after my workout.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is extremely outstanding if it&#x27;s a dupe for another brand it will be Dior</li>
            <li> Anyway, still 5 stars as I love the liner</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for more than 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> , it slides smoothly and stays all day !</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my most precious makeup product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Like I have more of them, and they are longer and stronger.</li>
            <li> Yep, definitely MORE lashes.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I know and love.</li>
            <li> just wish it was a more darker</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> ~ it doesn&#x27;t change for the better.  </li>
            <li> So I did my research on this product, saw that across the board, on every site that carried it, people overwhelmingly raved about this liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can create really nice and accurate lines with practice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that my lashes are any more longer or fuller, however, but that is not the reason why I use this product.</li>
            <li> I have anxiety which causes my hands to shake incessantly, which meant until I found this liquid eyeliner, I wasn&#x27;t able to use liquid eyeliner &amp; had to settle for pencil, which never turned out quite the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product .</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Favorite eyeliner EVER.</li>
            <li> Am still waiting for these magical eye lashes the product guarantees.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> the liner traces pretty good</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not because she has sensitive eyes like mine, but because it is so easy to put on!!!</li>
            <li> The best part is how long just one tube of it lasts!  </li>
            <li> The product arived on time in its original packaging and did not disappoint, it is truly a lengthening mascara!</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry it looks awesome and it won&#x27;t smear (unless you rub your eyes or something.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY high end products, and this is as good as, or better than, all of them.</li>
            <li> It gives just as fine and precise of a line, plus it has the added benefit of lash-boosting serum!</li>
            <li> The liner did not come in original packaging, but overall I think this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Easy to control and comes on nice and bold, just how I like it.  </li>
            <li> it looks great and natural.  </li>
            <li> What else is there to say other than it&#x27;s awesome?</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for in an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I was looking for low/no irritation and easy apply liquid liner.</li>
            <li> this is the eyeliner u should get,applies easy and looks awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so so SO easy to use.</li>
            <li> This liner is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, but...</li>
            <li> Easy to take off with make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, but does eventually flake by end of the day.</li>
            <li> Goes on so easily and easy to manage application.  </li>
            <li> It works so easily.</li>
            <li> For me this doesn&#x27;t smudge and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but I can apply it easily and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> While it does not smear just from use, you can easily remove it with a damp paper</li>
            <li> I like that if you make a mistake, it is easy to remove with just water and a q-tip.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, very smooth, quick drying and</li>
            <li> It stayed on all day which is amazing since I have pretty greasy eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner ever, hands down.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best drugstore liquid eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the right amount of black, it applies smoothly and evenly, it lasts all day (which is impressive because I work outside in Florida), and the tip doesn&#x27;t fray/deform/whatever after a ton of uses--which means my cat eye is perfect every time.</li>
            <li> the point was so fine that it applied so well.</li>
            <li> Pen is easily controlled and product rolls out smoothly.</li>
            <li> Goes on fine, haven&#x27;t yet noticed results</li>
            <li> It was a wonderful liquid eyeliner except that the black color is watery.</li>
            <li> and it will work just fine.  </li>
            <li> this became a huge problem because instead of having fine lines</li>
            <li> but most importantly, it GLIDES so very very well!</li>
            <li> This will be my primary eyeliner</li>
            <li> The application brush glides on smooth &amp; the tip gives a precise point.  </li>
            <li> I work from home and my dogs don&#x27;t care if I have makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free makeup brand.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, stays put, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> She has to reapply a couple of times during a show because it wipes off easily, but it&#x27;s easier to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> You can make a realllly precise line with it.</li>
            <li> It makes up for that in the precise application and durable set of the liquid, so I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The finish has a light satin sheen.</li>
            <li> Does not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have to shake more than 20 seconds initially.  </li>
            <li> Even after a long, hot day running around waitressing, it was perfect.  </li>
            <li> The color was very black (ultrablack) which is awesome.</li>
            <li> physicians formula products are generally of good quality and this one is no less.</li>
            <li> The tip is really defined and pointed for a more accurate and precise application and the liquid is smooth and glides on easily.</li>
            <li> Since the formula is more natural and safer than most eyeliners, I don&#x27;t mind the fact it can come off easily.</li>
            <li> For that price I think it&#x27;s a really good product and as good as 20/25 dollars eyeliners I bought from Sephora in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to fix mistakes with this pen as it doesn&#x27;t set quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the actual &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; tip, and for a liquid liner it dries quickly and fairly opaque.</li>
            <li> It is also super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it &amp;#34;boosts eyelash growth&amp;#34;, but it goes on super easy and is very easy to do the &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> See original two-star review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When this product first came out, it was definitely instantly in my top 5 list of fave makeup products ever.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about this eyeliner that I purchased 2.</li>
            <li> I am excited to use it again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it can beat some of the higher end brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the eyelash serum claims, but this is an excellent eyeliner that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever been able to use liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the 10 bucks at the drug store!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really works as lashes enhancer, but it permits me to draw my cat eyes so easily that it&#x27;s now my favourite eyeliner !</li>
            <li> With this eyeliner I was able to have a perfect line on both eyes in ten seconds flat!</li>
            <li> The tip is precise and not too soft it allows a nice application.  </li>
            <li> Great for quick application, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The brush is the best I&#x27;ve found and is so much easier to use than felt or other types of liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> the whites of my eyes turn bright red after wearing this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I have to put another &#x27;real&#x27; liner on top of it to get a liner effect like I would want.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really verify the eyelash boosting part of it&#x27;s claim to fame, but regardless it&#x27;s a lovely eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought it in brown to give as a gift</li>
            <li> Looks good - have only used twice.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> all in one stroke, all without reapplying more make up to the brush because it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> I would say that it stays in tip top condition up to 8 hours, and does not fade away much after that either ....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to love it so much.  </li>
            <li> ELF is what I used before I tried this out, and I love the ELF company and its whole line</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, yes it had faded somewhat by that point, but it hadn&#x27;t smeared or peeled or flaked.</li>
            <li> This is SO easy to use and create smooth, straight lines with...I&#x27;m just used to using a pencil because it is faster, so I don&#x27;t use this as often.</li>
            <li> It comes of pretty easily, as well.</li>
            <li> The flip side is that it smudges quickly and the color goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> My second most favorite eye-liner.</li>
            <li> Plus, you are more likely to put this on because you&#x27;re already wearing eyeliner on most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it quickly dries up.</li>
            <li> It even survives most of my high intensity Roller Derby practices.  </li>
            <li> Ultra black is a great color and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because the reviews were pretty good, but I had a very different experience.</li>
            <li> AND not only does it make it long, the liquid itself if awesome.</li>
            <li> I really like the easy to apply tip, and for a drugstore eyeliner, I don&#x27;t think you can beat it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my eyelashes, but it&#x27;s still more than worth the money just because it&#x27;s such a fantastic liner.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t imagine who would enjoy this product now, since it doesn&#x27;t provide an opaque line.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say it was so worth</li>
            <li> I rarely have to use a q-tip for fixes when I apply</li>
            <li> ; which is always fun to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously worth giving a shot before writing it off.  </li>
            <li> Came in fast, it&#x27;s such a good product</li>
            <li> By far my favorite eye liner.  </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I&#x27;m sticking to it since it&#x27;s a good product, better than some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Well worth a try.  .</li>
            <li> I am looking for a new doctor in New York and would love to get his contact information!</li>
            <li> so I went back to my other twist up eyeliner, which made me realize even more how great this one is.  </li>
            <li> Great product: very black</li>
            <li> And runs out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> damn why is it so hard to find a good eyeliner!</li>
            <li> really good control compared to other liquid liners I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but if you store it the right way (Right side up is what worked for me)</li>
            <li> nope this stuff just comes right off...</li>
            <li> luckly it didnt land in the right angle to touch the floor but</li>
            <li> Just the right amount comes out as you use it</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on, it stayed put and actually helped my lashed grow.</li>
            <li> but i love this product in general!</li>
            <li> It lasts almost a full work day, but instead of smudging, it flakes off, which is a quality that I really like.</li>
            <li> At the very least it feels good to know my money isn&#x27;t funding the torture of innocent animals so that I can feel &amp;</li>
            <li> (less if you can find a good sale) and</li>
            <li> On the upper lid it&#x27;s pretty good, but I have wet eyes that water easily under wind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use especially for beginners I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you cap it tightly after each use &amp; it will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> They say it helps your lashes grow more, but I&#x27;m probably not using it often enough to know.</li>
            <li> Wore pretty well throughout the day, didn&#x27;t smudge or transfer into lids....</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> and I prefer it mostly for my upper eyelid</li>
            <li> The formula is exactly what I was looking for, does not smudge when taking it off and does not come off u</li>
            <li> But, I can at least still say that the ease of use and brush tip are still great, hence the two stars.</li>
            <li> I think this is not likely judging by the reviews, most people were not allergic.</li>
            <li> It really does!</li>
            <li> My first one I bought in a fancy mall somewhere in Taiwan or Japan</li>
            <li> The first one i won from Physician&#x27;s Formula</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not like it costs any more than similar liners.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a better lasting product.</li>
            <li> Came fast !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stuck with this eyeliner for a couple of years now, and it will be that way unless I find an equal alternative that does better in waterproofing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and i would recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve gotten this before.</li>
            <li> overall this is just ok.</li>
            <li> tips for better, longer lasting, results:</li>
            <li> Apply on top of an eye makeup primer, or simply use eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This is great for any type of look, simple liner to cat eye liner (which is what I use it for), its pretty dark but not as bold as gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Each following morning I awoke with bright red eyes and specks of eyeliner in the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> So easy to use for a perfect line, thick or thin, and makes the flick of a cat eye so so easy.  </li>
            <li> I am sad that this eyeliner has changed into something else; I doubt I will be able to find another eyeliner that will be as good as this used to be.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is very easy to apply, long lasting, and a great ultra black color.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little more than excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write a follow-up if I see positive results.</li>
            <li> Its been one of my favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stoked about how cheap I can get these on Amazon as opposed to the drug store and will definitely purchase more once my current stash runs out.</li>
            <li> I was using it pretty much every day for about 6 months, and it just ran out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and that the line is thin and very easy to apply i</li>
            <li> I always preferred eyeliners with felt pen tips because they are the easiest and most precise way to apply them, giving sharp and crystal clear lines.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily if you rub it with a Q-tip soaked in water, so don&#x27;t expect it to last through the day&#x27;s up and downs.</li>
            <li> The ink is nice and black, and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all once it sets.  </li>
            <li> but I might keep a waterproof backup one for certain events.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s BARBARIC what they do to cats, dogs, monkeys, rabbits, mice, etc, in the name of OUR vanity and societal pressure to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; a certain way.of</li>
            <li> OUR vanity and societal pressure to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; a certain way.</li>
            <li> This shade is good if you&#x27;re doing face art or creating a general outline for something, but its more of a grey than a black.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but this really does help with cat eye.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my eyelashes are thicker or longer thanks to the serum</li>
            <li> but it does not apply very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;To boost the rest of my lashes, I started applying it across the whole lid.</li>
            <li> I give it a five because this eyeliner is so much easier to control and apply.</li>
            <li> As for the lash enhancing effects, i can&#x27;t really tell if there&#x27;s a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I have not noted any lash boosting, but I know it&#x27;s reasonable and stays put.</li>
            <li> the serum has really worked to improve my lash length, thickness, and strength.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I really realized how well this product is working.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The liner applies very well.</li>
            <li> It went on very runny and watery.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really say much for the lash serum benefits....</li>
            <li> I have found it really lengthens the life of my eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to work use a tissue and lightly running it back and forth</li>
            <li> Super black and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t use it enough for it to be effective as a serum.</li>
            <li> It is the blackest black you can imagine, and you can get anything from a super fine line to a thick bold one very easily.</li>
            <li> I like that it glides on easy and lasts all day long</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t bother with other brands any more.  </li>
            <li> BUT I still recommend this more than any other drugstore liquid liner.  </li>
            <li> Just a couple of weeks later, my lashes have lengthened significantly.</li>
            <li> This liner lasts and stays put better than any other</li>
            <li> But other than that i love it</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, so that is another reason it does not come off easily.</li>
            <li> I normally cannot make a straight line with liners to save my life, but with this one it&#x27;s much easier.  </li>
            <li> (yes, it lasts that long) just because I refuse to let go of such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The tip makes it easy to do ultra thin to thick liner, and is great for cat eyes!</li>
            <li> While I like that it is designed to have a very strong seal, it is a bit of a trouble to close.  </li>
            <li> I saw this eyeliner being used by a Youtuber that isn&#x27;t good with makeup, and since I am not good with makeup, I tried it.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately no stores near me just carried this product alone.</li>
            <li> I love the way it slides on, the dark color, and the way it stays on.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all, the quality feels right along the lines of way more expensive liners.  </li>
            <li> They are a little longer than most, but there isn&#x27;t much of it.  </li>
            <li> My new fav eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> I have liquid pen-style eyeliners from Tokidoki, Kat Von D, SmashBox, Lancome, etc, and I find myself using this liner the most, even though it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> Well, another of the winning features of this liner was that the shade Ultra Black was super super black, as you would expect.  </li>
            <li> and I was glad that I didn&#x27;t throw my previous liner away to use over it.</li>
            <li> I now have this in black and brown :)</li>
            <li> decent eye liner,  did not do anything for length</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about the lasting power, since at the end of the day it&#x27;s definitely flecked off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using make up forever before, as well as urban decay, but I actually like this one better.  </li>
            <li> It applies very easily with a super thin wand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I am still giving it a solid 5-star for being such a solid product for such a great affordable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of liquid liners, all high end, stila, eyeko, Kat von D, and this one trumps all of those.  </li>
            <li> And it is highly pigmented in color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite forgiving and holding a pen was more natural for me than those other applicator wands.</li>
            <li> but I have been pleasantly surprised at how much fuller and longer my lashes have gotten.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past from Walmart and have always loved the formulation and the lasting power.</li>
            <li> I still have product left, I think I got a fresh one, thankfully.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say for sure if it makes your eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I put it on in the morning, rode my bike 6 miles to work, went the whole day, rode 6 miles back  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but not great.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes and find that most cosmetics, even those for sensitive skin, are much too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> The seller I purchased from sent me brown instead of Ultra black, however the brown works well for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> so if you drop it, the brush hairs just go right back to being as pointy as they were before.</li>
            <li> right above my lashes for a defining eye look, and</li>
            <li> I bought the first one in-store, and after wearing a few times, had to come online and buy several more, just in case it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
            <li> But this eyeliner stays on all day long and pretty much even when I sleep in it.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> I am so very surprised by this eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> Natural makeup is my thing, and if you&#x27;re looking to switch over, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> The kind where mascara hardly has any effect because you barely have anything to build from.</li>
            <li> This creates a light black color.</li>
            <li> regular black isn&#x27;t very opaque and it&#x27;s almost kind of grey.</li>
            <li> The calligraphy brush style tip makes drawing lines easy and the ultra black shade is a true jet black.</li>
            <li> Wow was I pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing black eye liner on my top lids cat-eye style every day for the last 15+ years.</li>
            <li> For more expensive brands, they last longer but eventually the eyeliner becomes not so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and i liked it so much i was sad when i ran out</li>
            <li> I just ordered a clear one to use when I don&#x27;t want to apply any makeup.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to give the clear serum</li>
            <li> Clearly there is a design flaw they need to address.  </li>
            <li> said, although my skin is somewhat sensitive</li>
            <li> I was really surprised about that</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, no irritation (and I&#x27;m allergic to everything) and even though I thought the whole &amp;#34;lash booster&amp;#34; growth thing was a gimmick, I think my lashes actually have become longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this off amazon because it was a few cents cheaper, no tax, and free shipping.</li>
            <li> and my lashes are growing back (thanks in part to Rimmel Lash Accelerator...good for eyebrows, too)</li>
            <li> As far as having sensitive eyes I&#x27;d say proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and am a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, my eyelashes are considerably longer.  </li>
            <li> For my upper lashes, it&#x27;s a bit longer, but much fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to return it because I assumed the product would still work like the old one.</li>
            <li> Nice thin tip.</li>
            <li> However, this particular one- first came in a plastic box that looked like it had been completely ruined due to some sort of heat appied onto the plastic case...</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t take too long for them to get back to normal because I want to gauge my eyes out right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and it is long lasting and not something that runs out or dries up quickly and needs to be replaced often which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> My newest one is just as deep, opaque black and smooth as I remember from my old ones.  </li>
            <li> I usually experience my first symptoms of irritation within the first hour.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that if your eyes tear up often, it washed away a little too easily.</li>
            <li> I received it pretty quickly but was a bit disappointed that it was out of the sealed original packaging so there was no way of knowing whether it had already been swatched or even used on someone&#x27;s eye, which I found to be very unsanitary.</li>
            <li> Now, as for the lash boosting claims, I do have to doubt this; however I have to admit I don&#x27;t use it daily, and maybe that is what you have to do to see any result, but I highly doubt it has Lastisse-like results.  </li>
            <li> The ultra black is just black, at best (Milani&#x27;s Eye Tech Extreme Liquid Liner in blackest black is darker than this eyeliner).</li>
            <li> It sets and wears very well, all day long.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this product is reasonably priced and delivers far more value that all those fancy expensive items which are flogged on t.v.  </li>
            <li> It did work, but once you stop using it, your lashes will grow back as their normal, shorter size.  </li>
            <li> I took off one star because it tends to look shiny in a certain light, rather than dark matte black.</li>
            <li> They were all decent for maybe the first two weeks then the trouble begins.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about the lash-boosting claims, but I really liked the idea of starting to use a liquid eyeliner daily, so I gave it a shot!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I live the product and the color especially</li>
            <li> It is kinda long wearing but at the same time smudgy if its hot out or if you accidentally touch your eyes.</li>
            <li> in addition to recently moving to the very humid Deep South I assumed the battle would continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This liner is actually better than the comparable Sephora version I used to use, although it is a little trickier to layer and doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a couple of weeks, so not a good judge of the &amp;#34;last enhancing&amp;#34; properties; however, it is the easiest liquid/gel liner I have ever used, it goes on smoothly, stays through ANYTHING until I am ready to remove it, does not bleed or run.  </li>
            <li> No other liner has lasted through watering eyes etc in the corners like this does.</li>
            <li> And my lower lashes are as long as my upper lashes used to be, with a few more rows too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, I have no regrets!  </li>
            <li> a simple eyeliner, it is easy to apply, stays on for about 4-5 hours, usually fades afterward</li>
            <li> ONLY downfall is that it can easily be wiped off because the solution doesn&#x27;t dry like other liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I didn&#x27;t get the super black one.</li>
            <li> It (1) does not apply as smoothly as before, (2) smudges throughout the day, and (3) is extremely hard to take off.</li>
            <li> Since writing the original review I repurchased this product for the fourth time (in Ultra Black) to check again if I could make it work, since I stumbled across a couple recent reviews talking about having to shake up the pen</li>
            <li> Because it is placed just under and part of lash line it really fills in any empty spaces and once mascara is applied</li>
            <li> barely works\\&quot; to \\&quot;mascara looks like falsies\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> The first time I did it, I wasn&#x27;t too careful and the entire pen BOUNCED OFF onto the floor!  </li>
            <li> I love that the tip it thin.</li>
            <li> I bought it because i wanted to be able to wear a thin line.</li>
            <li> The product flows very well into the brush tip and as long as you cap it after use, it will last MONTHS, where most pen liners I&#x27;ve had only last a few weeks before they dry up.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave the black line on my eyelid like every other liner I&#x27;ve ever used, but comes off easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Also if you are looking for a striking solid dark black, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> So far the new fave is Kat Von D Tatoo Liner, which is a bit pricier and harder to get.  </li>
            <li> Super messy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a while, and I love the thin applicator pen...</li>
            <li> It is dark and absolutely smudge proof.  </li>
            <li> I did for the first few days.</li>
            <li> I hate all other applicators because they are goopy or don&#x27;t have precision; this one has perfect flow and control.</li>
            <li> if I want just a thin line that enhances my lashes, I get that easily, too.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a different in my lash length or fullness, but I could care less.</li>
            <li> I was able to line my eyes in half of the usual time!  </li>
            <li> Hard to use, never looked &#x27;right&#x27; on me, doubt the claim it can boost lash growth.</li>
            <li> All the other products I use are tried and tested old favorites, so it was definitely the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the color doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I do find that I sometimes have some smudging (especially on those days that I rush application and don&#x27;t wait for things to dry); but if I&#x27;ve allowed proper drying time, the liner lasts ALL DAY without budging -</li>
            <li> I later purchased the ultra black from Target because it is better for a dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> Last all day as long as you don&#x27;t touch it with water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going off about the &amp;#34;lash boosting&amp;#34; effect, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough for that.</li>
            <li> My lashes are naturally long and personally haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in length</li>
            <li> It takes a few strokes to get the right shade of black though.</li>
            <li> When I received it I thought it would last a week to 2 weeks; I ordered it from Mini Max Outlet Store on January 31st, it arrived February 6th, and it still feel at least half full</li>
            <li> Not only has it helped my lashes grow long, but fuller too!</li>
            <li> but this one - the Physicians Formula - is a nice dark black, not the watered down black that you have to draw 3 or 4 times over your eyes to get a full-on dark.</li>
            <li> It does last for a very long time, even with my warm/oily lids.</li>
            <li> The Ultra Black is a true, dark black.  </li>
            <li> It is a wee bit of work to get it off, you just need to be gentle not to wipe your eyes hard.</li>
            <li> It stays on long even when I do stage performances and get sweaty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I DO use eyeshadow primer (Milani) and put my Urban Decay eyeshadow on wet, using Aveda&#x27;s product for this application.  </li>
            <li> Still, if you like grey eyeliner, physicians formula eye booster is my go-to.</li>
            <li> long staying，thin line，good product！</li>
            <li> This is quite strange.</li>
            <li> I hate to sound like an infomercial, but after 1 week, I really noticed results!  </li>
            <li> So there is a good base when I put my eyeliner on.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the ultra black isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;ultra black,&amp;#34; compared to some other black eyeliners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Previously I had used a latisse-like serum that was much, much more expensive than this.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the lash growing claim, but the brush tip, price, long wear, smudge resistance, and long period of use before dry out made this product a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use black mascara on my upper lashes only, I think this helps prevent smudging under the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is better than the expensive estee lauder black liquid eyeliner that I used to use.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time for the pen to dry out, too,</li>
            <li> You have to wait a long time for it to dry or it&#x27;ll smear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying other products before I come back to this one.</li>
            <li> but I got liner smear a lot with their cream liner (which I preferred above all their other kinds of liner).</li>
            <li> I have very long eyelashes</li>
            <li> The product has a tendency to dry and accumulate on the tip, which impedes flow and may make it appear to stop working.</li>
            <li> This worked so well that when my friends and I were putting on individual falsies for a fun night out, you could not even see the false lashes on me!  </li>
            <li> I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> My lashes are still pretty thin</li>
            <li> To apply, I shake the pen first, uncap, then apply the liquid liner at an approximately 20-25 degree angle from my face.</li>
            <li> The next morning I did not have eyeliner running down my face, either.</li>
            <li> get the regular black since it looks gray.</li>
            <li> But the regular black does the trick.</li>
            <li> I use the black on my upper lids and the brown on my lower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth the price, lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t dry out on the tip, doesn&#x27;t drag and looks legit on.</li>
            <li> The black is not really black black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed, but the last 2 eyeliners that I have bought have been drastically different from the eyeliner</li>
            <li> I should mention I do not use it on my lower lash line, I just used a liner brush a little black shadow before I follow with clear mascara on the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am going crazy, but my eyelashes feel more substantial after less than a week of using this product.</li>
            <li> It can be administered as a subtle filler or a more dramatic cat eye.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not super long or even long</li>
            <li> and it does dry down to a slightly shiny finish, which you may dislike if you prefer completely matte black liner.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint might be that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> Did have a little bit of feathering in the corner of eyes, but I went back over it with the eyeliner a couple times and it helped fix the feathering</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed thicker/longer/more lashes, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> I bought this liner thinking it would help get a little of the Latisse the goth back</li>
            <li> It gave me EXTREME dry eye syndrome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in my lashes but not major</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it grows eyelashes as I don&#x27;t apply eye makeup everyday, only when I go out.</li>
            <li> I thought if it was minimal itching</li>
            <li> Look your products&#x27; companies up: we&#x27;ve got the internet now, you can do it with minimal difficulty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different black liquid eyeliners and this is my FAV!  </li>
            <li> It actually stays DARK black all day for me.</li>
            <li> I shake it first and then hold my eyelid, stretch it out a little bit and draw one thin line.</li>
            <li> My deep brown eyes look less dark in contrast with the ultra black color of the eyeliner</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know for sure if the ones I bought before that were terrible were duds, or if some of the pens when new have to be shaken for quite a while to get them started.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of other liquid eyeliners because they come highly-recommended but none of them even come close to this one--they just end up in the bottom of my makeup bag, abandoned after one use.</li>
            <li> lesson learned, one MUST BE CAREFUL CLOSING THE PEN!  </li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know how other people feel about this, but my lashes have grown.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer it over other liners I have used for that reason.</li>
            <li> I only had about 5 uses within one month before it was dried out!</li>
            <li> I usually have issues with eyeliners smudging, creating panda eyes, but this the only drugstore eyeliner that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t do that to me.</li>
            <li> One other pirk</li>
            <li> There are very few brands that I can use without having irritation and eye infections, especially from waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and the dry eyes persisted for a few months.</li>
            <li> I accidentally left the cap off for a few hours and it dried out</li>
            <li> I am an senior citizen, and for a long time I had thick and reasonably long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on nearly as dark or well as I though it would.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s normal but not ideal).</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;One tip: when you are not using the eyeliner, keep it standing upside down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like what i read from the other comments!</li>
            <li> I use fake eye lashes 2times a week and recently had eyelash extensions and due to having the extensions a was almost left with no eyelashes</li>
            <li> While it may crack or peel a little as the day goes on, it doesn&#x27;t peel or flake off in chunks like the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> If you want dark line you have to get the Ultra black.</li>
            <li> so dark (I had previously been using pencil liners).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other drugstore brand liquid eyeliners and none can hold a candle to this Physician&#x27;s Formula.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is that they run out too fast.</li>
            <li> Applies less pigmented than desired.</li>
            <li> After an 8 hour work day the black is faded.</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased the shade &#x27;black&#x27; and not &#x27;ultra black&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I bought one each in black and brown -</li>
            <li> I always set it with a black BareMinerals powder liner &amp; it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also black black black and resists smudging quite well, even on my oily lids in the heat of a Texas summer.  </li>
            <li> The color is Ultra Black like it says in the description.</li>
            <li> Also, I was slightly racoon-ey after a slightly humid morning.</li>
            <li> It gets me through the work day, but I can tell I have less on after I get home.</li>
            <li> B006RJRDTY Physicians Formula Mascara, Lash Boosting, Black Organics 7562 0.26 oz (7.5 g)]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the Physicans Formula is almost half the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For less than $10</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I started putting on ELF black cream eye liner underneath, and now it NEVER disappoints.</li>
            <li> I always get ultra black.</li>
            <li> First of all the lower rating is not for the products - its for my stupidity</li>
            <li> is a very dark black.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge either, it just becomes a little lighter after about 12 hours of wear.</li>
            <li> But after a month i started noticing my eyelashes were a little bit thicker</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit to get use too</li>
            <li> Get very black if you want it to look black.</li>
            <li> This is it!!&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to paraben free eyeliners, they tend to smear terribly and would always transfer to my upper lid within an hour.</li>
            <li> i like a felt tip for the control, but they always dried out; this one never does that.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the thin eyeliner wand, but never imagined the eye lash serum would actually work.</li>
            <li> in 1 eyeliner proved that I CAN have a long-wear eye liner without trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the boosting eyeliner for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I put it on everyday when I am doing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s entirely dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and my lashes seem that they have grown.</li>
            <li> This eye liner is the perfectly black liner that lasts For Hours!</li>
            <li> so none of that zig-zagging, dragging, all-over-the-place on your lid, liquid liners that just plain suck to use.</li>
            <li> and usually my lower line would be gone with a few tears.</li>
            <li> This product does have a slight hiccup, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I can create thin or thick lines especially the flicks.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it was a little hard for me to use it because I was not used to applying liquid formula, but now it way easier.</li>
            <li> clearly, I&#x27;m never going to have naturally dramatic eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve gone from \\&quot;mascara</li>
            <li> and I apply very little.</li>
            <li> very little though.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when removing the eyeliner, small specks of it got stuck in my eyelashes, around my eyes, and on my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it came off on the inner corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my lashes are longer or fuller</li>
            <li> Actually used it and was like &amp;#34;So that wasn&#x27;t scary.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the lash-enhancing quality.</li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it will boost my eyelashes</li>
            <li> It looks small</li>
            <li> and it was all dried out!  </li>
            <li> so my eyeliner usually ends up everywhere</li>
            <li> Lasts all day (or two days if I&#x27;m too lazy to take my makeup off at night...</li>
            <li> I must have gone through 5 store brands in the past year in terms of eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it helps boost my lashes</li>
            <li> I apply a very thin layer to my upper lid, and will go heavier for a night out.  </li>
            <li> You can push down firmly for thick lines and adjust to make lines needle thin</li>
            <li> This was kind of annoying since I was afraid of dirt and bacteria getting on the pen.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well with leaving small lines, almost always fat, thick lines.  </li>
            <li> It pains me to say that, unfortunately, Physicians Formula at some point a couple of years ago reformulate the shade Ultra Black and now it is not as black.  </li>
            <li> hard to keep it flowing once you tilt it up to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but it lasts until I&#x27;m off work at least.</li>
            <li> and I use it at LEAST twice a week.</li>
            <li> My only problem is I wish they made it in the Organic Wear line (without the artificial ingredients and chemicals) as they do with the mascara.  </li>
            <li> The application kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> If I want a thick line, I get one....</li>
            <li> I usually wear fake ones (for dramatic looks) but when i don&#x27;t my family still wonders if i have falsies on from how long my lashes have gotten.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my usual liquid liner (Almay&#x27;s) to do the line, and this pen to just do the cat eye tip!</li>
            <li> It just disappears, so you only need to reapply it, and not have to worry about looking like a mad lady with raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> It may smudge if you have seriously watery eyes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sidenote: Seriously ladies, stop funding cruelty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and contact the company because this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually looked into cosmetic tattoos because I&#x27;m so sick of it by now.</li>
            <li> I was so incredibly disappointed in this that I have even purchased the product multiple times since the reformulation, hoping that it was just a fluke, but each purchase has ended in a return.  </li>
            <li> and my eyes are red and extremely swollen from rubbing them because of the horrible itch.</li>
            <li> i had a couple of thin lines all over my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Tip is so thin.</li>
            <li> The applicator tip is thin at the end for a thinner line.</li>
            <li> For those not great with eyeliner, it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> As for the eyelash growth claim, it is unlikely to work for that because the &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredient (myristoyl pentapeptide-17) has no published, peer-reviewed studies backing it up for lash growth, although that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t do something.  </li>
            <li> Caution, you may be allergic to any of the ingredients and could have problems like other people who had a bad experience with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is fairly minor, but it does get slightly annoying after a while.</li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from the thin tipped liquid liners and opt for the thicker brush</li>
            <li> Not a HUGE difference, but I am shocked that I can notice anything at all.</li>
            <li> I just hate it when i saw my eyes dark because of it and make me feel shy in front of my office mate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no return policy.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> My eyes would be insanely itchy and red.</li>
            <li> Not impressive by any means</li>
            <li> but after awhile it became difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all - the expensive, the drugstore, the fancy.</li>
            <li> so I am not impressed with the lash boosting/serum claim.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw the claims on the box, but I looked up reviews on Amazon and everyone raved about it, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s like idiot proof stuff because the tip is thin and it glides-</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Like the very thin liner.</li>
            <li> Now together the ELF base hardly smears at all and the Physicians</li>
            <li> and I had to return it after 2 or 3 weeks because it irritated my eyes like CRAZY.</li>
            <li> So disappointing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t notice a difference in lash length or thickness since I&#x27;ve been using it, so, either it just doesn&#x27;t work for me or the lash boosting claims are a bit exaggerated!</li>
            <li> I am very wary of using it on myself now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so impossible to get off when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Now, the bad part.</li>
            <li> or I got a bad one, but</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeliner for over 2 years; I never imagined I would be so disappointed with it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> ( i know stupid me!) .</li>
            <li> I kept checking my liner out of habit (hate the raccoon look!!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and very good seller</li>
            <li> I guess you could say I&#x27;m not a fan. I tried this product because the reviews were pretty good, but I had a very different experience. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Blotchy - when applied, the eyeliner has inconsistent coverage and you have to go over it multiple times to get an even layer.&lt;br /&gt;-Burns eyelids - enough said, although my skin is somewhat sensitive&lt;br /&gt;-Irritates eyes - the whites of my eyes turn bright red after wearing this eyeliner. While wearing the eyeliner, my eyes didn&#x27;t get too red, but the next morning they were very red - even though I removed the eyeliner and washed my face! I was really surprised about that so I tried it 2 more times to make sure there wasn&#x27;t another factor. I noticed that when removing the eyeliner, small specks of it got stuck in my eyelashes, around my eyes, and on my face. So, for the 2nd &amp; 3rd wearings, I took extra care to remove every speck of eyeliner I could see, wash my face thoroughly, and rinse my eyes multiple times. That didn&#x27;t help. Each following morning I awoke with bright red eyes and specks of eyeliner in the corner of my eyes. All the other products I use are tried and tested old favorites, so it was definitely the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product. Unfortunately, there is no return policy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on nearly as dark or well as I though it would. They say it helps your lashes grow more, but I&#x27;m probably not using it often enough to know. I have to put another &#x27;real&#x27; liner on top of it to get a liner effect like I would want.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for in an eyeliner. I don&#x27;t notice any change in my lashes and wasn&#x27;t expecting to since this is not a pharma grade product, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for that I was looking for low/no irritation and easy apply liquid liner. I&#x27;ll be trying other products before I come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Satisfied! No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have liquid pen-style eyeliners from Tokidoki, Kat Von D, SmashBox, Lancome, etc, and I find myself using this liner the most, even though it&#x27;s half the price. It gives just as fine and precise of a line, plus it has the added benefit of lash-boosting serum!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any results yet about longer lashes but i will give it time  the liner traces pretty good</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this information anywhere! Who is this physician making this formula? I am looking for a new doctor in New York and would love to get his contact information!</li>
            <li> amazing applicator! i like a felt tip for the control, but they always dried out; this one never does that. I hate all other applicators because they are goopy or don&#x27;t have precision; this one has perfect flow and control. I will cry if they ever stop making this product. I recommend to all my friends and they love it. GREAT price. The fact that it makes my eyelashes longer is a bonus. It stays on long even when I do stage performances and get sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t get the regular black since it looks gray. Get very black if you want it to look black.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I didn&#x27;t get the super black one. But the regular black does the trick. My teen had the blacker one, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!  This is the Physicians Formula product that I have tried, and I am impressed.  I have only been using it a couple of weeks, so not a good judge of the &amp;#34;last enhancing&amp;#34; properties; however, it is the easiest liquid/gel liner I have ever used, it goes on smoothly, stays through ANYTHING until I am ready to remove it, does not bleed or run.  I DO use eyeshadow primer (Milani) and put my Urban Decay eyeshadow on wet, using Aveda&#x27;s product for this application.  So there is a good base when I put my eyeliner on.  If I want a thick line, I get one....if I want just a thin line that enhances my lashes, I get that easily, too.  I have used MANY high end products, and this is as good as, or better than, all of them. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner.  I can&#x27;t really verify the eyelash boosting part of it&#x27;s claim to fame, but regardless it&#x27;s a lovely eyeliner.  It&#x27;s my go-to.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner cause a friend recomended it to me and i have to say it was so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If u dont know how to use gel eyeliner or a eyeliner brush or u just dont want to keep cleaning brushes with every use this is the eyeliner u should get,applies easy and looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recomended.</li>
            <li> Applies less pigmented than desired. Had to layer it to get the darker pigmentation to show. Did have a little bit of feathering in the corner of eyes, but I went back over it with the eyeliner a couple times and it helped fix the feathering so it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable. Wore pretty well throughout the day, didn&#x27;t smudge or transfer into lids.... Unfortunately it came off on the inner corner of my eyes. Literally disappeared. Didn&#x27;t even flake, just vanished.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, no irritation (and I&#x27;m allergic to everything) and even though I thought the whole &amp;#34;lash booster&amp;#34; growth thing was a gimmick, I think my lashes actually have become longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I saw this eyeliner being used by a Youtuber that isn&#x27;t good with makeup, and since I am not good with makeup, I tried it. The pen makes it easier to do a cat eye look. I tend to shy away from the thin tipped liquid liners and opt for the thicker brush but this really does help with cat eye. My only issue is that the color doesn&#x27;t last very long. After an 8 hour work day the black is faded. I have been using my usual liquid liner (Almay&#x27;s) to do the line, and this pen to just do the cat eye tip! That seem to be working.</li>
            <li> First of all the lower rating is not for the products - its for my stupidity haha! I accidentally purchased the shade &#x27;black&#x27; and not &#x27;ultra black&#x27;. This shade is good if you&#x27;re doing face art or creating a general outline for something, but its more of a grey than a black. However thats my fault, i didn&#x27;t realise until I received it. Still, if you like grey eyeliner, physicians formula eye booster is my go-to. so so SO easy to use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear eyeliner for years. I have very sensitive skin and eyes and find that most cosmetics, even those for sensitive skin, are much too harsh for me. I bought this hoping for the best, but expecting the same results. I was so wrong. Not only can I wear this. I actually forgot I had it on and neglected to wash it off before going to bed the second time I wore it. The next morning I did not have eyeliner running down my face, either. It was still on my eyes! I love it so much I bought it in brown to give as a gift and my friend loves it, too. Not because she has sensitive eyes like mine, but because it is so easy to put on!!! Give it a try if you haven&#x27;t yet. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed thicker/longer/more lashes, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over two weeks and I don&#x27;t wear it daily. I just forget to put it on sometimes... because I&#x27;ve gone without eyeliner for so many years. But I&#x27;d use it anyway, even if it didn&#x27;t boost my lashes.</li>
            <li> I initially liked this product because it was the way i pictured it to be. the point was so fine that it applied so well. what i didn&#x27;t like was the fact that after a month the product dries up. a personal problem that i had with this product was that i was careless in the way that i covered it with the top and the bristles sprung out. this became a huge problem because instead of having fine lines i had a couple of thin lines all over my eyelid. but overall, i do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> decent eye liner,  did not do anything for length</li>
            <li> only eyeliner i use if i can get my hands on it &amp;#60;3.&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is FABULOUS! I bought one each in black and brown - I use the black on my upper lids and the brown on my lower. I do find that I sometimes have some smudging (especially on those days that I rush application and don&#x27;t wait for things to dry); but if I&#x27;ve allowed proper drying time, the liner lasts ALL DAY without budging - I even fell asleep with it on one night, and woke up to find that it was still in place!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyeliner. Next time will try a brown color.</li>
            <li> Great for quick application, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  I have been using the Rimmel equivalent but with a lot of irritation, red eyes and smudging throughout the day.  I ordered this in an effort to alleviate the eye irritation and redness.  This product is GREAT and I will use this from now on.  Not only does it not smudge but it does not cause irritation, at all, to my eyes.  Nor do I have to re-apply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for the price! I don&#x27;t think my eyelashes are thicker or longer thanks to the serum but I don&#x27;t use it everyday and I apply very little. I bought it because of the price and the good quality of the applicator: it&#x27;s very precise and easy to apply. It stays all day and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation (I wear contacts). For that price I think it&#x27;s a really good product and as good as 20/25 dollars eyeliners I bought from Sephora in the past. Try it!</li>
            <li> I love the brush liner which is so much better than the felt tip liners. I can create thin or thick lines especially the flicks. Ultra black is a great color and stays put all day. The product lasted for 4-5 months. Not sure if my lashes are longer or fuller but I would definitely recommend it as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like what i read from the other comments! i applied in the morning before I go to office, sometimes it smudged.. I just hate it when i saw my eyes dark because of it and make me feel shy in front of my office mate. Better to stick to Dermacol liquid eyeliner..</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past from Walmart and have always loved the formulation and the lasting power. I decided to buy this off amazon because it was a few cents cheaper, no tax, and free shipping. I received it pretty quickly but was a bit disappointed that it was out of the sealed original packaging so there was no way of knowing whether it had already been swatched or even used on someone&#x27;s eye, which I found to be very unsanitary. I am very wary of using it on myself now. If I would have known that this was out of the packaging I would have not purchased it. Maybe they could be trying to save money on shipping because of the bulky packaging but I would have rather had peace of mind knowing it was still sealed.</li>
            <li> Tip is so thin. It glides one perfectly. Love love love</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  Because it is placed just under and part of lash line it really fills in any empty spaces and once mascara is applied it looks great and natural.  I used to wear individual lashes, but with this product I don&#x27;t need them anymore and my lashes are growing back (thanks in part to Rimmel Lash Accelerator...good for eyebrows, too)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner it works the best I wish more stores carried it. I wish ulta carried this product.</li>
            <li> I have Stila, I have Tarte, I have Urban Decay... I have all the expensive eyeliners but this is till my favorite. Doesn&#x27;t last allll day but it lasts until I&#x27;m off work at least. It doesn&#x27;t smudge either, it just becomes a little lighter after about 12 hours of wear. The brush is the best I&#x27;ve found and is so much easier to use than felt or other types of liquid eyeliner. I rarely have to use a q-tip for fixes when I apply</li>
            <li> Big Fan of this stuff. Awesome color but most importantly, it GLIDES so very very well! I mean, it&#x27;s like idiot proof stuff because the tip is thin and it glides- so none of that zig-zagging, dragging, all-over-the-place on your lid, liquid liners that just plain suck to use. So easy, I bought it for my mother who&#x27;s 63 and never wears eyeliner and even SHE liked it. Actually used it and was like &amp;#34;So that wasn&#x27;t scary. That was easy&amp;#34; and I was like &amp;#34;Told you so&amp;#34; which is always fun to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price, lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t dry out on the tip, doesn&#x27;t drag and looks legit on. Solid product.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> (David&#x27;s wife is making this post)&lt;br /&gt;This is product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks and I can actually tell a difference in my eyelash length. I didn&#x27;t buy this product for this reason but it is a pleasant surprise. Hopefully they continue to grow. The applicator tip is thin at the end for a thinner line. I&#x27;ve noticed when I apply the eyeliner, my line is somewhat thicker because this product glides on so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY downfall is that it can easily be wiped off because the solution doesn&#x27;t dry like other liquid eyeliners. Since the formula is more natural and safer than most eyeliners, I don&#x27;t mind the fact it can come off easily. If you don&#x27;t rub your eyes, it won&#x27;t come off! It actually stays DARK black all day for me. It looks like I just applied it even at the end of the day. This will be my primary eyeliner but I might keep a waterproof backup one for certain events.</li>
            <li> Best pen eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, I won&#x27;t bother with other brands any more.  The tip is a tiny, ultra-fine BRUSH, not a felt tip . . . so if you drop it, the brush hairs just go right back to being as pointy as they were before. The product flows very well into the brush tip and as long as you cap it after use, it will last MONTHS, where most pen liners I&#x27;ve had only last a few weeks before they dry up.  It is the blackest black you can imagine, and you can get anything from a super fine line to a thick bold one very easily. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my eyelashes, but it&#x27;s still more than worth the money just because it&#x27;s such a fantastic liner.</li>
            <li> My new fav eyeliner!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner out there if you want to do perfect cat eyes.  The application brush glides on smooth &amp; the tip gives a precise point.  The Ultra Black is a true, dark black.  I always set it with a black BareMinerals powder liner &amp; it stays on all day.  It even survives most of my high intensity Roller Derby practices.  I highly recommend it.  Make sure you cap it tightly after each use &amp; it will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its my oily lids but it does not apply very well</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. Its easy to apply and it lasts almost all day! I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now and I prefer it mostly for my upper eyelid (I tend to do the winged eyeliner).&lt;br /&gt;Its great. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like most liquid eyeliners do.</li>
            <li> The formula is exactly what I was looking for, does not smudge when taking it off and does not come off u til you take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different black liquid eyeliners and this is my FAV!  I will always use this one and I love that it has no harmful chemicals in it like so many eyeliners do.</li>
            <li> Its been one of my favorite for a long time. If you want dark line you have to get the Ultra black. The black is not really black black. It&#x27;s a great price for the product you get. I compare it to the Stila liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li> Looks good - have only used twice. Not sure about the lash-enhancing quality.</li>
            <li> It will be my friend forever.</li>
            <li> This is one of the finest lines I&#x27;ve ever come across for eyeliner. Pen is easily controlled and product rolls out smoothly. No&lt;br /&gt;clumping/dipping and my lashes are longer, thicker, and darker.</li>
            <li> Very nice product !! Quick delivery !!</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE: Since writing the original review I repurchased this product for the fourth time (in Ultra Black) to check again if I could make it work, since I stumbled across a couple recent reviews talking about having to shake up the pen A LOT.  I am so happy to update this review to four stars.  My newest one is just as deep, opaque black and smooth as I remember from my old ones.  Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have to shake more than 20 seconds initially.  So I don&#x27;t know for sure if the ones I bought before that were terrible were duds, or if some of the pens when new have to be shaken for quite a while to get them started.  That&#x27;s why I rated it four stars instead of five, since there may be quality control issues.  BUT I still recommend this more than any other drugstore liquid liner.  It&#x27;s seriously worth giving a shot before writing it off.  As for the eyelash growth claim, it is unlikely to work for that because the &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredient (myristoyl pentapeptide-17) has no published, peer-reviewed studies backing it up for lash growth, although that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t do something.  It just means that it hasn&#x27;t actually been scientifically shown to do anything yet.  Some people say they have noticed a difference though so it probably can&#x27;t hurt to try.  But I recommend this liner because of its perfect tapered brush tip that blows any felt tip or cheap, skinny brush tip out of the water.  It&#x27;s also black black black and resists smudging quite well, even on my oily lids in the heat of a Texas summer.  It takes a long time for the pen to dry out, too, although after a while you do sometimes have to stop during application and shake again a couple times, but I personally don&#x27;t mind.  It may smudge if you have seriously watery eyes and it does dry down to a slightly shiny finish, which you may dislike if you prefer completely matte black liner.  In any case, I am so incredibly thrilled to be able to recommend this again and to use it again.  I will repurchase forever, even with the possibility of dealing with duds.  See original two-star review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Original review:&lt;br /&gt;Writing this review breaks my heart.  When this product first came out, it was definitely instantly in my top 5 list of fave makeup products ever.  It was my number one fave liner ever.  The brush tip is genius.  So easy to use for a perfect line, thick or thin, and makes the flick of a cat eye so so easy.  This product is the reason I will never be satisfied with anything but a brush tip liner for cat eyes again.  I can&#x27;t speak to the lash growing claim, but the brush tip, price, long wear, smudge resistance, and long period of use before dry out made this product a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the problem?  Well, another of the winning features of this liner was that the shade Ultra Black was super super black, as you would expect.  It pains me to say that, unfortunately, Physicians Formula at some point a couple of years ago reformulate the shade Ultra Black and now it is not as black.  In fact, it&#x27;s not even opaque, even after multiple passes.  I was so incredibly disappointed in this that I have even purchased the product multiple times since the reformulation, hoping that it was just a fluke, but each purchase has ended in a return.  No more.  I am also not the only former fan to notice this change.  I am looking for a replacement now.  So far the new fave is Kat Von D Tatoo Liner, which is a bit pricier and harder to get.  Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t imagine who would enjoy this product now, since it doesn&#x27;t provide an opaque line.  But, I can at least still say that the ease of use and brush tip are still great, hence the two stars.</li>
            <li> This liner is easy to apply. Nice thin tip. I do prefer Mac Liner for the cat eye tails though. But this is a nice every day look. I don&#x27;t know if it grows eyelashes as I don&#x27;t apply eye makeup everyday, only when I go out. I work from home and my dogs don&#x27;t care if I have makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free makeup brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on February 23th and used it about 3 times a week. I still have product left, I think I got a fresh one, thankfully. The color is Ultra Black like it says in the description. At the beginning it was a little hard for me to use it because I was not used to applying liquid formula, but now it way easier. I shake it first and then hold my eyelid, stretch it out a little bit and draw one thin line. It looks like I have nothing on, which I like, but my lashes instantly appear thicker. My eyes look bigger. My deep brown eyes look less dark in contrast with the ultra black color of the eyeliner, that is how I can tell is a very dark black. It comes off easily if you rub it with a Q-tip soaked in water, so don&#x27;t expect it to last through the day&#x27;s up and downs. I can sweat and it does not come off, unless I rub it accidentally. My skin is dry, so that is another reason it does not come off easily. I could tell it would come off if the skin was more oily. About the lash boost, I think it keeps the eyelashes well because I always use boosting serums to maintain my lashes and when I stopped the lashes fell off. This time, when I stopped using the Rimmel Serum and started using this one, the lashes did not fall off and still look healthy. I am not saying they look like falsies, but they look better than before I started using serums. Caution, you may be allergic to any of the ingredients and could have problems like other people who had a bad experience with this eyeliner. You could experience swelling, itchiness, redness and eyelashes may also fall. I think this is not likely judging by the reviews, most people were not allergic. I recommended it, and already bought my second tube. I don&#x27;t want to run out of it. I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> That so good i love it💞</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the thin eyeliner wand, but never imagined the eye lash serum would actually work. It really does! I had been wearing the eyeliner for maybe 6 weeks, then once day noticed that the outside corner of my upper eyelashes were longer than I remembered. It was only then that I realized that it was eye liner. I tend to wear the eyeliner heavier on the outside corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To boost the rest of my lashes, I started applying it across the whole lid. Just a couple of weeks later, my lashes have lengthened significantly. Totally awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner itself is great too. It applies very easily with a super thin wand. It sets and wears very well, all day long.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this eyeliner that I purchased 2. However, on me, the \\&quot;ultrablack\\&quot; was just sort of gray and I was glad that I didn&#x27;t throw my previous liner away to use over it. Also, I was slightly racoon-ey after a slightly humid morning. Not sure if it will boost my eyelashes so I&#x27;ll keep using it to test that. I&#x27;ll write a follow-up if I see positive results.</li>
            <li> I give it a five because this eyeliner is so much easier to control and apply. I love that the tip it thin. I&#x27;ve tried mac, stilla, and makeup forever. This blows them all out of the water. Good pigment and staying power too. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for 10+ yrs, although I&#x27;ve tried many expensive brands, I always end up going back to this one.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge, stays on all day and it&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this at a store with a eye last curler with it but unfortunately no stores near me just carried this product alone. Came in fast, it&#x27;s such a good product I recommend this product for anyone! So please! :)</li>
            <li> Hard to use, never looked &#x27;right&#x27; on me, doubt the claim it can boost lash growth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Goes on smooth, stays put, no sticky feeling. Love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter wears this for auditions &amp; shows.  She has to reapply a couple of times during a show because it wipes off easily, but it&#x27;s easier to clean up afterwards.  She has to loves it &amp; we feel better about her wearing it more often!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing.  It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.  When I purchased the product I was not actually expecting my lashes to grow but I have been pleasantly surprised at how much fuller and longer my lashes have gotten.  I have been using the liner for about a month now and my lashes are looking really great.  I would recommend this product and it has now become a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to eye liner and mascara. There are very few brands that I can use without having irritation and eye infections, especially from waterproof makeup. I usually experience my first symptoms of irritation within the first hour. This Physicians Formula Eye Booster 2 in 1 eyeliner proved that I CAN have a long-wear eye liner without trouble. In fact, I put it on this morning and had forgotten to remove it before I started to settle in for the night. No irritation existed to remind me to take it off for the night. Thank you Physician&#x27;s Formula. I am excited to use it again. I am looking forward to seeing just how it helps my eye lashes now as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this. I did for the first few days. The application tip is awesome! You can make a realllly precise line with it. The color was very black (ultrablack) which is awesome. The staying power was alright (I have hooded lids so that&#x27;s probably why since most liners smudge on me). Now, the bad part. I had tried RapidLash before and I had to return it after 2 or 3 weeks because it irritated my eyes like CRAZY. It gave me EXTREME dry eye syndrome. No kidding! My eyes would be insanely itchy and red. I stopped using it and the dry eyes persisted for a few months. It went away when I stated using Latisse which I loved. The Latisse made my lashes grow a ton but it did bother my eyes a bit. I stopped it when my lashes started falling out (it&#x27;s normal but not ideal). I bought this liner thinking it would help get a little of the Latisse the goth back but I&#x27;ve been using it maybe 2 weeks and I really loved it until I noticed my eyes started getting itchy. I thought if it was minimal itching I would continue using it but last night I forgot to wash off my makeup before bed and my eyes are red and extremely swollen from rubbing them because of the horrible itch. I hope it doesn&#x27;t take too long for them to get back to normal because I want to gauge my eyes out right now.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as an eyeliner I really liked it. As far as having sensitive eyes I&#x27;d say proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s the polypeptides in it that bother me because that&#x27;s the same thing that RapidLash had. I read something about having celiac&#x27;s disease (which I have) and polypeptides so maybe there&#x27;s a correlation but idk.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, my eyelashes have remained the same. This has no lash boosting effect.&lt;br /&gt;As a simple eyeliner, it is easy to apply, stays on for about 4-5 hours, usually fades afterward so I would have to reapply mid day. Not impressive by any means</li>
            <li> Love it and inexpensive</li>
            <li> Super messy! And runs out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> This was great when I first started experimenting with liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s quite forgiving and holding a pen was more natural for me than those other applicator wands. It&#x27;s also easy to fix mistakes with this pen as it doesn&#x27;t set quickly. The flip side is that it smudges quickly and the color goes away quickly. Also if you are looking for a striking solid dark black, this isn&#x27;t it. This creates a light black color.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever had! It looks small but if you store it the right way (Right side up is what worked for me) it&#x27;ll last a while. When I received it I thought it would last a week to 2 weeks; I ordered it from Mini Max Outlet Store on January 31st, it arrived February 6th, and it still feel at least half full and I use it at LEAST twice a week. Note I do use quite a bit of eyeliner. I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in my lashes but not major but I didn&#x27;t get it for that purpose anyways. Great eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for an eyeliner - preferably liquid, that didn&#x27;t smear and was paraben-free! This is it!!&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to paraben free eyeliners, they tend to smear terribly and would always transfer to my upper lid within an hour. Very frustrating. But this eyeliner stays on all day long and pretty much even when I sleep in it. There is ZERO smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I will be wearing this until they stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;So glad to have found this.</li>
            <li> excellent product really grow eyelashes ago I found it great buenisimo and durable this is the second I buy and  actually very good</li>
            <li> Super black and easy to apply. Last all day as long as you don&#x27;t touch it with water</li>
            <li> Nice liner but does nothing for your lashes.</li>
            <li> I am known by friends/family/coworkers as the girl with perfectly applied eyeliner. This eyeliner is the reason why. I have tried dozens of other liquid eyeliners because they come highly-recommended but none of them even come close to this one--they just end up in the bottom of my makeup bag, abandoned after one use. This eyeliner is the right amount of black, it applies smoothly and evenly, it lasts all day (which is impressive because I work outside in Florida), and the tip doesn&#x27;t fray/deform/whatever after a ton of uses--which means my cat eye is perfect every time.</li>
            <li> I love the actual &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; tip, and for a liquid liner it dries quickly and fairly opaque. This liner is actually better than the comparable Sephora version I used to use, although it is a little trickier to layer and doesn&#x27;t last quite as long. It makes up for that in the precise application and durable set of the liquid, so I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Best liner I have used and I have tried a ton! This liner lasts and stays put better than any other I ha pave tried. I put it on after my NARS shadow primer, so it definitely doesn&#x27;t budge! I haven&#x27;t really noticed a different in my lash length or fullness, but I could care less. That isn&#x27;t what I bought it for. No other liner has lasted through watering eyes etc in the corners like this does. And did I mention it STAYS PUT?? I think I did, but it must be mentioned again. No smearing and smudging with this product. I should mention I do not use it on my lower lash line, I just used a liner brush a little black shadow before I follow with clear mascara on the lower lashes. I use black mascara on my upper lashes only, I think this helps prevent smudging under the eyes. It is also super easy to use. The tip makes it easy to do ultra thin to thick liner, and is great for cat eyes!</li>
            <li> Lasted for two times, never buy it again...</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was quicker and easier to use to replace my gel eyeliner. This is great for any type of look, simple liner to cat eye liner (which is what I use it for), its pretty dark but not as bold as gel eyeliner. It&#x27;s super easy to use especially for beginners I would recommend it. It is kinda long wearing but at the same time smudgy if its hot out or if you accidentally touch your eyes. I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and it is long lasting and not something that runs out or dries up quickly and needs to be replaced often which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going off about the &amp;#34;lash boosting&amp;#34; effect, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough for that. It&#x27;s a good waterproof eyeliner. My eyes watered up, and it didn&#x27;t run. Having said that, it also isn&#x27;t a 24 hour liner, either. It gets me through the work day, but I can tell I have less on after I get home.</li>
            <li> long staying，thin line，good product！</li>
            <li> The only eyeliner I&#x27;ll ever use. The brush tip makes application so simple. You can push down firmly for thick lines and adjust to make lines needle thin all in one stroke, all without reapplying more make up to the brush because it&#x27;s ready to go. My only gripe is that if your eyes tear up often, it washed away a little too easily. All in all, this is my favorite eyeliner. Easy to control and comes on nice and bold, just how I like it.  As for the lash enhancing effects, i can&#x27;t really tell if there&#x27;s a difference at all. My lashes are still pretty thin and I&#x27;ve been using only this for several years.</li>
            <li> Love it the best i ever try so far.... the only bad thing is that they run out too fast. But other than that i love it</li>
            <li> Love it!  This is my 3rd or 4th one.</li>
            <li> Unless you constantly shake up the tube, the eyeliner stops coming out. When I first used the product it worked great but after awhile it became difficult to apply. Definitely won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My second most favorite eye-liner. My first one I bought in a fancy mall somewhere in Taiwan or Japan but this one - the Physicians Formula - is a nice dark black, not the watered down black that you have to draw 3 or 4 times over your eyes to get a full-on dark. This eye liner is the perfectly black liner that lasts For Hours! I would say that it stays in tip top condition up to 8 hours, and does not fade away much after that either .... It is a wee bit of work to get it off, you just need to be gentle not to wipe your eyes hard. I am still giving it a solid 5-star for being such a solid product for such a great affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, but... hard to keep it flowing once you tilt it up to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Also noticed that it seems to crackel, and break off the lid after it dries.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite eye liner.  I recently just bought it in a pack of three at Target and it was all dried out!  So disappointing so I came on Amazon to get it for cheaper.  Favorite!!!!!!!  I always get compliments on my cat eye.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to eyeliner for about 3 or 4 years now. I&#x27;ve tried a few other drugstore brand liquid eyeliners and none can hold a candle to this Physician&#x27;s Formula. The calligraphy brush style tip makes drawing lines easy and the ultra black shade is a true jet black. I have oily skin and this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t budge! Easy to take off with make-up remover. My lashes are naturally long and personally haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in length but that might just be me. What else is there to say other than it&#x27;s awesome? You probably won&#x27;t find a better drugstore eyeliner for the cost and I&#x27;m sure it can beat some of the higher end brands. Why pay $20+ when $7 will do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stoked about how cheap I can get these on Amazon as opposed to the drug store and will definitely purchase more once my current stash runs out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic BUT it&#x27;s also just a GREAT eyeliner. I love the way it slides on, the dark color, and the way it stays on. Also, I get no irritation when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all - the expensive, the drugstore, the fancy. I keep coming back to this one. I have not noted any lash boosting, but I know it&#x27;s reasonable and stays put.</li>
            <li> Goes on fine, haven&#x27;t yet noticed results but I live the product and the color especially</li>
            <li> This is best liquid eyeliner by far, and I have tried a lot. I don&#x27;t really know if it &amp;#34;boosts eyelash growth&amp;#34;, but it goes on super easy and is very easy to do the &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look with. I have been using it for about 3 years now-- I hope they never discontinue it because it is one of my makeup loves!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> I have droopy eyelids so my eyeliner usually ends up everywhere but where it started. I can&#x27;t say much about my eyelash growth but this is very easy to put on and STAYS where I put it!!  This will be my ONLY eyeliner from now on.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, but does eventually flake by end of the day.</li>
            <li> This lash boosting eyeliner does what the ads say.  It helps you eyelashes thicken.  I put it in the&lt;br /&gt;groove right above my lashes for a defining eye look, and then it works its magic during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I remove it at night, but layer it on my eyebrows to thicken them too.</li>
            <li> Great for cat eyes! Makes application a cinch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the eyelash serum claims, but this is an excellent eyeliner that lasts all day. Truly the best I&#x27;ve found, and great for cat eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner so much, it&#x27;s very precise and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner ever. I have been on a quest for over a year looking  for an eyeliner that is gym proof. Sometimes I go to work then immediately  after go to the gym. Most eyeliners  make me look like I have been bawling after my workout. But this one ..it is the best. I have tried pencil fell pens liquid water proof everything  you can imagine. This one is the absolute  best eyeliner  ever. I love it my search is over.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner!!! This is already my second one. The first one i won from Physician&#x27;s Formula and i liked it so much i was sad when i ran out and i had to get another one! I swear that this made my eyelashes longer. I usually wear fake ones (for dramatic looks) but when i don&#x27;t my family still wonders if i have falsies on from how long my lashes have gotten.  AND not only does it make it long, the liquid itself if awesome. The tip is really defined and pointed for a more accurate and precise application and the liquid is smooth and glides on easily. Once it&#x27;s dry it looks awesome and it won&#x27;t smear (unless you rub your eyes or something. Either way, i have never found an eyeliner so amazing as this one. When i run out you can bet i&#x27;ll be buying more again! :) I&#x27;d definitely give this 10 stars if i could!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. It&#x27;s just so impossible to get off when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Amazing.!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this if you dont know how to use a liner this does the job.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is extremely outstanding if it&#x27;s a dupe for another brand it will be Dior and it&#x27;s as perfect as Dior with a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I normally cannot make a straight line with liners to save my life, but with this one it&#x27;s much easier.  I accidentally left the cap off for a few hours and it dried out so I went back to my other twist up eyeliner, which made me realize even more how great this one is.  So I&#x27;m back to get another one.  It&#x27;s a keeper.  Now, as for the lash boosting claims, I do have to doubt this; however I have to admit I don&#x27;t use it daily, and maybe that is what you have to do to see any result, but I highly doubt it has Lastisse-like results.  Anyway, still 5 stars as I love the liner and it&#x27;s not like it costs any more than similar liners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a while, and I love the thin applicator pen... really good control compared to other liquid liners I&#x27;ve used.  Lasts all day (or two days if I&#x27;m too lazy to take my makeup off at night... eek!) on upper lids, but does wear off faster under bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice a difference in lash length or thickness since I&#x27;ve been using it, so, either it just doesn&#x27;t work for me or the lash boosting claims are a bit exaggerated!</li>
            <li> This works great, the eyeliner and the serum.  The eyeliner is very easy to apply, long lasting, and a great ultra black color.  the serum has really worked to improve my lash length, thickness, and strength. Also, its a great price!  My only problem is I wish they made it in the Organic Wear line (without the artificial ingredients and chemicals) as they do with the mascara.  [[ASIN:B006RJRDTY Physicians Formula Mascara, Lash Boosting, Black Organics 7562 0.26 oz (7.5 g)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product if you dont care about the ingredients.  However, I&#x27;m still in search for the perfect all natural/organic liquid eyeliner pen so if you know of one, please share! (:</li>
            <li> The application kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> nope this stuff just comes right off...it looks beautiful at first, but in 30 minutes having to re-apply.  Also,  its like  you can do one eye, and its like the stuff won&#x27;t come out for the second...  Will not buy again!  damn why is it so hard to find a good eyeliner!</li>
            <li> It comes off easy and the tube itself lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, not as long-lasting as I would like, however.  I do have oily eyelids, so I have to re-apply this occasionally throughout the day</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Goes on so easily and easy to manage application.  My only complaint might be that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but the price is so much better on amazon, it is a good value!!</li>
            <li> The swatch was very impressive!, I can&#x27;t wait to try it on myself.  Super happy with the fast delivery and awesome product.</li>
            <li> I am so very surprised by this eyeshadow.  I didn&#x27;t expect to love it so much.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of liquid liners, all high end, stila, eyeko, Kat von D, and this one trumps all of those.  The tip is a brush, not a felt tip which makes a WORLD of difference.  The tip won&#x27;t change shape or lose ink like the felt tips do.  The ink is nice and black, and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all once it sets.  It doesn&#x27;t budge!  Even after a long, hot day running around waitressing, it was perfect.  Also, this is the ONLY eyeliner I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need primer for.  It doesn&#x27;t transfer into my crease with my oily lids, and that is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the Kat Von D: This liner lasts longer and the Kat Von D actually does start to pull away from my lash line if I&#x27;m sweating.  So the Physicans Formula is almost half the price (less if you can find a good sale) and it&#x27;s a better lasting product.</li>
            <li> Perfect eyeliner.  The tip is precise and not too soft it allows a nice application.  I&#x27;ve been using the boosting eyeliner for a few weeks and I noticed my lashes are thicker. I just ordered a clear one to use when I don&#x27;t want to apply any makeup.</li>
            <li> I must have gone through 5 store brands in the past year in terms of eyeliners.  They were all decent for maybe the first two weeks then the trouble begins.  For more expensive brands, they last longer but eventually the eyeliner becomes not so easy to use.  I was heading out to Sephora to shop around when I stumbled upon a sale at the drug store.  I couldn&#x27;t resist the 2 for 1 packaging and the sales lady says she swears by this one.  I thought, for the price of $14 for 2, I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  Wow was I pleasantly surprised!  This one is easy to use, very smooth, quick drying and I was able to line my eyes in half of the usual time!  This doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all, the quality feels right along the lines of way more expensive liners.  It stayed on all day which is amazing since I have pretty greasy eyelids.  I haven&#x27;t used it for more than 4 weeks yet so I can&#x27;t tell whether it works for lash boosting effects or not.  I have very long eyelashes anyways so that isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem with this product is the packaging.  While I like that it is designed to have a very strong seal, it is a bit of a trouble to close.  The first time I did it, I wasn&#x27;t too careful and the entire pen BOUNCED OFF onto the floor!  This was kind of annoying since I was afraid of dirt and bacteria getting on the pen.  luckly it didnt land in the right angle to touch the floor but lesson learned, one MUST BE CAREFUL CLOSING THE PEN!  If Physician&#x27;s Formula could change this, it would be the perfect eyeliner.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m sticking to it since it&#x27;s a good product, better than some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It works so easily. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t been using this for years. I now have this in black and brown :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Not only has it helped my lashes grow long, but fuller too! I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and am a frequent buyer. Would recommend to every girl I know</li>
            <li> Great product...I probably could open a store with all of the eyeliners I have tried.  This one works great...it stays on, doesn&#x27;t burn or flake off, and is very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. The seller I purchased from sent me brown instead of Ultra black, however the brown works well for a more natural look. I later purchased the ultra black from Target because it is better for a dramatic effect. For me this doesn&#x27;t smudge and is easy to apply. Creates a nice cat-eye look. I don&#x27;t use it often enough to attest to the lash growth effects.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is amazing one of my favorite eyeliners ! Came fast !</li>
            <li> By far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the black line on my eyelid like every other liner I&#x27;ve ever used, but comes off easily with soap and water.  I bought the first one in-store, and after wearing a few times, had to come online and buy several more, just in case it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know how other people feel about this, but my lashes have grown.  I put it on everyday when I am doing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about the lash-boosting claims, but I really liked the idea of starting to use a liquid eyeliner daily, so I gave it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the eyeliner itself is quite nice.  I really like the easy to apply tip, and for a drugstore eyeliner, I don&#x27;t think you can beat it. I got the brown color.  I apply a very thin layer to my upper lid, and will go heavier for a night out.  The best part is how long just one tube of it lasts!  I was using it pretty much every day for about 6 months, and it just ran out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my eyelashes are considerably longer.  Previously I had used a latisse-like serum that was much, much more expensive than this.  It did work, but once you stop using it, your lashes will grow back as their normal, shorter size.  This worked so well that when my friends and I were putting on individual falsies for a fun night out, you could not even see the false lashes on me!  That&#x27;s when I really realized how well this product is working. Plus, you are more likely to put this on because you&#x27;re already wearing eyeliner on most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For less than $10, you get a true-multitasker.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product: very black, it slides smoothly and stays all day ! I don&#x27;t know if it really works as lashes enhancer, but it permits me to draw my cat eyes so easily that it&#x27;s now my favourite eyeliner !</li>
            <li> UPDATE: LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner. It&#x27;s my most precious makeup product. I wish I took before and after pictures of my eyelashes--I cannot believe how well this works for only $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this liner religiously for a month, and my lashes have definitely grown! For my upper lashes, it&#x27;s a bit longer, but much fuller and healthier. I have rows and rows of eyelashes now, where I used to only have a row. And my lower lashes are as long as my upper lashes used to be, with a few more rows too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now clearly, I&#x27;m never going to have naturally dramatic eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve gone from \\&quot;mascara barely works\\&quot; to \\&quot;mascara looks like falsies\\&quot;... in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... lots of people are raving about the liner formulation. It&#x27;s ok. I prefer my gel liner for lasting power. The liner applies very well. That&#x27;s the best part. I&#x27;m not too sure about the lasting power, since at the end of the day it&#x27;s definitely flecked off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the lash serum. I have naturally short, skimpy Asian lashes. The kind where mascara hardly has any effect because you barely have anything to build from. I feel like I am going crazy, but my eyelashes feel more substantial after less than a week of using this product. Like I have more of them, and they are longer and stronger. Not a HUGE difference, but I am shocked that I can notice anything at all. (Looks in a close-up mirror)... Yep, definitely MORE lashes. It&#x27;s crazy. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am always searching for a great all-day/waterproof eyeliner and this one comes close to being the one. It does last for a very long time, even with my warm/oily lids. Doesn&#x27;t get flaky. And it is highly pigmented in color. I got the ultrablack. To apply, I shake the pen first, uncap, then apply the liquid liner at an approximately 20-25 degree angle from my face. Do not go over skin you&#x27;ve already lined or the eyeliner will cake and become ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any difference to my lashes so I am not impressed with the lash boosting/serum claim.</li>
            <li> I bought it because i wanted to be able to wear a thin line. It works well ! But after a month i started noticing my eyelashes were a little bit thicker and i couldn&#x27;t understand why! I use fake eye lashes 2times a week and recently had eyelash extensions and due to having the extensions a was almost left with no eyelashes ( i know stupid me!) . My eyelashes are not super long or even long but they are are a bit thicker  and fuller.</li>
            <li> I am a novice at make up and just recently started using it daily. I recently purchased this and I love it. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say for sure if it makes your eyelashes grow. I like that it glides on easy and lasts all day long and it doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner!  This eyeliner is fantastic. It is dark and absolutely smudge proof.  It can be administered as a subtle filler or a more dramatic cat eye. Once you put it on it lasts all day and even to the next day if you do not wash it off. I had a friend ask me how I got my eyeliner so dark (I had previously been using pencil liners).  I will be reordering regularly!</li>
            <li> The best and most precise brush ever</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews about how this eyeliner is so amazing. Therefore, I decided to try it. This product is just not for me. As soon as I put it on, it gets on my eye since I&#x27;m not used to it and it stings my eye. Even if I put it correctly,  my tears tend to dissolve the formula making it smudge all over my eyes. It might be a great product for others but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeliner for over 2 years; I never imagined I would be so disappointed with it now. I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed, but the last 2 eyeliners that I have bought have been drastically different from the eyeliner I know and love. It (1) does not apply as smoothly as before, (2) smudges throughout the day, and (3) is extremely hard to take off. I had none of these problems before and I have drawn out using my eyeliner from November (yes, it lasts that long) just because I refuse to let go of such an amazing product. I am sad that this eyeliner has changed into something else; I doubt I will be able to find another eyeliner that will be as good as this used to be.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and that the line is thin and very easy to apply i just wish it was a more darker</li>
            <li> It was a wonderful liquid eyeliner except that the black color is watery. The brush like pen was great and I prefer it over other liners I have used for that reason.</li>
            <li> This is a really good and easy to use eyeliner.  I was using make up forever before, as well as urban decay, but I actually like this one better.  While it may crack or peel a little as the day goes on, it doesn&#x27;t peel or flake off in chunks like the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  Just the right amount comes out as you use it and it&#x27;s very easy to control.</li>
            <li> Love this. This is the first time I have ever been able to use liquid eyeliner. I am not sure how well it helps boost my lashes but I can apply it easily and precisely so I consider that a win. For whatever reason my tears can make a lot of eye products run, this stays on until I remove it at night. My go to eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m probably on my 9th one now. I like how they never smudge and the color stays on without flaking all day.&lt;br /&gt;One tip: when you are not using the eyeliner, keep it standing upside down. Trust me, the eyeliner will last longer this way.</li>
            <li> This product does deliver on its promises.  I am an senior citizen, and for a long time I had thick and reasonably long eyelashes.  All that changes with time, and let me tell you ~ it doesn&#x27;t change for the better.  Eye Booster has made my lashes longer, thicker and healthier.  No, I haven&#x27;t turned into a glamour girl, but it&#x27;s certainly improved my appearance  and made my eyes appear more expressive.  Ladies, this product is reasonably priced and delivers far more value that all those fancy expensive items which are flogged on t.v.  Well worth a try.  .</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw the claims on the box, but I looked up reviews on Amazon and everyone raved about it, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I hate to sound like an infomercial, but after 1 week, I really noticed results!  My lashes looked fuller and thicker.  I have wimpy Asian lashes.  They are a little longer than most, but there isn&#x27;t much of it.  Now I can actually notice my lashes without glopping on tons of mascara.  Even my lower lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though, that as a liquid eyeliner, it&#x27;s only meh.  You have to wait a long time for it to dry or it&#x27;ll smear.  And towards the end of the night it starts flaking off.  So I&#x27;m going to give the clear serum a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I have no regrets!  It&#x27;s totally worth the 10 bucks at the drug store!  Buy it!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> applying it takes some getting used to when going from a pencil to liquid...but i love this product in general! it stayed on all day and didnt budge!</li>
            <li> The eyelash booster does actually work. My eyelashes were noticeably denser, though not necessarily longer. I always preferred eyeliners with felt pen tips because they are the easiest and most precise way to apply them, giving sharp and crystal clear lines. As for the waterproofing... it&#x27;s good but not great. On the upper lid it&#x27;s pretty good, but I have wet eyes that water easily under wind and usually my lower line would be gone with a few tears. But the good thing about this is that even if it is not truly waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t smear into raccoon eyes when it&#x27;s coming off from water, sweat or tears. It just disappears, so you only need to reapply it, and not have to worry about looking like a mad lady with raccoon eyes. I&#x27;ve stuck with this eyeliner for a couple of years now, and it will be that way unless I find an equal alternative that does better in waterproofing.</li>
            <li> The liner did not come in original packaging, but overall I think this is an awesome product. The brush part is not too flimsy and I have great control over it. It washes off with water. I didn&#x27;t see any lash boosting effects yet, but according to some reviews on this product, it will eventually do its job. My eyelids are oily and this does not run. It takes a few strokes to get the right shade of black though. Overall, I love this product and i would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have seen my lashes growing! very little though.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I took off one star because it tends to look shiny in a certain light, rather than dark matte black. HOWEVER, I started putting on ELF black cream eye liner underneath, and now it NEVER disappoints. ELF is what I used before I tried this out, and I love the ELF company and its whole line but I got liner smear a lot with their cream liner (which I preferred above all their other kinds of liner). Now together the ELF base hardly smears at all and the Physicians Formula never flakes or fades and has a great depth of color. I intend to continue using both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing black eye liner on my top lids cat-eye style every day for the last 15+ years. I have never found an eye liner that stays in place for a dependable amount of time. I&#x27;ve actually looked into cosmetic tattoos because I&#x27;m so sick of it by now. So I did my research on this product, saw that across the board, on every site that carried it, people overwhelmingly raved about this liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add me to the list of believers. The first time I tried this, I put it on in the morning, rode my bike 6 miles to work, went the whole day, rode 6 miles back  (this is AUGUST &#x3D; sweat-drenched bike rides). I kept checking my liner out of habit (hate the raccoon look!!) all day, but it literally hadn&#x27;t budged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I went to wash my face before bed, this stuff was still in place. In the interest of full disclosure, yes it had faded somewhat by that point, but it hadn&#x27;t smeared or peeled or flaked. I have never been so impressed by a make-up product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST of ALL: this brand does NOT test on animals!! At the very least it feels good to know my money isn&#x27;t funding the torture of innocent animals so that I can feel &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: Seriously ladies, stop funding cruelty. Look your products&#x27; companies up: we&#x27;ve got the internet now, you can do it with minimal difficulty. It&#x27;s BARBARIC what they do to cats, dogs, monkeys, rabbits, mice, etc, in the name of OUR vanity and societal pressure to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; a certain way.of OUR vanity and societal pressure to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; a certain way.</li>
            <li> So this is a rather excellent eyeliner. The brush-tip pen is very fine and you can create really nice and accurate lines with practice. The finish has a light satin sheen. This product does have a slight hiccup, at least for me. The product has a tendency to dry and accumulate on the tip, which impedes flow and may make it appear to stop working. To get the pen flowing again, I usually do a couple of test swipes on my wrist and flex the bristles slightly more than usual. This is fairly minor, but it does get slightly annoying after a while.</li>
            <li> This would be a great eyeliner, the best even, except as many other reviewers have noted...it quickly dries up. I only had about 5 uses within one month before it was dried out! Clearly there is a design flaw they need to address.  But the line it creates is exceptional!  I personally didn&#x27;t use it enough for it to be effective as a serum.</li>
            <li> I usually have issues with eyeliners smudging, creating panda eyes, but this the only drugstore eyeliner that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t do that to me. It lasts almost a full work day, but instead of smudging, it flakes off, which is a quality that I really like. I can wear it to the gym without worrying about it. I can&#x27;t say that my lashes are any more longer or fuller, however, but that is not the reason why I use this product. Lastly, the ultra black isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;ultra black,&amp;#34; compared to some other black eyeliners I&#x27;ve used. The ultra black is just black, at best (Milani&#x27;s Eye Tech Extreme Liquid Liner in blackest black is darker than this eyeliner).</li>
            <li> This is quite strange. I bought a brown one from another site and it was one of the best eyeliners I had ever used. Very easy to put on, it stayed put and actually helped my lashed grow. However, this particular one- first came in a plastic box that looked like it had been completely ruined due to some sort of heat appied onto the plastic case... I didn&#x27;t bother to return it because I assumed the product would still work like the old one. I was wrong. It went on very runny and watery. I don&#x27;t think I can return it without the squished box it came in, but I will try anyway...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It is better than the expensive estee lauder black liquid eyeliner that I used to use. Great find.</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner ever, hands down. I have anxiety which causes my hands to shake incessantly, which meant until I found this liquid eyeliner, I wasn&#x27;t able to use liquid eyeliner &amp; had to settle for pencil, which never turned out quite the way I like it. With this eyeliner I was able to have a perfect line on both eyes in ten seconds flat! I&#x27;ve finally found my holy grail eyeliner &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this. First, I&#x27;ve gotten this before. This time, it lasted two applications!! now it&#x27;s taking the eyeliner off!! I don&#x27;t know if it lost it&#x27;s shell-life or I got a bad one, but it&#x27;s entirely dried out. I&#x27;m going to try and contact the company because this is ridiculous. I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is SO easy to use and create smooth, straight lines with...I&#x27;m just used to using a pencil because it is faster, so I don&#x27;t use this as often. The color seems to fade halfway through the day and I can&#x27;t really say much for the lash serum benefits....overall this is just ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product .</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner. I&#x27;ve purchased it three times! It&#x27;s my go-to and it&#x27;s so easy to use. For those not great with eyeliner, it&#x27;s a breeze. My 51-yo mother, who never wore eyeliner, picked this up and it looked great on the first try. I always get ultra black. The application is fairly simple. I keep mine stored upside-down to prevent the tip from drying out. I have found it really lengthens the life of my eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;The regular black isn&#x27;t very opaque and it&#x27;s almost kind of grey. It comes of pretty easily, as well. I haven&#x27;t noticed any boosting of my lashes, but I don&#x27;t get it for that. Natural makeup is my thing, and if you&#x27;re looking to switch over, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best drugstore liquid eyeliner I have ever used. I recommend it to everyone, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I had heard wonderful things about this mascara so I was a little more than excited to try it. The product arived on time in its original packaging and did not disappoint, it is truly a lengthening mascara!</li>
            <li> Like the very thin liner.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is incredible! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and my lashes seem that they have grown. In addition, I&#x27;ve always fought an on-going battle with liquid eyeliner...in addition to recently moving to the very humid Deep South I assumed the battle would continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tips for better, longer lasting, results: Apply on top of an eye makeup primer, or simply use eyeshadow. If you&#x27;re going for the cat-eye look, don&#x27;t stress over mistakes. While it does not smear just from use, you can easily remove it with a damp paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten an excellent 16 hour use out of one application with zero smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li> Favorite eyeliner EVER.</li>
            <li> Does not go on smoothly.  Doesn&#x27;t do well with leaving small lines, almost always fat, thick lines.  Would never buy this again.  Am still waiting for these magical eye lashes the product guarantees.  Doubt there&#x27;s any lash bulking serum in the product.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite product. physicians formula products are generally of good quality and this one is no less.</li>
            <li> I used to use this eyeliner like 5 years ago and I loved it. Until now, I feel like something has changed. The eyeliner sticks to my eyelids. That used to never happen. And after a days wear, if it gets into my eye, I started tearing. That also used to never happen. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I thought this would be a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have had this for almost a month and I can tell a big difference in my eye lashes.  My husband can also.  It does take a little bit to get use too but this is def. water proof it also looks like gel.  There is quite a bit that you can do with a pen as opposed to a liquid liner.  One other pirk it doesn&#x27;t fade or flake off.  If it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to work use a tissue and lightly running it back and forth and it will work just fine.  I think the reason it will do this occasionally is bec of the powder of the eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I like the easiness of the liner it glides on effortlessly. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if its helping with lash length as well as growth. I like that if you make a mistake, it is easy to remove with just water and a q-tip. That is why i ranked it 4 stars</li>
