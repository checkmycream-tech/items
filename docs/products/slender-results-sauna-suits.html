    <ol>
            <li> Good quality for a good price</li>
            <li> I bought this suit for working out to lose water weight and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Fits XL as advertised. It looked small but waist and neckband stretch way way out.&lt;br /&gt;Item is as described, and a great value</li>
            <li> Worked well until it rippedðŸ˜©</li>
            <li> It ripped in 4 day&#x27;s the fit was perfect, but not a good quality...I would not recommend this...Don&#x27;t waste your money even though it is nit expensive</li>
            <li> Material too flimsy ripped upon first wear.  Would not recommend purchasing this product.  Poor construction. Definitely not true to size.</li>
            <li> This was way too small.  Ordered an XL and it would not even fit my 12 year old who is about average size.</li>
            <li> This material did the job to make you sweat, but it tore so easily. I ordered the biggest size but after washing and putting&lt;br /&gt;out to dry, I guess it could not take the wind.</li>
            <li> it was good but it ripped the 3rd time i used it</li>
            <li> cheaply made, NOT true to size. I will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was so little I gave it to someone who only weighed 130 lbs and it was perfect for them... not stretch or anything...I wasted my money</li>
            <li> Too thin..not even a week and alreqdyvtorn</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly, whore it one day and it ripped from the waist down.</li>
            <li> fast delivery,and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Bought it mostly for a laugh to get warm during the cold winters. It works. A little too tight around the neck.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  The rubber band neck was so uncomfortable I had to cut it open and then the suit fell apart.</li>
            <li> I love it does what it was made for!!! I sweat. But it was smaller than described.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. The material out of which the suit is made is not at all quality, but it may have withstood usage if it were actually &#x27;one size fits most&#x27;. One size fits most 10 year olds..! An adult will find it very binding and therefore easy to tear. Right now the right arm is completely off of the top, and the left is splitting from the armpit up. The pants are split in half, save for the elastic waist line -the only thing keeping the legs together. Making arrangements for refund if possible.</li>
            <li> Works great but is quite a thin plastic.  Be extra careful,  I stuck my finger through the plastic trying to take it off.</li>
            <li> The suit didn&#x27;t last less than a week. Before it tore</li>
            <li> I received two pants NOT A SUIT( shirt and pant) very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Suit too small.  Need to return.</li>
