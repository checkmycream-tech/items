            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>, this topcoat is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing about Seche Vite for a while now and thought my friends were exaggerating its amazing qualities.</li>
            <li>The two bottle deal made for a nice price.</li>
            <li>Leaves my nails with a really nice shiny look (just like the salon).</li>
            <li>I always keep it handy...</li>
            <li>A lot of my friends and coworkers are jealous that I can do my own nails</li>
            <li>I did recommend this to many of my friends and they both have good comments to it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and the best for a fast drying of the nails.  </li>
            <li>It was a good price for the two bottles, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it, but it&#x27;s not as durable as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I do my own mani&#x27;s</li>
            <li>They came in the box nicely packed.</li>
            <li>a nice glossy finish  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li>This gives a gorgeous glassy finish, and seems to make glitter polishes sparkle even more.</li>
            <li>This topcoat is absolutely the best I have found at this time.</li>
            <li>It is a good top coat and helps to keep your manicure longer.</li>
            <li>This is a superior product over most.</li>
            <li>it makes the nails so nice and with that finish look..</li>
            <li>how nicely it extends the life of my manicures.</li>
            <li>Each bottle arrived in its own box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard great reviews and this now my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product!!!</li>
            <li>Now I can always have a spare bottle handy</li>
            <li>It really works great!!!  </li>
            <li>and it brings out a nice shine in the color.</li>
            <li>Gives my nails a nice gloss</li>
            <li>I did some research and now do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked my way through every drug store &amp;#34;no-ship&amp;#34; &amp;#34;extra hardening&amp;#34; type top coats as well as a sampling of higher end best reviewed top coats, and none of them have anything on this one!</li>
            <li>I love this top coat and it dries fast!!!!!!</li>
            <li>but this product is excellent for drying top coat of your polish very fast just like you came out of a salon.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>

            <li>sally hansen strengthening top coat is thicker and gives a noticeably glossy depth to any polish.  </li>

            <li>Have purchased bottles for so many friends and they are converts.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You can go about your business in about 5 seconds after applying the top coat.</li>
            <li>If you havent tried this top coat</li>
            <li>I have used it for years. :)</li>
            <li>Then I put this top coat on.  </li>
            <li>I will never use another top coat again.</li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite top coats for years.</li>
            <li>The china glaze is okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price on an absolute nail painting necessity.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than the others I&#x27;ve tried not so chippy</li>
            <li>I have purchased this many times before.</li>
            <li>A MUST have top coat.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than any they use.</li>
            <li>I lovee this product so much !!!!</li>
            <li>This topcoat gives a beautiful smooth finish and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Best top coat I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>I got my product very fast and a good condition.</li>
            <li>This two pack is a great value and honestly the only top coat you will ever need.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again and again as long as it&#x27;s this cheap!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I cut my drying time to seconds, it drys  very fast which is great for pedicures, you can put on full cover shoes and no smugging.</li>
            <li>I am beyond excited for this!</li>
            <li>OMG it is so worth the money!!</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be a great product to add to my new hobby, nail art.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great way to keep your manicure looking new.  </li>
            <li>and it is completely dry :D</li>
            <li>and, voila, perfect looking nails that dry before I can accidentally bump them into something.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too many layers on, though, because it will peel easily..</li>
            <li>My nails were dry within a couple of minutes and they look beautiful!  </li>
            <li>Quick drying and nice shine finish.</li>
            <li>Easy one stop shopping. :)</li>
            <li>It works well for a cheap replacement to my favorite top coat while I&#x27;m out of it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love how glossy this top coat is, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it peels at the corners of my nails more quickly than the OPI topcoat.</li>
            <li>Amazing and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I have been able to get most of it out and use it... but an unusual bummer for sure!</li>
            <li>Good buy, it really puts a great top coat on and it drys fast, shiny and quick.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely AMAZING and WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>Amazing, and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, but it&#x27;s greatest strength is by far drying speed over durability.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten up to a week of chip free polish using Seche Vite and have already recommended it to many of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>I bought one bottle at CVS and loved it so much that when i ran out</li>
            <li>This really kept my nails in good shape for about a week and two days.</li>
            <li>Really fast drying and superior protection.</li>
            <li>Hands down THE BEST top coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best clear nail polish ever even when you mess up your nail polish put this on top and it makes your nails look great</li>
            <li>If you do your own nails, and want them to look like you got them done at a salon, you need to get this right now.</li>

            <li>This is THE best fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The downside to this top coat is the smell - it is very strong when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle and ordering more so that I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li>Dries itself and the polish under it very quickly to the touch and very quickly over all.  </li>
            <li>It also dries very quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>flakes off really easily</li>
            <li>AND you can easily remove and touch up (unlike gel).  </li>
            <li>I have crappy nails, easily breaks and peels.</li>
            <li>It dries her nails in 5 to 10 minutes easy</li>
            <li>easy to pull of.every time put on then pull off any time.</li>
            <li>And it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>it looks good over top of any color even clear ..</li>
            <li>but now that problem is completely solved thanks to this great product!</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily and doesn&#x27;t bubble.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to peel off easily though.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly which helps eliminate smudges.</li>
            <li>It was set very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is just minutes, and &amp;#34;Almost &amp;#34; as strong as &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; without the damage to your nails.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t linger once it dries and</li>
            <li>Strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week now and my toe polish is still going strong</li>
            <li>It is very fast dying and gives a nice shine to any polish.</li>

            <li>Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is the best top coat ever.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic deal on this great top coat - probably same price for two here as you would pay for one in the store.</li>
            <li>My tips stay perfect for over a week, especially if I use a good regular polish with it.</li>
            <li>You just have to put 2 or 3 drops of lacquer thinners (sold at Sally&#x27;s beauty supplies) and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li>I also love using this whenever I do any nailart, the colors are more vibrant after I paint on a top coat.</li>
            <li>all 3 so the half price deal on Amazon is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly!</li>

            <li>Plus, I am used to cheap stuff.  </li>

            <li>It really works :-)</li>
            <li>I use a gel on top of it and it saves so much time.</li>
            <li>I really like this top coat and the way it seals in the polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use it when your nail color is still tacky and you use a REALLY THICK coat of Seche Vite.</li>

            <li>Also, such a good deal</li>
            <li>than these few complaints, it&#x27;s an okay product, certainly not the best top coat in the world, but you can&#x27;t beat the price on amazon for a cheap bottle of polish.</li>
            <li>The price is better than most stores and it dried very quickly compared to another top coat polish I have.</li>
            <li>This really does cause nails to try much more quickly.</li>

            <li>BUT it works better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used, including Sally Hansen Nail Treatment Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat.</li>
            <li>If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong though.</li>
            <li>Strong nail salon smell, but dries nails super fast!</li>

            <li>Have been doing my own mani&#x27;s for a long time, and more recently have been doing lot of VERY detailed nail art icluding use of gems, studs, decals, etc.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews I had to buy it!</li>
            <li>Better off going to the dollar store and getting clear coat!</li>
            <li>You can paint your nails and go to bed 20 minutes later with this top coat!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry!</li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s not a fake!</li>
            <li>The ONLY top coat I EVER use!</li>
            <li>I love the Dry Fast Top Coat because it has such a beautiful shine and of course, it dries fast.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I love this Top Coat, dry iyour nails in minutes..</li>
            <li>paid around $8.50 for two bottles, I feel that that price is fair, and nicely comparable to other fast dry top coats.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also leaves my nails with a really smooth feel that I really like.</li>
            <li>not only does it give you an amazing shine</li>
            <li>amazing stuff, leaves polish shiny and makes mani and pedi last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and dries really fast.</li>
            <li>She does not do a lot of art and prefers light colors so she doesn&#x27;t notice the shrink as much as I do with my darker colors.</li>
            <li>This stuff is legitimate and is the best kept at home manicure secret</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s saved my fresh manicure every time.</li>
            <li>It does have a really powerful chemical smell which some folks can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle product, something cheaper would definitely do, however it is nice, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>, I gave one to my sister in law, who loves painting her nails a lot more frequently than I do.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth it..</li>
            <li>I bought a clear coat from the dollar store that worked better.</li>
            <li>Best quick dry ever, keep away from cuticles - tends to dry them out.</li>
            <li>Many people have mistakenly thought that I used gel polishes, when it was really just a regular polish with this on top.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, it dries up really fast!</li>
            <li>not as durable as the last one i got, does not shine as nice</li>
            <li>and some are better quality than others, but this top coat helps all of them to last much longer.  </li>
            <li>: Apply a thin coat every 2-3 days to keep a brilliant shine!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny</li>
            <li>and I really like it since its fast drying, which is a time saving. :)</li>
            <li>Nice and shine that last!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it when I need it</li>
            <li>I use it every couple of days to keep my manicure/acrylic nails fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>My nail polish hasn&#x27;t chipped since I did my manicure a week ago, still looks as fresh as I did the day</li>
            <li>It dries nails pretty quickly and dries through all coats.</li>
            <li>i received these so quickly, and they were exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast!</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and no bubbles !</li>
            <li>I usually use a good regular top coat over my polish, then after a minute top it with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Seche Vite Top Coat after so many YouTubers give such high remarks</li>
            <li>been using it for years, quick dry and nice shine</li>
            <li>should also not wait too long to apply the top coat, 2-3 mins, and then you can seal it!</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth- love the actual brush itself and it dries so fast!</li>
            <li>But I used this topcoat and it peeled the nail polish right off of my nails.  </li>
            <li>Peels right off my nails just a day after applying.</li>
            <li>the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Not to be used over gel polish or it will just peel right off.  </li>
            <li>and they are so right.</li>
            <li>I got everything I need right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it kind of fills in any small imperfections that you may have.</li>
            <li>but it dries within minutes which is so important to me when you want to do your nails and pretty much get going.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;Since I switch to Seche Vite</li>
            <li>I have used Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for many years.  </li>
            <li>Dries super fast, leaves a nice shiny finish and makes a manicure last longer.  </li>
            <li>and I love how fast it dries so basically there&#x27;s no waiting on your top coat to dry.</li>
            <li>My only reason for giving 5 stars us that it had a very very strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>Dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smear nail polish and works great for getting nail rhinestones to stick down.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly smooth and high shine as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives our nails a bright shinny gloss and dry fast too.</li>
            <li>If you have made a boo boo on one of the nails, this will somehow smooth most of those out and dry</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct smell, but goes on shiny and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>but with this it barely ever happens any more.</li>
            <li>Good nails are not worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect top coat in terms of shine, fast dry and overall last.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite dries super fast.  </li>
            <li>This dries so quickly and smoothly, I really like it.</li>
            <li>This top coat is thick, easy to apply, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Drys super fast as well</li>
            <li>I definitely see why it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use when your in a rush and only have a few minutes to spare for drying.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and hardens well.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and prevents polish from streaking onto paper.</li>
            <li>Shiny,  quick drying,  highly protective!</li>
            <li>It dries super fast.</li>
            <li>great dried fast looks shiney would purchase again</li>
            <li>were a clear fast drying adhesive and top coat are needed.</li>
            <li>5 stars for how SUPER FAST it</li>
            <li>Evens out nails, makes them very shiny and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone chip free for up to a week so far!</li>
            <li>It dries VERY fast, and can do it and run out the door.</li>
            <li>but it also dries very fast which is a plus</li>
            <li>Also, very very cheap price compared to the commercial price</li>
            <li>Dries very fast.</li>
            <li>This price for two bottles is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>(Huge mishaps, I don&#x27;t know about)  Seems strange, but it is formulated to blend with the wet polish and will form a very nice finish.  </li>
            <li>I love this quick dry.</li>
            <li>do love, however, how quick you dry, the smoothness of your coat, and the lack of air bubbles you induce into my manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to quick dry nails- oils, ice water, drying drops, sprays, and many &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; topcoats.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply to the entire nail or it will separate and leave a line of separation.</li>
            <li>the request to send does not get it - at first promised, and now do not answer letters.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The name itself means &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; and it does exactly that.</li>
            <li>Flakes off within the first couple of hours of application</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Seche Vite before, but this is my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This product dries FAST!</li>
            <li>and then I check on my first hand</li>
            <li>I remember the first time I bought it, it smelt toxic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favourite top coat and all my friends always compliment my nails when I use this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>but it can&#x27;t get better with this only because of the price!</li>
            <li>My nails last 1-2 weeks while using this top coat</li>
            <li>and it dries pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Order from reputable sources or get it locally.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried several top coats, but Seche Vite is my preference.</li>
            <li>i thought it was really pretty..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone two whole weeks without a chip!</li>
            <li>It is certainly better than many and the cheaper brands, but manicures simple normally do not last for two weeks unless they are gel.</li>
            <li>(unfortunately not sold anymore)</li>
            <li>This product dries extremely fast!  </li>
            <li>Seche Vite will be the only top coat I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li>Only thing is, I decorated my friends nails and added this as a top coat.</li>
            <li>In fact, I will order a lot more next time!</li>
            <li>definitely works like magic.</li>
            <li>different top coats but</li>
            <li>this is the only top coat that keeps my polish from chipping</li>
            <li>It dries each layer of polish if you put it on when they&#x27;re all still kind of wet.</li>
            <li>Not only does this top coat not smear my nail art when I apply it</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li>Nothing else dries your nails as fast as Seche Vite!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow directions;) plus I got 2 bottles here for the same price as just one at Walmart?!</li>
            <li>Well even better I called amazon on a Friday, the vendor contacted me on Friday and had the nail polish to my house on Saturday (the next day).</li>
            <li>I am currently using and enjoying this Seche Vite nail polish product.</li>
            <li>Does not last more than about 4 days.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Dries really shiny also!</li>
            <li>Get the restorer to be able to uses every last drop.  </li>
            <li>Even better, two days later</li>
            <li>After using Sally Hansen Insta Dri for several years, I decided to give this product a try after reading so many rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the only top coat i will use.</li>
            <li>And, my nails last for a week or more.  </li>
            <li>I was a manicurist years ago when this product first showed up on the shelves</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Really fast drying, indeed!</li>
            <li>From now on it will be the only top coat that I use -</li>
            <li>Finally, I use the Seche Vite top coat.  </li>
            <li>I have tried EVERY drugstore top coat over the last 15 years.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like the ones they sell in the department stores for the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few months ago because it was a good price, but I just got around to using it now.</li>
            <li>but it still dries to a high gloss and is a super protective coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few different quick drying top coats, and Seche Vite is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using other top coats because Seche Vite smells pretty toxic, but nothing dries as fast and keeps my mani looking good for as long.</li>
            <li>I rarely get any chipping or smudging and my manicures last for over a week easily.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and I mean many top coats in my lifetime and nothing comes close to the quick dry and the shine of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>This top coat makes your nail polish dry SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>It dries more quickly than any other I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast and leaves a clear and smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I was previously using Sally Hansen, and I am not even sure if it was a top coat or a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>I may also consider using it to top gems and quickly lock them in place, but will absolutely not be covering my whole nail with it.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the only top coat I will purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always in search of a top coat that dries fast and doesn&#x27;t end up with sheet marks the next day.  </li>
            <li>My nails dried fast and looked really good.</li>
            <li>And the high gloss finish gives me that fresh from the salon look</li>
            <li>It not only provides a strong protective barrier for your nail color, but it also leaves them really shiny!</li>
            <li>This top coat will have your nails dry and ready to go in a flash!</li>
            <li>such a great product -- drys in less than 5 minutes and makes your nail polish last longer than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li>This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li>Those who do not like to spend a long time drying nail polish without flaws would love this item.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>, this is exactly like the real one</li>
            <li>so i do no use in my nails, but it is good for small crafts</li>
            <li>It delivers on high shine, long lasting chip protection, and most importantly, speedy drying!</li>
            <li>5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li>After you do your color give it a moment to dry before applying this top coat.</li>
            <li>This top coat is 90% dry after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Why I always order this and use it when I paint my nails, is because you can literally put it on immediately after you put on your colored nail polish, maybe wait 10-15 minutes at most, and you nails are completley dry, no bubbles,</li>
            <li>favorite thing is the DRY time.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was reluctant to purchase Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend the money if it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  </li>
            <li>I let the large drip fall off and then use without wiping any off.  </li>
            <li>You must have Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for your nail polish.</li>
            <li>This truly is a fast dry top coat.  </li>
            <li>This really is dry fast top coat</li>
            <li>I bought 10 bottles of Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this top coat to anyone and everyone that hates waiting for ever for dry nails!</li>
            <li>and I love that it helps dry the polish faster!</li>
            <li>But now I use this top coat and my nails are completely dry in just a couple minutes!</li>
            <li>Also, i was taken aback by the warning label in the back of the bottle which states he can cause reproductive problems and not to use if pregnant!</li>
            <li>The price on this was good, and it&#x27;s no worse than other topcoats, so no regrets about the purchase.</li>
            <li>If shines, doesn&#x27;t dull quicly, keeps the color bright.</li>
            <li>Very often I would apply the seche vite myself after getting a manicure because my nail technician always missed the edges</li>
            <li>it seems to be the real thing</li>
            <li>So both are speedy fast</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>but it dries your polish fast.</li>
            <li>This product really drys fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely continue to purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Drys so fast you could go to be 30 minutes after finishing your nails and</li>
            <li>This dries fast -</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>and, c&#x27;mon, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>After using this on top of a few coats of color, I&#x27;m able to go to sleep shortly afterwards and no worry about smudging them on the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A salon I went to used it, but was very secretive</li>
            <li>so I can have nails ready to go in minutes.</li>
            <li>One thing I did find was to remove the polish  with it on takes a remover with close to straight acetone.</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>It really does work, it dries your nails in about a minute.</li>
            <li>fast  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s VERY potent/chemical smelling)</li>
            <li>It wears very well, and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>This one dries so fast</li>
            <li>It is really shiny which I really like.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, stays shiny.</li>
            <li>It dries fast too.  </li>
            <li>I have heard people say this lasts for a week straight.</li>
            <li>This topcoat dries so fast, and prevents my nail polish from messing up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather buy it off here where I can get two for the price of one!&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>I am very greatful that a coworker introduced me to this product.</li>
            <li>I think it really helps prolong the life of my manicure</li>
            <li>Though I am a fan to Seche products this one didn&#x27;t really work well for me.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look so shiny, it lasts and it also dries my nails fast.</li>
            <li>I got it in a very sturdy brown cardboard box and it had stuffing inside</li>
            <li>Shiny and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Drys so fast.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much that I dicided not to return it</li>
            <li>Fast drying as well.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>It really is.  </li>
            <li>It was here fast and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>after i started using this product my nails become much stronger, it took care of ridges, nail polish lasts longer and DRIES UP IN SECONDS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried thinning it with some acetone, but it doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>Dries really fast and gives nails a glossy shine.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and protects polish.</li>
            <li>I really like how fast Seche Vite dries.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but thats mostly when its almost empty, for me, and i just rebuy it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>it is very shiny.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and glossy.</li>
            <li>the fast drying is awsome</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>This stuff is miraculous, straight up.</li>
            <li>Really prevents chips.  </li>
            <li>Drys really fast but my nail polish still chips</li>
            <li>This really tops off a manicure.  </li>
            <li>but I worked fast anyway.</li>
            <li>Dries SO fast.  </li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>and they are actually the ones who pointed me to this product, saying that it is far and away better than anything their company makes.</li>
            <li>I buy a LOT of nail polish and hair stuff and could open my own nail shop, so hopefully that can give you some insight into how much I actually have.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Seche Vite dry fast top coat and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>even if its a brand new bottle used for the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the brush looked kind of stiff &amp;separated.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this top coat, it seriously dries in less then a min and stays on for a long time with good nail polish under it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other fast drying top coats</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the strong scent of the polish because I am very sensitive to scents but other than that, LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It works as expected, goes on smoothly and easily and not too thick, and is nice and clear.</li>
            <li>then when I used other top coats.</li>
            <li>I am throwing out all of my other top coats.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other brands</li>
            <li>I never use any other top coat.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use any other top coat out there.  </li>
            <li>to any other top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other top coats that set immediately</li>
            <li>But aside from that, my nails are super shiny, rock hard and last a good time.</li>
            <li>it does dry very quickly s</li>
            <li>Also my manicure held up chip free for around 5 days which is twice as long as any other top coats.</li>
            <li>and it dries so quickly and really prevents any impressions or smudges you might get hours later from towels or bed sheets etc.</li>
            <li>However, I am just not willing to spend more than a couple dollars for a bottle of nail polish, especially when you buy so many different colors.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it drys the only draw back</li>
            <li>Something about this Seche Vite is different from the one I purchase at full price</li>
            <li>I use OPI Nail Envy as base coat, regular nail polish, then seche vite top coat with excellent results.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this stuff to me, and I had just finished a really cool \\&quot;galaxy manicure\\&quot; when it came, and I wanted it to last.</li>
            <li>I have used it to top off 6 coats of clear and colored nail polishes and it manages to dry everything underneath!</li>
            <li>While this product does dry quickly, it starts peeling off on the first day.  </li>
            <li>helps my nail polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li>This is possibly the best top coat out there; it lasts with no chips for at least a week, and even then, it only chips a little.</li>
            <li>The nail polish dries quickly with a long lasting high polished smooth shine.</li>
            <li>Love this drys quickly no smudges</li>
            <li>With this top coat, the longest my polish had lasted was a week and half to almost two without chipping at all.</li>
            <li>Also found that my nails chip less with this top coat.</li>
            <li>notice that the polish does NOT last any longer than without a top coat, it simply just aids in drying and adding shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>This stuff is shiny enough and dries quick.  </li>
            <li>and now I don&#x27;t have to put an extra coat of top coat in the morning when I inevitably get sheet marks on my nails!</li>
            <li>This top coat cost in a regular local store about $9-$14 that&#x27;s a lot.</li>
            <li>These are the only top coats I use after trying multiple kinds.  </li>
            <li>Fast drying, long wearing, and super shiny.  </li>
            <li>As of right now, I&#x27;ve had a manicure using seche for 8 days and there is not a single chip in sight</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Seche Vite</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The high gloss afterwards is just a bonus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see the pro&#x27;s using this product all the time and when I go to purchase its so high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend you purchase the Seche Vite Restore too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The shine is high gloss,it makes your polish stand out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li>Its a high gloss</li>
            <li>One bottle of Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat at my local Target is like $8!!</li>
            <li>i am pretty pleased with the product, it dries really quickly, but the downfall is that is does chip in a day, it&#x27;s not a really good topcoat, other than the fact that it «seche» really quick.</li>
            <li>but I guess thats why its the professional choice!!</li>
            <li>I like it better than some nail polishes feeling like they damage my nails by chipping a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries fast, helps protect your polished nails and/or provides a high gloss clear coat.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, a definite necessity for getting your polish to stay on longer than two days, which is about how long my polish lasts without it.</li>
            <li>After using this top coat, manicure does not last long....</li>
            <li>I normally purchase it from Sally&#x27;s beauty Supply and it runs me about $8 a bottle</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal with Seche Vites.</li>
            <li>and it is nice and thick</li>
            <li>This is like magic put over your regular polish dries super hard and fast.</li>
            <li>It has such a strong nail polish smell, but it dries almost instantly.</li>
            <li>my homemade manicures last much longer than any other brand top coat I&#x27;ve had tried before.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast, rock hard and super shiny.</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat I use and to get a twin pack for the price of one single bottle is a steal.</li>
            <li>and finally I figured out the brand and ordered right away.</li>
            <li>I use it right after putting on my last coat of color.</li>
            <li>High shine, quick dry awesomeness!</li>
            <li>This product sells for $9 per bottle where I live.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>this really do live your nails shinny</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out this.</li>
            <li>and I have to buy a new ones before I use it up</li>
            <li>This is one product that I simply can&#x27;t live without.....</li>
            <li>Seche Vite dries multiple coats to a good hard finish within 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It does dry quickly and well</li>
            <li>It truly dried fast and to a fantastic shell.</li>
            <li>It also has a superior shine finish that last for at least a week.</li>
            <li>I have never really been one to use a top coat, but since I moved in to a stone age apartment with no dishwasher, my manicures have been lasting between 2-3 days, tops.</li>
            <li>I also love that it dries super fast because I tend to be impatient and mess up my nails by doing things too quickly while waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li>It has a high shine finish and you apply it directly after the nail polish.  </li>
            <li>how long I let the polish dry before applying the top coat.</li>
            <li>My fave top coat usually at $7 at sally&#x27;s  for 1 so for 2 bottles for the price of one i had to purchase it, and</li>
            <li>, I was so surprised!</li>
            <li>Makes manicure and pedicure last longer than with any other top coat.</li>
            <li>No more sheet marks:)  </li>
            <li>If you are considering buying it, I would definitely recommend it over any other top coat.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the results!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it lends additional lasting power over other top coats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t adhere well to my nails and the first time I went to scratch my arm, my polish popped off in one solid piece.</li>
            <li>There is not better top coat.</li>
            <li>Just did my nails two days ago and put this on as the top coat, as usual...</li>
            <li>And showed up a week early!</li>
            <li>With one layer of it for the final step, anyone can make their nails as pretty as just come out of a salon.</li>
            <li>The formula and the quality is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I have to say here that it did NOT dry quickly for me, but it made that manicure last almost 2 weeks, even with me doing dishes every day, and typing for 9 hours a day.</li>
            <li>This topcoat polish is quick drying, long lasting, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous and gives you that glossy shine and long lasting wear that a salon manicure gives you.  </li>
            <li>Amazon had two bottles for the price of less than one at Target with free ship.</li>
            <li>What I received, does not dry as fast as the Seche Vite, i buy from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i get around it by opening up my windows when applying it  -The product thickens up very quickly, but I&#x27;ve solved this by mixing in a few drops of Seche Vite Restore  -Nail</li>
            <li>Though I still wish there was something that would dry my nails faster, this is definitely worth sticking with.</li>
            <li>I rarely have time to just sit and wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell it&#x27;s the exact same stuff I buy at Sally Beauty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;After using several bottles of this top coat, I noticed that once you get down to about 1/4&amp;#34; of product in the bottle, you might as well throw it away.</li>
            <li>It used to take all day for my nails to dry, and now they dry super fast!</li>
            <li>Having used other products before - I will go with another brand that won&#x27;t require me to deal with fixing a 90% full bottle.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s a quick dry is a major plus.  </li>
            <li>If you use acetone it will severely dry the nails and skin just use moisterizer right away.</li>
            <li>Applied to wet polished nails, it holds your polish intact many days longer than other quick dry products.</li>
            <li>It gives a beautiful shine, lasting protection, and doesn’t get hard and tacky in the bottle as other brands have.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything better on the market, and it&#x27;s hard to find in my area.  </li>
            <li>No chipping and its hard to chip with this top coat.</li>
            <li>My daughter is able to use it for the hard finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick liquid, but it applies very well and protects my nail color for a long time.</li>
            <li>Up until I purchased this, I swore by Sally Hansen Insta-Dry in clear, as a topcoat.</li>
            <li>My pedicure last literally until the toenails grow out so much</li>
            <li>I am able to get at least 6 days of wear without chipping.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for any busy mom of two young kids like myself.</li>
            <li>Your manicure will last much longer and helps protect your nails.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about the prices, way lower that</li>
            <li>Dries nails within a minute and my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just going to use my old tops,</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t resist to pursed so far</li>
            <li>You get the look of professionally done gel nails.</li>
            <li>This should not be happening this early.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look salon professional</li>
            <li>One star marked off because the formula seems to thicken after each use.</li>
            <li>Now my pedis look as though I had them done professionally.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised by how this topcoat performs.  </li>
            <li>, looks like I got a professional manicure every time, and it dries faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This product dries fast with a shiny coat even with multiple layers.</li>
            <li>This topcoat dries fast, doesnt streak or shrink,  stays shiny and protects my tiny artwork on nails!</li>
            <li>I really like this topcoat considering the low price of it.</li>
            <li>wow away</li>
            <li>I am not great at applying my own nail polish (I get streaks sometimes), but I put a big drop of this on the nail gently spread it around</li>
            <li>sally hansen dries within 30 seconds or so, so i think i can take those few extra seconds to get a better look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In only a few minutes, I am able to do anything without messing up my nails.  </li>
            <li>Does get thick when it&#x27;s running low though, but that&#x27;s a tiny problem considering how good it is.</li>
            <li>While that product doesn&#x27;t suck, I truly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better and often found my polish peeling off because it was so thick.</li>
            <li>This is a very fast dry for your nails.  </li>
            <li>This absolutely dries fast, but the quick dry makes it chip a little easier and faster.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries so fast that the first nail is totally dry before getting to the fifth nail on the same hand.</li>
            <li>Super shiny and last a long time.</li>
            <li>You have to really know how to use it, depending on how wet or dry your last polish coat is determines how easy this Seche sticks to it.</li>
            <li>This thing dry your nails fast, no waiti time needed!</li>
            <li>Nails dry fast!  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and makes my color last a LONG time!</li>
            <li>This is a very long lasting topcoat that does an extraordinary job of protecting my home manicures.  </li>
            <li>With the quick-drying formula, I never mess up my nails.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that one of the bottles had some black plastic bits around the top of the opening that ended up getting in the actual polish and has already ruined 2 manicures that simply need the final top coat</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful that nail polish could actually dry so fast and so perfectly</li>
            <li>I definitely see one bottle priced quite high where I am.</li>
            <li>very pretty gloss, over bland nail polish.</li>
            <li>I have tried others and no other compares!</li>
            <li>It does dry amazingly fast, but as others have stated, it shrinks your polish and pulls it away from the edges, I even went as far as to polish the edges and tips, but it still pulled.</li>
            <li>The only thing about it that might be negative is that it does have a strong paint chemical smell that&#x27;s different from regular nail polish, but it goes away quickly so I can&#x27;t bring myself to dock it a star for that.</li>
            <li>Happy to say no chips, nail polish dries fast, shiny, and looks like a gel manicure without the bad side effects of an actual gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I do this every time and think it is greatly responsible for the long wear that I get out of each manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so my nails get pretty rough treatment.</li>
            <li>I wear a new color every week because it only takes me 15 minutes max to do my nails, and 10 minutes of that is filing.</li>
            <li>can live without it, dries polish guickly and manicure last for days without chipping</li>
            <li>Directions are in the box and it is necessary to read and follow them if you are new to the product.  </li>
            <li>Brings back the shine of a new pedi even after being on the beach and in the water.  </li>
            <li>I use this product as a dry fast topcoat after applying nail polish.</li>
            <li>I know you think that by &amp;#34;gooping&amp;#34; it on it won&#x27;t  dry fast, but by the time I got to my pinky, my thumb was already dry!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It keeps the polish on your nails and it really does dry in 5 MINUTES!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the fast dry about a week ago..</li>
            <li>when you paint your nails you don&#x27;t really want to wait for them to dry</li>
            <li>It does dry amazingly fast</li>
            <li>And yeah, it somehow makes the polish dry all the way to the nail really fast</li>
            <li>My friend borrowed it and will be ordering SecheVite Dry Fast, too.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt dry as fast as this and also leaves a cloudy haze.</li>
            <li>Makes my polish last for at least a week or more.</li>
            <li>Definitely lives up to its instant done nails, but you have to do them every 2 days or be really gentle to keep them from automatically peeling off.</li>
            <li>it drys my nails immediately, and since I am often adding an extra coat of polish as I go out the door, it&#x27;s absolutely essential to have the nails dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Cons are that it smells strongly and it gets thick halfway through the bottle</li>
            <li>and I actually do recommend it, BUT be cautious if you&#x27;re pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant because it&#x27;s dangerous and also try to use it in a well ventilated room due to the chemical odor.</li>
            <li>Does dry very fast but does not keep the polish from wearing off by the second day.</li>
            <li>Other than it lets your nail polish dried very fast , it also makes your nail polish more long lasting.</li>
            <li>I used to have to keep them free of activity for several hours after applying the old top coats I had been using, or I would get ugly marks on my nails, but Seche isn&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li>So, great top coat, terrible base coat, lol.</li>
            <li>Very thick and does dry very quick but pretty spendy for the end result i think</li>
            <li>By the time you&#x27;ve applied it to all ten fingertips, the first tip is already dry!  </li>
            <li>The product is wonderful but it arrived broken  one bottle was totally shattered and the other one had dried on polish and glass.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my old stand-by...</li>
            <li>It still performs as expected and dries really fast once applied.</li>
            <li>if you put this over your regular polish frequently.  </li>
            <li>I am a busy mom who is constantly submerging my hands in water and scrubbing messes.</li>
            <li>Love the shine and it does protect my thin, splitting and peeling nails.  </li>
            <li>It dries SUPER quickly, to a HARD finish, not tacky or soft at all.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my nails dry in no time with a high gloss/shine.</li>
            <li>this polish will help dry your polish fast but after a day it will chip sometimes within the same day.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry fast</li>
            <li>I thought it was normal to smear and take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li>People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!  </li>
            <li>People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!  </li>
            <li>I want to love you so much, but I have trouble getting over how after I get to the middle of the bottle, you turn into some thick, gloppy, unusable product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other top-coats but they don&#x27;t really seem to compare.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very shiny finish that is extremely chip resistant.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff, have not had trouble with the shrinkage on the ends of nails if you tuck it under a little on the polishing.  </li>
            <li>dries SUPER fast like seriously I feel like five min after its dry</li>
            <li>Keeps my nail polish protected, DOES NOT CHIP, dries in a complete 2 minutes or LESS, my nails have been a lot stronger and has a vibrant shine to it that lasts as well.</li>
            <li>When I tried, it said that because of hazardous issues, I am unable to send them back, but I coudln&#x27;t get a hold of anyone who would give me a refund.</li>
            <li>I bought the little bottle first.  </li>
            <li>Nearly all of the nail polish I purchased was less than $1.50 a bottle, so it was by no means high quality.</li>
            <li>so if you even barely touch it with the brush on your next stroke</li>
            <li>Also keeps your polish on longer than usual - I can easily go a week or longer without one little chip (and I have a 4 and 2 year old and am a SAHM</li>
            <li>I never even worry about dry time between my color coats anymore because I know that when I use seche, the whole manicure is dry in 10 minutes TOPS.</li>
            <li>This product tends to get very thick VERY quickly so getting the seche restore is a must.</li>
            <li>But not only fast, but it gives my manicure a high diamond shine as well as a rock hard feel.</li>
            <li>It also becomes very goopy half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li>Does last almost as long as a gel application, but not as toxic by far.  </li>
            <li>Having purchased 5 of these so far I have yet to figure out how to make it last that long without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And with the Seche Clear Base Coat my nails stay nice for almost two weeks!</li>
            <li>It barely lasts a few days and the smell is very different from the real product.</li>
            <li>Love that it dries nails super fast but has a horrible smell.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if you&#x27;re impatient with waiting for your nails to dry, you need to get this top coat!</li>
            <li>I usually use Revlon quick dry</li>
            <li>Very high gloss and firm finish to protect nails.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products that say they dry fast -</li>

            <li> , this topcoat is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing about Seche Vite for a while now and thought my friends were exaggerating its amazing qualities.</li>
            <li> The two bottle deal made for a nice price.</li>
            <li> Leaves my nails with a really nice shiny look (just like the salon).</li>
            <li> I always keep it handy...</li>
            <li> A lot of my friends and coworkers are jealous that I can do my own nails</li>
            <li> I did recommend this to many of my friends and they both have good comments to it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and the best for a fast drying of the nails.  </li>
            <li> It was a good price for the two bottles, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it, but it&#x27;s not as durable as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I do my own mani&#x27;s</li>
            <li> They came in the box nicely packed.</li>
            <li> a nice glossy finish  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li> This gives a gorgeous glassy finish, and seems to make glitter polishes sparkle even more.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is absolutely the best I have found at this time.</li>
            <li> It is a good top coat and helps to keep your manicure longer.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product over most.</li>
            <li> it makes the nails so nice and with that finish look..</li>
            <li> how nicely it extends the life of my manicures.</li>
            <li> Each bottle arrived in its own box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews and this now my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product!!!</li>
            <li> Now I can always have a spare bottle handy</li>
            <li> It really works great!!!  </li>
            <li> and it brings out a nice shine in the color.</li>
            <li> Gives my nails a nice gloss</li>
            <li> I did some research and now do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked my way through every drug store &amp;#34;no-ship&amp;#34; &amp;#34;extra hardening&amp;#34; type top coats as well as a sampling of higher end best reviewed top coats, and none of them have anything on this one!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat and it dries fast!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but this product is excellent for drying top coat of your polish very fast just like you came out of a salon.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This works awesome and dries super quick!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recommend it highly</li>

            <li> and then the top coat pealed off?</li>
            <li> and I have tried sooooo many top coats, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> sally hansen strengthening top coat is thicker and gives a noticeably glossy depth to any polish.  </li>

            <li> You can go about your business in about 5 seconds after applying the top coat.</li>
            <li> If you havent tried this top coat</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. :)</li>
            <li> Then I put this top coat on.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another top coat again.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite top coats for years.</li>
            <li> The china glaze is okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price on an absolute nail painting necessity.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than the others I&#x27;ve tried not so chippy</li>
            <li> I have purchased this many times before.</li>
            <li> A MUST have top coat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than any they use.</li>
            <li> I lovee this product so much !!!!</li>
            <li> This topcoat gives a beautiful smooth finish and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> I got my product very fast and a good condition.</li>
            <li> This two pack is a great value and honestly the only top coat you will ever need.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again and again as long as it&#x27;s this cheap!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I cut my drying time to seconds, it drys  very fast which is great for pedicures, you can put on full cover shoes and no smugging.</li>
            <li> I am beyond excited for this!</li>
            <li> OMG it is so worth the money!!</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be a great product to add to my new hobby, nail art.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great way to keep your manicure looking new.  </li>
            <li> and it is completely dry :D</li>
            <li> and, voila, perfect looking nails that dry before I can accidentally bump them into something.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too many layers on, though, because it will peel easily..</li>
            <li> My nails were dry within a couple of minutes and they look beautiful!  </li>
            <li> Quick drying and nice shine finish.</li>
            <li> Easy one stop shopping. :)</li>
            <li> It works well for a cheap replacement to my favorite top coat while I&#x27;m out of it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love how glossy this top coat is, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it peels at the corners of my nails more quickly than the OPI topcoat.</li>
            <li> Amazing and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I have been able to get most of it out and use it... but an unusual bummer for sure!</li>
            <li> Good buy, it really puts a great top coat on and it drys fast, shiny and quick.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING and WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Amazing, and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, but it&#x27;s greatest strength is by far drying speed over durability.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten up to a week of chip free polish using Seche Vite and have already recommended it to many of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle at CVS and loved it so much that when i ran out</li>
            <li> This really kept my nails in good shape for about a week and two days.</li>
            <li> Really fast drying and superior protection.</li>
            <li> Hands down THE BEST top coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Best clear nail polish ever even when you mess up your nail polish put this on top and it makes your nails look great</li>
            <li> If you do your own nails, and want them to look like you got them done at a salon, you need to get this right now.</li>

            <li> This is THE best fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The downside to this top coat is the smell - it is very strong when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle and ordering more so that I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Dries itself and the polish under it very quickly to the touch and very quickly over all.  </li>
            <li> It also dries very quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> flakes off really easily</li>
            <li> AND you can easily remove and touch up (unlike gel).  </li>
            <li> I have crappy nails, easily breaks and peels.</li>
            <li> It dries her nails in 5 to 10 minutes easy</li>
            <li> easy to pull of.every time put on then pull off any time.</li>
            <li> And it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> it looks good over top of any color even clear ..</li>
            <li> but now that problem is completely solved thanks to this great product!</li>
            <li> It goes on so easily and doesn&#x27;t bubble.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to peel off easily though.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly which helps eliminate smudges.</li>
            <li> It was set very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is just minutes, and &amp;#34;Almost &amp;#34; as strong as &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; without the damage to your nails.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t linger once it dries and</li>
            <li> Strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week now and my toe polish is still going strong</li>
            <li> It is very fast dying and gives a nice shine to any polish.</li>
            <li> This was on the allure&#x27;s top products of 2012 and they were right!  </li>
            <li> Drys super fast and leaves a nice shiney shellac-like finish!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is the best top coat ever.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic deal on this great top coat - probably same price for two here as you would pay for one in the store.</li>
            <li> My tips stay perfect for over a week, especially if I use a good regular polish with it.</li>
            <li> You just have to put 2 or 3 drops of lacquer thinners (sold at Sally&#x27;s beauty supplies) and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li> I also love using this whenever I do any nailart, the colors are more vibrant after I paint on a top coat.</li>
            <li> all 3 so the half price deal on Amazon is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> It dries so quickly!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining my polish after applying, because Seche dries amazingly quickly and leaves the polish finished perfectly, so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about being careful with them after applying your polish.  </li>

            <li> Plus, I am used to cheap stuff.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased others I love this one the most sometimes the topcoat peels completely off</li>
            <li> kind of on the thick side but over all its great, I would repurchase again soon.</li>
            <li> took advantage of this great deal of 2 bottles rather than a single.</li>

            <li> I used to paint my nails at least once a week because I couldn&#x27;t stand when they chipped, but this has greatly reduced that time!</li>
            <li> I found this top coat thanks to my nail salon</li>
            <li> And the nail polish dries so fast after I put this on top.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it really protects the nails..</li>
            <li> I received two for the price of one an obvious good buy.</li>

            <li> It really works :-)</li>
            <li> I use a gel on top of it and it saves so much time.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat and the way it seals in the polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to use it when your nail color is still tacky and you use a REALLY THICK coat of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> You need this fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> Always love the fast  way this dries.</li>

            <li> I really wish I could say that I love this.</li>
            <li> This Top Coat makes applying nail polish much easier.</li>
            <li> Also, such a good deal</li>
            <li> than these few complaints, it&#x27;s an okay product, certainly not the best top coat in the world, but you can&#x27;t beat the price on amazon for a cheap bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> The price is better than most stores and it dried very quickly compared to another top coat polish I have.</li>
            <li> This really does cause nails to try much more quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries SOOOO Fast though so be quick about getting it applied. :)</li>

            <li> Dries super fast, love it.</li>
            <li> BUT it works better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used, including Sally Hansen Nail Treatment Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat.</li>
            <li> If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong though.</li>
            <li> Strong nail salon smell, but dries nails super fast!</li>

            <li> I will only use this top coat it is hands down the best one out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite for years because of how quickly it dries to the core.</li>

            <li> I keep recommending it to all my girl friends, hands down the most amamizng top coat!</li>
            <li> Good quality quick dry topcoat.</li>
            <li> This dries very fast and keeps my nail polish on a whole lot longer than most products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Best money spent will never use any other top coat .</li>
            <li> i am wearing a new revlon matte/glitter combination, so maybe that&#x27;s why, but i have many of those</li>
            <li> Just a slight learning curve then you will be so happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this shiny quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, strong and lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Seche Vite dry fast top coat!</li>
            <li> Have been doing my own mani&#x27;s for a long time, and more recently have been doing lot of VERY detailed nail art icluding use of gems, studs, decals, etc.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews I had to buy it!</li>
            <li> Better off going to the dollar store and getting clear coat!</li>
            <li> You can paint your nails and go to bed 20 minutes later with this top coat!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sorry!</li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s not a fake!</li>
            <li> The ONLY top coat I EVER use!</li>
            <li> I love the Dry Fast Top Coat because it has such a beautiful shine and of course, it dries fast.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I love this Top Coat, dry iyour nails in minutes..</li>
            <li> paid around $8.50 for two bottles, I feel that that price is fair, and nicely comparable to other fast dry top coats.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also leaves my nails with a really smooth feel that I really like.</li>
            <li> not only does it give you an amazing shine</li>
            <li> amazing stuff, leaves polish shiny and makes mani and pedi last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and dries really fast.</li>
            <li> She does not do a lot of art and prefers light colors so she doesn&#x27;t notice the shrink as much as I do with my darker colors.</li>
            <li> This stuff is legitimate and is the best kept at home manicure secret</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s saved my fresh manicure every time.</li>
            <li> It does have a really powerful chemical smell which some folks can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle product, something cheaper would definitely do, however it is nice, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> , I gave one to my sister in law, who loves painting her nails a lot more frequently than I do.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth it..</li>
            <li> I bought a clear coat from the dollar store that worked better.</li>
            <li> Best quick dry ever, keep away from cuticles - tends to dry them out.</li>
            <li> Many people have mistakenly thought that I used gel polishes, when it was really just a regular polish with this on top.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, it dries up really fast!</li>
            <li> not as durable as the last one i got, does not shine as nice</li>
            <li> and some are better quality than others, but this top coat helps all of them to last much longer.  </li>
            <li> : Apply a thin coat every 2-3 days to keep a brilliant shine!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny</li>
            <li> and I really like it since its fast drying, which is a time saving. :)</li>
            <li> Nice and shine that last!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth it when I need it</li>
            <li> I use it every couple of days to keep my manicure/acrylic nails fresh looking.  </li>
            <li> My nail polish hasn&#x27;t chipped since I did my manicure a week ago, still looks as fresh as I did the day</li>
            <li> It dries nails pretty quickly and dries through all coats.</li>
            <li> i received these so quickly, and they were exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast!</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and no bubbles !</li>
            <li> I usually use a good regular top coat over my polish, then after a minute top it with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Seche Vite Top Coat after so many YouTubers give such high remarks</li>
            <li> been using it for years, quick dry and nice shine</li>
            <li> should also not wait too long to apply the top coat, 2-3 mins, and then you can seal it!</li>
            <li> It glides on smooth- love the actual brush itself and it dries so fast!</li>
            <li> But I used this topcoat and it peeled the nail polish right off of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Peels right off my nails just a day after applying.</li>
            <li> the price is right.  </li>
            <li> Not to be used over gel polish or it will just peel right off.  </li>
            <li> and they are so right.</li>
            <li> I got everything I need right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> On top of that it kind of fills in any small imperfections that you may have.</li>
            <li> but it dries within minutes which is so important to me when you want to do your nails and pretty much get going.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;Since I switch to Seche Vite</li>
            <li> I have used Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for many years.  </li>
            <li> Dries super fast, leaves a nice shiny finish and makes a manicure last longer.  </li>
            <li> and I love how fast it dries so basically there&#x27;s no waiting on your top coat to dry.</li>
            <li> My only reason for giving 5 stars us that it had a very very strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> Dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smear nail polish and works great for getting nail rhinestones to stick down.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly smooth and high shine as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives our nails a bright shinny gloss and dry fast too.</li>
            <li> If you have made a boo boo on one of the nails, this will somehow smooth most of those out and dry</li>
            <li> It does have a distinct smell, but goes on shiny and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> but with this it barely ever happens any more.</li>
            <li> Good nails are not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect top coat in terms of shine, fast dry and overall last.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries super fast.  </li>
            <li> This dries so quickly and smoothly, I really like it.</li>
            <li> This top coat is thick, easy to apply, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Drys super fast as well</li>
            <li> I definitely see why it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use when your in a rush and only have a few minutes to spare for drying.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and hardens well.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and prevents polish from streaking onto paper.</li>
            <li> Shiny,  quick drying,  highly protective!</li>
            <li> It dries super fast.</li>
            <li> great dried fast looks shiney would purchase again</li>
            <li> were a clear fast drying adhesive and top coat are needed.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for how SUPER FAST it</li>
            <li> Evens out nails, makes them very shiny and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone chip free for up to a week so far!</li>
            <li> It dries VERY fast, and can do it and run out the door.</li>
            <li> but it also dries very fast which is a plus</li>
            <li> Also, very very cheap price compared to the commercial price</li>
            <li> Dries very fast.</li>
            <li> This price for two bottles is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> (Huge mishaps, I don&#x27;t know about)  Seems strange, but it is formulated to blend with the wet polish and will form a very nice finish.  </li>
            <li> I love this quick dry.</li>
            <li> do love, however, how quick you dry, the smoothness of your coat, and the lack of air bubbles you induce into my manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to quick dry nails- oils, ice water, drying drops, sprays, and many &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; topcoats.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply to the entire nail or it will separate and leave a line of separation.</li>
            <li> the request to send does not get it - at first promised, and now do not answer letters.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The name itself means &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; and it does exactly that.</li>
            <li> Flakes off within the first couple of hours of application</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Seche Vite before, but this is my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This product dries FAST!</li>
            <li> and then I check on my first hand</li>
            <li> I remember the first time I bought it, it smelt toxic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my favourite top coat and all my friends always compliment my nails when I use this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t get better with this only because of the price!</li>
            <li> My nails last 1-2 weeks while using this top coat</li>
            <li> and it dries pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Order from reputable sources or get it locally.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried several top coats, but Seche Vite is my preference.</li>
            <li> i thought it was really pretty..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone two whole weeks without a chip!</li>
            <li> It is certainly better than many and the cheaper brands, but manicures simple normally do not last for two weeks unless they are gel.</li>
            <li> (unfortunately not sold anymore)</li>
            <li> This product dries extremely fast!  </li>
            <li> Seche Vite will be the only top coat I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, I decorated my friends nails and added this as a top coat.</li>
            <li> In fact, I will order a lot more next time!</li>
            <li> definitely works like magic.</li>
            <li> different top coats but</li>
            <li> this is the only top coat that keeps my polish from chipping</li>
            <li> It dries each layer of polish if you put it on when they&#x27;re all still kind of wet.</li>
            <li> Not only does this top coat not smear my nail art when I apply it</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> Nothing else dries your nails as fast as Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow directions;) plus I got 2 bottles here for the same price as just one at Walmart?!</li>
            <li> Well even better I called amazon on a Friday, the vendor contacted me on Friday and had the nail polish to my house on Saturday (the next day).</li>
            <li> I am currently using and enjoying this Seche Vite nail polish product.</li>
            <li> Does not last more than about 4 days.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Dries really shiny also!</li>
            <li> Get the restorer to be able to uses every last drop.  </li>
            <li> Even better, two days later</li>
            <li> After using Sally Hansen Insta Dri for several years, I decided to give this product a try after reading so many rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the only top coat i will use.</li>
            <li> And, my nails last for a week or more.  </li>
            <li> I was a manicurist years ago when this product first showed up on the shelves</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Really fast drying, indeed!</li>
            <li> From now on it will be the only top coat that I use -</li>
            <li> Finally, I use the Seche Vite top coat.  </li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY drugstore top coat over the last 15 years.  </li>
            <li> Exactly like the ones they sell in the department stores for the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago because it was a good price, but I just got around to using it now.</li>
            <li> but it still dries to a high gloss and is a super protective coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different quick drying top coats, and Seche Vite is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using other top coats because Seche Vite smells pretty toxic, but nothing dries as fast and keeps my mani looking good for as long.</li>
            <li> I rarely get any chipping or smudging and my manicures last for over a week easily.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and I mean many top coats in my lifetime and nothing comes close to the quick dry and the shine of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This top coat makes your nail polish dry SUPER fast.</li>
            <li> It dries more quickly than any other I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast and leaves a clear and smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using Sally Hansen, and I am not even sure if it was a top coat or a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> I may also consider using it to top gems and quickly lock them in place, but will absolutely not be covering my whole nail with it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the only top coat I will purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in search of a top coat that dries fast and doesn&#x27;t end up with sheet marks the next day.  </li>
            <li> My nails dried fast and looked really good.</li>
            <li> And the high gloss finish gives me that fresh from the salon look</li>
            <li> It not only provides a strong protective barrier for your nail color, but it also leaves them really shiny!</li>
            <li> This top coat will have your nails dry and ready to go in a flash!</li>
            <li> such a great product -- drys in less than 5 minutes and makes your nail polish last longer than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li> Those who do not like to spend a long time drying nail polish without flaws would love this item.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> , this is exactly like the real one</li>
            <li> so i do no use in my nails, but it is good for small crafts</li>
            <li> It delivers on high shine, long lasting chip protection, and most importantly, speedy drying!</li>
            <li> 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> After you do your color give it a moment to dry before applying this top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is 90% dry after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Why I always order this and use it when I paint my nails, is because you can literally put it on immediately after you put on your colored nail polish, maybe wait 10-15 minutes at most, and you nails are completley dry, no bubbles,</li>
            <li> favorite thing is the DRY time.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was reluctant to purchase Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend the money if it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  </li>
            <li> I let the large drip fall off and then use without wiping any off.  </li>
            <li> You must have Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for your nail polish.</li>
            <li> This truly is a fast dry top coat.  </li>
            <li> This really is dry fast top coat</li>
            <li> I bought 10 bottles of Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this top coat to anyone and everyone that hates waiting for ever for dry nails!</li>
            <li> and I love that it helps dry the polish faster!</li>
            <li> But now I use this top coat and my nails are completely dry in just a couple minutes!</li>
            <li> Also, i was taken aback by the warning label in the back of the bottle which states he can cause reproductive problems and not to use if pregnant!</li>
            <li> The price on this was good, and it&#x27;s no worse than other topcoats, so no regrets about the purchase.</li>
            <li> If shines, doesn&#x27;t dull quicly, keeps the color bright.</li>
            <li> Very often I would apply the seche vite myself after getting a manicure because my nail technician always missed the edges</li>
            <li> it seems to be the real thing</li>
            <li> So both are speedy fast</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> but it dries your polish fast.</li>
            <li> This product really drys fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely continue to purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Drys so fast you could go to be 30 minutes after finishing your nails and</li>
            <li> This dries fast -</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> and, c&#x27;mon, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> After using this on top of a few coats of color, I&#x27;m able to go to sleep shortly afterwards and no worry about smudging them on the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A salon I went to used it, but was very secretive</li>
            <li> so I can have nails ready to go in minutes.</li>
            <li> One thing I did find was to remove the polish  with it on takes a remover with close to straight acetone.</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> It really does work, it dries your nails in about a minute.</li>
            <li> fast  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s VERY potent/chemical smelling)</li>
            <li> It wears very well, and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> This one dries so fast</li>
            <li> It is really shiny which I really like.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, stays shiny.</li>
            <li> It dries fast too.  </li>
            <li> I have heard people say this lasts for a week straight.</li>
            <li> This topcoat dries so fast, and prevents my nail polish from messing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather buy it off here where I can get two for the price of one!&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I am very greatful that a coworker introduced me to this product.</li>
            <li> I think it really helps prolong the life of my manicure</li>
            <li> Though I am a fan to Seche products this one didn&#x27;t really work well for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look so shiny, it lasts and it also dries my nails fast.</li>
            <li> I got it in a very sturdy brown cardboard box and it had stuffing inside</li>
            <li> Shiny and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> Drys so fast.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I dicided not to return it</li>
            <li> Fast drying as well.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> It really is.  </li>
            <li> It was here fast and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> after i started using this product my nails become much stronger, it took care of ridges, nail polish lasts longer and DRIES UP IN SECONDS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried thinning it with some acetone, but it doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast and gives nails a glossy shine.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and protects polish.</li>
            <li> I really like how fast Seche Vite dries.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but thats mostly when its almost empty, for me, and i just rebuy it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> it is very shiny.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast and glossy.</li>
            <li> the fast drying is awsome</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> This stuff is miraculous, straight up.</li>
            <li> Really prevents chips.  </li>
            <li> Drys really fast but my nail polish still chips</li>
            <li> This really tops off a manicure.  </li>
            <li> but I worked fast anyway.</li>
            <li> Dries SO fast.  </li>
            <li> and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> and they are actually the ones who pointed me to this product, saying that it is far and away better than anything their company makes.</li>
            <li> I buy a LOT of nail polish and hair stuff and could open my own nail shop, so hopefully that can give you some insight into how much I actually have.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Seche Vite dry fast top coat and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> even if its a brand new bottle used for the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush looked kind of stiff &amp;separated.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this top coat, it seriously dries in less then a min and stays on for a long time with good nail polish under it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other fast drying top coats</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the strong scent of the polish because I am very sensitive to scents but other than that, LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It works as expected, goes on smoothly and easily and not too thick, and is nice and clear.</li>
            <li> then when I used other top coats.</li>
            <li> I am throwing out all of my other top coats.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other brands</li>
            <li> I never use any other top coat.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use any other top coat out there.  </li>
            <li> to any other top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other top coats that set immediately</li>
            <li> But aside from that, my nails are super shiny, rock hard and last a good time.</li>
            <li> it does dry very quickly s</li>
            <li> Also my manicure held up chip free for around 5 days which is twice as long as any other top coats.</li>
            <li> and it dries so quickly and really prevents any impressions or smudges you might get hours later from towels or bed sheets etc.</li>
            <li> However, I am just not willing to spend more than a couple dollars for a bottle of nail polish, especially when you buy so many different colors.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it drys the only draw back</li>
            <li> Something about this Seche Vite is different from the one I purchase at full price</li>
            <li> I use OPI Nail Envy as base coat, regular nail polish, then seche vite top coat with excellent results.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this stuff to me, and I had just finished a really cool \\&quot;galaxy manicure\\&quot; when it came, and I wanted it to last.</li>
            <li> I have used it to top off 6 coats of clear and colored nail polishes and it manages to dry everything underneath!</li>
            <li> While this product does dry quickly, it starts peeling off on the first day.  </li>
            <li> helps my nail polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best top coat out there; it lasts with no chips for at least a week, and even then, it only chips a little.</li>
            <li> The nail polish dries quickly with a long lasting high polished smooth shine.</li>
            <li> Love this drys quickly no smudges</li>
            <li> With this top coat, the longest my polish had lasted was a week and half to almost two without chipping at all.</li>
            <li> Also found that my nails chip less with this top coat.</li>
            <li> notice that the polish does NOT last any longer than without a top coat, it simply just aids in drying and adding shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> This stuff is shiny enough and dries quick.  </li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t have to put an extra coat of top coat in the morning when I inevitably get sheet marks on my nails!</li>
            <li> This top coat cost in a regular local store about $9-$14 that&#x27;s a lot.</li>
            <li> These are the only top coats I use after trying multiple kinds.  </li>
            <li> Fast drying, long wearing, and super shiny.  </li>
            <li> As of right now, I&#x27;ve had a manicure using seche for 8 days and there is not a single chip in sight</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Seche Vite</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The high gloss afterwards is just a bonus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see the pro&#x27;s using this product all the time and when I go to purchase its so high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend you purchase the Seche Vite Restore too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The shine is high gloss,it makes your polish stand out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li> Its a high gloss</li>
            <li> One bottle of Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat at my local Target is like $8!!</li>
            <li> i am pretty pleased with the product, it dries really quickly, but the downfall is that is does chip in a day, it&#x27;s not a really good topcoat, other than the fact that it «seche» really quick.</li>
            <li> but I guess thats why its the professional choice!!</li>
            <li> I like it better than some nail polishes feeling like they damage my nails by chipping a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries fast, helps protect your polished nails and/or provides a high gloss clear coat.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, a definite necessity for getting your polish to stay on longer than two days, which is about how long my polish lasts without it.</li>
            <li> After using this top coat, manicure does not last long....</li>
            <li> I normally purchase it from Sally&#x27;s beauty Supply and it runs me about $8 a bottle</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal with Seche Vites.</li>
            <li> and it is nice and thick</li>
            <li> This is like magic put over your regular polish dries super hard and fast.</li>
            <li> It has such a strong nail polish smell, but it dries almost instantly.</li>
            <li> my homemade manicures last much longer than any other brand top coat I&#x27;ve had tried before.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast, rock hard and super shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I use and to get a twin pack for the price of one single bottle is a steal.</li>
            <li> and finally I figured out the brand and ordered right away.</li>
            <li> I use it right after putting on my last coat of color.</li>
            <li> High shine, quick dry awesomeness!</li>
            <li> This product sells for $9 per bottle where I live.</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> this really do live your nails shinny</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out this.</li>
            <li> and I have to buy a new ones before I use it up</li>
            <li> This is one product that I simply can&#x27;t live without.....</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries multiple coats to a good hard finish within 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It does dry quickly and well</li>
            <li> It truly dried fast and to a fantastic shell.</li>
            <li> It also has a superior shine finish that last for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I have never really been one to use a top coat, but since I moved in to a stone age apartment with no dishwasher, my manicures have been lasting between 2-3 days, tops.</li>
            <li> I also love that it dries super fast because I tend to be impatient and mess up my nails by doing things too quickly while waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li> It has a high shine finish and you apply it directly after the nail polish.  </li>
            <li> how long I let the polish dry before applying the top coat.</li>
            <li> My fave top coat usually at $7 at sally&#x27;s  for 1 so for 2 bottles for the price of one i had to purchase it, and</li>
            <li> , I was so surprised!</li>
            <li> Makes manicure and pedicure last longer than with any other top coat.</li>
            <li> No more sheet marks:)  </li>
            <li> If you are considering buying it, I would definitely recommend it over any other top coat.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the results!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it lends additional lasting power over other top coats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t adhere well to my nails and the first time I went to scratch my arm, my polish popped off in one solid piece.</li>
            <li> There is not better top coat.</li>
            <li> Just did my nails two days ago and put this on as the top coat, as usual...</li>
            <li> And showed up a week early!</li>
            <li> With one layer of it for the final step, anyone can make their nails as pretty as just come out of a salon.</li>
            <li> The formula and the quality is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I have to say here that it did NOT dry quickly for me, but it made that manicure last almost 2 weeks, even with me doing dishes every day, and typing for 9 hours a day.</li>
            <li> This topcoat polish is quick drying, long lasting, and very shiny.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and gives you that glossy shine and long lasting wear that a salon manicure gives you.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had two bottles for the price of less than one at Target with free ship.</li>
            <li> What I received, does not dry as fast as the Seche Vite, i buy from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i get around it by opening up my windows when applying it  -The product thickens up very quickly, but I&#x27;ve solved this by mixing in a few drops of Seche Vite Restore  -Nail</li>
            <li> Though I still wish there was something that would dry my nails faster, this is definitely worth sticking with.</li>
            <li> I rarely have time to just sit and wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell it&#x27;s the exact same stuff I buy at Sally Beauty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;After using several bottles of this top coat, I noticed that once you get down to about 1/4&amp;#34; of product in the bottle, you might as well throw it away.</li>
            <li> It used to take all day for my nails to dry, and now they dry super fast!</li>
            <li> Having used other products before - I will go with another brand that won&#x27;t require me to deal with fixing a 90% full bottle.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s a quick dry is a major plus.  </li>
            <li> If you use acetone it will severely dry the nails and skin just use moisterizer right away.</li>
            <li> Applied to wet polished nails, it holds your polish intact many days longer than other quick dry products.</li>
            <li> It gives a beautiful shine, lasting protection, and doesn’t get hard and tacky in the bottle as other brands have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything better on the market, and it&#x27;s hard to find in my area.  </li>
            <li> No chipping and its hard to chip with this top coat.</li>
            <li> My daughter is able to use it for the hard finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a thick liquid, but it applies very well and protects my nail color for a long time.</li>
            <li> Up until I purchased this, I swore by Sally Hansen Insta-Dry in clear, as a topcoat.</li>
            <li> My pedicure last literally until the toenails grow out so much</li>
            <li> I am able to get at least 6 days of wear without chipping.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any busy mom of two young kids like myself.</li>
            <li> Your manicure will last much longer and helps protect your nails.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about the prices, way lower that</li>
            <li> Dries nails within a minute and my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just going to use my old tops,</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t resist to pursed so far</li>
            <li> You get the look of professionally done gel nails.</li>
            <li> This should not be happening this early.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look salon professional</li>
            <li> One star marked off because the formula seems to thicken after each use.</li>
            <li> Now my pedis look as though I had them done professionally.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by how this topcoat performs.  </li>
            <li> , looks like I got a professional manicure every time, and it dries faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This product dries fast with a shiny coat even with multiple layers.</li>
            <li> This topcoat dries fast, doesnt streak or shrink,  stays shiny and protects my tiny artwork on nails!</li>
            <li> I really like this topcoat considering the low price of it.</li>
            <li> wow away</li>
            <li> I am not great at applying my own nail polish (I get streaks sometimes), but I put a big drop of this on the nail gently spread it around</li>
            <li> sally hansen dries within 30 seconds or so, so i think i can take those few extra seconds to get a better look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In only a few minutes, I am able to do anything without messing up my nails.  </li>
            <li> Does get thick when it&#x27;s running low though, but that&#x27;s a tiny problem considering how good it is.</li>
            <li> While that product doesn&#x27;t suck, I truly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better and often found my polish peeling off because it was so thick.</li>
            <li> This is a very fast dry for your nails.  </li>
            <li> This absolutely dries fast, but the quick dry makes it chip a little easier and faster.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries so fast that the first nail is totally dry before getting to the fifth nail on the same hand.</li>
            <li> Super shiny and last a long time.</li>
            <li> You have to really know how to use it, depending on how wet or dry your last polish coat is determines how easy this Seche sticks to it.</li>
            <li> This thing dry your nails fast, no waiti time needed!</li>
            <li> Nails dry fast!  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and makes my color last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> This is a very long lasting topcoat that does an extraordinary job of protecting my home manicures.  </li>
            <li> With the quick-drying formula, I never mess up my nails.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that one of the bottles had some black plastic bits around the top of the opening that ended up getting in the actual polish and has already ruined 2 manicures that simply need the final top coat</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful that nail polish could actually dry so fast and so perfectly</li>
            <li> I definitely see one bottle priced quite high where I am.</li>
            <li> very pretty gloss, over bland nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have tried others and no other compares!</li>
            <li> It does dry amazingly fast, but as others have stated, it shrinks your polish and pulls it away from the edges, I even went as far as to polish the edges and tips, but it still pulled.</li>
            <li> The only thing about it that might be negative is that it does have a strong paint chemical smell that&#x27;s different from regular nail polish, but it goes away quickly so I can&#x27;t bring myself to dock it a star for that.</li>
            <li> Happy to say no chips, nail polish dries fast, shiny, and looks like a gel manicure without the bad side effects of an actual gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I do this every time and think it is greatly responsible for the long wear that I get out of each manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so my nails get pretty rough treatment.</li>
            <li> I wear a new color every week because it only takes me 15 minutes max to do my nails, and 10 minutes of that is filing.</li>
            <li> can live without it, dries polish guickly and manicure last for days without chipping</li>
            <li> Directions are in the box and it is necessary to read and follow them if you are new to the product.  </li>
            <li> Brings back the shine of a new pedi even after being on the beach and in the water.  </li>
            <li> I use this product as a dry fast topcoat after applying nail polish.</li>
            <li> I know you think that by &amp;#34;gooping&amp;#34; it on it won&#x27;t  dry fast, but by the time I got to my pinky, my thumb was already dry!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It keeps the polish on your nails and it really does dry in 5 MINUTES!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the fast dry about a week ago..</li>
            <li> when you paint your nails you don&#x27;t really want to wait for them to dry</li>
            <li> It does dry amazingly fast</li>
            <li> And yeah, it somehow makes the polish dry all the way to the nail really fast</li>
            <li> My friend borrowed it and will be ordering SecheVite Dry Fast, too.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt dry as fast as this and also leaves a cloudy haze.</li>
            <li> Makes my polish last for at least a week or more.</li>
            <li> Definitely lives up to its instant done nails, but you have to do them every 2 days or be really gentle to keep them from automatically peeling off.</li>
            <li> it drys my nails immediately, and since I am often adding an extra coat of polish as I go out the door, it&#x27;s absolutely essential to have the nails dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Cons are that it smells strongly and it gets thick halfway through the bottle</li>
            <li> and I actually do recommend it, BUT be cautious if you&#x27;re pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant because it&#x27;s dangerous and also try to use it in a well ventilated room due to the chemical odor.</li>
            <li> Does dry very fast but does not keep the polish from wearing off by the second day.</li>
            <li> Other than it lets your nail polish dried very fast , it also makes your nail polish more long lasting.</li>
            <li> I used to have to keep them free of activity for several hours after applying the old top coats I had been using, or I would get ugly marks on my nails, but Seche isn&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li> So, great top coat, terrible base coat, lol.</li>
            <li> Very thick and does dry very quick but pretty spendy for the end result i think</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;ve applied it to all ten fingertips, the first tip is already dry!  </li>
            <li> The product is wonderful but it arrived broken  one bottle was totally shattered and the other one had dried on polish and glass.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my old stand-by...</li>
            <li> It still performs as expected and dries really fast once applied.</li>
            <li> if you put this over your regular polish frequently.  </li>
            <li> I am a busy mom who is constantly submerging my hands in water and scrubbing messes.</li>
            <li> Love the shine and it does protect my thin, splitting and peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> It dries SUPER quickly, to a HARD finish, not tacky or soft at all.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my nails dry in no time with a high gloss/shine.</li>
            <li> this polish will help dry your polish fast but after a day it will chip sometimes within the same day.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry fast</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal to smear and take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!  </li>
            <li> People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!  </li>
            <li> I want to love you so much, but I have trouble getting over how after I get to the middle of the bottle, you turn into some thick, gloppy, unusable product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other top-coats but they don&#x27;t really seem to compare.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very shiny finish that is extremely chip resistant.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, have not had trouble with the shrinkage on the ends of nails if you tuck it under a little on the polishing.  </li>
            <li> dries SUPER fast like seriously I feel like five min after its dry</li>
            <li> Keeps my nail polish protected, DOES NOT CHIP, dries in a complete 2 minutes or LESS, my nails have been a lot stronger and has a vibrant shine to it that lasts as well.</li>
            <li> When I tried, it said that because of hazardous issues, I am unable to send them back, but I coudln&#x27;t get a hold of anyone who would give me a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought the little bottle first.  </li>
            <li> Nearly all of the nail polish I purchased was less than $1.50 a bottle, so it was by no means high quality.</li>
            <li> so if you even barely touch it with the brush on your next stroke</li>
            <li> Also keeps your polish on longer than usual - I can easily go a week or longer without one little chip (and I have a 4 and 2 year old and am a SAHM</li>
            <li> I never even worry about dry time between my color coats anymore because I know that when I use seche, the whole manicure is dry in 10 minutes TOPS.</li>
            <li> This product tends to get very thick VERY quickly so getting the seche restore is a must.</li>
            <li> But not only fast, but it gives my manicure a high diamond shine as well as a rock hard feel.</li>
            <li> It also becomes very goopy half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> Does last almost as long as a gel application, but not as toxic by far.  </li>
            <li> Having purchased 5 of these so far I have yet to figure out how to make it last that long without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And with the Seche Clear Base Coat my nails stay nice for almost two weeks!</li>
            <li> It barely lasts a few days and the smell is very different from the real product.</li>
            <li> Love that it dries nails super fast but has a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re impatient with waiting for your nails to dry, you need to get this top coat!</li>
            <li> I usually use Revlon quick dry</li>
            <li> Very high gloss and firm finish to protect nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that say they dry fast -</li>
            <li> I got this because my four year old can never sit still long enough to let her nail polish dry when I paint her nails.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with the purchase and hope the bottle doesn&#x27;t dry up and become thick after a few uses.</li>
            <li> top coat goes on extremely thick, and tends to leave small bubbles-</li>
            <li> You can also buy a large bottle to funnel into the small one if that&#x27;s what you prefer too.  </li>
            <li> (not because it doesn&#x27;t last, I just get bored easily) and I haven&#x27;t done my nails in years without using this topcoat.  </li>
            <li> It usually ends up leaving just a hint of nail showing at the tips/cuticles, but otherwise keeps the polish intact very well.</li>
            <li> Makes your manicure last long without any chips.</li>
            <li> Shine last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Adds lots of shine and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I used to always smudge my nails because I wouldn&#x27;t wait long enough.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old, but the color of the liquid actually looked a little yellowed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of other top coats, including Essie and OPI, but everything dried dull or bubbly until this.</li>
            <li> This product sells for much more expensive in stores like in Target or other drug stores, so I would definitely recommend buying two for the price of one on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed and will not go back to any other top coats.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I can paint my nails, let dry like 2 minutes, put this on and dig around in my purse 1 minute later and not a smudge to be had ..</li>
            <li> Strange texture goes on pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> The product did not live up to its publicity.&lt;br /&gt;It does not harden enough to prevent chipping the day after you apply it.</li>
            <li> when it dryed less then 4seconds not a little dry fully dryed in second an</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would cut down on my manicure / pedicure dry time and Sec he Vite fast dry was mention on UTube with rave reviews</li>
            <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t like Seche Vite because of the shrinkage, but I think that is a small price to pay for the high gloss</li>
            <li> Dries fast and hard.</li>
            <li> it dried faster than I expected and leaves a high gloss shine for days.  </li>
            <li> , that alone makes it worth it since 9 out of 10 times I have painted my nails in the past, I&#x27;ve managed to smudge, dent, or mess them up in some way before they dry all the way.</li>
            <li> however, i am one star shy because when i received the product, the brush in one if the bottles wasn&#x27;t applying smoothly.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> that long without chipping.  </li>
            <li> Within a few hours of applying, the edges started peeling and developed a milky, matte finish.</li>
            <li> goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have long nails...</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known about this stuff a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three tries -- having to remove it all and then reapply it three days in a row before I finally gave up.</li>
            <li> I did not give it the one star that I feel it deserves, because it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
            <li> I first used a drugstore base coat, two coats of polish (cheap polish) and then waited a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> nothing is as thick and dries as fast as this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Just that I think these might shrink your nail polish so a good base coat is needed</li>
            <li> I mean I was really</li>
            <li> No more bed sheet impressions on my newly manicured nails.  </li>
            <li> I always used to smudge my nails because they took so long to dry</li>
            <li> (I heard this tip only in one other place and it made a difference).</li>
            <li> With seche vita, I can wear my manicure for about 4-5 days which is a very long time for me.  </li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;ve just been being very careful about giving my nails plenty of time, or this actually dries faster, but I haven&#x27;t had issues with immediate marring.</li>
            <li> I use to wait hours for the polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry as soon as you put it on within seconds</li>
            <li> My manicures used to get scuffed up and destroyed before they even had time to dry.  </li>
            <li> Your hands will be dry to the touch within 2 minutes or so</li>
            <li> , i gotta text one of the people on my contacts, so i hope my nails dry fast.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> With this topcoat, my nails are dry within minutes.  </li>
            <li> It just takes minutes to dry no matter</li>
            <li> I used to go to bed with my nails dry</li>
            <li> Within a minute, it will be dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> Waiting for my nails to dry is torture.</li>
            <li> am the type of person that loves to change my polish on a whim, which means I often do not have a lot of time to wait for the nail polish to dry before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> since I don&#x27;t like waiting forever for polish to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to wait around for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> as soon as you put this over your nail polish, your nails are dry within seconds.  </li>
            <li> Within 30 to 45 minutes my nails are completely dry.</li>
            <li> None of them have worked as well as Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> I can NEVER wait for my polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested this product after I complained about my nail polish regularly chipping off my natural nails.</li>
            <li> At first I was spreading it too thin.  </li>
            <li> 2) when you get down to about a quarter of the bottle left</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super shiny, not toooo thin and dries in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually polish my nails every other day (I get bored quickly) and in less than five minutes my polish is completely dry and ready to work.  </li>
            <li> Dry tot he touch in seconds!</li>
            <li> And helps dry my nails stat!</li>
            <li> 2 for less than the price of one at my local target.</li>
            <li> brush is also short and doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the bottle so even once you use half a bottle</li>
            <li> In less than 5 minutes (probably closer to 1-2 minutes) you can go about your daily business and not worry about ruining your manicure.  </li>
            <li> Now to the actual product painted my nails yesterday and usually I have a chip already the day of or the next day of manicure.</li>
            <li> I have purchased similar products as such in the past.</li>
            <li> You can apply this to wet or dry nail polish</li>
            <li> I bought all products, including four different color polishes, for less than the cost of one no-chip manicure.  </li>
            <li> Only con is when it is about half empty it starts to thicken</li>
            <li> Since I started using Seche Vite, I don&#x27;t have to worry if I only have a few minutes, because my nails are completely dry within 2-3 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does dry rock hard in just a few minutes - forget those pricey gel manicures.</li>
            <li> The only thing i will say is you should probably wait a little longer than 45 minutes before you wear boots -- it will get ruined if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I buy a stupid amount of nail polish and this is the first time I was ever interested in writing a review on nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how long this manicure will last me!</li>
            <li> It has dried multiple coats of nail polish with no problem.</li>
            <li> But, a few hours later, the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bottle is closed.</li>
            <li> But since it rapidly dissipates, it&#x27;s not really much of a problem.</li>
            <li> as expected and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Item arrived sooner than expected and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It does crystalize and evaporate so the Sec</li>
            <li> The nail art is a lot of work that I would like to last longer than a few days.</li>
            <li> I will be a lifelong Seche Vite user.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling its the top coat as I have changed color coats and base coats and this same thing happens.</li>
            <li> I type heavily at the office and due to that, the tips of my nail color are slightly faded, but again, I&#x27;m certain this is due to my heavy typing activity.  </li>
            <li> I paint my nails with a base coat, two coats of color, a coat of Fast Dry, then a coat of glitter, and another coat of Seche Vite Dry Fast.  </li>
            <li> resistant.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because both brushes were stiff and unusable.</li>
            <li> I read in previous reviews that after application in just a few short seconds/minutes that your polish wouldn&#x27;t smudge and is touchably dry</li>
            <li> I find if I use a base coat with this product, the polish pretty much just peels off within two days.</li>
            <li> Will take your nails from sopping wet to hard and dry in 10 minutes flat.  </li>
            <li> so I truly did not get a single dent mark even with a layer of base coat, two layers of color, and the seche vite on top.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a single chip, something that my clumsy and constantly typing self has never managed before.  </li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as other polishes either.</li>
            <li> Such a waste!</li>
            <li> I apply it to one hand and go to do my other one</li>
            <li> I noticed though that the product gets a little thicker after using it for a while (like when you have a little left in the bottle), no worries though.</li>
            <li> It works well with other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> it gets extremely gloopy/unusable.  </li>
            <li> It is worse than normal nail polish and your nails will stink for hours after you put it on</li>
            <li> I had always used this in the past because it was always glossy for entire time until wanting a color change.</li>
            <li> and I try to use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Ordered this along with a couple of other nail products.</li>
            <li> I use them over my China Glaze or Orly nail polishes, but they also work well on other kinds like Milani.</li>
            <li> I have had it on my toes for five days with no chips or cracks and it is still extremely glossy without any touchups.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have to paint my nails about every other day</li>
            <li> I wash dishes by had every day and do other cleaning and sewing.</li>
            <li> Other thinners don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that can&#x27;t sit and wait for nail polish to dry, whoever is in a rush or like me, it makes me anxious to sit still without using my hands while polish gets dry.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t press down when you drag the brush on your nail.</li>
            <li> and they last for a really long time even though I am very hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> Since I usually use more expensive polishes, I hate to go through them so quickly.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really hard on my nails and constantly washing my hands.</li>
            <li> It dries almost instantly to a finish as shiny and hard as glass.</li>
            <li> Just common sense practices will pay off with longer lasting polish.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do anything rough - like do dishes until thoroughly dried.  </li>
            <li> It dries up and becomes way too thick in the bottle and stringy after only a handful of uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate painting my nails then having to wait for an hour or two before I can safely do anything without ruining my manicure.</li>
            <li> After polishing my nails with a base coat and applying 3 coats of nail polish, I then applied this quick dry topcoat and within minutes it was dry to the touch..</li>
            <li> When the nail chips, the top coat, color coats and base coats chip all together.</li>
            <li> is when you get down to a quarter of a bottle to starts to turn into glue.</li>
            <li> It never lets me down.</li>
            <li> and they last a few days longer with this!!  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other!</li>
            <li> I have real nails and this lasts like mad) and the tech called me a few days later and said she ordered it for herself.</li>
            <li> No more waiting around forever for you nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I usually sit around for 30 minutes to give it ample time to dry.</li>
            <li> I also put it over nail polish before it was dry and it dried it in seconds!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product since I tend to always mess my nail polish because I hate waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Product is a little disappointing in that it is hard to keep off cuticles and peels easily.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend try to convince me recently that the $20 bottle of Debra Lippmann&#x27;s Addicted to Speed is even better, so I sprang for it and was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> My nails are dry in a matter of minutes, very few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The box was delivered basically opened and half squished.</li>
            <li> But this topcoat dries in less than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It dries in a flash to the touch and with in a half hour to do dishes.  </li>
            <li> less stressful</li>
            <li> (it applied the black junk in addition to the polish)</li>
            <li> I got 2 bottles for less than $9...</li>
            <li> not super amazed but</li>
            <li> This is SOOOOOO helpful and I have had a lot less re-dos since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> It does get goopy half way through the bottle</li>
            <li> I purchased a nail stamping kit, stamping plates, dotting tools, rhinestones, nail glue, 500 fake nails, and a BUNCH of new nail polish.</li>
            <li> Now I can slather on as thick a coat of polish as I want and not have to worry about the time it will take to dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is buying some nail polish thinner as it gets very thick once you use up about half of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another down side is that it gets very thick after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer if I add decals or do ombre designs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it even a little.</li>
            <li> I mean it actually dries while you&#x27;re applying it, so you have to be VERY heavy handed during application to avoid brush stroke lines on your nails.</li>
            <li> I would get so sick and tired of purchasing these beautiful, vibrant....not to mention expensive nail polishes</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when it&#x27;s halfway finished, it gets very thick and gooey</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after you&#x27;ve been using it for a while, the bottle starts to thicken and is really hard to work with, and it seems like no amount of nail thinner fixes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am rather impatient when it comes to waiting for my nails</li>
            <li> but this stuff is a big secret to it.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t waste your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> NOT shake this product before use because it will fill with air-bubbles and be unusable for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing i&#x60;m not happy with it</li>
            <li> In a hurry out just impatient?</li>
            <li> I use this, give it a few minutes without doing anything with my hands, then put on a few drops of quickdry solution and give it another couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> within a few days the design literally pealed off as if it was a sticker.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s narrow and all the bristles seem to be stuck together?</li>
            <li> I know there is something you can buy to thin it back out,</li>
            <li> I use this after each coat of nail polish and it dries in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it everyday, so hopefully no harm will come from it.  </li>
            <li> In a few minutes I can go about my day and not worry about smudging my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is made to be applied thickly over WET nails.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not 3 free.</li>
            <li> I am so impatient.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is the smell is a bit stronger compare to my other topcoat such as Poshe and Julep freedom.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m doing my nails at least every other day.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to pay the exorbitant cost of gel nails ($35 for plain in my area every two weeks)  </li>
            <li> I recently &amp;#34;slapped on&amp;#34; some nail polish without base but still used Seche Vite and my polish lasted almost a week, even with my doing dishes without gloves and normal showering/hand washing.</li>
            <li> I still stand by this product and have purchased probably close to 50 bottles over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> No nicks in my polish, no smudging , no nothing perfectly dried nails in 5 min or less!!</li>
            <li> I typically paint my nails right before going to sleep since I&#x27;m terrible with waiting to let my nails dry.</li>
            <li> This product drys the nails within a few minutes - and I mean a few.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Only negative comment was one brush was a little bent up in the bottle BUT not a make or break deal.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a hard protective coating once it has completely dried.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush is a little weird knob the one I opened.</li>
            <li> Dried in five minutes and hasn&#x27;t budged!</li>
            <li> , I never am never able to finish a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Where ever  I usually buy these, sell one for the price listed here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ; I actually thought my nails were still wet because of the shine, and was shocked that it had dried THAT shiny.</li>
            <li> I usually give it 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually end up with a chip after a couple days</li>
            <li> I do my nails before bed a lot and usually wake up with scratch marks on them even if I had done them 30-60 minutes before bed.  </li>
            <li> I am uncertain why reviewers are stating this is not authentic?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not authentic</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why ppl think that?</li>
            <li> I usually do my nails before bed</li>
            <li> No more smudged nails for me.</li>
            <li> I change my nail polish usually once a week, my nails are always painted and</li>
            <li> It dries so doggone quickly, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> My manicure will last five days unless I am careless about protecting my hands and it  could be longer for some.  </li>
            <li> an amateur</li>
            <li> No more smearing.  </li>
            <li> The tear was quite far down, and would have been painful to remove.</li>
            <li> I have tried it with several different base coats, nail polishes, even tried glitter polish which is usually like glue, and everything has chipped WITHIN ONE DAY.  </li>
            <li> It went on very easily, no globbing or dragging up my color.  </li>
            <li> So, whether you&#x27;re impatient, clumsy, or just want to prolong the life of your manicure, get this stuff!</li>
            <li> I thought this was the really hard topcoat they use on your nails at the salon</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails and this extends the color for up to a week.</li>
            <li> She is using this strictly for the hard finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets thick and hard to get out towards the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I do my nails at least every two days</li>
            <li> It does get thick and gloppy after a while but buy the seche thinner</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> Seche gives your nails thick protection from chips and scratches.</li>
            <li> It hardens immediately and leaves a thick coat that covers any boo boos with the color coat.</li>
            <li> All of the bottles I&#x27;ve purchased got about 4 uses out of them before the coat got thick and rubbery.</li>
            <li> I type a lot and a thick coat of this stuff</li>
            <li> The only downfall, is sometimes it changes the polish color slightly. :(</li>
            <li> No more blanket marks when you paint your nails at bedtime!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed  with you, Amazon , as I am a loyal prime customer.</li>
            <li> This is also less expensive than buy the two-pack at cvs.</li>
            <li> Seriously, get this (the two pack if you can).</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve changed my clothes and done my hair within 20 minutes of finishing my nails, no gouges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 star because once you get to the middle of the bottle the polish hardens and is almost impossible to work with.</li>
            <li> Also, one thing to know is that the warning label says to avoid using it during pregnancy as it can cause birth defects, which is a little scary.  </li>
            <li> Once this seche vite would dry, air pockets would form under my nail polish causing the Polish to popped off like it was a fake nail!</li>
            <li> I use the clear for a base coat as well.</li>
            <li> It also has a bad habit of shrinking if you apply it to dry polish</li>
            <li> When this product is halfway used up its very thick and goopey.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s annoying to tilt the bottle to the side to get enough product on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thin consistency and</li>
            <li> One bottle was broken</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used this product over and over (using just 1 thin coat or 2 coats).</li>
            <li> and if you want to thin it you have to buy Seche Restore.</li>
            <li> 1 was broken and got cut.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of paying $30 to $40 every two weeks for a no-chip manicure.  </li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time (and a gross amount of money) perfecting my art work and was crazy mad when my color was pulled away from the tips and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Also evens out any sloppy brush marks...</li>
            <li> as long as I don&#x27;t use a base coat with it.</li>
            <li> I took a picture of the broken bottles but it was of no use because I am still unable to be in contact with anyone.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s not safe to use around kids and the fumes are bad, but it WORKS</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Worst polish ever, it always peels off entire nail and all polish at once within like 2 days max.</li>
            <li> The O.P.I. is just to expensive.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very thin, like water.  </li>
            <li> She also has very thin nails that peel and split at the slightest snag or tap and needs something to protect them.</li>
            <li> because waiting for them to dry is the worst</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Warning this stuff STINKS.</li>
            <li> but the SMELL, my god the smells is just crazy.</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations as finding a &amp;#34;miracle drying polish&amp;#34; is usually disappointing.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Well, here I am to admit that I was so wrong!  </li>
            <li> but I have been disappointed in comparison to store bought bottles.</li>
            <li> :-((</li>
            <li> Pros: (1)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price!!</li>
            <li> If you use the Duris rejuvacote for your base coat your nails will get stronger.</li>
            <li> Again, I hate these surveys, I don&#x27;t mind giving you info but this requirement of x number of words is annoying.  </li>
            <li> I think that I&#x27;ll no longer use a base (unless it&#x27;s a color</li>
            <li> I use a base coat</li>
            <li> I did use it as my base coating polish at times.</li>
            <li> I will say, however that this makes a terrible base coat.</li>
            <li> I always hated painting my nails</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Try it; you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> After I tried the product, the smell was terrible  and brought tears to my  eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells really terrible and gives me a headache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost idiot proof!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is legitimate and is the best kept at home manicure secret</li>
            <li> Love Seche Vite. Have used it for years.  This is a good deal for 2 bottles.  Bought a set for my mom too.</li>
            <li> Seche vite drys fast and creates this amazing glossy and smoothing shield on the nails. Be sure to apply to the entire nail or it will separate and leave a line of separation. Very often I would apply the seche vite myself after getting a manicure because my nail technician always missed the edges and I would see the separation when I got home. She didn&#x27;t seem to like me taking over at the end but I have to be happy with my nails.</li>
            <li> For sure the best topcoat for the price.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries super fast.  It leaves an ultra smooth and shiny finish!  I cannot do my nails without it.</li>
            <li> I love this shiny quick dry top coat. must have for quality manicures</li>
            <li> I was SO excited when I saw this deal but I have been disappointed in comparison to store bought bottles. It seems like these bottles have more air bubbles in them and they the bottle dried out much faster than others.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;Since I switch to Seche Vite my homemade manicures last much longer than any other brand top coat I&#x27;ve had tried before.</li>
            <li> After I tried the product, the smell was terrible  and brought tears to my  eyes. I checked the label and it says IT CAN CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS AND REPRODUCTIVE  HARM! After researching  it, it contains ingredients that CAN CAUSE CANCER! Good nails are not worth it. I am demanding a refund seeing as this warning was not in the product  description. Very disappointed  with you, Amazon , as I am a loyal prime customer.</li>
            <li> The seller sent only one bottle of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;With the request to send does not get it - at first promised, and now do not answer letters.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend to buy!&lt;br /&gt;You cheated!</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended.  Good buy, it really puts a great top coat on and it drys fast, shiny and quick. The two bottle deal made for a nice price.</li>
            <li> Awfully strong smell, but the best topcoat around.</li>
            <li> The best topcoat I ever tried. The polish drys instantly. I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews I had to buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite for years because of how quickly it dries to the core. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other top-coats but they don&#x27;t really seem to compare. My only complaint is that after you&#x27;ve been using it for a while, the bottle starts to thicken and is really hard to work with, and it seems like no amount of nail thinner fixes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the company itself, I got both of my nail polishes on time, packaged securely, with no breaks. As far as I can tell it&#x27;s the exact same stuff I buy at Sally Beauty. I&#x27;d recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> Best money spent will never use any other top coat . This is a great deal I stock up and as long as it isn&#x27;t opened. I am rather impatient when it comes to waiting for my nails this eliminates that problem . As soon as I apply it dries my nails within a minute and it also makes my nails super shiny salon worthy .</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used.  Thanks for all the great reviews I read on this.  Because of those reviews I found this great product.  Leaves my nails with a really nice shiny look (just like the salon).</li>
            <li> I have used Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for many years.  It&#x27;s also used by the manicurists in my nail salon.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The fact that it&#x27;s a quick dry is a major plus.  It&#x27;s saved my fresh manicure every time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Great buy...I always keep it handy...</li>
            <li> This dries very fast and keeps my nail polish on a whole lot longer than most products I&#x27;ve tried.  It also leaves my nails with a really smooth feel that I really like.</li>
            <li> Not all the hype. Very thick and does dry very quick but pretty spendy for the end result i think</li>
            <li> I would definitely repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping but, TERRIIBLLE handling. The box was delivered basically opened and half squished. But I love this top coat and this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat ever.  But you should buy seche restore with it because this topcoat tends to get thicken up over time.  But this topcoat dries in less than 2 minutes.  I do my nails and go to bed.  And nothing smudges.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat you can buy.  It arrived quickly at a very good price.</li>
            <li> It made my nails yellow.</li>
            <li> It did arrive in a timely manner and it is what it says it is....  But I used this topcoat and it peeled the nail polish right off of my nails.  I could peel the nail polish off in one piece from my nail.  I thought this was the really hard topcoat they use on your nails at the salon..  I must have been mistaken</li>
            <li> Great top coat, strong and shiny.</li>
            <li> Just got it and tried it and it is the best top coat I&#x27;ve used.  Dries fast and hard.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is the best top coat ever.  It dries in a flash to the touch and with in a half hour to do dishes.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything better on the market, and it&#x27;s hard to find in my area.  Why?  It is a superior product.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  It arrived earlier than expected. I would purchase from them again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative comment was one brush was a little bent up in the bottle BUT not a make or break deal.  Still can use it regardless.</li>
            <li> I lovee this product so much !!!! Dries SO QUICKLY, ITS AMAZING!!!! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when it&#x27;s halfway finished, it gets very thick and gooey</li>
            <li> My fave top coat usually at $7 at sally&#x27;s  for 1 so for 2 bottles for the price of one i had to purchase it, and it seems to be the real thing</li>
            <li> Favorite Topcoat- dries extremely fast and worth the price</li>
            <li> This is the BEST top coat! I use the clear for a base coat as well. A lot of my friends and coworkers are jealous that I can do my own nails but this stuff is a big secret to it. With the quick-drying formula, I never mess up my nails. I&#x27;ve also done laundry literally 5 minutes after doing my nails. This stuff doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as other polishes either. I wear a new color every week because it only takes me 15 minutes max to do my nails, and 10 minutes of that is filing.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for a fast drying top coat.  I have used it to top off 6 coats of clear and colored nail polishes and it manages to dry everything underneath!</li>
            <li> This top coat is awesome! It does have a distinct smell, but goes on shiny and dries super fast. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish. If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li> Not only was the top coat super fast, the shipping was incredible! It literally took no time to get here, I was so surprised! So both are speedy fast and I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased. The price was wonderful too.</li>
            <li> This top coat makes your nail polish dry SUPER fast. It&#x27;s a must have for doing your nails! No more waiting around forever for you nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for 2 bottles!!! Just that I think these might shrink your nail polish so a good base coat is needed</li>
            <li> BEST top coat ever. Strong nail salon smell, but dries nails super fast!</li>
            <li> This my favorite top coat and the price was unbeatable. 2 for less than the price of one at my local target.</li>
            <li> It really works.  I use to wait hours for the polish to dry.  This is just minutes, and &amp;#34;Almost &amp;#34; as strong as &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; without the damage to your nails.  Buy it, it&#x27;s best I have ever come across.  If you use the Duris rejuvacote for your base coat your nails will get stronger.</li>
            <li> I just received mine in the mail and used it on my toes and its a dream! Dried in five minutes and hasn&#x27;t budged! I sooo can&#x27;t wait for my nails to be done so I can use this perfectly glossed polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, I could do without the smell...</li>
            <li> I do my nails at least every two days and I love this product because it dries my nails fast and being that I am a mom of four it works great!!</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle at CVS and loved it so much that when i ran out i knew i needed more, but its so expensive. Seeing this price for TWO was great! If you are looking for a great top coat that literally dries fast, this is going to be your best bet! They use this stuff in salons as well, and it makes your nails look like you have gels. buy it! This is also less expensive than buy the two-pack at cvs.</li>
            <li> Love it would be buying more</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for 2 years now.  I do not use gel or acrylic nails, and enjoy doing my own.  However, I did not like the shirt time it would take for my nails to chip after a self manicure.  With seche vita, I can wear my manicure for about 4-5 days which is a very long time for me.  My pedicure last literally until the toenails grow out so much I need to cut them.  I work a lot with my hands and so my manicures used to chip after 1-2 days before seche vita.</li>
            <li> The name itself means &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; and it does exactly that. There is a bit of a learning curve when applying it but it dries your polish fast. It does have a really powerful chemical smell which some folks can&#x27;t stand. I&#x27;ve tried other fast drying top coats but I always come back to Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> well buy more ...has a hearse smell .but works great .  been use now for about 3 months and will always buy this top coat from here on out :)</li>
            <li> This is a very long lasting topcoat that does an extraordinary job of protecting my home manicures.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> can live without it, dries polish guickly and manicure last for days without chipping</li>
            <li> Best top coat to use the polish stays put for about a week before starting to chip. also speeds up drying time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! It dries quickly and makes my color last a LONG time! And I wash my hands a LOT.</li>
            <li> Peels right off my nails just a day after applying.</li>
            <li> Flakes off within the first couple of hours of application</li>
            <li> Best invention ever!  I have used this for 2 years and it never fails me :)</li>
            <li> Love this Top Coat aside from the fumes which do take your breath away. But aside from that, my nails are super shiny, rock hard and last a good time.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a dry fast topcoat after applying nail polish. This product really drys fast.  You can literally run your fingers in your purse or tie your shoe without messing up a nail.  I then reapply it the second day to extend my manicure.  I am able to get at least 6 days of wear without chipping. This is by far the best deal that I have found anywhere for this product. This product sells for $9 per bottle where I live. This is a must have for any busy mom of two young kids like myself.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  Your manicure will last much longer and helps protect your nails.</li>
            <li> I love that this is drying for polish underneath, but my favorite thing is that this is the best top coat I&#x27;ve tried, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve worked my way through every drug store &amp;#34;no-ship&amp;#34; &amp;#34;extra hardening&amp;#34; type top coats as well as a sampling of higher end best reviewed top coats, and none of them have anything on this one! Best for not chipping and for hardening my nails so they don&#x27;t bend or break.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and she was very happy with this product. would recommend! If you know someone who likes to do their own nails!</li>
            <li> For real the best top coat and quick dry ever! Even over foil, doesn&#x27;t crinkle it. Shine for days over everything. Try it you&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> All in all, I like it, but I still don&#x27;t feel like it makes my nails last that long without chipping.  Also, one thing to know is that the warning label says to avoid using it during pregnancy as it can cause birth defects, which is a little scary.  But I LOVE that it dries so quickly and gives a great glossy finish.</li>
            <li> These arrived in a box with very little padding, but other wise it was great! I&#x27;ve used Seche Vite before, but this is my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The top coat is nice, but don&#x27;t expect it to be chip proof (my sinful colors top coat lasted longer). However that was only with one coat of regular polish. I would recommend 2.&lt;br /&gt;You should also not wait too long to apply the top coat, 2-3 mins, and then you can seal it! You obviously can wait longer, but you do not need to.&lt;br /&gt;The shine from this top coat is incredible, and before it starts chipping, it looks great!&lt;br /&gt;I paid around $8.50 for two bottles, I feel that that price is fair, and nicely comparable to other fast dry top coats.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle product, something cheaper would definitely do, however it is nice, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Such a waste! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> After watching many you tube videos almost all nail art videos people use seiche vite so I thought it would be a great product to add to my new hobby, nail art. Thanks so much. Item was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast and leaves a great shine!!</li>
            <li> This is seriously magic in a bottle! I would recommend this top coat to anyone and everyone that hates waiting for ever for dry nails! pick yourself up some Seche Vite today!</li>
            <li> You must have Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for your nail polish. Other than it lets your nail polish dried very fast , it also makes your nail polish more long lasting. I did recommend this to many of my friends and they both have good comments to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat after my Mom recommended it. It&#x27;s the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes the finish very shiny and smooth and perfectly completes my manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen my manicurists using this when getting my nails done but never had a bottle. This two pack is a great value and honestly the only top coat you will ever need. Hardens to an indestructible shell in minutes and keeps your nails looking fresh, shiny, and chip free for days. Beauty staple that you definitely should have around.</li>
            <li> Not going to tell you anything new, this is the best top coat for drying quick and solid! Does get thick when it&#x27;s running low though, but that&#x27;s a tiny problem considering how good it is.</li>
            <li> Good top coat.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best actually</li>
            <li> This polish gives my nails a perfect shine and a really smooth and very shiny coat after I polish my nails. It doesn&#x27;t chip or peel.  I really can&#x27;t say enough about the prices, way lower that the stores. Will absolutely continue to purchase from Amazon. Love it!</li>
            <li> Now my manicure stay smudge proof and no do over. I will continue to use this product until they stop making it ( please don&#x27;t stop production)</li>
            <li> fast shipping and love the product....would nto use anything else.</li>
            <li> Best Top Coat I have ever used. Makes manicure and pedicure last longer than with any other top coat. Worth the money</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and the best for a fast drying of the nails.  I panic when my bottle is getting low.</li>
            <li> Hands down THE BEST top coat I have ever used.  Drys so fast you could go to be 30 minutes after finishing your nails and the next morning they&#x27;re still perfect without the dreaded &#x27;bed-marks&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love how glossy this top coat is, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it peels at the corners of my nails more quickly than the OPI topcoat. It was a good price for the two bottles, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it, but it&#x27;s not as durable as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and I mean many top coats in my lifetime and nothing comes close to the quick dry and the shine of Seche Vite. It leaves a hard protective coating once it has completely dried. I love this stuff and will never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> The best.  Fast drying, long wearing, and super shiny.  Nothing else works as well, don&#x27;t waste your money elsewhere. Just buy this.</li>
            <li> No more sheet marks:)  This product drys the nails within a few minutes - and I mean a few.  You can touch your nails in about 3 - 5 minutes.  You can&#x27;t do anything rough - like do dishes until thoroughly dried.  I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I would get so sick and tired of purchasing these beautiful, vibrant....not to mention expensive nail polishes and they would chip or peel off within 2 days time. I did some research on top coats and this one has truly lived up to it&#x27;s reviews! My maincure laste a week, which includind: dishwahing, rock climbing, playing in th sand, and working retail. I am beyond happy with this product. I keep recommending it to all my girl friends, hands down the most amamizng top coat!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, have not had trouble with the shrinkage on the ends of nails if you tuck it under a little on the polishing.  Dries itself and the polish under it very quickly to the touch and very quickly over all.  Do not know how I lived without this.</li>
            <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
            <li> so many raves about this product but its dries soooo fast for the price</li>
            <li> This dries so quickly and smoothly, I really like it. However, it does tend to pull the nail polish inwards. It usually ends up leaving just a hint of nail showing at the tips/cuticles, but otherwise keeps the polish intact very well.</li>
            <li> Great buy and the price is unbeatable!  This product is the best.  I love finishing up my nails with this top coat.  It leaves my nails dry in no time with a high gloss/shine.</li>
            <li> This truly is a fast dry top coat.  I LOVE this brand and it is the only one I will use.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Does not do what it says. No need to bother with.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing.  In my quest to find the perfect top coat, I&#x27;ve purchased literally 100&#x27;s of bottles of top coats over the years, and not a single one comes close to Seche.  The shine is beautiful, and it puts a finish on my nails like I&#x27;ve never before seen.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining my polish after applying, because Seche dries amazingly quickly and leaves the polish finished perfectly, so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about being careful with them after applying your polish.  I used to have to keep them free of activity for several hours after applying the old top coats I had been using, or I would get ugly marks on my nails, but Seche isn&#x27;t like this.  Once applied it dries fast, and it has the most beautiful finish.  If you are considering buying it, I would definitely recommend it over any other top coat.  I&#x27;m so happy I found it.</li>
            <li> love this, makes polishing you&#x27;re nails less stressful cause it&#x27;s dry as soon as you put it on within seconds</li>
            <li> This is still the best top coat out there, in my opinion. Lasts forever and takes a good amount of effort to chip. Leaves it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is an OKAY top coat.  It works well for a cheap replacement to my favorite top coat while I&#x27;m out of it.&lt;br /&gt;This top coat goes on extremely thick, and tends to leave small bubbles- even if its a brand new bottle used for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT shake this product before use because it will fill with air-bubbles and be unusable for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I never am never able to finish a bottle.  It dries up and becomes way too thick in the bottle and stringy after only a handful of uses.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is also short and doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the bottle so even once you use half a bottle it&#x27;s annoying to tilt the bottle to the side to get enough product on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that the polish does NOT last any longer than without a top coat, it simply just aids in drying and adding shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these few complaints, it&#x27;s an okay product, certainly not the best top coat in the world, but you can&#x27;t beat the price on amazon for a cheap bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> This dries fast - I mean it actually dries while you&#x27;re applying it, so you have to be VERY heavy handed during application to avoid brush stroke lines on your nails. I know you think that by &amp;#34;gooping&amp;#34; it on it won&#x27;t  dry fast, but by the time I got to my pinky, my thumb was already dry!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this again - it revived my manicure, and I may start taking this with me to the salon when I get my nails done.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, getting 2 bottles is a great deal &amp; I was really impressed with the shine, drying time and over all look of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this top coat for a long time and it is amazing! Just like the salon uses. . Makes them shiny and colors lasts longer</li>
            <li> I saw a review about it on youtube and someone else told me about it.  So I got and IT&#x27;S the best fast dry top coat since sliced bread!  I&#x27;m an OPI kinda gal but I prefer this over OPI top coat.  I do my own mani&#x27;s and they last a few days longer with this!!  I will rebuy</li>
            <li> Love...Love....Love... this tope coat. Makes your manicure last long without any chips. Shine last a long time as well. I gave a bottle to my daughter and she loves it as well. Now when I go to the manicurist to get my nails done this top coat is coming with me.</li>
            <li> been using it for years, quick dry and nice shine</li>
            <li> I love this top coat and feel naked with out it.  This product is fabulous and gives you that glossy shine and long lasting wear that a salon manicure gives you.  Excellent price- you&#x27;ll be hooked once you try it.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. Excellent customer service.All my rhinestones stay in place for many days. The only thing i&#x60;m not happy with it has very strong odor.</li>
            <li> This really does cause nails to try much more quickly. Its everything in claims to be!</li>
            <li> This product dries FAST! But not only fast, but it gives my manicure a high diamond shine as well as a rock hard feel. It protects my color and my nails from chipping. It has dried multiple coats of nail polish with no problem. It has also sealed in numerous nail art manicures, including ones with decals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this top coat so much, I gave one to my sister in law, who loves painting her nails a lot more frequently than I do. She needed a top coat that could save her time on dying time. And another lovable plus? Haven&#x27;t experienced bubbles with this top coat yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am officially a true believer of this product and claim it to be the Holy Grail of my nail polish collection. Can&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite better then the one my girl uses at the nail shop. I keep one of these in my purse gives life back and brightens it up looks like I am wearing gel.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh!!!!! I LOVE THIS TOP COAT!!!! It Is a Life/time saver!!!! Therefore it is the shiz :) I apply it to one hand and go to do my other one and then I check on my first hand and it is completely dry :D</li>
            <li> Also, great buy for the price. Where ever  I usually buy these, sell one for the price listed here.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this top coat. I remember the first time I bought it, it smelt toxic but I guess I got used to it and I didn&#x27;t mind because it actually does its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better top coat.  Dries super fast, leaves a nice shiny finish and makes a manicure last longer.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Again, I hate these surveys, I don&#x27;t mind giving you info but this requirement of x number of words is annoying.  The product did not live up to its publicity.&lt;br /&gt;It does not harden enough to prevent chipping the day after you apply it.</li>
            <li> the product is worth full price but this is a steal! since using it i got my mom, sister, friends and co worker hooked! will re purchase over and over!</li>
            <li> Love it! a must have for every girl!</li>
            <li> Love the product but not so much the seller I bought from. I&#x27;ve bought this product fibe times. That&#x27;s how much I love. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently started getting fancy with my nails. I purchased a nail stamping kit, stamping plates, dotting tools, rhinestones, nail glue, 500 fake nails, and a BUNCH of new nail polish. Some of the nail polish didn&#x27;t dry very nicely, looking matte instead of shiny. Nearly all of the nail polish I purchased was less than $1.50 a bottle, so it was by no means high quality. However, I am just not willing to spend more than a couple dollars for a bottle of nail polish, especially when you buy so many different colors. It adds up! At first, I was reluctant to purchase Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend the money if it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  Plus, I am used to cheap stuff.  I was previously using Sally Hansen, and I am not even sure if it was a top coat or a clear nail polish. Either way, it did not look good. Maybe it was old, but the color of the liquid actually looked a little yellowed. It also would make my nail polish bleed; I would see my nail polish color on the brush no matter how long I let the polish dry before applying the top coat. I am so glad I found this on Amazon and gave in and bought it. It is absolutely worth it.. Seche Vite dries extremely quickly, and SO shiny; I actually thought my nails were still wet because of the shine, and was shocked that it had dried THAT shiny. Seche Vite makes your nails look beautifully glassy, and helps to hide any imperfections. I also applied a couple of coats of Seche Vite under my nail polish, where my nail had torn about 1/4 way across. The tear was quite far down, and would have been painful to remove. This helped keep my nail from ripping the rest of the way off until I could find my nail glue. I also used Seche Vite to stick and seal on rhinestones, using one coat to stick the rhinestone on, and a second coat over the nail and rhinestone to keep it on. It worked great, since it made it stick without clouding the rhinestone, or leave any residue like glue could have. I really love this top coat and wonder how I ever did my nails without it! People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!  The 2 pack is a great value!top coat and wonder how I ever did my nails without it!

            <li> Fantastic deal on this great top coat - probably same price for two here as you would pay for one in the store. I love this stuff, a definite necessity for getting your polish to stay on longer than two days, which is about how long my polish lasts without it.</li>
            <li> Seche is always a reliable top coat! In a hurry out just impatient? This top coat is Super fast and super shiny!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries so fast that the first nail is totally dry before getting to the fifth nail on the same hand. Gloss to the nail polish is amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a thick liquid, but it applies very well and protects my nail color for a long time. It also dries very quickly and evenly. I am very pleased with this product! HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS TOP COAT. I never even worry about dry time between my color coats anymore because I know that when I use seche, the whole manicure is dry in 10 minutes TOPS. It leaves your nails with a glossy, glasslike shine and it almost looks like you have an acrylic wrap! As of right now, I&#x27;ve had a manicure using seche for 8 days and there is not a single chip in sight and I do a LOT of typing so my nails get pretty rough treatment. The only reason I took off a star is because of the toxic ingredients in this polish, On the box it states that it contains chemicals that are KNOWN to cause birth defects as established by the state of California. Also, it smells really terrible and gives me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will continue to use this product and I actually do recommend it, BUT be cautious if you&#x27;re pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant because it&#x27;s dangerous and also try to use it in a well ventilated room due to the chemical odor.</li>
            <li> I have used so many top coats  through the years but once I tried Seche Vite I new I had finally found one that lives up to its promise. Nails shine and polish stays days longer then when I used other top coats.</li>
            <li> Amazing! They&#x27;re not kidding when they call it &amp;#34;Dry Fast&amp;#34;!! By the time you&#x27;ve applied it to all ten fingertips, the first tip is already dry!  Seriously, get this (the two pack if you can). You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> flakes off really easily</li>
            <li> Great price for two bottles and got here really fast. Love this stuff. It does get thick and gloppy after a while but buy the seche thinner and it stays great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Seche Vite dry fast top coat! It&#x27;s definitely my favourite top coat and all my friends always compliment my nails when I use this. It leaves your nails looking like you just got it done at a salon, looks sorta like gel nails because it&#x27;s so shiny. I also love that it dries super fast because I tend to be impatient and mess up my nails by doing things too quickly while waiting for them to dry. With this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about that though! This product sells for much more expensive in stores like in Target or other drug stores, so I would definitely recommend buying two for the price of one on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat you&#x27;ll find.  Period!  It goes on easily, dries quickly and shines for days.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best top coat out there; it lasts with no chips for at least a week, and even then, it only chips a little. I used to paint my nails at least once a week because I couldn&#x27;t stand when they chipped, but this has greatly reduced that time!</li>
            <li> For a great price you get 2 &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; Seche Vite top coats. They came in the box nicely packed. I noticed though that the product gets a little thicker after using it for a while (like when you have a little left in the bottle), no worries though. The product is great though, fires fast and leaves a shiny finish :)</li>
            <li> This is THE best topcoat EVER.  Yeah, it&#x27;s not safe to use around kids and the fumes are bad, but it WORKS and, c&#x27;mon, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know girls who work at Julep (makers of polish and beauty products) and they are actually the ones who pointed me to this product, saying that it is far and away better than anything their company makes.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent top coat. I typically paint my nails right before going to sleep since I&#x27;m terrible with waiting to let my nails dry. This top coat is thick, easy to apply, and dries very quickly. It not only provides a strong protective barrier for your nail color, but it also leaves them really shiny! After using this on top of a few coats of color, I&#x27;m able to go to sleep shortly afterwards and no worry about smudging them on the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this top coat is the smell - it is very strong when you first put it on. But, a few hours later, the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - this is a GREAT price for the product!</li>
            <li> I bought this item since I had found it in my sister&#x27;s nail polish kit box. She loves to put on nail polish and knows everything about it. She enthusiastically recommended the item, and I was really impressed by its performance. Those who do not like to spend a long time drying nail polish without flaws would love this item. It is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> It dries VERY fast, and can do it and run out the door. No worries about chips and smears. Very strong vapors, So use in a make sure you have plenty of ventilation.</li>
            <li> The best top coat I have ever tried. Miracle worker! A salon I went to used it, but was very secretive and finally I figured out the brand and ordered right away.</li>
            <li> Yes - it is the shiniest and the fastest drying top coat I have ever used.  I am not great at applying my own nail polish (I get streaks sometimes), but I put a big drop of this on the nail gently spread it around and, voila, perfect looking nails that dry before I can accidentally bump them into something.  Almost idiot proof!  Does last almost as long as a gel application, but not as toxic by far.  AND you can easily remove and touch up (unlike gel).  Try it you won&#x27;t be sorry.  I am throwing out all of my other top coats.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever!! It keeps the polish on your nails and it really does dry in 5 MINUTES!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> This top coat dries incredibly fast and makes polish look rich like a gel coat is on. If shines, doesn&#x27;t dull quicly, keeps the color bright. Nest price, top shelf. Buy this!</li>
            <li> Great price for great products, it doesn&#x27;t get better than that! Seche Vite is one of best top coats I&#x27;ve found, I am very satisfied with the products and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot of great things about Seche Vite fast dry top coat and was excited to find such a great deal on it. It came extraordinarily quickly, love that. The product itself is great...as long as I don&#x27;t use a base coat with it. I have crappy nails, easily breaks and peels. I find if I use a base coat with this product, the polish pretty much just peels off within two days. I recently &amp;#34;slapped on&amp;#34; some nail polish without base but still used Seche Vite and my polish lasted almost a week, even with my doing dishes without gloves and normal showering/hand washing. I think that I&#x27;ll no longer use a base (unless it&#x27;s a color I&#x27;m concerned about staining my nails) so I can have nails ready to go in minutes.</li>
            <li> What I received, does not dry as fast as the Seche Vite, i buy from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to think :?</li>
            <li> Great price. Exactly what I wanted. Comes with two bottles and it&#x27;s cheaper than one bottle at my local store!</li>
            <li> I used the fast dry about a week ago..It does keep the polish from chipping. One thing I did find was to remove the polish  with it on takes a remover with close to straight acetone. I have acetone at home and put alot on paper towel had to hold it there for a minute or two to get it off. If you use acetone it will severely dry the nails and skin just use moisterizer right away.</li>
            <li> i am happy becasue the perso i bought it for loves it and was very happy to receive it. it does dry very quickly s</li>
            <li> Does dry very fast but does not keep the polish from wearing off by the second day. I expected more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the rave reviews people give this stuff.  I have tried it with several different base coats, nail polishes, even tried glitter polish which is usually like glue, and everything has chipped WITHIN ONE DAY.  I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat in all the land.  I have tried so many other brands and I always come back to this.  It dries so quickly and looks like glass.  I have people ask me almost daily if it is gel.  Love, love love.</li>
            <li> Best top coat!!!!! Adds lots of shine and long lasting!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat! It dries more quickly than any other I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives a gel-like finish to nail polish without the concerns about UV.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend ordered and used this product and she says she loves it.  It dries her nails in 5 to 10 minutes easy and she can go about her day as if she never painted her nails whereas before she would have to wait multiple hours.  Best top coat ever.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever made. Trust me and stop searching now, just buy this one -- Makes your nails look better than the salon! It dries SOOOO Fast though so be quick about getting it applied. :)</li>
            <li> It peels off like Saran Wrap, no matter how many coats you put on. I bought a clear coat from the dollar store that worked better. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nail Life Speed Demon until it was discontinued. This is an even better product. Will take your nails from sopping wet to hard and dry in 10 minutes flat.  High shine, quick dry awesomeness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed by this product. I use it right after putting on my last coat of color. It dries so quickly! I usually give it 5 minutes. I used to always smudge my nails because I wouldn&#x27;t wait long enough. Goes on thick and shiny. The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t linger once it dries and the bottle is closed. Looks like gel nail quality but comes off with regular nail polish remover. I usually end up with a chip after a couple days but I&#x27;m really hard on my nails and constantly washing my hands.</li>
            <li> It really does work, it dries your nails in about a minute. I was surprised to see the results! Must try!</li>
            <li> This topcoat polish is quick drying, long lasting, and very shiny. The quality is&lt;br /&gt;exceptional. It works well with other nail polishes. I love it.</li>
            <li> Pros:  -Dries fast  -Leaves a nice glossy finish  -Helps my manicure last about 3 days longer than it would without this product    Cons:  -My room reeks of this when I use it, but i get around it by opening up my windows when applying it  -The product thickens up very quickly, but I&#x27;ve solved this by mixing in a few drops of Seche Vite Restore  -Nail polish may \\&quot;shrink\\&quot; when drying, but sealing the tip of your nail helps prevent this from happening    I&#x27;ve tried using other top coats because Seche Vite smells pretty toxic, but nothing dries as fast and keeps my mani looking good for as long. I keep coming back to it because it&#x27;s still the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Seche Vite for my top coat for probably 4-5 years now and it&#x27;s honestly life changing.  My manicures used to get scuffed up and destroyed before they even had time to dry.  I give myself a manicure 2x a week (not because it doesn&#x27;t last, I just get bored easily) and I haven&#x27;t done my nails in years without using this topcoat.  It has a high shine finish and you apply it directly after the nail polish.  Your hands will be dry to the touch within 2 minutes or so and then you can do dishes/normal activities probably within 5 minutes.  Recommendation would be to be light handed when applying as it can go on thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks I would say are 1) the smell (I&#x27;m so used to it by now but it&#x27;s VERY potent/chemical smelling) 2) when you get down to about a quarter of the bottle left it gets extremely gloopy/unusable.  I still stand by this product and have purchased probably close to 50 bottles over the past few years.  You can also buy a large bottle to funnel into the small one if that&#x27;s what you prefer too.  Love Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. Super shiny and last a long time. I will never use another top coat again. This is the best</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better than one?! TWO! Can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re getting two of these bottles for that price! It was too good to believe at first! I&#x27;ve heard so many great reviews on this product compared to other products I was looking at and I just had to try for myself! My nail polish always chips and crack as soon as the day after doing my nails! And I needed something that&#x27;ll put a stop to that! I&#x27;ve tried others that worked but it can&#x27;t get better with this only because of the price! I did my nails three days ago and I don&#x27;t see a chip or crack. I am beyond excited for this! My nail are STILL also super shiny! My friend did her nails at my house also and as soon as she put this polish on, she immediately went on Amazon to purchase it for herself! And it LITERALLY dries within minutes!!!</li>
            <li> i have tried sally hansen, out the door and finally found seche vite... boy, am i glad i did. this top coat is AMAZING! it&#x27;s super shiny, not toooo thin and dries in less than 2 minutes. i will never use another top coat again. love love love it!</li>
            <li> I found this top coat thanks to my nail salon and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else quite like it since that does such an amazing job. My nails last 1-2 weeks while using this top coat and it dries pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Worst polish ever, it always peels off entire nail and all polish at once within like 2 days max. Would not recommend to anyone. Better off going to the dollar store and getting clear coat!</li>
            <li> It works as expected, goes on smoothly and easily and not too thick, and is nice and clear. I don&#x27;t find that it lends additional lasting power over other top coats I&#x27;ve used. It does dry quickly and well--I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;ve just been being very careful about giving my nails plenty of time, or this actually dries faster, but I haven&#x27;t had issues with immediate marring. I use this, give it a few minutes without doing anything with my hands, then put on a few drops of quickdry solution and give it another couple of minutes. The price on this was good, and it&#x27;s no worse than other topcoats, so no regrets about the purchase.</li>
            <li> Best quick dry ever, keep away from cuticles - tends to dry them out. make sure to follow up with cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> Best Topcoat! Great Seller! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I just starting using this product. It gives a great shine and dries really fast. I often do my nails before I go to bed and no smudges when I wake up. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago because it was a good price, but I just got around to using it now. This polish the vendor sent to me is NOT Seche Vite. It barely lasts a few days and the smell is very different from the real product. Waste of money. Order from reputable sources or get it locally.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this, people think I have on gel polish. Produces a long-lasting shine! Will continue to purchase this polish.</li>
            <li> This was my second order. I have gone threw four bottles already. I am hooked. My friend is also hooped. I got her into it too. lol Works perfect. when you paint your nails you don&#x27;t really want to wait for them to dry so you put this on and it works as a fast-dry and top coat. Two in one. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I’ve tried several top coats, but Seche Vite is my preference. It gives a beautiful shine, lasting protection, and doesn’t get hard and tacky in the bottle as other brands have.</li>
            <li> Glossy shiny finish. And the nail polish dries so fast after I put this on top. Great value. It&#x27;s much more expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> i thought it was really pretty.. and then the top coat pealed off? like after about a day it starts to sorta form flappy flaps on the sides and then fall off...</li>
            <li> Love this polish! Never paint my nails without it, and there is no place else that can beat the price! Yay for Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to nail polish and I have tried sooooo many top coats, but this one is my favorite. It goes on smooth and dries super fast. Many people have mistakenly thought that I used gel polishes, when it was really just a regular polish with this on top. GREAT product! I will say, however that this makes a terrible base coat. It didn&#x27;t adhere well to my nails and the first time I went to scratch my arm, my polish popped off in one solid piece. So, great top coat, terrible base coat, lol.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat - have been using it for years!  Leaves the perfect finish and dries quickly.  Most importantly, it really protects the nails.. I&#x27;ve gone two whole weeks without a chip!</li>
            <li> this stuff is very thin, like water.  after putting it on, i couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in glossiness.  sally hansen strengthening top coat is thicker and gives a noticeably glossy depth to any polish.  i read all the 5-star reviews and wanted to try this stuff out, but i won&#x27;t buy it again.  i don&#x27;t care that it dries quickly, as i feel giving oneself a manicure should be a time to relax and not be thinking, &amp;#34;omg, i gotta text one of the people on my contacts, so i hope my nails dry fast.&amp;#34;  sally hansen dries within 30 seconds or so, so i think i can take those few extra seconds to get a better look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also noticed my polish seems to be chipping around the edges.  i am wearing a new revlon matte/glitter combination, so maybe that&#x27;s why, but i have many of those and i haven&#x27;t noticed this happening before with SH.</li>
            <li> This stuff is shiny enough and dries quick.  Thin consistency and the price was very good.  At Sally&#x27;s this runs about 6.99 even 7+.  I received two for the price of one an obvious good buy.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product.. Worth every penny. I was so happy to find it on here for a good price because it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Glossy and dries within 2 minutes.  I do my nails before bed a lot and usually wake up with scratch marks on them even if I had done them 30-60 minutes before bed.  With this topcoat, my nails are dry within minutes.  I also use it several days after the gloss starts to disappear from my manicure to &amp;#34;revamp&amp;#34; my mani.  Worth the money...and getting a 2-pack was great!</li>
            <li> i dont like it. easy to pull of.every time put on then pull off any time. you have to put on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not what i looking for. :-((</li>
            <li> Best top coat. People are always asking my if I have gel nails since they&#x27;re so shiny. Drys super fast as well so you don&#x27;t have to worry much about ruining your nail polish once you add the top coat. On top of that it kind of fills in any small imperfections that you may have. The only thing I would suggest is buying some nail polish thinner as it gets very thick once you use up about half of it.</li>
            <li> This topcoat really is that much better than the others. It dries almost instantly to a finish as shiny and hard as glass.</li>
            <li> You can paint your nails and go to bed 20 minutes later with this top coat!  I have been using it for a year and just bought a replacement bottle.  I also bought 6 bottles for xmas gifts.  My next purchase will be the restore and refill bottle.  Absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re clearly missing out on the best topcoat ever. You need a thicker coat than you&#x27;d think. Also be sure to pull the topcoat over the edge of your nail so that it doesn&#x27;t shrink all weird.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  If you haven&#x27; tried it you should.  It is the best</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my go to for top coat and I was thrilled to find such a great deal! The only down side is that one of the bottles had some black plastic bits around the top of the opening that ended up getting in the actual polish and has already ruined 2 manicures that simply need the final top coat (it applied the black junk in addition to the polish) I have been able to get most of it out and use it... but an unusual bummer for sure!</li>
            <li> Up until I purchased this, I swore by Sally Hansen Insta-Dry in clear, as a topcoat. It wears very well, and doesn&#x27;t chip. When I saw this Seche Vite offer for 2 bottles at a price that seemed too good to be true, I decided to try it. I&#x27;m not sorry! This gives a gorgeous glassy finish, and seems to make glitter polishes sparkle even more. The only con would be the smell. But since it rapidly dissipates, it&#x27;s not really much of a problem. This dries so quickly, it&#x27;s amazing. I have a couple bottles of Insta-Dry to use up, and after that, Seche Vite will be my go-to topcoat.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is absolutely the best I have found at this time. I am sure I will be ordering more. Your service is great! Have a Blessed Day, Rita Norton</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and getting two for this cheap is a steal!</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever.</li>
            <li> The item came in the Seche packaging and with the official pamphlet. I am uncertain why reviewers are stating this is not authentic? It is a good top coat and helps to keep your manicure longer. I am also uncertain why ppl believe it is that it is the get all of top coats. It is certainly better than many and the cheaper brands, but manicures simple normally do not last for two weeks unless they are gel. This helps and is better than most, so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase (better pricing than retail here). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not authentic and I&#x27;m not sure why ppl think that? I use a base coat (unfortunately not sold anymore) that prevents peeling. Stickey is available online so when I run out I will go back to stickey. This is a superior product over most.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best top coats out in the market and if you in most store, costly. 2 bottles and still at a very low cost even if it was one! Who could ask for more.♥♥☺</li>
            <li> The best top cost there is.</li>
            <li> My nail tech recommended this top coat and I absolutely love it. Drys super fast and leaves a nice shiney shellac-like finish!</li>
            <li> Great deal all around</li>
            <li> Love this top coat...not only does it give you an amazing shine but it dries within minutes which is so important to me when you want to do your nails and pretty much get going.  I highly recommend Seche Vite</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat. It is very fast dying and gives a nice shine to any polish.</li>
            <li> Best top coat EVER!! I have only used this brand for about 6 months now but I won&#x27;t go back to another brand. This one dries so fast and I don&#x27;t have to waste much time and get back to whatever I want to do in no time at all.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this product.  Pros: (1) This product dries extremely fast!  In less than 5 minutes (probably closer to 1-2 minutes) you can go about your daily business and not worry about ruining your manicure.  (2) This product goes on very smooth.  Cons: (1) I have used this top coat a handful of times now and I have not noticed a big improvement in the durability of my manicure.  Without a topcoat, my nail polish will stay maybe 1-2 days before chipping; with this topcoat, it lasts about a day longer.  (2) This product has a very strong chemical odor to the point that it may raise concern to some.  Overall a good product, but it&#x27;s greatest strength is by far drying speed over durability.</li>
            <li> This the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever bought. It truly lives up to the hype. Dries nails within a minute and my manicure last much longer. Seche Vite will be the only top coat I&#x27;ll ever use. Amazon had two bottles for the price of less than one at Target with free ship. Bought it now.</li>
            <li> My loves this product. Always order from here.</li>
            <li> It is really shiny which I really like. Only thing is, I decorated my friends nails and added this as a top coat. within a few days the design literally pealed off as if it was a sticker.  I have only had this happen w this nail polish and it has only  happened w her. Otherwise I think I will still buy it when I need it.  the price is right.  delivery was good too.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever invented keeps manicure longer dries SUPER fast like seriously I feel like five min after its dry and I&#x27;m out the door..nails are super shiny even like two weeks into Mani&lt;br /&gt;.love love love!!</li>
            <li> This really is dry fast top coat and it&#x27;s the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I usually do my nails before bed and now I don&#x27;t have to put an extra coat of top coat in the morning when I inevitably get sheet marks on my nails!</li>
            <li> I love this quick dry. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I highly recommend it. It dries the quickest of them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally in love with this product. In fact, I will order a lot more next time! your nails will look fantastic!</li>
            <li> WOW....This thing dry your nails fast, no waiti time needed!</li>
            <li> It is just the best one out there other than the chanel high gloss top coat.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever. Cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat,  I have always had a problem with my polish coming off.  This is like magic put over your regular polish dries super hard and fast. Will make this my go to item/</li>
            <li> This has the most shiny finish I&#x27;ve ever had when using a top coat. I am hard on my nails and this extends the color for up to a week. Only con is when it is about half empty it starts to thicken so I bought the Sech Vite Restore as well to help this.</li>
            <li> One bottle was broken</li>
            <li> I received this 4 days before the estimated delivery date, which is awesome. My only complaint is that the brush is a little weird knob the one I opened. It&#x27;s narrow and all the bristles seem to be stuck together? It&#x27;s still useable, just a tiny thing that I noticed. These are replacements for bottles I already had so I&#x27;m just going to use my old tops, but I did want to mention it. Otherwise, fantastic shipping and spectacular price!!</li>
            <li> The BEST top coat.Dries fast, stays shiny. Doesn&#x27;t chip. Won&#x27;t use any other!</li>
            <li> I got my nails done and loved what she put on my nails. So I got thought I would try it. I saw it on line and the rest was history.&lt;br /&gt;It woulds perfectly. Love the look and feel</li>
            <li> After reading all the glowing reviews I just had to purchase this top coat. Within a few hours of applying, the edges started peeling and developed a milky, matte finish. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my old stand-by...Sally Hansen Double Duty. Stays glossy alot longer.</li>
            <li> A manicure will stay intact for 4-5 days with this top coat. I&#x27;ve even pushed it for 6 days once and it still looked OK.  Warning this stuff STINKS. It is worse than normal nail polish and your nails will stink for hours after you put it on BUT it works better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used, including Sally Hansen Nail Treatment Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat. Seche gives your nails thick protection from chips and scratches. It dries in a minute. I would recommend this to any woman.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It just takes minutes to dry no matter how think the coats of polish are. So glad I stumbled on a video on youtube about &amp;#34;drying nails fast&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it&#x27;s my favorite top coat..dries quickly and seem to help from breakage and chips.</li>
            <li> Hands-down the BEST topcoat I&#x27;ve used in my life...I love love love it!  It dries SUPER quickly, to a HARD finish, not tacky or soft at all.  It makes a huge difference in how my polish holds up against chipping, and it adds a ton of shine to give the perfect finish to my manicures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but the SMELL, my god the smells is just crazy.</li>
            <li> I used to go to bed with my nails dry (or so I thought) until I woke up the next morning and found fabric imprinted nails. If you paint your nails at night you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now immediately after I paint my nails I paint this topcoat on, and it dries it to the touch in about 30 seconds. The high gloss afterwards is just a bonus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glass like topcoat AND it dries your nail polish underneath!  The only reason why I gave this baby 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does smell quite a bit.  For someone with allergies, like me it can be an issue.  Will it make me stop using it? No way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, it dries up really fast! Within a minute, it will be dry to the touch. buy it now!</li>
            <li> always use this topcoat. have given bottles to friends. dries so quickly. protects several coats at a time. (no sheet marks at nite!)</li>
            <li> best top coat for me. I&#x27;ve tried OPI, China Glaze, Sally Hansens, but I love Seche Vite the most! definitely works like magic. Dry tot he touch in seconds!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever. I had to purchase this package deal because I can not run out of this top coat ever.</li>
            <li> not as durable as the last one i got, does not shine as nice</li>
            <li> Love this drys quickly no smudges</li>
            <li> this really do live your nails shinny they are great just one layer and it is nice and thick</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is my favorite top coat.  It dries really fast and leaves a clear and smooth finish.  I like to buy nail polishes and some are better quality than others, but this top coat helps all of them to last much longer.  I got this from Cosmetics Central and they are excellent sellers.  I consider this a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This top coat leaves a brilliant, &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; shine. And it dries very quickly. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: It has a VERY strong odor, and comes with a warning label. Use in a well ventilated place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Apply a thin coat every 2-3 days to keep a brilliant shine! (Great to use with Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat)</li>
            <li> love this product drys fast and makes my nail look like glass</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this top coat for about couple months ago and I run out. This top coat cost in a regular local store about $9-$14 that&#x27;s a lot. So I found this seller in such a good prize so I couldn&#x27;t resist to pursed so far I love this top coat. I got my product very fast and a good condition.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and works great!! It exceeded my expectations as finding a &amp;#34;miracle drying polish&amp;#34; is usually disappointing. I highly recommend Seche Vite dry fast top coat and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I already knew the product. It is an excellent top coat and dryer, the fastest I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend it to anyone that can&#x27;t sit and wait for nail polish to dry, whoever is in a rush or like me, it makes me anxious to sit still without using my hands while polish gets dry.</li>
            <li> i just love seche vite! its truly the best top coat i have ever used! dries nails super fast and keeps polish looking great for weeks!</li>
            <li> I see the pro&#x27;s using this product all the time and when I go to purchase its so high. I was so happy to see a reasonable price, in fact  I got two for the price of one. Will definitely be putting to great use.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat!  Dries very fast and does not chip asap!</li>
            <li> This and Poshe are the only two topcoats I&#x27;ll use when I do my nails. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, very fabulous price!  One bottle of this costs nearly 4x in the store as here on Amazon, very happy to have salon quality.  Best top coat ever (OPI and Essie don&#x27;t stand a chance!)</li>
            <li> This top coat is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. It dries nails pretty quickly and dries through all coats. Though I still wish there was something that would dry my nails faster, this is definitely worth sticking with.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly smooth and high shine as advertised.  It dries fast too.  Quite pleased with the purchase and hope the bottle doesn&#x27;t dry up and become thick after a few uses.</li>
            <li> DRIES SO FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful that nail polish could actually dry so fast and so perfectly but I guess thats why its the professional choice!!</li>
            <li> it makes the nails so nice and with that finish look.. it looks good over top of any color even clear ..</li>
            <li> Definitely best top coat I&#x27;ve used so far. I like to do my nails myself to save money. This topcoat gives a beautiful smooth finish and dries fast. Also my manicure held up chip free for around 5 days which is twice as long as any other top coats. My only reason for giving 5 stars us that it had a very very strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested this product after I complained about my nail polish regularly chipping off my natural nails. I have been impressed with the brilliant shine of this product as well as how nicely it extends the life of my manicures. An added and important bonus has been the lack of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! I have tried them all and this is by far the best.  I have been using it for years and didn&#x27;t know I could get it at such a great price on Amazon...but now I do! Love it.</li>
            <li> Very good top coat. I dont think it dries all that quick but it is better than most regular top coats. The texture is perfect and has great shine. I definitely see why it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> There is not better top coat.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST top coat I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of them!  Dries quickly, super shiny and sturdy.</li>
            <li> i get so many compliments on my &amp;#34;gel manicure&amp;#34;! keeps at home manicure for about a week!</li>
            <li> I buy a stupid amount of nail polish and this is the first time I was ever interested in writing a review on nail polish.  This stuff is AMAZING!!! It makes my nail polish shine beautifully and the best part is that it is dry in less than 5 minutes!  I&#x27;m not even exaggerating at all, this stuff is really awesome!  I always hated painting my nails because waiting for them to dry is the worst but now that problem is completely solved thanks to this great product!</li>
            <li> Best price. Bought one bottle in store for the price of two online. Ver happy with my purchase. Will be buying more when the time calls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had patience. Waiting for my nails to dry is torture. I&#x27;m SO glad to have found this product. I literally can dig around in my purse within 5 minutes and it won&#x27;t smudge at all. Painting your nails before bed is now possible. AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to meet the person who invented this product and buy them dinner.</li>
            <li> Peels off the very next day!  I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It hardens immediately and leaves a thick coat that covers any boo boos with the color coat. I&#x27;ve tried a lot&lt;br /&gt;of different top coats but nothing is as thick and dries as fast as this stuff.  I was happy to find it on line after my local drug store and discount dept store stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> After you do your color give it a moment to dry before applying this top coat. If you don&#x27;t, it will smudge. If you wait, it will go on smoothly and look AMAZING for a day or so. You get the look of professionally done gel nails. It&#x27;s perfect for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day 2, it starts to chip. I have heard people say this lasts for a week straight. Having purchased 5 of these so far I have yet to figure out how to make it last that long without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another down side is that it gets very thick after only a few uses. All of the bottles I&#x27;ve purchased got about 4 uses out of them before the coat got thick and rubbery. There probably are tricks for avoiding that or fixing it. Having used other products before - I will go with another brand that won&#x27;t require me to deal with fixing a 90% full bottle. This should not be happening this early.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this top coat. Makes my .97 cent nail polish look like a salon manicure.</li>
            <li> Love Seche Vite! Always works for me.</li>
            <li> I bought 10 bottles of Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat to give as gifts.  Each bottle arrived in its own box.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product!  I apply a coat twice a week to maintain my mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> I got this because my four year old can never sit still long enough to let her nail polish dry when I paint her nails. This works awesome and dries super quick! The only downfall, is sometimes it changes the polish color slightly. :(</li>
            <li> love this top coat; I&#x27;ll probably never use anything else. great deal by the seller. no complaints.</li>
            <li> I never wear nail polish without this topcoat. This topcoat dries so fast, and prevents my nail polish from messing up. I recommend this topcoat to everyone who wears nail polish.</li>
            <li> I cannot be without this product. It truly dried fast and to a fantastic shell. So essential for adding nail art or embellishments.</li>
            <li> Greatest top coat I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews and this now my favorite top coat. Tip: Don&#x27;t let the brush touch your nails, let that ball of polish on the brush do the work, just use the brush to guide the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34;. (I heard this tip only in one other place and it made a difference). Delivery was quick as well!</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I use and to get a twin pack for the price of one single bottle is a steal. This top coat is 90% dry after 5 minutes. It&#x27;s perfect to use when your in a rush and only have a few minutes to spare for drying.</li>
            <li> This arrived all cracked, and there seemed to be NO WAY of contacting anyone to return it! When I tried, it said that because of hazardous issues, I am unable to send them back, but I coudln&#x27;t get a hold of anyone who would give me a refund. I took a picture of the broken bottles but it was of no use because I am still unable to be in contact with anyone.</li>
            <li> It is the one and only perfect gloss and lasting top coat. I had always used this in the past because it was always glossy for entire time until wanting a color change. I could alwsys depend on it.</li>
            <li> I have stopped getting my nails done because this nail polish covers all imperfections. I get asked where I do my nails all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this because it is super glossy and dries REALLY fast. I hate painting my nails then having to wait for an hour or two before I can safely do anything without ruining my manicure. This top coat will have your nails dry and ready to go in a flash! Buy this!!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Cheap. So very cheap. One bottle of Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat at my local Target is like $8!! I&#x27;d much rather buy it off here where I can get two for the price of one!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this is exactly like the real one so I know it&#x27;s not a fake!</li>
            <li> I got 4 of this top coat and I got all four. The us is not a scam!</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I bought this brand of top coat. It totally lives up to it&#x27;s name. This is by far, the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever owned and used. It makes my nails look salon professional and they last for a really long time even though I am very hard on my nails. This is a must have for everyone who does their nails.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It dries super fast and hardens well. Don&#x27;t put too many layers on, though, because it will peel easily..</li>
            <li> as expected and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Excellent product, dries in seconds and gives you a professional finish.</li>
            <li> this is the only top coat that keeps my polish from chipping</li>
            <li> Dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smear nail polish and works great for getting nail rhinestones to stick down. I can paint my nails, let dry like 2 minutes, put this on and dig around in my purse 1 minute later and not a smudge to be had .. no kidding !! This is worth every penny and then some.  If you are looking for a good , fast drying top coat to make your life easier, don&#x27;t even hesitate in buying this !!!!</li>
            <li> Love it and will purchase again. Especially liked the FREE SHIPPING!!</li>
            <li> amazing stuff, leaves polish shiny and makes mani and pedi last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff ! It really works :-)</li>
            <li> I all ready used and its a great product</li>
            <li> I know this product is amazing. I never use any other top coat.  Best ever!! Dries almost immediately.  Strong. Chip resistant.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because both brushes were stiff and unusable.</li>
            <li> Best fast-drying topcoat ever!!! Believe me ive used tons of brand and not one of them beats this product or the price!</li>
            <li> Super great buy!! Fast shipping and great product!!! I love the glossy finish!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly which is great since I&#x27;m always remembering it as I&#x27;m going out the door!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own manicures and pedicures at home for years now, which means I have tried many different products, and this has become my absolute favorite topcoat hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the type of person that loves to change my polish on a whim, which means I often do not have a lot of time to wait for the nail polish to dry before leaving the house. Since I started using Seche Vite, I don&#x27;t have to worry if I only have a few minutes, because my nails are completely dry within 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topcoat is nice and thick and leaves such an amazing layer of gloss, I have never found another product that comes close to giving me this type of flawless finish on my nails. I rarely get any chipping or smudging and my manicures last for over a week easily. One tip that I have is to be sure to &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; your nails with the topcoat, meaning make sure you use the brush to wrap the tips of your nails and apply the topcoat to the undersides of your nails as well. I do this every time and think it is greatly responsible for the long wear that I get out of each manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always recommend Seche Vite to everyone, this is my holy grail topcoat!</li>
            <li> THIS THE BEST TOP COAT EVER.</li>
            <li> Great product at a super price!</li>
            <li> This is a very fast dry for your nails.  I use a gel on top of it and it saves so much time.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat EVER. It dries each layer of polish if you put it on when they&#x27;re all still kind of wet. Just don&#x27;t press down when you drag the brush on your nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and do a lot of nail art. Not only does this top coat not smear my nail art when I apply it but it also dries very fast which is a plus since I don&#x27;t like waiting forever for polish to dry. It has a wonderful clear as glass finish too and I was happy to find it in a 2 pack which was more economical. Now I can always have a spare bottle handy so I can be sure not to run out!</li>
            <li> this is the best clear coat ever.  These two bottles represent the fifth and sixth I&#x27;ve purchased. It dries super fast and prevents polish from streaking onto paper.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING and WORTH IT. Just finished ordering another 2 pack and the &amp;#34;Seche Plus&amp;#34;. Haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle and ordering more so that I won&#x27;t run out! Keeps my nail polish protected, DOES NOT CHIP, dries in a complete 2 minutes or LESS, my nails have been a lot stronger and has a vibrant shine to it that lasts as well. This is deff a 10 star product!</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. Put it over any type of color, it will last for three days plus. This is washing bottles and dishes every day, dealing with two kids, typing and teaching. I&#x27;ve seen it last up to two weeks!</li>
            <li> A product that does what it says. No more smudged nails for me. I am very greatful that a coworker introduced me to this product. Try it; you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great product- as if I bought from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> i received these so quickly, and they were exactly what i ordered. i am pretty pleased with the product, it dries really quickly, but the downfall is that is does chip in a day, it&#x27;s not a really good topcoat, other than the fact that it «seche» really quick. Perfect if you are a nail polish freak (like me) that changes them every 2 days</li>
            <li> Best Top Coat and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This top coat did not disappoint! It leaves a very shiny finish that is extremely chip resistant. One star marked off because the formula seems to thicken after each use. It still performs as expected and dries really fast once applied. Overall, I would recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> Nothing else dries your nails as fast as Seche Vite! Applied to wet polished nails, it holds your polish intact many days longer than other quick dry products.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat ever!!! Makes my polish last for at least a week or more. Love how it drys very fast also!</li>
            <li> Just received my order and had to try it out. This polish is amazing. I am pleased with the product and will buy it again. My nails were dry within a couple of minutes and they look beautiful!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to wait around for my nails to dry. I have tried other products that say they dry fast - but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results. I recommend this product you will be pleased!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used and I was thrilled to find this 2-pack for such a great price! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is the best top coat product i have ever bought.  as soon as you put this over your nail polish, your nails are dry within seconds.  they are also very smooth feeling.  the nail polish does not chip and does not need any touchups.  i paint my nails once a week and the polish lasts for the entire week.  i love this product</li>
            <li> After using this top coat, manicure does not last long....But manicure dries faster with this.</li>
            <li> Best clear nail polish ever even when you mess up your nail polish put this on top and it makes your nails look great</li>
            <li> Best top coat out there! Prevents from chipping, helps dry nails fast and keep your manicure perfect! I recommend getting the Seche Vite thinner to use because when this bottle reaches the halfway mark, it starts to get goopy.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! Dries super fast!</li>
            <li> used over acrylics and standard polish works like a champ! Polish lasted one week on tips prior to being worn off</li>
            <li> Shiny,  quick drying,  highly protective!</li>
            <li> I do love this top coat! I think it really helps prolong the life of my manicure and I try to use it every other day. I&#x27;ve gone chip free for up to a week so far!</li>
            <li> My favorite fast drying top coat. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Finally, that same SHINE that you get at the salon! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of other top coats, including Essie and OPI, but everything dried dull or bubbly until this. Now my pedis look as though I had them done professionally. So, so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is THE BEST!  I type a lot and a thick coat of this stuff goes a long way.  It makes the polish extra shiny.&lt;br /&gt;It gets thick and hard to get out towards the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat and the way it seals in the polish. I can literally feel it seeping in through out my entire nail polish. I would highly recommend this product. Be sure to go to there website first to learn how apply the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 4 years now. I love how fast it drys the only draw back is when you get down to a quarter of a bottle to starts to turn into glue.</li>
            <li> My fave top coat. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price!!</li>
            <li> I love this Top Coat, dry iyour nails in minutes..</li>
            <li> Works great, makes my polish last a lot longer! Just make sure you follow directions;) plus I got 2 bottles here for the same price as just one at Walmart?! That&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Ordered this along with a couple of other nail products. UPS had made a mistake with shipping, I contacted amazon they told me the vendor would contact me in 2-3 business days. Well even better I called amazon on a Friday, the vendor contacted me on Friday and had the nail polish to my house on Saturday (the next day). Now that is amazing customer service &amp; for that I give lots of credit and will buy from this vendor, along with recommend it to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now to the actual product painted my nails yesterday and usually I have a chip already the day of or the next day of manicure. Happy to say no chips, nail polish dries fast, shiny, and looks like a gel manicure without the bad side effects of an actual gel manicure. I am anxious to see how long this manicure will last me!</li>
            <li> I am currently using and enjoying this Seche Vite nail polish product. It was exactly what i wanted and more</li>
            <li> I love this top coat!  Seche Vite dries the nail polish super fast and leaves a nice shiny smooth surface.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the only top coat I will purchase.  I&#x27;ve tried many others but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in search of a top coat that dries fast and doesn&#x27;t end up with sheet marks the next day.  This one works.  I can paint my nails at night and wake up with no sheet marks.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is $10.99 at my local Ulta store. This price is unbeatable. I do highly recommend you purchase the Seche Vite Restore too. When this product is halfway used up its very thick and goopey. The restore acts as a paint thinner and restores it to its original state. I&#x27;ve purchased Seche Vite from this seller for months on end now and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> After polishing my nails with a base coat and applying 3 coats of nail polish, I then applied this quick dry topcoat and within minutes it was dry to the touch.. fabulous</li>
            <li> These are the only top coats I use after trying multiple kinds.  I use them over my China Glaze or Orly nail polishes, but they also work well on other kinds like Milani.</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I&#x27;ve found that lasts more than 24 hours without chipping! Love this stuff. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Though I am a fan to Seche products this one didn&#x27;t really work well for me. I read in previous reviews that after application in just a few short seconds/minutes that your polish wouldn&#x27;t smudge and is touchably dry, this DID NOT happen for me and I&#x27;ve used this product over and over (using just 1 thin coat or 2 coats). I&#x27;ve experienced using this product and even hours after it still smudged.</li>
            <li> It really works great!!!  I DO RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it is a perfect topcoat. It really does dry rock hard in just a few minutes - forget those pricey gel manicures. My nails actually grow out before the manicure chips. It&#x27;s best to use it when your nail color is still tacky and you use a REALLY THICK coat of Seche Vite. I even give it as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Good quality quick dry topcoat. One of the best.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly. It is the best top coat ever! I have tried others and no other compares! Try it! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> great product.  Prefer this brand to others.  Quick drying and nice shine finish.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It makes my nails look so shiny, it lasts and it also dries my nails fast.</li>
            <li> Oh Seche Vite.  I want to love you so much, but I have trouble getting over how after I get to the middle of the bottle, you turn into some thick, gloppy, unusable product.  I know there is something you can buy to thin it back out, but I don&#x27;t want to buy a product for my product.. I just want my product to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love, however, how quick you dry, the smoothness of your coat, and the lack of air bubbles you induce into my manicure.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. Dries super fast and has an amazing shine, like a piece of glass layered over your nails. This was an amazing deal, $9 for 2. I definitely see one bottle priced quite high where I am. I highly recommend. 5/5 rating.</li>
            <li> Great product and dries your nails within 15-20 minutes of application.  I usually sit around for 30 minutes to give it ample time to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this topcoat for about a year already and haven&#x27;t gone to anything else. With a store membership it&#x27;s 6.99 a bottle at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and 9.99 at Ulta Beauty Stores. I use a bottle a month so this is definitely a cheaper alternative. It came two days before the estimated delivery date and I was very pleased about that. I was also pleased with the care of how the package was delivered. I got it in a very sturdy brown cardboard box and it had stuffing inside so it wouldn&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will definitely be purchasing again in the future and referring people to this seller.</li>
            <li> Works great to quick dry my toenails and protect the polish longer than without it.  Also evens out any sloppy brush marks...</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite top coat.  It goes on so easily and doesn&#x27;t bubble.  It&#x27;s also a great way to keep your manicure looking new.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t like Seche Vite because of the shrinkage, but I think that is a small price to pay for the high gloss shine and the quick drying time.  This is my go to top coat.</li>
            <li> I change my nail polish usually once a week, my nails are always painted and this is my all time favorite top coat. It drys super quick and is super shiny. With this top coat, the longest my polish had lasted was a week and half to almost two without chipping at all. I also love using this whenever I do any nailart, the colors are more vibrant after I paint on a top coat.</li>
            <li> best product out there! great value for 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> Shiny and dries fast.  Doesn&#x27;t change the color of your polish. Love it.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff all of the time...It&#x27;s the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve been buying my own nail polish since 1999 in high school!  I buy a LOT of nail polish and hair stuff and could open my own nail shop, so hopefully that can give you some insight into how much I actually have.  Just did my nails two days ago and put this on as the top coat, as usual...I might submit a picture if I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff and don&#x27;t understand what others must be doing wrong not to love it as well.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever. I will always use this top coat. Drys so fast. Glad I bought two whole bottles. :)</li>
            <li> I like this stuff! It was recommended by a co worker who is a former nail designer. It is one of the fastest drying top coat ever!! It does seem to peel off easily though. Does not last more than about 4 days. I use my hands alot too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish!!! It dries soooo fast!!! No nicks in my polish, no smudging , no nothing perfectly dried nails in 5 min or less!! It&#x27;s soo shiny and I&#x27;m just in love :)</li>
            <li> very pretty gloss, over bland nail polish.</li>
            <li> This really kept my nails in good shape for about a week and two days. No chipping and its hard to chip with this top coat. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this. I use this after each coat of nail polish and it dries in just a few minutes. Its the best I have ever used. I can do my nails in just over an hour now, it no longer takes hours. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Best Top Coat I have ever used in my life. Also, very very cheap price compared to the commercial price</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by how this topcoat performs.  I have had it on my toes for five days with no chips or cracks and it is still extremely glossy without any touchups.  I usually polish my nails every other day (I get bored quickly) and in less than five minutes my polish is completely dry and ready to work.  It takes a little longer if I add decals or do ombre designs but it still dries to a high gloss and is a super protective coat.</li>
            <li> Makes polish shine and I use good polish which this helps only make it look better. I tried this out and tried it and i&#x27;m hooked, your polish wears longer, use it under and after your last coat put on a coat of it. Try one you may find you like it just as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to by mistake since I palce and order for same product the same time. I like this product so much that I dicided not to return it</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product since I tend to always mess my nail polish because I hate waiting for it to dry. This stuff dries very fast!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quick quick quick quickdry - this is it! My all time favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Dries really shiny also!</li>
            <li> This topcoat is soooo shiny!!! Dries super fast, love it.</li>
            <li> I will only use this top coat it is hands down the best one out there.  Makes my nails look awesome and it brings out a nice shine in the color.</li>
            <li> excellent product, my manicure lasted 4 weeks on natural nails, with no nicks.  Would definitely recommend to others.  Doesn&#x27;t matter which nail brand that is used, the product holds onto the color.</li>
            <li> Great shine and manicure seems to last longer.  Make sure you apply it evenly or else it will show.  Fast drying as well.  Did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews of this product and heard people saying it worked well. I couldn&#x27;t agree more. I can paint my nails and be free to do whatever I need to get done within 20 minutes without ever messing up my polish.</li>
            <li> Love that it dries nails super fast but has a horrible smell. Also, i was taken aback by the warning label in the back of the bottle which states he can cause reproductive problems and not to use if pregnant! So with that being said use caution ladies!!</li>
            <li> If you paint your nails. You need this fast drying top coat. It is simply the best and will enhance your paint job.</li>
            <li> Nice top coat. Nail polish lasts an extra couple of days with it. Dries fast.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  Strange texture goes on pretty thick.  Something about this Seche Vite is different from the one I purchase at full price</li>
            <li> Item arrived sooner than expected and just what I wanted. Great price!</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat.  Get the restorer to be able to uses every last drop.  Dries in minutes.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful.  it dried faster than I expected and leaves a high gloss shine for days.  Great find.  Thanks,</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I said to myself, \\&quot;It cant be that good.\\&quot;  It really is.  My nails are dry in a matter of minutes, very few minutes.  I know that some of the ingredients are supposedly harmful, but I use it anyway.  I&#x27;m not using it everyday, so hopefully no harm will come from it.  Other than that, this topcoat is amazing.</li>
            <li> it dries nice and fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, for 20 years. Never knew about this until last year when I&#x27;d read someone mention it in a nail polish review. Bought it and I&#x27;ve never looked back. Dries your polish in under 5 minutes and leaves a great shiny gloss finish. Also keeps your polish on longer than usual - I can easily go a week or longer without one little chip (and I have a 4 and 2 year old and am a SAHM so my hands get beat up all day and night...lol). Will never use another one again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do my nails without this stuff anymore. I take it to the nail-salon with me, too.</li>
            <li> I have use this top coat for years and I really like it since its fast drying, which is a time saving. :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat because it dries fast and leaves a super shiny finish.&lt;br /&gt;I took advantage of this great deal of 2 bottles rather than a single. Will purchase&lt;br /&gt;again.</li>
            <li> It was here fast and works like a charm. This not only gives your polish a great shine, it makes it totally smudge free!</li>
            <li> after i started using this product my nails become much stronger, it took care of ridges, nail polish lasts longer and DRIES UP IN SECONDS</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used and I will be purchasing this product religiously from now on! It is incredibly fast drying, (true to its name), and leaves you with a nice, resilient, high gloss finish that lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> This top coat is my #1 go-to nail product. It delivers on high shine, long lasting chip protection, and most importantly, speedy drying! I had a friend try to convince me recently that the $20 bottle of Debra Lippmann&#x27;s Addicted to Speed is even better, so I sprang for it and was highly disappointed. While that product doesn&#x27;t suck, I truly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better and often found my polish peeling off because it was so thick. Seche Vite is the perfect top coat for ladies in the know who do nails often and want the best product and bang for their buck!</li>
            <li> Whats not to love about this top coat?! It is so shiny, looks like I got a professional manicure every time, and it dries faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I really enjoy doing my nails once or twice a week, and this topcoat has made it even more fun cause they always look so good after! MUST TRY for anyone who likes doing their nails!</li>
            <li> These things are $10 EACH at Target, LOVE this deal.  It shipped quickly and arrived in tact.  I will be buying this again and again as long as it&#x27;s this cheap!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve used quite a few different quick drying top coats, and Seche Vite is hands down the best. I usually use a good regular top coat over my polish, then after a minute top it with Seche Vite. In a few minutes I can go about my day and not worry about smudging my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;After using several bottles of this top coat, I noticed that once you get down to about 1/4&amp;#34; of product in the bottle, you might as well throw it away. It thickens up and starts to &amp;#34;spiderweb&amp;#34; when you&#x27;re applying it. I&#x27;ve tried thinning it with some acetone, but it doesn&#x27;t really help. I still use Seche Vite every time I polish my nails, and will continue to buy it. It truly is the best quick dry top coat I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing about Seche Vite for a while now and thought my friends were exaggerating its amazing qualities. Well, here I am to admit that I was so wrong!  It does dry amazingly fast, that alone makes it worth it since 9 out of 10 times I have painted my nails in the past, I&#x27;ve managed to smudge, dent, or mess them up in some way before they dry all the way. And yeah, it somehow makes the polish dry all the way to the nail really fast so I truly did not get a single dent mark even with a layer of base coat, two layers of color, and the seche vite on top.  Even better, two days later and I don&#x27;t have a single chip, something that my clumsy and constantly typing self has never managed before.  I&#x27;m in loooove! The only thing about it that might be negative is that it does have a strong paint chemical smell that&#x27;s different from regular nail polish, but it goes away quickly so I can&#x27;t bring myself to dock it a star for that. So, whether you&#x27;re impatient, clumsy, or just want to prolong the life of your manicure, get this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would cut down on my manicure / pedicure dry time and Sec he Vite fast dry was mention on UTube with rave reviews so I purchased 2 bottles. I cut my drying time to seconds, it drys  very fast which is great for pedicures, you can put on full cover shoes and no smugging. The shine is high gloss,it makes your polish stand out. It does crystalize and evaporate so the Sec he Vite Restore is a must. But this product is fantastic and yes,yes,yes I will be purchasing  more,love it.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast and gives nails a glossy shine. It is very smooth to put on and it doesn&#x27;t smear nail polish. It&#x27;s a must buy for nail polish lovers!</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat made.  (in my opinion, of course).  Have used it for a number of years and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I love the Dry Fast Top Coat because it has such a beautiful shine and of course, it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times now and I love it. It dries super fast. Within 30 to 45 minutes my nails are completely dry. And it makes my nails feel smooth like glass. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with chipping or shrinkage or anything like that. I absolutely love it and it will be my go to top coat from now on.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this. Dries fast and protects polish.</li>
            <li> Great stuff an fast delivery</li>
            <li> Best top coat around!! Nice and shine that last!! Dries quickly and easy to use!! I usually use Revlon quick dry but i think this has stole my top coat heart!! Nice deal too!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out this. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever made, and you can&#x27;t beat this price anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend introduce me to this product and I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives our nails a bright shinny gloss and dry fast too.</li>
            <li> I really like how fast Seche Vite dries. I go through a lot of top coats because I do my own nail designs and I&#x27;m doing my nails at least every other day. My only complaints about Seche is that it does cause polish shrinkage so it looks as if you have tip wear the next day. It also becomes very goopy half way through the bottle. But once you add Seche Restore, it&#x27;s usable again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I rarely have time to just sit and wait for my nails to dry. Now I don&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li> this polish will help dry your polish fast but after a day it will chip sometimes within the same day. Use good polish when you use this polish.</li>
            <li> I would not be without this top coat. It dries so doggone quickly, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  No more bed sheet impressions on my newly manicured nails.  It shines beautifully, too.</li>
            <li> Fast-drying, brilliant top coat!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A SUPER DEAL. CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE.  PRODUCT WORKS GREAT ON NAILS AND I WOULD REOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO DOES NAILS FOR A GREAT TOP COAT.</li>
            <li> I love this Seche Vite.... I normally purchase it from Sally&#x27;s beauty Supply and it runs me about $8 a bottle and I got 2 for like $8... Omg will definitely buy again from here!</li>
            <li> After using Sally Hansen Insta Dri for several years, I decided to give this product a try after reading so many rave reviews.  I painted my nails 9 days ago using:  CND Stickey as the basecoat, Butter London polish, and this product as the topcoat.  I am blown away by how great my nails still look!  I type heavily at the office and due to that, the tips of my nail color are slightly faded, but again, I&#x27;m certain this is due to my heavy typing activity.  With Sally Hansen Insta Dri, my nail polish would begin chipping by day 4.  I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only top coat i will use. I got my boss hooked on it too ! It does get goopy after awhile but thats mostly when its almost empty, for me, and i just rebuy it. It dries super fast and no bubbles ! Love it and will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I have purchased similar products as such in the past. This item is truly recommended. Dries very fast. Makes manicuring very easy.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is by far the best topcoat you will ever use. you will not regret this purchase. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing in so many ways! It dries very quickly which helps eliminate smudges. It also has a superior shine finish that last for at least a week. I&#x27;ve tried many top coats because I polish my nails three or four times a week to change the color. This one is by far the best one and it&#x27;s cheap! I will never use another top coat.</li>
            <li> This absolutely dries fast, but the quick dry makes it chip a little easier and faster. Definitely lives up to its instant done nails, but you have to do them every 2 days or be really gentle to keep them from automatically peeling off.</li>
            <li> I am right handed and notice that most of the chipping happens on that hand. I wash dishes by hand 1 or 2 times a day and I shower nightly, scrubbing my scalp because I have oily scalp. So I am thinking this might be why. Also, I don&#x27;t have long nails... I keep them short... so this means I can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t wrap the seche vite under my nail or on the tip... because I don&#x27;t have tips.</li>
            <li> Product is a little disappointing in that it is hard to keep off cuticles and peels easily.  Nice shine though!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this top coat, it seriously dries in less then a min and stays on for a long time with good nail polish under it.</li>
            <li> Always love the fast  way this dries. It is always glossy and you can touch it in 1 minute. Thoroughly dries in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much I bought my mom some for Christmas. It glides on smooth- love the actual brush itself and it dries so fast! I&#x27;ve also noticed it helps your polish last longer than say Essie or Opi</li>
            <li> By far the best top coat I have ever found to make a manicure last. I&#x27;ve gotten up to a week of chip free polish using Seche Vite and have already recommended it to many of my girlfriends. It leaves the nails very smooth and glossy and enhances the look of every polish. Great product and a great deal for the 2 pk.</li>
            <li> I think this is probably the 5th bottle of this I have bought.  I love it, I don&#x27;t use any other top coat out there.  I have to paint my nails about every other day and I couldn&#x27;t do it without Seche Vite!  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> i wont use anything else.  i even bring this with me when i go to the nail salon.  It dries SO quickly and lasts maybe a day or 2 longer than my manicure used to</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! You can paint your nails with as many coats as you want and then apply this top coat and it dries so quickly and really prevents any impressions or smudges you might get hours later from towels or bed sheets etc. I have never found a product that works this great at keeping my nails looking like I got them done at a salon! I 100% recommend this product, it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me and this is my second purchase.  I bought the little bottle first.  I loved it so much, had to get more, so got the bigger size and the restorer as well.  I paint my nails with a base coat, two coats of color, a coat of Fast Dry, then a coat of glitter, and another coat of Seche Vite Dry Fast.  In only a few minutes, I am able to do anything without messing up my nails.  It is the best ever.  And, my nails last for a week or more.  I wash dishes by had every day and do other cleaning and sewing. I recommend this to anyone who does their own nails and wants a nice look all week long.  I tell everyone who comments on my nails about Seche Vite.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat out there. I bought a bunch and gave them as Christmas gifts to all girlfriends. They all said it was one of the best Christmas gifts they got!! It dries SO fast!!!</li>
            <li> I will add this on anytime I get a delivery.  I was a manicurist years ago when this product first showed up on the shelves and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since  You can do your toes and crawl in to bed within 20 minutes and no sheet marks.  Since I bought it for my 3 teenage nieces to share, they hoard and hide it, so I now have to buy it for all 3 so the half price deal on Amazon is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is the best.  Been using it for years.  It does get think though and I have to buy a new ones before I use it up but I don&#x27;t do my nails often and it&#x27;s worth it when I need it I just buy another because I can keep a manicure for a week even with washing dishes</li>
            <li> This polished caused me to throw away all of my glaze polish. Once this seche vite would dry, air pockets would form under my nail polish causing the Polish to popped off like it was a fake nail! I did use it as my base coating polish at times.</li>
            <li> This product dries fast with a shiny coat even with multiple layers. I plan to purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting. Excellent price!</li>
            <li> Best product I have found out there so far.  I used to have my nails done, don&#x27;t anymore but this product is excellent for drying top coat of your polish very fast just like you came out of a salon. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, helps protect your polished nails and/or provides a high gloss clear coat.  Excellent product, would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat. It goes on smoothly, and dries really fast. It puts a great shine on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is truly the absolute best top coat you can buy. It makes your nails look like you got them proffesionally done! Why I always order this and use it when I paint my nails, is because you can literally put it on immediately after you put on your colored nail polish, maybe wait 10-15 minutes at most, and you nails are completley dry, no bubbles, no risk of messing up your nails. The best part is is that this shines like no other. It makes your nails look so glossy, just like after you get your nails done. It also help to fix any messups you may have made with your colored nail polish, because once you apply this on top, it smooths everything out to perfection. If you do your own nails, and want them to look like you got them done at a salon, you need to get this right now.</li>
            <li> mine experience was good!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, all the great reviews are true.  You can get a week + out of it no matter what polish you use underneath!!!  Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Nails dry fast!  Wish I would have known about this stuff a long time ago.  And with the Seche Clear Base Coat my nails stay nice for almost two weeks!</li>
            <li> This is one product that I simply can&#x27;t live without.....it drys my nails immediately, and since I am often adding an extra coat of polish as I go out the door, it&#x27;s absolutely essential to have the nails dry quickly.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent top coat.  At first I was spreading it too thin.  This is made to be applied thickly over WET nails.  Directions say to have a bead on the tip of the brush.  I let the large drip fall off and then use without wiping any off.  Apply immediately after two coats of polish. If you have made a boo boo on one of the nails, this will somehow smooth most of those out and dry so you would never know it.  (Huge mishaps, I don&#x27;t know about)  Seems strange, but it is formulated to blend with the wet polish and will form a very nice finish.  Love the shine and it does protect my thin, splitting and peeling nails.  My manicure will last five days unless I am careless about protecting my hands and it  could be longer for some.  I use gloves for dishwashing and protective gloves for yard work.  Just common sense practices will pay off with longer lasting polish.  Directions are in the box and it is necessary to read and follow them if you are new to the product.  Just a slight learning curve then you will be so happy with this one.  I got an excellent price on two bottles - one for me and one for a friend.  My nails are looking better than they have in years.  Happy, happy.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat and it dries fast!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been doing my own mani&#x27;s for a long time, and more recently have been doing lot of VERY detailed nail art icluding use of gems, studs, decals, etc. The nail art is a lot of work that I would like to last longer than a few days. I use OPI Nail Envy as base coat, regular nail polish, then seche vite top coat with excellent results. Mani&#x27;s usually last 5-7 days and I&#x27;m an RN in an ICU washing hands a gazillion x/day using alcohol hand gel AND soap &amp; water. This topcoat dries fast, doesnt streak or shrink,  stays shiny and protects my tiny artwork on nails! This is my HG of topcoats. Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> Amazing and fast shipping!! Love love the polish!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My nails dried fast and looked really good. I will purchase more Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> They use this in my salon and I had to get some.  Not only does it dry fast it is very shiny.  I use it every couple of days to keep my manicure/acrylic nails fresh looking.  You don&#x27;t need to pay the exorbitant cost of gel nails ($35 for plain in my area every two weeks)  if you put this over your regular polish frequently.  This price for two bottles is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it. Gives my nails a nice gloss and I love that it helps dry the polish faster! The polish sometimes chips after a day or two, but then I work in retail!</li>
            <li> yes, love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to quick dry nails- oils, ice water, drying drops, sprays, and many &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; topcoats. None of them have worked as well as Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an amateur, I stamp my an my daughters&#x27; nails using various store bought polishes. Seche Vite dries multiple coats to a good hard finish within 5-10 minutes. Seriously, I&#x27;ve changed my clothes and done my hair within 20 minutes of finishing my nails, no gouges. I&#x27;ve gone to bed 30 minutes after and NO hair or pillowcase marks in the morning! I got 2 bottles for less than $9...well worth it!</li>
            <li> Great what I expected</li>
            <li> great service and great product</li>
            <li> I should have known better when they offered two bottles for the price of one.  While this product does dry quickly, it starts peeling off on the first day.  I gave it three tries -- having to remove it all and then reapply it three days in a row before I finally gave up.</li>
            <li> Love this quick dry it my fav at a great deal. I had to give it to friends and now they love it</li>
            <li> Gives a wonderful look and amazing shine to any manicure.  Not to be used over gel polish or it will just peel right off.  Brings back the shine of a new pedi even after being on the beach and in the water.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this topcoat considering the low price of it. It dries fast and glossy. The only bad thing about this product is the smell is a bit stronger compare to my other topcoat such as Poshe and Julep freedom.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Really fast drying, indeed! And the gloss is very nice as well! Good size of bottle for home use and perfect price promotion for 2 bottles! Thank you!</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best top coat ever and the fast drying is awsome I mean I was really wow away when it dryed less then 4seconds not a little dry fully dryed in second an I have ben doing nails for a while now about 8yr an still never had a product to keep it promise an not just say it to sell I love it so much I buying 6more bottles.im inlove with this fast drying top coat is so shiny I just love it :)</li>
            <li> Amazing! It used to take all day for my nails to dry, and now they dry super fast!</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like rubber cement or something - as soon as I opened it I was like oh yes, this is going to be good. Turns out it lives up to its smell! I am obsessed and will not go back to any other top coats.</li>
            <li> ilove this nail polish! helps my nail polish dry super fast! and always makes it have a perfect shine! i recommend</li>
            <li> great dried fast looks shiney would purchase again</li>
            <li> great price, quick delivery</li>
            <li> Great product.  Been using for years.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Advertised as the best top coat and it is.  This stuff feels absolutely wonderful on the nail and maintains my polish.</li>
            <li> This is THE best fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! I love Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my manicure last about a week. I am a busy mom who is constantly submerging my hands in water and scrubbing messes.</li>
            <li> Love this! For sure ordering more.</li>
            <li> This was on the allure&#x27;s top products of 2012 and they were right!  This top coat is holding up really well!  From now on it will be the only top coat that I use - it&#x27;s wonderful and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I always used to smudge my nails because they took so long to dry but with this it barely ever happens any more. And the high gloss finish gives me that fresh from the salon look I love &lt;3!! Now I can slather on as thick a coat of polish as I want and not have to worry about the time it will take to dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is miraculous, straight up. I have never really been one to use a top coat, but since I moved in to a stone age apartment with no dishwasher, my manicures have been lasting between 2-3 days, tops. Since I usually use more expensive polishes, I hate to go through them so quickly. My friend recommended this stuff to me, and I had just finished a really cool \\&quot;galaxy manicure\\&quot; when it came, and I wanted it to last. I put 2 coats of seche vite on. I have to say here that it did NOT dry quickly for me, but it made that manicure last almost 2 weeks, even with me doing dishes every day, and typing for 9 hours a day. Amazing, and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite lives up to it&#x27;s promises and then some. Really fast drying and superior protection. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat but the smell is almost overbearing. It has such a strong nail polish smell, but it dries almost instantly. You have to really know how to use it, depending on how wet or dry your last polish coat is determines how easy this Seche sticks to it. Sometimes it will wrinkle your polish or smear your designs but with some practice with it, it&#x27;s an awesome top coat.</li>
            <li> Once you go seche, you&#x27;ll never go back....to any other top coat. My tips stay perfect for over a week, especially if I use a good regular polish with it.</li>
            <li> This is a carcinogen so i do no use in my nails, but it is good for small crafts were a clear fast drying adhesive and top coat are needed.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite top coat. Dries fast, strong and lasts for days. If you lose some luster, just throw on another coat. Really prevents chips.  Make sure you keep the bottle opening clean and close up right away.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! 5 mind and I&#x27;m out the door no smudging or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I  have tried many products this is simply  the best bare none.  You can apply this to wet or dry nail polish we the same result.  The nail polish dries quickly with a long lasting high polished smooth shine. It masks any mistakes in your polish applications. You&#x27;ll look as if you just left the manicurist.</li>
            <li> not super amazed but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> The best. must try it.</li>
            <li> Very happy! Haven&#x27;t experienced any shrinkage and applies like a dream. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used! I love painting my nails, and before this top coat I would always end up with smudges. But now I use this top coat and my nails are completely dry in just a couple minutes! I&#x27;ve tried many top coats over the years and this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Best top coat in the universe.  Have purchased bottles for so many friends and they are converts.  Took to nail salon and the tech tried it on her nails (b/c I insist they use this instead of theirs.  I have real nails and this lasts like mad) and the tech called me a few days later and said she ordered it for herself.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for how SUPER FAST it dries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star because once you get to the middle of the bottle the polish hardens and is almost impossible to work with. PLEASE FIX THIS!</li>
            <li> Drys really fast but my nail polish still chips</li>
            <li> love this product, &amp;everythng about it! however, i am one star shy because when i received the product, the brush in one if the bottles wasn&#x27;t applying smoothly. the brush looked kind of stiff &amp;separated. but overall, i do love this top coat!</li>
            <li> The best. Period. It&#x27;s cheap and works.</li>
            <li> Great product! And showed up a week early!</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> This top coat works great!! Can go almost two weeks without redoing my nails.</li>
            <li> The price is better than most stores and it dried very quickly compared to another top coat polish I have. Also found that my nails chip less with this top coat.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Seche Vite Top Coat after so many YouTubers give such high remarks and they are so right. The best top coat I have ever used. My nail polish hasn&#x27;t chipped since I did my manicure a week ago, still looks as fresh as I did the day I did them. Very high gloss and firm finish to protect nails. Love it. Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> This really tops off a manicure.  I take it to the nail salon for a fast drying, glossy, durable top ooat.  My friend borrowed it and will be ordering SecheVite Dry Fast, too.</li>
            <li> Love love love! This is my go-to top coat for all brands of polish! I swear this stuff is magic! Dries all layers quickly, to a smooth gel-like finish.</li>
            <li> Arrived before the estimated time of arrival which is always great to get your products before expected. This product was recommended by a friend and I love how fast it dries so basically there&#x27;s no waiting on your top coat to dry. You can go about your business in about 5 seconds after applying the top coat. The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the strong scent of the polish because I am very sensitive to scents but other than that, LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while now and this is a good deal for 2 bottles.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> If you havent tried this top coat OMG it is so worth the money!! It is the best out there!! I have used it for years. :)</li>
            <li> Best top coat you can buy.</li>
            <li> I really wish I could say that I love this. I can&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t like it even a little. It does dry amazingly fast, but as others have stated, it shrinks your polish and pulls it away from the edges, I even went as far as to polish the edges and tips, but it still pulled. What doesn&#x27;t pull, chips and peels and in big strips. When the shiny strip is peeled away, it leaves a matte finish. I spend a lot of time (and a gross amount of money) perfecting my art work and was crazy mad when my color was pulled away from the tips and cuticles. I did not give it the one star that I feel it deserves, because it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste. My daughter is able to use it for the hard finish. She does not do a lot of art and prefers light colors so she doesn&#x27;t notice the shrink as much as I do with my darker colors. She also has very thin nails that peel and split at the slightest snag or tap and needs something to protect them. She is using this strictly for the hard finish. I may also consider using it to top gems and quickly lock them in place, but will absolutely not be covering my whole nail with it. Like another reviewer, I may also consider it on my pedi.</li>
            <li> came with both just as described. definatly going to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This fast dry top coat is the best! I&#x27;ve only used it on my toes but it took a lot of abuse the day I put it on. I first used a drugstore base coat, two coats of polish (cheap polish) and then waited a minute or two.  Then I put this top coat on.  It went on very easily, no globbing or dragging up my color.  I&#x27;ve used other top coats that set immediately so if you even barely touch it with the brush on your next stroke it globs, this did not - but I worked fast anyway. It was set very quickly.  I took a shower about an hour later and it didn&#x27;t hurt the polish at all.  I wore close toed shoes that night and the polish was still perfect and shiny when I took my shoes off.  It&#x27;s been a week now and my toe polish is still going strong and it is still shiny,  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite top coat. It dries super fast, rock hard and super shiny. Cons are that it smells strongly and it gets thick halfway through the bottle and if you want to thin it you have to buy Seche Restore. Other thinners don&#x27;t work as well. It also has a bad habit of shrinking if you apply it to dry polish and it&#x27;s not 3 free.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I will never use another top coat again. This is perfect for nail stamping because your designs don&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> This product tends to get very thick VERY quickly so getting the seche restore is a must. A couple drops won&#x27;t do it so you have to put tons of it. I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle of seche vite and I am almost done with the seche restore!!! But it dries my nails very fast!!</li>
            <li> This Top Coat makes applying nail polish much easier. With one layer of it for the final step, anyone can make their nails as pretty as just come out of a salon. Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used and kept returning to this product!</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite top coats for years. It never lets me down.</li>
            <li> I love these! Great price!!! Good delivery time! Bottles were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat!  Makes doing nail art a breeze.  And helps dry my nails stat!</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! The smell is pretty strong though.</li>
            <li> Was not wrapped at all!! 1 was broken and got cut.  Find somewhere else to buy!!!</li>
            <li> And I have used plenty. Evens out nails, makes them very shiny and dries quickly.  I highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li> This item is the best fast-dry top coat for so cheap! The china glaze is okay but it doesnt dry as fast as this and also leaves a cloudy haze. The O.P.I. is just to expensive. LOVE THIS! And I swear I&#x27;m not one of those people who gets paid to write reviews or something lol.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying $30 to $40 every two weeks for a no-chip manicure.  I also felt the removal process of the no-chip was damaging my nails.  I did some research and now do my own nails at home.  I start with China Glaze adhesion which extends the life of the polish.  I use China Glaze polish.  Finally, I use the Seche Vite top coat.  The end product looks like a salon manicure.  I bought all products, including four different color polishes, for less than the cost of one no-chip manicure.  My manicure lasts a minimum of eight days, and that&#x27;s doing dishes and housework.  I got everything I need right here on Amazon.  Easy one stop shopping. :)</li>
            <li> Peels off within a day.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I can say that others have not already written. It&#x27;s a great price on an absolute nail painting necessity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased others I love this one the most sometimes the topcoat peels completely off but it&#x27;s better than the others I&#x27;ve tried not so chippy</li>
            <li> The ONLY top coat I EVER use! such a great product -- drys in less than 5 minutes and makes your nail polish last longer than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; top coat. The only thing i will say is you should probably wait a little longer than 45 minutes before you wear boots -- it will get ruined if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Fastest top coat ever!! kind of on the thick side but over all its great, I would repurchase again soon.</li>
            <li> This truly is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Incredibly fast-drying, very shiny, and helps nail polish not chip. Also, such a good deal it&#x27;s almost underpriced.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries within under a minute! Seriously, if you&#x27;re impatient with waiting for your nails to dry, you need to get this top coat!</li>
            <li> No more smearing.  No more blanket marks when you paint your nails at bedtime!  Does not pick up ANY color from your nail.  Polish does not get contaminated with polish colors.  Dries SO fast.  SUPER shiny finish!  Does not smear nail art designs.  Makes your polish last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing is the DRY time.  I am so impatient.  I can NEVER wait for my polish to dry.  This is SOOOOOO helpful and I have had a lot less re-dos since I started using this.  I will be a lifelong Seche Vite user.  I have tried EVERY drugstore top coat over the last 15 years.  I thought it was normal to smear and take forever to dry.  THANK YOU, SECHE VITE!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this many times before. This is the perfect top coat in terms of shine, fast dry and overall last. When the nail chips, the top coat, color coats and base coats chip all together. I have a feeling its the top coat as I have changed color coats and base coats and this same thing happens. I like it better than some nail polishes feeling like they damage my nails by chipping a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only cons are its super chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again. And I would recommend this to anyone who does nails on their own or out because the drying rate is really impressive!</li>
            <li> A MUST have top coat. I bought it at ulta and this is the best topcoat. It beats Essie, opi, China glaze, zoya. Its a high gloss and it dries fast. I also put it over nail polish before it was dry and it dried it in seconds!</li>
            <li> The best fast dry top coat ever!!!  Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I actually bring a bottle with me to the nail salon - it&#x27;s better than any they use.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the ones they sell in the department stores for the fraction of the price. You get TWO for the price of not even ONE bottle. Where I find these, they cost $10. The formula and the quality is exactly the same. It does get goopy half way through the bottle but that&#x27;s normal with Seche Vites. You just have to put 2 or 3 drops of lacquer thinners (sold at Sally&#x27;s beauty supplies) and it works as good as new. I will never buy retail price ever again. Seche Vite is the BEST top coat out there right now that&#x27;s more in the affordable line.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful but it arrived broken  one bottle was totally shattered and the other one had dried on polish and glass.</li>
