            <li>I love this oil for my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for some time and love it.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was ok,</li>
            <li>I love using on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the cost could be better</li>
            <li>This Light Moroccan oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT and it will always be in my hair care regimen....</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but cost a lot more in salons with their mark ups.</li>
            <li>The trick is not to use too much, or it can make your hair appear oily, but just the right amount (about a quarter size in the palm of your hand) works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I tried the original Morroccan Oil and really liked the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s making my hair so soft, and the product smells good too!</li>
            <li>I use to use the regular but have learned that the light is best for fine haired blondes!</li>
            <li>The Light Moroccan Oil is perfect for my fine naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>The best treatment for dry or healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil because my mom recommended me and it was really awesome for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money!!  </li>
            <li>If you blow dry, straighten or curl your hair, this is the perfect product to use before hand!</li>
            <li>I find the best results are if I blow dry it after I add it to my hair, it makes my hair feel thicker and smoother.</li>
            <li>Easy to pump into hand and then apply where it is needed the most.</li>
            <li>Then I tried the light treatment and have to say I love this one even better.  </li>
            <li>The product gives my hair volume, greatly reduces frizz, makes it look shiny, gives it more \\&quot;weight\\&quot; and more of a sleek look (it actually feels like I have more, thicker hair when I shake it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product light smell light weight ,works good before or after flat iron</li>
            <li>This is great for keeping hair soft.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth, silky, youthful looking hair, than you better buy this product.   </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this is the first hair product I have ever used that I have fallen in love with (I&#x27;m 45).  </li>
            <li>When I realized there was a light oil I decided to try it and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love Morrocan Oil Treatment Light.  </li>
            <li>this light hair oil make my hair looks healthy but not too oily.</li>
            <li>I love the smell on my hair and the smooth and defined curls.</li>
            <li>Great product - makes my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>U deserve buy one to enjoy smooth hair!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, adds sheen and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccan Oil and I love the Light version very much!  </li>
            <li>wise this product is a bit high compared to what it does.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair very shiny and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after washing gets tangled easily, even with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product ever, for super dry damaged hair I will ever use.  </li>
            <li>Light, not a heavy buildup, the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>Fine when I straighten it.</li>
            <li>Works fine on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful and almost half the price of purchase in salons</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair which can become frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just TOO light, even for my really fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li>So, if you have fine hair, buy the light.  </li>
            <li>so I appreciate the light formula for not giving me super grease!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine textured and I like to use the Moroccanoil Light in it because it conditions my hair and makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li>And of course I love Amazon&#x27;s fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Fantastic really makes my hair feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li>This is great if you have light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It is also alcohol free.</li>
            <li>but I can use this light oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference, but the light version seems to do the trick just as promised.</li>
            <li>I realize the LIGHT version is geared towards blondes and switching to that formula has helped with the oil making my hair look darker.  </li>
            <li>I saw this light version and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Yes this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I have to use quite a bit of the light oil.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li>I have used Moroccan Oil Light since it was recommended to me by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy putting in my hair</li>
            <li>It is light and leaves my hair silky and smooth without being oily or having a build up.</li>
            <li>I think it might be that my hairdresser doesn&#x27;t use the light Moroccan Oil and that&#x27;s what I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Now, I get curls my daughters like to wrap around their fingers and because I no longer diffuse it, several stylists have commented on the great condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked so much the product.</li>
            <li>This is a light treatment to help dryness in hair.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy it and can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I rub my hands together, smooth it on my ends, then massage the remaining residue into the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>Everything this company produceing is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and definitely decreases the amount of drying time.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt moroccan oil light treats processed and damaged hair</li>
            <li>This treatment is fairly light in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair becomes smooth after use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it made my wife&#x27;s hair greasy instead of smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair stays smooth and shiny for days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t effect my day to day styling, but it keeps my hair hydrated and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I tried the regular Moroccan Oil and it worked great on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>it is light and not greasy or sticky and too shinny either.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair silky smooth and shiny, even without any styling.</li>
            <li>I use the light because my hair is a lighter color.  </li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of oil, it smells so good and leaves my crazy wavy, knotting tendencies beautifully shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have used both original and light oil.  </li>
            <li>I live in the high desert and this is the best product for keep my hair healthy and soft!</li>
            <li>And for the first time, I had a hairdresser tell me my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Delivered on time and Original Product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that it is so useful!</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; it works really well for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair feel so incredibly soft and the light version is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Exquisite scent and leaves my hair silky &amp; soft after countless heat treatments.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is light on my hair and gives it a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product, but once used, I will go with the regular Moroccan Oil over the light.</li>
            <li>controls the fly aways with the dry weather</li>
            <li>the best never makes  your hair oily, only leaves it soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I got it quickly and it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is great for smoothing rough hair and adding shine.  </li>
            <li>Delivers soft, shiny, frizz-free hair that smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It also brought out shiny golden highlights in my light brown color.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shampoo, conditioner and oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for helping me be able to afford this product.</li>
            <li>Possibly I needed something more potent than the light</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>Other oils leave a yellow tint in my all white hair, this is perfect as it leaves no residue while making my hair shine beautifully</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and it keeps my hair very healthy!</li>
            <li>Its a must since i live in Cali where the sun is so strong!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and cant live without it anymore!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Light version is not as effective as regular.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  :)</li>
            <li>it works perfectly with my hair which is thick but fine and mostly straight...</li>
            <li>Hair texture is smooth and hot.</li>
            <li>the label is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Also it was a great price compared to other places I have looked!</li>
            <li>Amazingly, this is the first time in years and years that my lips have not dried, not chapped, or even cracked.</li>
            <li>The name sounds like it&#x27;s some natural product that&#x27;s very exotic and, at the price, it should be, but it&#x27;s really just a slicking product that uses silicone.  </li>
            <li>When I first heard about &amp;#34;Moroccan Oil Treatment&amp;#34; I thought Pssh!  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and I love it makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>My straight, fine blond hair turns to silk when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Since I do have lighter hair, I do prefer the light, though there isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li>I switched to real Argan oil (light formula).</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>the big one comes with a pump so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I love both the Moroccanoil Light and the Regular formula.  </li>
            <li>The price is worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>but worth the cost.</li>
            <li>And by the way, I am almost 60, color my hair, and it keeps it looking young and healthy.  </li>
            <li>My hair never looked better and it is so soft.</li>
            <li>Given the price tag, you would think this is like, the pinacle of hair treatment success.  </li>
            <li>Love Moroccanoil - Makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend regular kind</li>
            <li>My other daughter has also noticed many more tangles since the switch as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands and Moroccan oil is the best!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried other oils that were sort of the same, but none smell as wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the stuff, but I have to go easy near my roots because it&#x27;s easy to make the hair too oily.</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>I always put it in right after my shower and let my hair airdry.</li>
            <li>I tried many other products to eliminate frizz and add shine and no other product is as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>All in all this stuff is hands down amazing compared to the cheap off brand that I used to buy from Target.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other product in the market better than this one.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels sexy and smooth all day long!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to work with, makes my hair feel softer after using and seems to last awhile too.</li>
            <li>I bought lots of products to try to eliminate the dry fuzzy ends and none of them really did a good job.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many in the past and this is hands down the best thing I have used on my hair!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>When I wash my hair all the frizzies come back, but I just put the oil back in and it looks great.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>The regular oil is great, but it left my hair with a brassy tone.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, only needs a few drops</li>
            <li>Helps control how much product comes out, since the oil can come out pretty quick out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like this item very much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast.</li>
            <li>Also it smells heavenly and seems to make my hair dry more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Can highly recommend to use it for the hair to look healthy and feel soft</li>
            <li>it comes in a really pretty glass bottle and pump.</li>
            <li>Smooths wild hair - makes hair feel smooth without looking greasy</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>My hair has lots of volume and that is why i bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>keeps her hair smooth and soft also</li>
            <li>will probably order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I was at the movies the first night I tried it and couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was so itchy</li>
            <li>may be responsible for some chest zits but my hair loves it!</li>
            <li>This works really well for colored and processed hair!</li>
            <li>Love the entire line of Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>I first has my hair stylist use this on me.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very shiny and manageable....not greasy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis, and if I didn&#x27;t know better, i&#x27;d think that THIS was the ineffective cheap-o product.  </li>
            <li>I love Moroccan Oil and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>After I start using the products, my hair look much healthier, shiny and smoother!  </li>
            <li>I like this sosososso much!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I feel my hair has become more frizzy than ever after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li>It works better on my fine hair than the original formula, keeping it soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I just got a new bottle of the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Moroccan Oil and will go back to my tried and true love.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my hair soft and have less frizz.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy or strongly scented as what they use at the salon, but that&#x27;s better for me.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of frizzies and loose fly aways (at time of use/with each usage, until next washing).</li>
            <li>Tangles easily, dry, breakage, just all around unmanigible (it is very fine).</li>
            <li>so that the round brush passes through my hair much more smoothly, thereby reducing pull on my hair and</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend one Moroccan Oil type over the other (as they both seem to work well), but I chose this light version because I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>the light oil is very forgiving if you use a little more than needed.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and love it for a long time.</li>
            <li>This product give a nice shine without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, blonde hair (processed) and this stuff keeps it strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have coarse curly hair that frizzes easily</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, use it after I towel dry my hair after every wash no matter what.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, I see definite difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Bottle is the large size and comes with the pump applicator.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as how the product and seller were...the item came super fast, and was well packaged.  </li>

            <li>I have pretty fine dry hair</li>
            <li>My hair was never fuzzy when I was younger, it was always straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>so ti is veyr reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I like to try and wear it straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the traditional Moroccan Oil, and am now using Moroccan Oil Light.</li>
            <li>Light and smell terrific will not fight with your perfume.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it in stock.</li>
            <li>Your hair is left silky smooth -</li>
            <li>I learned what humidity really is and this product works.</li>
            <li>I use the &#x27;light&#x27; because I have blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps reduce frizz and makes my hair look healthier and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Some of them make your hair look very greasy</li>
            <li>I have used the regular oil and the light.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it came with a pump.</li>
            <li>However, when I use Moroccan Oil at home I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>Though mostly recommend wet</li>
            <li>After using Moroccanoil for a month my hair has never looked so much healthier</li>
            <li>really helps damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the regular formula, as well as the light but noticed no difference in the product.</li>
            <li>I need to admit, It works very well.</li>
            <li>this product really helps with the tangles, the body and the sheen.  </li>
            <li>I use it only on my ends and it makes my hair look so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>In short - JUST GET THE CHEAP STUFF.  </li>
            <li>I accidently bought Light (for blondes) instead of the regular.  </li>
            <li>My hair is looking so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil really helps to comb through.  </li>
            <li>In the winter months it helps to keep my hair from drying out  and in summer it really helps to keep it from frizzing in the humidity.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I always have had fly away, broken ends.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really helps to keep my scalp moisturized .</li>
            <li>Worth the brand price and bought directly from amazon</li>
            <li>, so I know it&#x27;s the real product.</li>
            <li>and my stylist says she has never had a client with such soft, healthy hair</li>
            <li>worked OK when used in small amounts on damp hair, but realized it&#x27;s full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I originally tried the regular Moroccanoil Treatment</li>
            <li>I have yet to find any other oil that works as well, or smells better...</li>
            <li>A quick toner or purple shampoo will neutralize that, but the product won&#x27;t work unless you leave it in for a certain amount of time and use it regularly...</li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good things about the oil, other than to get some!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more liquidy now than before it is super thick and concentrated.</li>
            <li>(so I can get two days of wear without washing) scrunch with a damp towel, spray a fine hairspray from the bottom up through the curls and let air dry.  </li>
            <li>Does not weight your hair down and makes your hair look shiny and healthy...</li>
            <li>What I like most about the oil versus other treatments is the fragrance!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I feel my hair is less frizzy and more silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the LIGHT version, and is clearly described and labeled as such.</li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredient list, it&#x27;s mainly silicone (not that it&#x27;s on the bottle itself...</li>
            <li>or I can&#x27;t stand the smell, particularly when it is over saturated with flower</li>
            <li>I use my fingers to separate my curls by quickly raking (side to side) through my hair up by the roots (NOT in my actual curls.)  </li>
            <li>Great for all hair types, oily, dry, straight, curly, thick, thin hair.... Makes your hair healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>love big, big hair!</li>
            <li>I love the final touch it provides and the extra protection from weather.</li>
            <li>this is always a great little addition to smoothe your hair and it mixes well with other products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with dry/damaged/coloured hair</li>
            <li>your hair in need of a little more strength?</li>
            <li>I thought that with the overall ratings of this particular item, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine to dull hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great but has not made my hair silly as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser likes to use it on my hair, and normally he wouldn&#x27;t use any product</li>
            <li>I normally do the progressive streightning or Brazilian Treatment that controls my volume for 5 months, but when it is over, the Morrocan Oil can help a lot.</li>
            <li>My hair keeps getting better everyday.</li>
            <li>This would last me up to 5 months, so this is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Much better than heavy conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft, more durable, less breakage</li>
            <li>They have transformed my hair from a wild frizzy mess to be shiny, healthy and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I color and heat style my hair and Moroccan Oil has kept my hair very soft and just plain healthy</li>
            <li>and this helps my skin stay supple and smooth a lot longer than other products.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s a new product in the market</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live in a humid climate, though...</li>
            <li>This is my new go to oil.</li>
            <li>I have dark, fine hair</li>
            <li>For anyone who has ever used the regular Moroccan Oil and liked the product but thought it was too oily or heavy for your hair, I recommend that you try the \\&quot;Light\\&quot; version.  </li>
            <li>My daughter fell into the hype that the regular oil made blonde hair darker, so we switched to Light.  </li>
            <li>is it&#x27;s effect on bleached hair - while the light variety is supposed not to deposit tones on blonde or white hair</li>
            <li>and I picked the Light because my hair is white and didn&#x27;t want to turn it yellow.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like some do.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even weigh down my fine hair either.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and my skin is very soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft..</li>
            <li>It now dries in less time and looks so good I can wear it down for once.</li>
            <li>around!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Makes hair so soft and helps with frizz!</li>
            <li>be aware that you are always running a risk of getting an item from a different country..</li>
            <li>I love it, it just takes a small amt.</li>
            <li>My hair is sooo soft and shiny since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li>I have used this for years on my untamable naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>especially here in the hot desert area.</li>
            <li>, I just put a little bit on my fingers and rub it at the ends, once my hair is dry, that&#x27;s when the magic begins, my hair is so bouncy, shiny and manageable!</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li>This light version doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten extremely dry since I&#x27;ve started to go gray and color and highlight my hair, and I don&#x27;t think this product was strong enough to address that.  </li>
            <li>Its light texture will not weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li>It helps during the after shampoo comb through, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, adds to the shine, and makes a natural sleekness to my style.  </li>
            <li>If my hair wet feels very smooth, but after that it gets dry, worest if I used dryer.</li>
            <li>I really like the light version of the oil and use a small amount 1/2 teaspoon on my hair after the shower.  </li>
            <li>It adds a nice shine to your hair without being greasy and only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li>Was not sure I would like it as much as the original, but I do.</li>
            <li>but it was just too heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product gives my fine damaged hair a sheen without making it limp or greasy.</li>
            <li>- you&#x27;d think the ingredients in the light version would be pretty much the same as the regular version, just less of everything!</li>
            <li>This product works better for me than the regular Moroccanoil which is a little heavy for my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the normal version, not the light, but I bought this one by mistake and I like it as well.</li>
            <li>It will leave hair soft and manageable and shining.  </li>
            <li>My hairstylists have used MoroccanOil on my hair before and my hair always felt so soft afterwards</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m content with the product so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and managable.</li>
            <li>It dries with a natural finish, or can be used with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair shiny, baby soft and no friz.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses it on my hair, and it makes my hair so soft and controllable.</li>
            <li>Still, total it was about 1/3 of the price - a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>I selected it because it is not heavy and to use in color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really understand why it&#x27;s called a treatment though as it is essentially just an oil for your hair.</li>
            <li>Just soft and shiney</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s not the real thing because the texture feels completely different, it leaves a sort of sticky residue on your hands.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair SOFT not oily</li>
            <li>I have tried Redkens Diamond oil, and the all soft serum and neither compare to this.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be so soft people will want to pet you.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil saved my ends and makes me hair soft after every wash, even on my dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, just soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It completely changes my hairs&#x27; texture and feel without leaving it darker or greasy.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>This is very light  - only use one small pump.</li>
            <li>I just think it&#x27;s so odd that the \\&quot;light\\&quot; version gave me such a strong reaction</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron so much on humid days.</li>
            <li>(Original version was a tad to heavy for me.)  </li>
            <li>Therefore it&#x27;s rare that i last very long wearing my hair down, and i really want to be able to wear my hair down!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and always leaves my long, thick hair feeling silky and smelling good!</li>
            <li>No other brand that claims to have Moroccan Oil is comparable!</li>
            <li>Not as much as normal Moroccanoil, but this oil will noticeably yellow ash toned hair even after one application.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair that tends to break or split</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>instead of focusing on putting that shine, that volume, and that strength in my hair, i have to also worry about this glass bottle slipping out of my hands and my hopes of voluminous, shiny, and healthy hair shattering into hundreds of little glass</li>
            <li>I will say that I have long, blond, fine hair and this product does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>It also helps my hair dry fast.</li>
            <li>i bought this a couple years ago i used it but its not pure argan oil ,its not natural ,its full of fillers and silicons .it might work for you but keep in mind you&#x27;re using chemicals</li>
            <li>and i can run my fingers through it easily even after a long day and getting wind blown (so much less tangled)!</li>
            <li>I have fine, susceptible-to-frizz hair, and I have trouble with breakage when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the only product my naturally curly hair needs.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist believes one should not wash their hair everyday as it strips essential oils from the scalp, so I apply it again on the second day to smooth it out once again and freshen the scent.  </li>
            <li>When they say light, they really mean it.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and it helps tame my dry, grey hair without being greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair has been really good lately, and I know that it&#x27;s not only due to this product, but I would not live without it.</li>
            <li>Its not dry or stringy anymore and its so heavy and thick not, I can wear a pony tail and be confident!</li>
            <li>While I have never noticed any darkening of her blonde hair from the regular Moroccan oil, I have noticed that the hair is not nearly as healthy looking with this light version.  </li>
            <li>The first day I tried it my hair was suddenly soft and actually had movement instead of feeling stiff.  </li>
            <li>Although my hair is not especially dry, I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many other products through Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue with a possible fake product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my long hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It easy to comb out my thick long hair after I use it!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy, thick hair</li>
            <li>Really adds body and shine without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>I have always had dry hair, but this does truly fix that, no more fly away, or broken ends.</li>
            <li>Worth the money as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and this makes it feel so much fuller without being greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I found this online, and it is exactly the same as the salon, just less!</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and have fine but thick hair that is shoulder lenght and slightly fuzzy.</li>
            <li>But, I cannot put it in towel dried hair because when I let it dry naturally it makes my hair poofy and with way too much</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, thin and with fine highlights.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to buy this product off Amazon because I didn&#x27;t really know what to compare it to</li>
            <li>My hair is a little frizzy and some products tend to leave my hair very oily.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and just use a little of this</li>
            <li>but the price it a little bit over too much...</li>
            <li>If you have normal to heavy thick hair, buy the original.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets limp and gross with products that are too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have fine (silky,) thick, long, curly hair that I struggled to wear curly for a long time because it just looked frizzy/messy.  </li>

            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Best product for my unruly coarse and frizzy hair yet</li>
            <li> I love this oil for my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and love it.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was ok,</li>
            <li> I love using on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the cost could be better</li>
            <li> This Light Moroccan oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT and it will always be in my hair care regimen....</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but cost a lot more in salons with their mark ups.</li>
            <li> The trick is not to use too much, or it can make your hair appear oily, but just the right amount (about a quarter size in the palm of your hand) works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I tried the original Morroccan Oil and really liked the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making my hair so soft, and the product smells good too!</li>
            <li> I use to use the regular but have learned that the light is best for fine haired blondes!</li>
            <li> The Light Moroccan Oil is perfect for my fine naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> The best treatment for dry or healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because my mom recommended me and it was really awesome for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money!!  </li>
            <li> If you blow dry, straighten or curl your hair, this is the perfect product to use before hand!</li>
            <li> I find the best results are if I blow dry it after I add it to my hair, it makes my hair feel thicker and smoother.</li>
            <li> Easy to pump into hand and then apply where it is needed the most.</li>
            <li> Then I tried the light treatment and have to say I love this one even better.  </li>
            <li> The product gives my hair volume, greatly reduces frizz, makes it look shiny, gives it more \\&quot;weight\\&quot; and more of a sleek look (it actually feels like I have more, thicker hair when I shake it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product light smell light weight ,works good before or after flat iron</li>
            <li> This is great for keeping hair soft.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth, silky, youthful looking hair, than you better buy this product.   </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is the first hair product I have ever used that I have fallen in love with (I&#x27;m 45).  </li>
            <li> When I realized there was a light oil I decided to try it and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love Morrocan Oil Treatment Light.  </li>

            <li> I love the smell on my hair and the smooth and defined curls.</li>

            <li> Easy to use, adds sheen and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil and I love the Light version very much!  </li>
            <li> wise this product is a bit high compared to what it does.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very shiny and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and after washing gets tangled easily, even with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product ever, for super dry damaged hair I will ever use.  </li>
            <li> Light, not a heavy buildup, the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Fine when I straighten it.</li>
            <li> Works fine on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful and almost half the price of purchase in salons</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair which can become frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> It smells so good and makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just TOO light, even for my really fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li> So, if you have fine hair, buy the light.  </li>
            <li> so I appreciate the light formula for not giving me super grease!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine textured and I like to use the Moroccanoil Light in it because it conditions my hair and makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li> And of course I love Amazon&#x27;s fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic really makes my hair feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li> This is great if you have light blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It is also alcohol free.</li>
            <li> but I can use this light oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference, but the light version seems to do the trick just as promised.</li>
            <li> I realize the LIGHT version is geared towards blondes and switching to that formula has helped with the oil making my hair look darker.  </li>
            <li> I saw this light version and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Yes this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and I have to use quite a bit of the light oil.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil Light since it was recommended to me by my stylist.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy putting in my hair</li>
            <li> It is light and leaves my hair silky and smooth without being oily or having a build up.</li>
            <li> I think it might be that my hairdresser doesn&#x27;t use the light Moroccan Oil and that&#x27;s what I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Now, I get curls my daughters like to wrap around their fingers and because I no longer diffuse it, several stylists have commented on the great condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked so much the product.</li>
            <li> This is a light treatment to help dryness in hair.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy it and can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I rub my hands together, smooth it on my ends, then massage the remaining residue into the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Everything this company produceing is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and definitely decreases the amount of drying time.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt moroccan oil light treats processed and damaged hair</li>
            <li> This treatment is fairly light in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair becomes smooth after use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it made my wife&#x27;s hair greasy instead of smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair stays smooth and shiny for days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t effect my day to day styling, but it keeps my hair hydrated and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular Moroccan Oil and it worked great on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> it is light and not greasy or sticky and too shinny either.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair silky smooth and shiny, even without any styling.</li>
            <li> I use the light because my hair is a lighter color.  </li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of oil, it smells so good and leaves my crazy wavy, knotting tendencies beautifully shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used both original and light oil.  </li>
            <li> I live in the high desert and this is the best product for keep my hair healthy and soft!</li>
            <li> And for the first time, I had a hairdresser tell me my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and Original Product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it is so useful!</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; it works really well for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel so incredibly soft and the light version is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Exquisite scent and leaves my hair silky &amp; soft after countless heat treatments.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is light on my hair and gives it a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product, but once used, I will go with the regular Moroccan Oil over the light.</li>
            <li> controls the fly aways with the dry weather</li>
            <li> the best never makes  your hair oily, only leaves it soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I got it quickly and it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is great for smoothing rough hair and adding shine.  </li>
            <li> Delivers soft, shiny, frizz-free hair that smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It also brought out shiny golden highlights in my light brown color.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo, conditioner and oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for helping me be able to afford this product.</li>
            <li> Possibly I needed something more potent than the light</li>
            <li> Love it so much.</li>
            <li> Other oils leave a yellow tint in my all white hair, this is perfect as it leaves no residue while making my hair shine beautifully</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and it keeps my hair very healthy!</li>
            <li> Its a must since i live in Cali where the sun is so strong!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and cant live without it anymore!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Light version is not as effective as regular.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  :)</li>
            <li> it works perfectly with my hair which is thick but fine and mostly straight...</li>
            <li> Hair texture is smooth and hot.</li>
            <li> the label is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Also it was a great price compared to other places I have looked!</li>
            <li> Amazingly, this is the first time in years and years that my lips have not dried, not chapped, or even cracked.</li>
            <li> The name sounds like it&#x27;s some natural product that&#x27;s very exotic and, at the price, it should be, but it&#x27;s really just a slicking product that uses silicone.  </li>
            <li> When I first heard about &amp;#34;Moroccan Oil Treatment&amp;#34; I thought Pssh!  </li>
            <li> Came quickly and I love it makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> My straight, fine blond hair turns to silk when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Since I do have lighter hair, I do prefer the light, though there isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li> I switched to real Argan oil (light formula).</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> the big one comes with a pump so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I love both the Moroccanoil Light and the Regular formula.  </li>
            <li> The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> And by the way, I am almost 60, color my hair, and it keeps it looking young and healthy.  </li>
            <li> My hair never looked better and it is so soft.</li>
            <li> Given the price tag, you would think this is like, the pinacle of hair treatment success.  </li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil - Makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend regular kind</li>
            <li> My other daughter has also noticed many more tangles since the switch as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and Moroccan oil is the best!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other oils that were sort of the same, but none smell as wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I really do like the stuff, but I have to go easy near my roots because it&#x27;s easy to make the hair too oily.</li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> I always put it in right after my shower and let my hair airdry.</li>
            <li> I tried many other products to eliminate frizz and add shine and no other product is as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> All in all this stuff is hands down amazing compared to the cheap off brand that I used to buy from Target.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other product in the market better than this one.</li>
            <li> Her hair feels sexy and smooth all day long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to work with, makes my hair feel softer after using and seems to last awhile too.</li>
            <li> I bought lots of products to try to eliminate the dry fuzzy ends and none of them really did a good job.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many in the past and this is hands down the best thing I have used on my hair!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> When I wash my hair all the frizzies come back, but I just put the oil back in and it looks great.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> The regular oil is great, but it left my hair with a brassy tone.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, only needs a few drops</li>
            <li> Helps control how much product comes out, since the oil can come out pretty quick out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like this item very much.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast.</li>
            <li> Also it smells heavenly and seems to make my hair dry more quickly.  </li>
            <li> Can highly recommend to use it for the hair to look healthy and feel soft</li>
            <li> it comes in a really pretty glass bottle and pump.</li>
            <li> Smooths wild hair - makes hair feel smooth without looking greasy</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> My hair has lots of volume and that is why i bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> keeps her hair smooth and soft also</li>
            <li> will probably order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was at the movies the first night I tried it and couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was so itchy</li>
            <li> may be responsible for some chest zits but my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> This works really well for colored and processed hair!</li>
            <li> Love the entire line of Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> I first has my hair stylist use this on me.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very shiny and manageable....not greasy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis, and if I didn&#x27;t know better, i&#x27;d think that THIS was the ineffective cheap-o product.  </li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> After I start using the products, my hair look much healthier, shiny and smoother!  </li>
            <li> I like this sosososso much!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I feel my hair has become more frizzy than ever after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> It works better on my fine hair than the original formula, keeping it soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I just got a new bottle of the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Moroccan Oil and will go back to my tried and true love.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my hair soft and have less frizz.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy or strongly scented as what they use at the salon, but that&#x27;s better for me.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of frizzies and loose fly aways (at time of use/with each usage, until next washing).</li>
            <li> Tangles easily, dry, breakage, just all around unmanigible (it is very fine).</li>
            <li> so that the round brush passes through my hair much more smoothly, thereby reducing pull on my hair and</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend one Moroccan Oil type over the other (as they both seem to work well), but I chose this light version because I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> the light oil is very forgiving if you use a little more than needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and love it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product give a nice shine without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, blonde hair (processed) and this stuff keeps it strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly hair that frizzes easily</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, use it after I towel dry my hair after every wash no matter what.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, I see definite difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Bottle is the large size and comes with the pump applicator.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as how the product and seller were...the item came super fast, and was well packaged.  </li>

            <li> so ti is veyr reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I like to try and wear it straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the traditional Moroccan Oil, and am now using Moroccan Oil Light.</li>

            <li> Some of them make your hair look very greasy</li>
            <li> I have used the regular oil and the light.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it came with a pump.</li>
            <li> However, when I use Moroccan Oil at home I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Though mostly recommend wet</li>
            <li> After using Moroccanoil for a month my hair has never looked so much healthier</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular formula, as well as the light but noticed no difference in the product.</li>

            <li> this product really helps with the tangles, the body and the sheen.  </li>
            <li> I use it only on my ends and it makes my hair look so shiny and smooth.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Really like this oil.</li>
            <li> I always have had fly away, broken ends.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really helps to keep my scalp moisturized .</li>
            <li> Worth the brand price and bought directly from amazon</li>
            <li> , so I know it&#x27;s the real product.</li>
            <li> and my stylist says she has never had a client with such soft, healthy hair</li>
            <li> worked OK when used in small amounts on damp hair, but realized it&#x27;s full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I originally tried the regular Moroccanoil Treatment</li>
            <li> I have yet to find any other oil that works as well, or smells better...</li>
            <li> A quick toner or purple shampoo will neutralize that, but the product won&#x27;t work unless you leave it in for a certain amount of time and use it regularly...</li>
            <li> and I cannot say enough good things about the oil, other than to get some!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more liquidy now than before it is super thick and concentrated.</li>
            <li> (so I can get two days of wear without washing) scrunch with a damp towel, spray a fine hairspray from the bottom up through the curls and let air dry.  </li>
            <li> Does not weight your hair down and makes your hair look shiny and healthy...</li>
            <li> What I like most about the oil versus other treatments is the fragrance!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> I feel my hair is less frizzy and more silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the LIGHT version, and is clearly described and labeled as such.</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredient list, it&#x27;s mainly silicone (not that it&#x27;s on the bottle itself...</li>
            <li> or I can&#x27;t stand the smell, particularly when it is over saturated with flower</li>
            <li> I use my fingers to separate my curls by quickly raking (side to side) through my hair up by the roots (NOT in my actual curls.)  </li>
            <li> Great for all hair types, oily, dry, straight, curly, thick, thin hair.... Makes your hair healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li> love big, big hair!</li>
            <li> I love the final touch it provides and the extra protection from weather.</li>
            <li> this is always a great little addition to smoothe your hair and it mixes well with other products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with dry/damaged/coloured hair</li>
            <li> your hair in need of a little more strength?</li>
            <li> I thought that with the overall ratings of this particular item, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice shine to dull hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great but has not made my hair silly as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser likes to use it on my hair, and normally he wouldn&#x27;t use any product</li>
            <li> I normally do the progressive streightning or Brazilian Treatment that controls my volume for 5 months, but when it is over, the Morrocan Oil can help a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair keeps getting better everyday.</li>
            <li> This would last me up to 5 months, so this is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Much better than heavy conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft, more durable, less breakage</li>
            <li> They have transformed my hair from a wild frizzy mess to be shiny, healthy and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I color and heat style my hair and Moroccan Oil has kept my hair very soft and just plain healthy</li>
            <li> and this helps my skin stay supple and smooth a lot longer than other products.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a new product in the market</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live in a humid climate, though...</li>
            <li> This is my new go to oil.</li>
            <li> I have dark, fine hair</li>
            <li> For anyone who has ever used the regular Moroccan Oil and liked the product but thought it was too oily or heavy for your hair, I recommend that you try the \\&quot;Light\\&quot; version.  </li>
            <li> My daughter fell into the hype that the regular oil made blonde hair darker, so we switched to Light.  </li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s effect on bleached hair - while the light variety is supposed not to deposit tones on blonde or white hair</li>
            <li> and I picked the Light because my hair is white and didn&#x27;t want to turn it yellow.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like some do.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even weigh down my fine hair either.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and my skin is very soft</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft..</li>
            <li> It now dries in less time and looks so good I can wear it down for once.</li>
            <li> around!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Makes hair so soft and helps with frizz!</li>
            <li> be aware that you are always running a risk of getting an item from a different country..</li>
            <li> I love it, it just takes a small amt.</li>
            <li> My hair is sooo soft and shiny since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years on my untamable naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li> especially here in the hot desert area.</li>
            <li> , I just put a little bit on my fingers and rub it at the ends, once my hair is dry, that&#x27;s when the magic begins, my hair is so bouncy, shiny and manageable!</li>
            <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> This light version doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten extremely dry since I&#x27;ve started to go gray and color and highlight my hair, and I don&#x27;t think this product was strong enough to address that.  </li>
            <li> Its light texture will not weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> It helps during the after shampoo comb through, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, adds to the shine, and makes a natural sleekness to my style.  </li>
            <li> If my hair wet feels very smooth, but after that it gets dry, worest if I used dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like the light version of the oil and use a small amount 1/2 teaspoon on my hair after the shower.  </li>
            <li> It adds a nice shine to your hair without being greasy and only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> Was not sure I would like it as much as the original, but I do.</li>
            <li> but it was just too heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product gives my fine damaged hair a sheen without making it limp or greasy.</li>
            <li> - you&#x27;d think the ingredients in the light version would be pretty much the same as the regular version, just less of everything!</li>
            <li> This product works better for me than the regular Moroccanoil which is a little heavy for my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the normal version, not the light, but I bought this one by mistake and I like it as well.</li>
            <li> It will leave hair soft and manageable and shining.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylists have used MoroccanOil on my hair before and my hair always felt so soft afterwards</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m content with the product so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and managable.</li>
            <li> It dries with a natural finish, or can be used with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair shiny, baby soft and no friz.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses it on my hair, and it makes my hair so soft and controllable.</li>
            <li> Still, total it was about 1/3 of the price - a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> I selected it because it is not heavy and to use in color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really understand why it&#x27;s called a treatment though as it is essentially just an oil for your hair.</li>
            <li> Just soft and shiney</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not the real thing because the texture feels completely different, it leaves a sort of sticky residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair SOFT not oily</li>
            <li> I have tried Redkens Diamond oil, and the all soft serum and neither compare to this.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be so soft people will want to pet you.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil saved my ends and makes me hair soft after every wash, even on my dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It makes it shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, just soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It completely changes my hairs&#x27; texture and feel without leaving it darker or greasy.</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is very light  - only use one small pump.</li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s so odd that the \\&quot;light\\&quot; version gave me such a strong reaction</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron so much on humid days.</li>
            <li> (Original version was a tad to heavy for me.)  </li>
            <li> Therefore it&#x27;s rare that i last very long wearing my hair down, and i really want to be able to wear my hair down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and always leaves my long, thick hair feeling silky and smelling good!</li>
            <li> No other brand that claims to have Moroccan Oil is comparable!</li>
            <li> Not as much as normal Moroccanoil, but this oil will noticeably yellow ash toned hair even after one application.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair that tends to break or split</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li> instead of focusing on putting that shine, that volume, and that strength in my hair, i have to also worry about this glass bottle slipping out of my hands and my hopes of voluminous, shiny, and healthy hair shattering into hundreds of little glass</li>
            <li> I will say that I have long, blond, fine hair and this product does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> It also helps my hair dry fast.</li>
            <li> i bought this a couple years ago i used it but its not pure argan oil ,its not natural ,its full of fillers and silicons .it might work for you but keep in mind you&#x27;re using chemicals</li>
            <li> and i can run my fingers through it easily even after a long day and getting wind blown (so much less tangled)!</li>
            <li> I have fine, susceptible-to-frizz hair, and I have trouble with breakage when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the only product my naturally curly hair needs.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist believes one should not wash their hair everyday as it strips essential oils from the scalp, so I apply it again on the second day to smooth it out once again and freshen the scent.  </li>
            <li> When they say light, they really mean it.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and it helps tame my dry, grey hair without being greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair has been really good lately, and I know that it&#x27;s not only due to this product, but I would not live without it.</li>
            <li> Its not dry or stringy anymore and its so heavy and thick not, I can wear a pony tail and be confident!</li>
            <li> While I have never noticed any darkening of her blonde hair from the regular Moroccan oil, I have noticed that the hair is not nearly as healthy looking with this light version.  </li>
            <li> The first day I tried it my hair was suddenly soft and actually had movement instead of feeling stiff.  </li>
            <li> Although my hair is not especially dry, I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many other products through Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue with a possible fake product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my long hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It easy to comb out my thick long hair after I use it!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, wavy, thick hair</li>
            <li> Really adds body and shine without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry hair, but this does truly fix that, no more fly away, or broken ends.</li>
            <li> Worth the money as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and this makes it feel so much fuller without being greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I found this online, and it is exactly the same as the salon, just less!</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have fine but thick hair that is shoulder lenght and slightly fuzzy.</li>
            <li> But, I cannot put it in towel dried hair because when I let it dry naturally it makes my hair poofy and with way too much</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, thin and with fine highlights.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this product off Amazon because I didn&#x27;t really know what to compare it to</li>
            <li> My hair is a little frizzy and some products tend to leave my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and just use a little of this</li>
            <li> but the price it a little bit over too much...</li>
            <li> If you have normal to heavy thick hair, buy the original.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets limp and gross with products that are too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have fine (silky,) thick, long, curly hair that I struggled to wear curly for a long time because it just looked frizzy/messy.  </li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair for the first time and was a little concerned about how dry my ends had become.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted; my hair is amazingly soft and easily detangled with a few drops of this.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> have mixed race hair which is quite long and frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair and looking to straighten out those curls this oil will help when used with heat (hair dryer, flat iron etc).  </li>
            <li> I put quite a big in my long hair and flat-iron it.  </li>
            <li> And it is true that in thin oily hair it does not get sticky...</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and does not weigh my hair down - my hair looks and feels naturally soft.</li>
            <li> It will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> recently I began cancer treatments that resulted in dry, thinning hair.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is very dry from bleaching (blonde) and curling irons and flat irons, etc.  </li>
            <li> One bottle will last a very, very long time!</li>
            <li> so a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft without looking heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way  </li>
            <li> My daughters have long hair too and they also like this product.</li>
            <li> I used silk theraphy for a long time but was told by a friend about this product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use alot of product to get results so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> She wanted to try it on my hair since I have really long hair.  </li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist is always surprised at how few split ends</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have soft silky hair, even with a few wirey (colored treated) gray hairs.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair</li>
            <li> This product made my hair shiny without looking oily, manageable, and it&#x27;s almost like my old hair got secretly replaced by new hair overnight.</li>
            <li> Life back to it and can be used with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;FWIW, i&#x27;m not alone in my disappointment - my mother bought the exact same product (on the same day, from the same seller) - and she had the same results.  </li>
            <li> The less expensive options i&#x27;ve tried (literally every single one) were better in EVERY CATEGORY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first thinking it would weigh my hair down and make it look flatter than it already is, but it doesn&#x27;t do that at all!!  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount applied at the ends of wet hair to keep your hair soft and keep the &amp;#34;fly always&amp;#34; at bay.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive, but i do think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> If you have thick, long, curly hair I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and is frizzy and a nightmare to deal with.</li>
            <li> I always apply it after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have decided to use Fructis leave in Smooting conditioner, then put this in once my hair is dry, and that works well.</li>
            <li> Helps with frizz and dry hair- never used product before</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with dry, chapped, even  cracked lips during the winter.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have always had dry hair and have tried dozens of products to soften it up.  </li>
            <li> A drop on dry hair tames the fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Try to use after you dry your hair</li>
            <li> I use it whether or not I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Once dry</li>
            <li> and then if your hair is dry between washes; touch up the ends.</li>
            <li> and since I have curly, dry hair; I pile it on.  </li>
            <li> I get out of the shower before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is damp or dry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hair is fly-away or dry try it.</li>
            <li> I use it on damp hair before I blow dry</li>
            <li> My hair gets really dry at the ends and have split ends.  </li>
            <li> recommend people should get one and it only takes few drop already enough.</li>
            <li> I have used this moroccanoil treatment for almost a decade and can not live without it at this point.</li>
            <li> My hair is nowhere NEAR what it&#x27;s been with other similar products - less managable, less shiny, no decrease in drying time, etc.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this for my fiance... soft hair for days.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is over halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> but the product is a giant let down.  </li>
            <li> A little goes on a long way, only apply at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that are similar (trying to save money, this stuff is not cheap) but keep coming back to the Moroccanoil formula.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount so it will last for ever.</li>
            <li> You can apply it to wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Can use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Can apply wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard not to get a product that makes my hair poof out, since I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the light version was less expensive, so I figured I would try it</li>
            <li> I blow dry with a big round brush and my hair is silky and voluminous.  </li>
            <li> ..Use it wet or dry!</li>
            <li> its called jasmine&#x27;s secret is the bomb ,pure argan oil ,hand made and created by professionals</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a little (a nickel-sized blob rubbed through your palms)</li>
            <li> you only need a little  to stop frizz and condition</li>
            <li> Blow it out with round brush, touch up with flat iron and blow out slightly again to loosen some of my waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already bought the regular oil</li>
            <li> The macadamia was better in my opinion, but this one isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> only thing I am not fond of is it is heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Then a year later, I started using a hair shampoo that dried my hair out</li>
            <li> It was recieved on time and within the time expected.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Her long dark hair was shinny and always looked beautify.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so you can stretch your dollar.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be put off by the price.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, the bottle lasts me months using it every day.</li>
            <li> I have since tossed out all other hair gloss &amp;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all due to this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other oil treatment</li>
            <li> No need any other product.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount of it and you are done.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and cheaper products.  </li>
            <li> This one product has replaced using 2 or 3 other products.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands that claim Moroccanoil....</li>
            <li> My long hair has become dry and hard to manage...</li>
            <li> I use a small amount with either my hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li> sometimes w/ other leave ins that hydrate my hair but weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and never have to blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> A little bit of this oil into wet hair makes it manageable and silky.</li>
            <li> Everyday when my hair is about half dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but you don&#x27;t use much as each pump is about 1/4 tsp.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and this product keeps it shiny and under control.  </li>
            <li> The oil itself is just as thick as the regular formulation in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Truly wont let you down.</li>
            <li> This is an oil that does not weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Smoothes and moisturizes hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> well.. i find it leaves my hair moisturised and doesn&#x27;t weight it down a ton.  </li>
            <li> is sort of muddled - it seems to tone down the scent of whatever shampoo you&#x27;ve used, but replaces it with something that just kinda smells...</li>
            <li> Towel dry your hair, mix the small amount of product between your hands and rub through your hair.  </li>
            <li> Puts moisture in your hair however is slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the previous reviewer was talking about when she says it&#x27;s \\&quot;fake\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I got it from a supply house for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> I would agree with previous reviewers, the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; I believe refers to the color, recommended for blondes, not the texture.  </li>
            <li> My only issue was that the regular version was a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> Place a pump or two into the palm of your hand, rub palms together and apply to hair a few inches from the root down to the tip.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair looks a little shinier and feels softer</li>
            <li> This year, as I apply the oil to my hair, I put a little on my lips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;4) I comb it through my hair with my fingers before blow-drying, and it makes my hair a little \\&quot;slicker\\&quot;</li>
            <li> a little pricey</li>
            <li> treatment made my hair look a little darker on occasions which I did not enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it to keep the tangles out of my little ones hair and on my little guy to keep his hair under control.</li>
            <li> is is all i use after I wash my hair besides a little spray...</li>
            <li> from other site...item was leaking)  Not this one!!</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry, so after drying it I put just a very small amount on the palm of my hand and run it through my hair.</li>
            <li> But I ordered it anyway and have been using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I use one squirt from the included pump and blend it throughout my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> and I have used this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my hair oily or heavy like the bargain brands, and I have tried them all.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make it heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I have thin fragile hair</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my hair will get too oily if I do.  </li>
            <li> for taming unwanted frizz, I did notice a very slight decrease in frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used all the usual lip balms, to little help.  </li>
            <li> It does not look weighed down or greasy in the least.</li>
            <li> I have very thick dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Received it in just a few days!</li>
            <li> I usually buy Moroccan oil in a salon but decided to buy from Amazon this time.</li>
            <li> The 25 ml is pointless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just NOT very good.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend to use this oil who have bad condition hair</li>
            <li> Hard to find anywhere except a specialty hair salon</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone with thick, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Mine is thick and wavy to the root.</li>
            <li> and I always felt uncomfortable just going in to a salon where I don&#x27;t have other services done.  </li>
            <li> For the last several years my hair has been my worst enemy:</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t going to pay the ridiculous price of what the salon wanted.  </li>
            <li> and it was not nearly as good</li>
            <li> but when I use this, my hair feels very thick.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, this is the morrocon oil you should be using.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair strands</li>
            <li> and it last&#x27;s forever, over a year or longer, use very little, maybe the size of a dime....worth the price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a must have for anyone with dry hair or bad hair days on rain or humid days!  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t know if it was a fake product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s fake?</li>
            <li> Well, I find it really weird that I turned out to be allergic to this product.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> you will get the fake stuff.</li>
            <li> so the cost is not as expensive as it seems.  </li>
            <li> Weird, almost makes me think something is not legit.</li>
            <li> It is a disappointment considering its price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t even say ARGAN OIL on it  and its expensive !</li>
            <li> and I was wrong!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to heat style it and achieve a sheen without Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> so bad</li>
            <li> It is a must for those of us with frizzy and crazy hair!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years. It will not leave hair oily because it is a lighter version of Argan oil.  It will leave hair soft and manageable and shining.  It is especially good to use in winter when hair is dryer.  It is also alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this for my fiance... soft hair for days.</li>
            <li> My hairstylists have used MoroccanOil on my hair before and my hair always felt so soft afterwards but I never used it myself. I was a little hesitant to buy this product off Amazon because I didn&#x27;t really know what to compare it to so I wouldn&#x27;t know if it was a fake product. But I ordered it anyway and have been using it for a few days. I have noticed that my hair looks a little shinier and feels softer so I&#x27;m content with the product so far.</li>
            <li> I loveee Moroccan oil!  This is perfect to put in my hair after showering and makes my hair smell amazing and feel so soft!  If you blow dry, straighten or curl your hair, this is the perfect product to use before hand!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it keeps my hair healthy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing. Works great. Love PRIME shipping :)</li>
            <li> I have used this moroccanoil treatment for almost a decade and can not live without it at this point. lol. I use a small amount with either my hair wet or dry. It makes my hair smooth, no fly-aways, stops split ends, smells amazing, heals my hair and helps it grow healthy/stay healthy. You only need a small amount, the bottle lasts me months using it every day. I find the best results are if I blow dry it after I add it to my hair, it makes my hair feel thicker and smoother. I have very fine, thin hair that tends to break or split but when I use this, my hair feels very thick.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have highlights and it makes my hair very smooth and silky. I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> no issues and it was received on time.</li>
            <li> Quality of this product was amazing.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is great.  I love the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; it works really well for my fine hair.  Was not sure I would like it as much as the original, but I do.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have very thin and fine hair but I can use this light oil treatment. Just makes my hair feel better. And for the first time, I had a hairdresser tell me my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> OMG! I have fried, damaged, bleached out hair almost to my waist. It takes forever to dry and is frizzy and a nightmare to deal with. I tried this product on a whim and OH MAN, if I had more money I&#x27;d invest in stock in this company. This product made my hair shiny without looking oily, manageable, and it&#x27;s almost like my old hair got secretly replaced by new hair overnight. It now dries in less time and looks so good I can wear it down for once. This product is a miracle and I would recommend it to anyone with thick, hard to manage hair. MIRACLE! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works miracles in my hair! And it just smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of the oil. Product packaging is gorgeous it comes in a really pretty glass bottle and pump. Lasts FOREVER. Worth the money. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Puts moisture in your hair however is slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> The best leave on conditioner.  Easy to use. does the job.</li>
            <li> Love this lighter version of the Moroccanoil for my hair.  (Original version was a tad to heavy for me.)  I have shoulder length hair and just one pump is plenty so this bottle will last me a long time.  I have since tossed out all other hair gloss &amp;/or shine products (I had a lot!) and will never again buy anything else but this product!</li>
            <li> Exquisite scent and leaves my hair silky &amp; soft after countless heat treatments.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and my 2 daughters&#x27; hair. We only go through 2 bottles a year so ti is veyr reasonably priced. This is great for keeping hair soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the hair. Makes hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely amazing!!!  Smooths wild hair - makes hair feel smooth without looking greasy</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! No other brand that claims to have Moroccan Oil is comparable! This IS - The BEST!</li>
            <li> For anyone who has ever used the regular Moroccan Oil and liked the product but thought it was too oily or heavy for your hair, I recommend that you try the \\&quot;Light\\&quot; version.  Non-greasy, non-heavy formula gives the perfect balance but isn&#x27;t too drying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, I have always suffered from hair frizz and I kept buying a lot of products to see if they would do something to my hair and no luck at all. When I saw this product I decided to give it a shot and once I tried it,I fell in love with it. I always apply it after I towel dry my hair, I just put a little bit on my fingers and rub it at the ends, once my hair is dry, that&#x27;s when the magic begins, my hair is so bouncy, shiny and manageable! I recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> smells good, and works a lot on my hair,much more curled and elastic, perfect products! so much better than Germany hair  product i used before</li>
            <li> Would not go without it</li>
            <li> Easy to use, adds sheen and softness to my hair. Love it. Can&#x27;t imagine my hair without this product. :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the previous reviewer was talking about when she says it&#x27;s \\&quot;fake\\&quot;. It&#x27;s the LIGHT version, and is clearly described and labeled as such. Not as heavy or strongly scented as what they use at the salon, but that&#x27;s better for me. I accidentally left it at home when I visited my daughter for the weekend, and I could see a very big difference after blow drying. I adore this product and have recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes a world of difference (in a good way) for me. Excellent transaction.</li>
            <li> I have fine, semi curly blonde hair that I also highlight. I like to try and wear it straight but it is hard not to get a product that makes my hair poof out, since I let it dry naturally.  I have always had dry hair, but this does truly fix that, no more fly away, or broken ends. I do really love this product it smells nice too.  But, I cannot put it in towel dried hair because when I let it dry naturally it makes my hair poofy and with way too much volume.&lt;br /&gt;So I have decided to use Fructis leave in Smooting conditioner, then put this in once my hair is dry, and that works well.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner. I have been using this for 4 years now and this is only the second bottle I have had to purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this oil a lot.  I have coarse curly hair that frizzes easily, this calms it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am not fond of is it is heavily perfumed.  Not only is that not needed but it is obnoxious.</li>
            <li> Great for moisture and shine!</li>
            <li> Other oils leave a yellow tint in my all white hair, this is perfect as it leaves no residue while making my hair shine beautifully</li>
            <li> Best hair care around!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Helps with frizz and dry hair- never used product before but this feels healthy.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with dry, chapped, even  cracked lips during the winter. I have used all the usual lip balms, to little help.  This year, as I apply the oil to my hair, I put a little on my lips.  Amazingly, this is the first time in years and years that my lips have not dried, not chapped, or even cracked.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was expecting.  Great purchase. I will be buying it again once this one is done!</li>
            <li> absorbs in easily, and less prone to oiliness then the full strength oil.  for that reason i also go through a lot of it.  It leaves my hair more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Quick service and good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the traditional Moroccan Oil, and am now using Moroccan Oil Light. I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference, but the light version seems to do the trick just as promised. My hair is soft and managable. I use one squirt from the included pump and blend it throughout my towel dried hair. It dries with a natural finish, or can be used with a blow dryer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend one Moroccan Oil type over the other (as they both seem to work well), but I chose this light version because I have baby fine hair. It does not look weighed down or greasy in the least. If you are wanting to try it, I would say it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and this product keeps it shiny and under control.  Even my hairdresser likes to use it on my hair, and normally he wouldn&#x27;t use any product but those he keeps in his shop.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth, silky, youthful looking hair, than you better buy this product.   It delivers RESULTS!  A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while.  It&#x27;s well worth the money!!  Even the keratin treatment does not replace using this fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Works well for dry hair.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> My hair has lots of volume and that is why i bought it in the first place. I normally do the progressive streightning or Brazilian Treatment that controls my volume for 5 months, but when it is over, the Morrocan Oil can help a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this produce. My hair is a little frizzy and some products tend to leave my hair very oily. This product leaves my hair shiny, baby soft and no friz. You only need a small amount so it will last for ever.</li>
            <li> Since I found Moroccanoil I use nothing else on my hair.  I get my blonde highlights every six weeks and my stylist says she has never had a client with such soft, healthy hair and it&#x27;s all due to this product.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Item as described, received on time</li>
            <li> This product give a nice shine without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, color treated hair and this product works wonders. It has improved the condition of my hair permanently and has greatly reduced breakage. You only need to apply a little (a nickel-sized blob rubbed through your palms) so a bottle lasts a long time. I also love the fragrance. I have tried other products that are similar (trying to save money, this stuff is not cheap) but keep coming back to the Moroccanoil formula. Also had a very good experience with the retailer I used to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love that Moroccanoil!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Hard to find anywhere except a specialty hair salon and I always felt uncomfortable just going in to a salon where I don&#x27;t have other services done.  So glad I could find it at Amazon! And of course I love Amazon&#x27;s fast shipping!! Received it in just a few days!</li>
            <li> My favorite smoothing oil ..I use it on myself and my dog ..keeps her hair smooth and soft also</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Light and smell terrific will not fight with your perfume.</li>
            <li> like this item very much. will probably order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I always love this product, expecially for summer.  I have very curly hair and just use a little of this and it goes a long way.  I realize the LIGHT version is geared towards blondes and switching to that formula has helped with the oil making my hair look darker.  This a great product to help with the frizz and smells very good.</li>
            <li> Great product light smell light weight ,works good before or after flat iron I&#x27;m so happy with it .</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is the first hair product I have ever used that I have fallen in love with (I&#x27;m 45).  I have fine, susceptible-to-frizz hair, and I have trouble with breakage when I blow dry.  Here are the things I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It smells fantastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This light version doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The product gives my hair volume, greatly reduces frizz, makes it look shiny, gives it more \\&quot;weight\\&quot; and more of a sleek look (it actually feels like I have more, thicker hair when I shake it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I comb it through my hair with my fingers before blow-drying, and it makes my hair a little \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; so that the round brush passes through my hair much more smoothly, thereby reducing pull on my hair and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I have used hair products I like before, but I have never found one I absolutely love.  Well worth the price, for me at least.</li>
            <li> I originally tried the regular Moroccanoil Treatment and I liked it but it was just too heavy for my fine hair.  When I realized there was a light oil I decided to try it and am so glad I did.  It works great and makes my hair look healthy and smooth!</li>
            <li> Great product smell is amazing</li>
            <li> Received my&lt;br /&gt; Product as promised.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li> The BEST oil for hair! Light, not a heavy buildup, the smell is amazing! It&#x27;s a staple in my routine!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair was damaged from dying and this brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft without looking heavy or greasy. Life back to it and can be used with wet or dry hair. Warning, do not use the hair dryer if it has passed the oil, otherwise fry your hair, let it pass after drying.</li>
            <li> Love it. Thanks for having it in stock. Maybe one day it will be on sale and you will notify me of the sale dates.</li>
            <li> I bought two, but qr code was erased.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s fake?</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My straight, fine blond hair turns to silk when I use it.  Helps to de-tangle too.</li>
            <li> Well, I find it really weird that I turned out to be allergic to this product.  I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Moroccan Oil for a while with no problems.  I saw this light version and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was at the movies the first night I tried it and couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was so itchy...kept having to scratch my chest, the back of my neck/upper back, and head.  And my face broke out in hives.  I used it a second time and had the same reactions, but this time my eyes got itchy, my lips got swollen and itchy, and even my gums and the roof of my mouth were swollen and sore!  I finally figured out all this upper body trauma was being caused by this product.  I was out at a brunch when I made the realization and couldn&#x27;t wait to go home and shower and get the product off of me.  It took several days for the lips to settle back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how the product and seller were...the item came super fast, and was well packaged.  My hair has gotten extremely dry since I&#x27;ve started to go gray and color and highlight my hair, and I don&#x27;t think this product was strong enough to address that.  I just got a new bottle of the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Moroccan Oil and will go back to my tried and true love.  I just think it&#x27;s so odd that the \\&quot;light\\&quot; version gave me such a strong reaction - you&#x27;d think the ingredients in the light version would be pretty much the same as the regular version, just less of everything!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing..Your hair is left silky smooth - no frizz..Use it wet or dry! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Yes this stuff is fantastic.  I have always had dry hair and have tried dozens of products to soften it up.  The first day I tried it my hair was suddenly soft and actually had movement instead of feeling stiff.  It also brought out shiny golden highlights in my light brown color. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Her hair feels sexy and smooth all day long! It smells good too but the price it a little bit over too much...maybe it it&#x27;s 5 buck cheaper i will give it a 4.8</li>
            <li> this is always a great little addition to smoothe your hair and it mixes well with other products.  the smell is wonderful.  I use it infrequently and love it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist started using this on my hair and it works ok, but I like my cheaper products better. If you look at the ingredient list, it&#x27;s mainly silicone (not that it&#x27;s on the bottle itself...kind of suspicious).  The name sounds like it&#x27;s some natural product that&#x27;s very exotic and, at the price, it should be, but it&#x27;s really just a slicking product that uses silicone.  I have some gels that use silicone and work better.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It is light on my hair and gives it a nice soft feel. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like an oily feel to their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other oil treatment so I can&#x27;t compare. However, my hair is very dry from bleaching (blonde) and curling irons and flat irons, etc.  This stuff did a great job of getting rid of the frizzy ends.  It&#x27;s not a permanent solution. When I wash my hair all the frizzies come back, but I just put the oil back in and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil and I love the Light version very much!  I have fine hair and Morocan Oil Light is perfect for it.  I also feel regardless of your hair type the Moroccan Oil regular/light is excellent.  It conditions, shines and keeps those frizzies at bay!  Living in Texas I learned what humidity really is and this product works.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it all the time and I&#x27;ll recommend it to others AND I re order every time I run out.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I could have used for my hair.</li>
            <li> may be responsible for some chest zits but my hair loves it! the big one comes with a pump so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo, conditioner and oil. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily. I use to use the regular but have learned that the light is best for fine haired blondes!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Shipped every fast and is great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Good on me. My hair keeps getting better everyday. Truly wont let you down.</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat frizzy hair.  I use this after towel drying, use accordingly to the amount of hair you have.  I blow dry with a big round brush and my hair is silky and voluminous.  Smells wonderful.  I use the &#x27;light&#x27; because I have blonde hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, this is the morrocon oil you should be using. A little goes on a long way, only apply at the ends. Great product!</li>
            <li> I color and heat style my hair and Moroccan Oil has kept my hair very soft and just plain healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Was replacing a bottle that leaked. My hairdresser uses it on my hair, and it makes my hair so soft and controllable. If you have thick, long, curly hair I would highly recommend it. The only draw back was the price. I got it from a supply house for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> Best product i have ever used on my hair! My hair shines and smells absolutely wonderful.  Always get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> I love both the Moroccanoil Light and the Regular formula.  They calm and soften my thick coarse, wavy hair without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> OMG PLEASE BUY THIS IT HAS MADE MY HAIR LOOK LIKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING EVER!! Its not dry or stringy anymore and its so heavy and thick not, I can wear a pony tail and be confident!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have tried many in the past and this is hands down the best thing I have used on my hair! The shipping was super fast and I cannot say enough good things about the oil, other than to get some!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and never have to blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I have unruly curly frizzy hair and this product mixed with the Curl cream totally transforms my hair…love love love</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine dry hair and I have to use quite a bit of the light oil. Next time I will purchase the regular oil instead. All in all this stuff is hands down amazing compared to the cheap off brand that I used to buy from Target.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My hair is soft and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> This product really helps reduce frizz and makes my hair look healthier and shiny.  The trick is not to use too much, or it can make your hair appear oily, but just the right amount (about a quarter size in the palm of your hand) works perfectly.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this oil into wet hair makes it manageable and silky. A drop on dry hair tames the fly-aways. Never greasy.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! Leaves your hair smooth and shine. No need any other product. Only a small amount of it and you are done.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other product in the market better than this one. And it is true that in thin oily hair it does not get sticky... I absolutely love it and would advise anyone to buy it. Try to use after you dry your hair and you will see it with an incredible shine!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best hair product  out there! a little pricey but it goes a long way  you only need a little  to stop frizz and condition</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. The smell is so nice and it does wonders for my hair. I like the container for the larger size..easier to use.</li>
            <li> Seemed to make my hair fizzy when curly. Fine when I straighten it. I will go back to the regular Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> my hair condition is getting better after using this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to use this oil who have bad condition hair</li>
            <li> Love this product and have used it for some time. I have baby fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like some do.</li>
            <li> Ranks with the salon Moraccan Oils.  Would recommend for shine and softness.  Easy to pump into hand and then apply where it is needed the most.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair with a silky texture without making it greasy, wonderful smell and it is easy to style it.  I have very long hair and I have used this product for a few years.  I have tried other brands and cheaper products.  Some of them make your hair look very greasy or I can&#x27;t stand the smell, particularly when it is over saturated with flower smells.  Moroccan Oil is the perfect combination of aromas and the argan oil does wonder to the hair.  My daughters have long hair too and they also like this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil Light since it was recommended to me by my stylist.  Although my hair is not especially dry, I live in a dry climate.  What I like most about the oil versus other treatments is the fragrance!</li>
            <li> It is a MUST if you have anything but forever undyed hair. Between cuts, this will prevent split ends from happening.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff for your hair. Love it and it smells so wonderful. Enjoy putting in my hair...... yum yum</li>
            <li> All around great!!!!fast service</li>
            <li> This leave my hair so shinny... Like in magazines! Best thing I have ever found! Pair with Frizz Control spray and its perfection.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, use it after I towel dry my hair after every wash no matter what. I have long, blonde hair (processed) and this stuff keeps it strong and healthy. I have used the regular oil and the light. Since I do have lighter hair, I do prefer the light, though there isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li> I love Morrocan Oil Treatment Light.  It is a must for those of us with frizzy and crazy hair!  I use it whether or not I blow dry.  The smell alone is delightful.  The way my hair feels is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It smells so good and makes your hair very soft. I also really like that it came with a pump.</li>
            <li> This is an oil that does not weigh down your hair.  You can apply it to wet or dry hair.  I am a white female and find it nourishing to my hair since I do not wash my hair but once a week.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me about the magic in a bottle... This works really well for colored and processed hair! I love it! The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and use it on my skin it work wonderful and my skin is very soft</li>
            <li> Recently switched from hair serums to the Moroccan oil.  It is light and leaves my hair silky and smooth without being oily or having a build up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works as well as the regular version.  My daughter fell into the hype that the regular oil made blonde hair darker, so we switched to Light.  While I have never noticed any darkening of her blonde hair from the regular Moroccan oil, I have noticed that the hair is not nearly as healthy looking with this light version.  My other daughter has also noticed many more tangles since the switch as well.</li>
            <li> I used silk theraphy for a long time but was told by a friend about this product. She gave me a sample and i liked it a lot so i bought the big bottle! Everyday when my hair is about half dry i put this on. Its a must since i live in Cali where the sun is so strong! I feel my hair is less frizzy and more silky.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product that I have ever used. It is weightless. This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love the entire line of Moroccanoil products. They have transformed my hair from a wild frizzy mess to be shiny, healthy and manageable.  The Frizz control works best when combined with the light treatment oil for styling.  I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron so much on humid days. Blow it out with round brush, touch up with flat iron and blow out slightly again to loosen some of my waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already bought the regular oil so I am using it up when I don&#x27;t style it.  I have another tip from my hairdresser.....when you are going to pull back your hair for sports or beach day, put some hydrating conditioner and use up some of the regular treatment oil in your hair and leave it on! The heat (under your hat) will activate it to deep condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive but worth the cost. You don&#x27;t have to use alot of product to get results so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this Moroccan Oil on my hair at the salon and my hair feels great.  However, when I use Moroccan Oil at home I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.  I think it might be that my hairdresser doesn&#x27;t use the light Moroccan Oil and that&#x27;s what I purchased.  I will say that I have long, blond, fine hair and this product does not weigh my hair down and I use 2 nickle size pumps.  I think it&#x27;s a good product, but once used, I will go with the regular Moroccan Oil over the light.</li>
            <li> I have fine (silky,) thick, long, curly hair that I struggled to wear curly for a long time because it just looked frizzy/messy.  A stylist used this on me for a blow out and I loved it.  Took some home and experimented with my curls.  Now, I comb through my wet hair, apply Moroccan Oil to everywhere EXCEPT near my scalp (so I can get two days of wear without washing) scrunch with a damp towel, spray a fine hairspray from the bottom up through the curls and let air dry.  Once dry I use my fingers to separate my curls by quickly raking (side to side) through my hair up by the roots (NOT in my actual curls.)  Now, I get curls my daughters like to wrap around their fingers and because I no longer diffuse it, several stylists have commented on the great condition of my hair.  LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The best treatment for dry or healthy hair. It makes your hair look and feel so healthy. It also drys faster when using a blow dryer. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product and will buy again. Good price also</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I have tried several other brands and Moroccan oil is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic really makes my hair feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li> Have tried this product before years ago.  Glad to be using it again.</li>
            <li> I liked so much the product. It is really good. I recomend for all kind of hair. It looks brilliant.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this for my curly hair. This one product has replaced using 2 or 3 other products.</li>
            <li> One of the best things on earth.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil for your hair. It is expensive but worth it. You can you this on your hair or enemy on your face and body. You don&#x27;t need to use very much. A little goes a long way. No greasy residue left in your hair and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> When they say light, they really mean it. I have dark, fine hair and I&#x27;ve used macadamia oil before. The macadamia was better in my opinion, but this one isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s just TOO light, even for my really fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price wise this product is a bit high compared to what it does.</li>
            <li> I had used this product for about a year.  It was given to me by a salon technician.  She wanted to try it on my hair since I have really long hair.  It seemed to be ok.  Then a year later, I started using a hair shampoo that dried my hair out so bad I thought I was going to have to cut it.  (I had already trimmed it twice).  So I looked for more of the product and in stores it was more expensive than I wanted to spend.  So I started looking up deals on the internet.  I found it at Amazon for about a 1/3 of the price, but had to pay shipping.  Still, total it was about 1/3 of the price - a real bargain.  IT WORKS.  It does not make my hair oily or heavy like the bargain brands, and I have tried them all.  This is the best oil on the market that I have found so far.  So, if you have fine hair, buy the light.  If you have normal to heavy thick hair, buy the original.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  And by the way, I am almost 60, color my hair, and it keeps it looking young and healthy.  This is the best Moroccan Oil on the market as far as I am concerned.  I am very happy with Amazon.  Thanks Amazon for helping me be able to afford this product.</li>
            <li> Great for all hair types, oily, dry, straight, curly, thick, thin hair.... Makes your hair healthy and strong.  It&#x27;s basically a leave in conditioner, which they don&#x27;t say since it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; not a &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.  Can use it wet or dry.  Though mostly recommend wet and then if your hair is dry between washes; touch up the ends. I&#x27;ve never had build up with it and since I have curly, dry hair; I pile it on.  It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It even comes w/ a twist in pump, if you prefer that over the pouring into your hand.  Helps control how much product comes out, since the oil can come out pretty quick out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love big, big hair! And since my hair is bigger when it&#x27;s drier, there&#x27;s a comprise sometimes w/ other leave ins that hydrate my hair but weigh it down.  This is perfect!  Get big hair and it&#x27;s hydrated &amp; my curls are very happy! A 10!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product again and again.  It is amazing for curly hair.  Gives you moisture, cuts frizz and smoothes flyaways.  I apply this mid-shaft to the ends of my hair and scrunch it through and that&#x27;s the only product my naturally curly hair needs.  Also it smells heavenly and seems to make my hair dry more quickly.  This is like my fourth bottle.  Miracle product.  I would agree with previous reviewers, the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; I believe refers to the color, recommended for blondes, not the texture.  The oil itself is just as thick as the regular formulation in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever, for super dry damaged hair I will ever use.  I have used so many oil products, but it never stayed in my hair to keep it healthy, no breakage and shine.  After using Moroccanoil for a month my hair has never looked so much healthier and it goes a long way.  This would last me up to 5 months, so this is worth every penny.  It works great for colored hair, perms.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  :)</li>
            <li> The Light Moroccan Oil is perfect for my fine naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, adds softness and shine.  And it smells good too!!!  Doesn&#x27;t even weigh down my fine hair either.</li>
            <li> i love it!! this light hair oil make my hair looks healthy but not too oily. i must buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, good price, quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is a light treatment to help dryness in hair.  I selected it because it is not heavy and to use in color-treated hair.  A couple pumps, blend in palm of hands and work through the hair and then style.  It is easy to use, I see definite difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and always leaves my long, thick hair feeling silky and smelling good!</li>
            <li> I use this everytime I get out of the shower before I blow dry. My hair stylist is always surprised at how few split ends I have whenever I go in to see her! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Been purchasing this for years.  Smoothes and moisturizes hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fast service!</li>
            <li> Best hair product on the market!</li>
            <li> Gets rid of frizzies and loose fly aways (at time of use/with each usage, until next washing). Helps reduce breakage from highlighting. Smells awesome! Though directions say to use 1-2 pumps, I use 7-8 to tackle my breakage frizzies. Love the feel and look. Soaks in &amp; does not look greasy.</li>
            <li> makes my hair really soft. a bit expensive, but i do think it&#x27;s worth it! really helps damaged hair. so yeah, overall very happy!</li>
            <li> Really enjoy it and can see and feel the difference. Can highly recommend to use it for the hair to look healthy and feel soft</li>
            <li> i love this product.  you want your to shine? moroccan oil.  you want more volume? poooof. moroccan oil. your hair in need of a little more strength? answer? you guessed it. moroccan oil.  you want to apply this amazing moroccan oil on your hair? well you&#x27;re kind of out of luck.  you kind of need the pump to transfer the oil from the bottle to the surface of your hand. but the pump is missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product itself, the oil, the great moroccan oil, is fine.  but what good is a good product if you can&#x27;t put it to use because the shipper forgot to put a working pump in the package?!!!  What would have been a five star review, is now a one star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every time i try to apply this oil to my hair, i have to unscrew the cap, which is now slippery because of all the oil on the cap.  what else? the bottle is slippery from the oil too.  instead of focusing on putting that shine, that volume, and that strength in my hair, i have to also worry about this glass bottle slipping out of my hands and my hopes of voluminous, shiny, and healthy hair shattering into hundreds of little glass pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE&#x27;S MY PUMP??!!!</li>
            <li> I first has my hair stylist use this on me. I fell in love. I have fine blonde hair, and it used to break before I could get it longer than my shoulders. Now my hair is over halfway down my back. I use it every day as soon as I get out of the shower. It also helps my hair dry fast. This is great if you have light blonde hair. The regular oil is great, but it left my hair with a brassy tone. The light version is perfect for my color! I can&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair and also body - the smell is incredible. LOVE this stuff!! Great value on Amazon vs salons, too.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!! Makes hair so soft and helps with frizz!</li>
            <li> I love this product for my thin,dry hair.  I use it instead of conditioner.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product and I have to admit, after using it for years I can&#x27;t go without it! You only need a small amount applied at the ends of wet hair to keep your hair soft and keep the &amp;#34;fly always&amp;#34; at bay. I have longer hair and use 2 pumps. I rub my hands together, smooth it on my ends, then massage the remaining residue into the rest of my hair. On weekends when I&#x27;ve skipped this product my hair looks awful.&lt;br /&gt;A bottle typically last me about 3 months - and I use it daily. A great styling tool that really does work. I&#x27;ve used the regular formula, as well as the light but noticed no difference in the product.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and Original Product!&lt;br /&gt;100% satisfied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but you don&#x27;t use much as each pump is about 1/4 tsp. It works well to seal the ends of your hair to prevent split ends.</li>
            <li> Everything this company produceing is just fantastic. I have the oil and the the spray for blond hair and I am very happy with it. My hair never looked better and it is so soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Works fine on my hair.  The seller made sure the package was well packed.</li>
            <li> It was recieved on time and within the time expected. My wife loves the product and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and definitely decreases the amount of drying time. Doesn&#x27;t really understand why it&#x27;s called a treatment though as it is essentially just an oil for your hair.</li>
            <li> Hair texture is smooth and hot.</li>
            <li> i bought this a couple years ago i used it but its not pure argan oil ,its not natural ,its full of fillers and silicons .it might work for you but keep in mind you&#x27;re using chemicals .&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t even say ARGAN OIL on it  and its expensive !&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s a new product in the market its called jasmine&#x27;s secret is the bomb ,pure argan oil ,hand made and created by professionals&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price and great results</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.. when I straighten my hair I use it on the ends and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair :)</li>
            <li> This is ideal for naturally any hair grade. Mine is thick and wavy to the root. This oil detangles and softens hair, especially after washing hair, even blow drying.</li>
            <li> This is hair crack. The best product on the market for hair. Makes hair look healthy. Keeps hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> Put some on every day and watch your hair become glossy and glamorous!! I used chi for several years until I discovered this product!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. The best product to nourish your hair. I will definitely purchase this again.  The only thing I notice is they change the consistency. It&#x27;s more liquidy now than before it is super thick and concentrated. But I still love it!</li>
            <li> Without a doubt moroccan oil light treats processed and damaged hair well.. i find it leaves my hair moisturised and doesn&#x27;t weight it down a ton.  Where i feel it lacks is it&#x27;s effect on bleached hair - while the light variety is supposed not to deposit tones on blonde or white hair I can&#x27;t help but feel that it does.  Not as much as normal Moroccanoil, but this oil will noticeably yellow ash toned hair even after one application.  A quick toner or purple shampoo will neutralize that, but the product won&#x27;t work unless you leave it in for a certain amount of time and use it regularly... so i find myself in a cycle of using it, toning it out, and using it again... and so on.</li>
            <li> This treatment is fairly light in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed race hair which is quite long and frizzy. Possibly I needed something more potent than the light treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was beautiful. I did noticed a softness to my hair when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for taming unwanted frizz, I did notice a very slight decrease in frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment made my hair look a little darker on occasions which I did not enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be ideal for individuals who have very fine hair. Would be ideal for bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I need to admit, It works very well. The difference between before and after on my wife&#x27;s hair is great. She has a very dense and heavy hair, and this product helps her a lot.</li>
            <li> My long hair has become dry and hard to manage...this product really helps with the tangles, the body and the sheen.  Good going!</li>
            <li> This product has the most beautiful fragrance. I had extremely dry skin and this helps my skin stay supple and smooth a lot longer than other products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it when my hair is damp or dry. Bottle is the large size and comes with the pump applicator. Arrived quickly. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! Helps my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is shiny and holds curls all day when I use this oil.  I&#x27;ve tried several different oils and nothing works as well as this does.</li>
            <li> This is the best product i have bought in years for my hair!!! My hair is shinier and stronger! I LOVE it and cant live without it anymore!</li>
            <li> Arrived Fast great product great price</li>
            <li> Will make your hair, feel, smell and look wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff I think it&#x27;s great I think it is really really good for your hair and helps it grow and really it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> My hair becomes smooth after use this. And the scent is great!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair and smell nice.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have fine but thick hair that is shoulder lenght and slightly fuzzy. My hair was never fuzzy when I was younger, it was always straight and smooth.  I bought lots of products to try to eliminate the dry fuzzy ends and none of them really did a good job.  I tried the original Morroccan Oil and really liked the results.  Then I tried the light treatment and have to say I love this one even better.  I use it only on my ends and it makes my hair look so shiny and smooth. I tried many other products to eliminate frizz and add shine and no other product is as good as this one.  I will always use Moroccanoil for my hair.</li>
            <li> Thought it would repair and change the texture of my hair and I was wrong! It smells great but has not made my hair silly as I thought it would. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Has never left hair oily.  Just soft and shiney</li>
            <li> This hair oil does wonders to my hair! it eases my frizz and makes it smoother. If you&#x27;re thinking of getting it the best place to get it, that I&#x27;ve found, is right here! it was so much more cheaper than what my hair stylist sold it to me for. definite buy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it keeps my hair healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> perfect for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets limp and gross with products that are too heavy. This works great, smooths without adding weight.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Moroccan oil in a salon but decided to buy from Amazon this time. I think it&#x27;s not the real thing because the texture feels completely different, it leaves a sort of sticky residue on your hands. This is a product I use daily and I know how it absorbs into my skin and hair. The product I received didn&#x27;t so I returned it for a refund. I&#x27;ve purchased many other products through Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue with a possible fake product.</li>
            <li> For the last several years my hair has been my worst enemy: Tangles easily, dry, breakage, just all around unmanigible (it is very fine). Therefore it&#x27;s rare that i last very long wearing my hair down, and i really want to be able to wear my hair down! However, this stuff has changed everything! my hair is soft, more durable, less breakage and i can run my fingers through it easily even after a long day and getting wind blown (so much less tangled)! And the best part, there is no greasy residue whatsoever!!! GREAT STUFF!! So glad i was able to come across this product and ordered it. Five star product for sure.</li>
            <li> love the way this product makes my hair feel.I have very fine hair and can&#x27;t use most serums. This is very light  - only use one small pump. Great shine and silky feel</li>
            <li> This is what happens more and more on amazon. you will get the fake stuff. be aware that you are always running a risk of getting an item from a different country..different mixtures..mine was from israel i believe.&lt;br /&gt;it made my wife&#x27;s hair greasy instead of smooth and shiny. we returned it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. Great product</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I have yet to find any other oil that works as well, or smells better...and I have tried a lot of them!  My hair stays smooth and shiny for days. I don&#x27;t live in a humid climate, though...so I can&#x27;t attest to how it works in a coastal environment.  But in Colorado it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is a life saving product for my hair.  It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t effect my day to day styling, but it keeps my hair hydrated and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  Makes my hair very shiny and manageable....not greasy! A little goes a long way, so you can stretch your dollar.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular Moroccan Oil and it worked great on my hair.  My only issue was that the regular version was a little expensive.  I noticed that the light version was less expensive, so I figured I would try it and so far it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. I have very fine and thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it heavy or oily. Instead, it gives my hair a nice sheen and healthy feel. I use it every other day and it keeps my hair very healthy!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product at my salon and love it. I use it to keep the tangles out of my little ones hair and on my little guy to keep his hair under control. It smells so good too. They love it.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best! Definitely spend the money on the larger size. The 25 ml is pointless. Leaves hair SOFT not oily</li>
            <li> My hair is course and this product is wonderful to make it soft &amp; manageable.  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> This product works better for me than the regular Moroccanoil which is a little heavy for my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li> if I could do it again, I would NOT spend this amount of money on this product.  The less expensive options i&#x27;ve tried (literally every single one) were better in EVERY CATEGORY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used argan oil (various brands)  in my hair for well over a year, and have always been very impressed by the results.  I thought that with the overall ratings of this particular item, it would be worth it.  I was mistaken.  Given the price tag, you would think this is like, the pinacle of hair treatment success.  IT&#x27;S NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis, and if I didn&#x27;t know better, i&#x27;d think that THIS was the ineffective cheap-o product.  It&#x27;s just NOT very good.  My hair is nowhere NEAR what it&#x27;s been with other similar products - less managable, less shiny, no decrease in drying time, etc.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my hair seeming greasy at ALL with any product of this kind - EXCEPT THIS ONE.  To top it all off, the fragrance (the one that everyone is raving about... which... well, i&#x27;m just baffled by.  maybe they haven&#x27;t tried anything else and this is somehow impressive?  the scent is kinda \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;) is sort of muddled - it seems to tone down the scent of whatever shampoo you&#x27;ve used, but replaces it with something that just kinda smells... bleh.... you wind up with hair that smells... clean-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, i&#x27;m not alone in my disappointment - my mother bought the exact same product (on the same day, from the same seller) - and she had the same results.  No decrease in frizz, no improvement in texture, nothing positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that people think that this is the magic unicorn of hair oil treatments - but it&#x27;s just not.  the label is very pretty.  but the product is a giant let down.  In short - JUST GET THE CHEAP STUFF.  it works better anyway.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil - Makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> ok but doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the original</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!  Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted; my hair is amazingly soft and easily detangled with a few drops of this. I have thin hair strands so I appreciate the light formula for not giving me super grease! I&#x27;ve tried the cheaper versions at the drugstores and I always end up giving that away to friends with thicker hair and shelling out for this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just purchased Moroccanoil Treatment Light and was very happy with the results.  It works better on my fine hair than the original formula, keeping it soft and shiny without weighing it down. It also keeps the frizzies to a minimum and has the same scent.  Glad they make this alternative!</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d product....No leaks....(ordered from other site...item was leaking)  Not this one!! Perfect Delivery...Will order again...Prompt &amp; on time ! The price was right.  Love this hair treatment....Tried other brands that claim Moroccanoil....This is the original and the best..The Light version for me works the best.</li>
            <li> I accidently bought Light (for blondes) instead of the regular.  So pay close attention when ordering.  I love Moroccan Oil and use it daily.  It adds a nice shine to your hair without being greasy and only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel so incredibly soft and the light version is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I got it quickly and it&#x27;s original. I&#x27;m good with this.</li>
            <li> This oil is so wonderful for your hair and even skin. The smell is lovely and it helps tame my dry, grey hair without being greasy. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> controls the fly aways with the dry weather</li>
            <li> If my hair wet feels very smooth, but after that it gets dry, worest if I used dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and love it for a long time. I was just browsing for a more affordable version on Amazon, and bingo! I found it. Will definitely replenish my stock here again once it runs out.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my hair and even though its oil it doesnt leave my hair greasy at all. Its expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Light version is not as effective as regular.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  Well worth the money.  My hair is looking so much healthier.  The light oil works great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with the product. It is the more effective one she had already tried and the best cost-benefit one.</li>
            <li> This product gives my fine damaged hair a sheen without making it limp or greasy. Smells nice too.  Also seems to reduce static.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the normal version, not the light, but I bought this one by mistake and I like it as well. My hair has been really good lately, and I know that it&#x27;s not only due to this product, but I would not live without it. I love the final touch it provides and the extra protection from weather.</li>
            <li> I love it, it just takes a small amt. I use it after I wash my hair and I don&#x27;t need conditioner...It also has a very nice smell...</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and this makes it feel so much fuller without being greasy or weighing it down. Just rub between hands and then on ends of hair before drying. Gives a nice shine to dull hair. Worth the money as a little goes a long way. It will last a very long time. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, thin and with fine highlights. I combine this product with Morrocanoil Smoothing Lotion (just like they did at the hair salon) and I am very happy with the result. I love the smell on my hair and the smooth and defined curls. Also, using these products I wash my hair now every 3rd day instead of every 2nd day. Great products, makes my hair feel special and pampered.</li>
            <li> This product is just sooo amazing!! My hair is sooo soft and shiny since I&#x27;ve been using it! 100% satified!!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and I love it makes my hair so soft.  Also manageable I will be ordering more Great product</li>
            <li> LOVE this...Does not weight your hair down and makes your hair look shiny and healthy...Would buy it again...Peggy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great and works great.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very shiny and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> I have thin fragile hair and I&#x27;d recommend regular kind</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and not greasy.  Highly recommend!  Delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> I live in the high desert and this is the best product for keep my hair healthy and soft!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and after washing gets tangled easily, even with conditioner.  Moroccan Oil really helps to comb through.  It&#x27;s great when drying my hair as the brush glides through easily.  In the winter months it helps to keep my hair from drying out  and in summer it really helps to keep it from frizzing in the humidity.  I was a little hesitant at first thinking it would weigh my hair down and make it look flatter than it already is, but it doesn&#x27;t do that at all!!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> am still using this oil, I love it!! it is light and not greasy or sticky and too shinny either. it helps protecting my hair from the hair dryer&#x27;s heat.</li>
            <li> l love it .I use it for myself and my daughter too.</li>
            <li> Great product - makes my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and manageable. I have tried Redkens Diamond oil, and the all soft serum and neither compare to this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic in a bottle! If you&#x27;re hair is fly-away or dry try it. Your hair will be so soft people will want to pet you.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser turned me on to this product..it works perfectly with my hair which is thick but fine and mostly straight...it makes my hair shine and keeps my scalp healthy....love it...is is all i use after I wash my hair besides a little spray...</li>
            <li> This oil smells great. Its light texture will not weigh down your hair. If you have curly hair and looking to straighten out those curls this oil will help when used with heat (hair dryer, flat iron etc).  It will not untangle your hair but it does a great job at smoothing out your hair and protecting it from drying. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair for the first time and was a little concerned about how dry my ends had become. Moroccan oil saved my ends and makes me hair soft after every wash, even on my dry/damaged hair. I highly recommend this product for anyone with dry/damaged/coloured hair</li>
            <li> If you want healthy, shiny hair buy this product.  Great for any age and hair type.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years on my untamable naturally curly hair!  Cheaper than buying in in the salon!!!!  Wonderful</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is just amazing-- and you will not find the price cheaper anywhere else than it is on amazon. I can&#x27;t afford it from the salon, but I&#x27;ve purchased it through amazon twice and have been very happy both times. It leaves your hair silky smooth and shiny, even without any styling. I always put it in right after my shower and let my hair airdry. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it now that I&#x27;m used to using it. It&#x27;s the ONLY hair product I use every day.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It met and exceeded my expectations. My hair feels so soft and smells amazing. I get so many compliments on how my hair smells. I received it very fast. I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference in my hair, I even use the left over from my hands and rub it on my elbows.  it works great on hair and skin.  especially here in the hot desert area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great treatment.. Leaves my hair very soft.. It helps with freeze.. People ask me what shampoo I use cause it smells great..</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  She asked for it and I bought it for her. She has amazing healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Works great salon quality.</li>
            <li> This lightweight oil is perfect for my hair.  It helps during the after shampoo comb through, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, adds to the shine, and makes a natural sleekness to my style.  Much better than heavy conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> 3 pumps of this and my hair is tangle free and smells so wonderful.  I use it on damp hair before I blow dry and I have used this for about 4 years.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is great for smoothing rough hair and adding shine.  It also has a great light, fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love this morracan oil! It smells great and makes my hair soft and have less frizz. Also it was a great price compared to other places I have looked! I will definitely be purchasing another bottle in the future from amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing product and the light color worked perfectly with my blonde hair. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love it! I started using it in Arizona when it was recommended by my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out and used a substitute and it was not nearly as good so I was happy to find it&lt;br /&gt;again at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  When I first heard about &amp;#34;Moroccan Oil Treatment&amp;#34; I thought Pssh!  Another overpriced &#x27;hair miracle&#x27;.  Then my hair stylist gave me a sample.  I loved it!  But I wasn&#x27;t going to pay the ridiculous price of what the salon wanted.  I found this online, and it is exactly the same as the salon, just less!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and almost half the price of purchase in salons</li>
            <li> Saw Moroccanoil mentioned by a TV News person, not a paid advertisement. Her long dark hair was shinny and always looked beautify.  Decided to try and I picked the Light because my hair is white and didn&#x27;t want to turn it yellow.  Smells wonderful, only needs a few drops so the cost is not as expensive as it seems.  Lots of immitation moroccan oil but this is really good stuff.  Nice on cuticles too.</li>
            <li> Works great for my fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick dry hair.  I can&#x27;t live without this product! Love it / I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product.  It is a must have for anyone with dry hair or bad hair days on rain or humid days!  PERFECT Product!</li>
            <li> Works well with the Gold Glimmer for every day use. Great leave in conditioner for the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> The best hair oil i ever used. My hair was complrtrly changed. It is magic. Love it so much.</li>
            <li> Really like this oil. It&#x27;s light and easy to work with, makes my hair feel softer after using and seems to last awhile too. This is my new go to oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair has never look this good.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, wavy, thick hair and it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to heat style it and achieve a sheen without Moroccan Oil. I really do like the stuff, but I have to go easy near my roots because it&#x27;s easy to make the hair too oily.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my hair!  It makes it shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> been using this oil for years......the best never makes  your hair oily, only leaves it soft and manageable and it last&#x27;s forever, over a year or longer, use very little, maybe the size of a dime....worth the price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s making my hair so soft, and the product smells good too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, it makes my hair so soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It leave my hair shiny and nice.  Smells wonderful too.  I put quite a big in my long hair and flat-iron it.  Never looks greasy; just looks sleek.</li>
            <li> I have fine, blonde hair that I also highlight. I always have had fly away, broken ends. Not anymore, sister! Comes in a pump so one pump is the perfect amount to put on your ends. I have oily hair so I only use it on the ends. To finish I use the Moroccan Oil Shine Spray. Their products work so well and smell SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine textured and I like to use the Moroccanoil Light in it because it conditions my hair and makes it shiny.  But, I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my hair will get too oily if I do.  It is a good product, though, and I use it often to control static.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry, so after drying it I put just a very small amount on the palm of my hand and run it through my hair.</li>
            <li> Best product for my unruly coarse and frizzy hair yet</li>
            <li> I love this oil for my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, just soft and shiny.  I use the light because my hair is a lighter color.  I have tried other oils that were sort of the same, but none smell as wonderful.  I happen to love a good scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because my mom recommended me and it was really awesome for my long hair.  My hair gets really dry at the ends and have split ends.  After I start using the products, my hair look much healthier, shiny and smoother!  Also, the seller was great, fast shipping and great package, will buy from them again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is part of my daily regimen.  I have very fine, blonde hair.  It completely changes my hairs&#x27; texture and feel without leaving it darker or greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like the light version of the oil and use a small amount 1/2 teaspoon on my hair after the shower.  Towel dry your hair, mix the small amount of product between your hands and rub through your hair.  I stay away from the scalp and focus on the ends.  My hair is shiny, lasts several days without shampooing again.  This product tames the fly-aways and is good on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Omg.....I like this sosososso much! I like this smell and it makes my hair looks well! I can&#x27;t believe that it is so useful! U deserve buy one to enjoy smooth hair!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years! Delivers soft, shiny, frizz-free hair that smells amazing. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be put off by the price. One bottle will last a very, very long time!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! The product talks for itself. It works great on my hair, considering that I have oily hair. It makes my hair feel silky and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this is rated as one of the best moroccon hair oils. I replaced my loreal hair serum with this but it does nothing to my hair. I feel my hair has become more frizzy than ever after starting to use this product. It is a disappointment considering its price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years and I love it. It leaves my long hair soft and shiny. It easy to comb out my thick long hair after I use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and I love it!  It smells and feels great. I very highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and love it.  recently I began cancer treatments that resulted in dry, thinning hair. Today I am using it daily and work it into my roots. It really helps to keep my scalp moisturized . It is not greasy and does not weigh my hair down - my hair looks and feels naturally soft.</li>
            <li> Exceptional Product!  My hair looks so healthy.  I would recommend this product to everyone. I wish I had known about Morocccan Oil sooner.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of oil, it smells so good and leaves my crazy wavy, knotting tendencies beautifully shiny and healthy. Worth the brand price and bought directly from amazon, so I know it&#x27;s the real product.</li>
            <li> I thought this was ok, worked OK when used in small amounts on damp hair, but realized it&#x27;s full of chemicals. I switched to real Argan oil (light formula).</li>
            <li> This smell great. I love using on my hair.  It&#x27;s just the cost could be better</li>
            <li> Best for thick, dry hair. Adds shine without making your hair look greasy</li>
            <li> this product is awesome!! recommend people should get one and it only takes few drop already enough.</li>
            <li> I have used both original and light oil.  I have baby fine hair so the light works awesome.</li>
            <li> This Light Moroccan oil is amazing. I have soft silky hair, even with a few wirey (colored treated) gray hairs. I have fine hair and the light oil is very forgiving if you use a little more than needed. I LOVE IT and it will always be in my hair care regimen....</li>
            <li> Nothing like this for coarse gray hair.  Leaves it soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product ... Still wondering why the QR code was scratched off my bottle ??? Weird, almost makes me think something is not legit.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used. Really adds body and shine without weighing hair down. A bit pricey, but cost a lot more in salons with their mark ups.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair which can become frizzy.  A pump or two of this Moroccan Oil Treatment smooths the frizzies, and makes the hair shine.  It also has a wonderful scent.  Place a pump or two into the palm of your hand, rub palms together and apply to hair a few inches from the root down to the tip.  Can apply wet or dry.  I apply after washing my hair.  My hair stylist believes one should not wash their hair everyday as it strips essential oils from the scalp, so I apply it again on the second day to smooth it out once again and freshen the scent.  Works great!</li>
