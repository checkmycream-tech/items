    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The gel is perfect for application purposes.  </li>
            <li>When I run out (and I do my best to NEVER let that happen)</li>
            <li>Your service is always excellent.  </li>
            <li>you want to keep your eyes shut to get the best use out of it...</li>
            <li>;&#x27; what I found for me that works the best..</li>
            <li>Best moisturizing drops I every used.  </li>
            <li>And then I saw the gel, and thought maybe it was a happy medium.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They are long-lasting and provide great relief for my eyes for 12-16 hours.  </li>
            <li>Great drops I competition pistol,shoot and</li>
            <li>these are great.  </li>
            <li>Some are good, some are great.  </li>
            <li>I think that over the years, I have tried a good number of the products out there:</li>
            <li>Novartis did to create the product, they did good</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to order.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my own experience of comparing two of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most effective nighttime relief.</li>
            <li>you have better product suggestions, please kindly let me know.</li>
            <li>However, every time I use the product, the relief gets better.  </li>
            <li>like this quite well.  much better for me than the gooey ointment</li>
            <li>How?&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the magic is in the resilient (pharmacokinetic) delivery of the product.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t love getting the drops</li>
            <li>The gel works better for me than the drops.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I followed his advice.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>The Similansan Eye Drops performs much better and much more convenient.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>So be sure to get SEVERE.</li>
            <li>And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t sting the way other products this strong and effective might.  </li>
            <li>Works great, and almost no waste.</li>
            <li>gel is great because it has preservatives in it, but they dissipate completely when it hits your eyes.</li>
            <li>(need to look at the mirror) and it is easy to cause the blurry vision after applied.</li>
            <li>Yes, this SEVERE gel works very well for me, the best product I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders and I would highly suggest for you or your beloved pet.</li>
            <li>These eye drops are very good for my severely dry eyes.</li>
            <li>I bought these after Lasik eye surgery because the picture of the box on Amazon says they are preservative free in the eye.  </li>
            <li>The drops keep my eyes from drying out while I sleep, greatly minimizing the number of times I use Refresh Optimum eye drops daily to clear my vision and focus.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any longer than refresh presevatives free vials even though it&#x27;s a gel.  </li>
            <li>After 3 successful eye surgeries and trying almost every eye drop on the market, including 3 samples from my surgeon.....I will only use the Systane Lubricant Eye Drops in the vials.  </li>
            <li>I cannot give this product a great rating, because it was not what I needed for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>a great product for dry eyes...</li>
            <li>It would of course be just as wonderful on lightly dry eye problems,or even to refresh normal eyes.</li>
            <li>After that I have a good several hours of comfort.  </li>
            <li>But if you have a severe problem, the gel makes your eyes feel cool and heavenly.</li>
            <li>I will be much appreciated. :)</li>
            <li>Feels cool to the eye when I put it in.  </li>
            <li>Best thing I have found for my extra sever dry eye problem..</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really stunned, especially given that I had a good experience with GenTeal&#x27;s PM eye lubricant.</li>
            <li>If the burning doesn&#x27;t stop then it is maybe not the right eye drop for you and of course stop using.</li>
            <li>and/or made my eyes light sensitive.</li>
            <li>Her eyes are now healthy and white.</li>
            <li>If you have dry eyes, the kind that causes blurry vision and makes your eyes feel like sandpaper, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is a clear drop, but the drop falls onto your eye like this cool goo.  </li>
            <li>The gel does not blur the eye and can be applied easy enough.  </li>
            <li>this is the very best product for dry, red gritty sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>This is by far the very best product on the market for severe, gritty, red dry eyes I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The gel lubricates and soothes the eye gently and keeps them lubricated thoughout the day and night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you, I quickly really got into it.  </li>
            <li>so when I read the reviews I really thought it was going to work for me</li>
            <li>It is soothing tho, and night is when I really need help.</li>
            <li>Using this product about 3-4 times per day really beats the eye drops I had used until now.  </li>
            <li>The gel lasts a lot longer and is so much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>and this gel does the trick fast.</li>
            <li>The box I received is different and says nothing about being preservative free.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I like that they are essentially preservative free.</li>
            <li>They were very &#x27;jell-like&#x27; which I didn&#x27;t quite expect.  </li>
            <li>So much so, I became a slave to having drops in my purse, in my car, etc - because not to have them was a real emergency.</li>
            <li>This product does nothing for red, and itchy dry eyes, but it probably very good for normal non-allergy dry eyes.</li>
            <li>Holy cow, am I glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most efficient lubricant I have for my dry eye problem.</li>
            <li>My eyes also  appear larger,  because they are adequately lubricated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After some research my ever-resourceful lovely wife found out that the former condition could be handled by a product that cleanses the eyelids (OCuSOFT Lid Scrub Eyelid Cleanser); the latter is handled by \\&quot;GenTeal Lubricant Dry-Eye Relief Gel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a moderate case of dry eyes and this product works very well to give me several hours of good relief.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more practical to buy the double pack if you plan to use this product regularly.</li>
            <li>is that it only blurs your vision for ~1 minute and when it dries, it doesn&#x27;t leave some funky film around your eyelids like other more potent dry eye drops.</li>
            <li>I highly recommned</li>
            <li>Most of them dried my eyes out or made my eyes burn, sting, swell,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a  super sensitive vegan and I tried numerous products.</li>
            <li>I am a (cool) physician with dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>relevant products use some type of methylcellulose as the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li>When the new is about half used, cut the tip off the old tube just above the threads; be sure to use a clean, sterile, sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Great in cold weather too.</li>
            <li>I want to scream out loud.  </li>
            <li>At first, I felt that it was strange.  </li>
            <li>But I remember years ago when I tried my first eye drops that felt strange too!  </li>
            <li>They are preservative free, long lasting for me and instant relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Push the new tube tip into the opening of the old tube, and squeeze the last remaining contents of the old tube into the half-full newer tube.</li>
            <li>have also found that if you have slight burning at first when using eye drops/lubricants it is because of the eye being so dry and the burning should subside right away.  </li>
            <li>The doctor has given me at least 3 other sample brands &amp; this lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t blur my eyes for very many minutes when applied.  </li>
            <li>It is very lubricant like ans makes the eyes moist for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is kind of thick, but your visions clears fast after blinking a few times and it melts in your eyes.</li>
            <li>No other eye drops comes close to lubricating my eyes as GenTeal Gel.</li>
            <li>0.34 fl.oz) tube contains enough gel to last a good little while; I add two drops in each eye every night before bed and in the morning, very little dryness.  </li>
            <li>strong recommendation is that if you have slight, moderate OR severe dry eyes: Select this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I  suffered from Dry Eye Syndrome (scratchy, itchy,  gritty red eyes)  for six years and having DES can really wear on you!</li>
            <li>I put a tiny amount carefully into each eye and blink gently until my vision clears.  </li>
            <li>My personal feeling is that this one is really way ahead of all the other products of this type on the market.  </li>
            <li>Ointments are hard to clean out of one&#x27;s eyes and can only be used at bedtime.</li>
            <li>if you have truly severe dry eye, this offers relief for about 20-30 minutes tops.</li>

            <li> if you have truly severe dry eye, this offers relief for about 20-30 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> I mean, I saw the ointment first, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that people actually applied that stuff to their eyes.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as others here have pointed out -</li>
            <li> (GenTeal Severe Dry Eye Relief ONLY in this review).  </li>
            <li> My dry eye problem is helped a lot by using GenTeal several times a day.  </li>
            <li> My problem is, my dry eyes are caused by allergies, so they not only get very dry but they get very red and itchy.</li>
            <li> So when my physician suggested that I try one of the OTC dry eyes medications for the symptoms I was having, I put it off as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> Watching that little drop of water just teeter there on the edge of falling into my extremely sensitive eyes is equisite torture to me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this all the time.  The doctor has given me at least 3 other sample brands &amp; this lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t blur my eyes for very many minutes when applied.  Will purchase this again when I need it.  I have to use daytime drops about 3 or 4 times in a day and this seems to last through the night.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do eye drops.  I just can&#x27;t.  Watching that little drop of water just teeter there on the edge of falling into my extremely sensitive eyes is equisite torture to me.  I want to scream out loud.  And when the drop falls, and my reaction to blink takes over causing the drop to miss, it&#x27;s like being waterboarded.  When I see my ophthalmologist, the physician&#x27;s assistant yells at me to keep my eyes open when they give me drops.  I can&#x27;t!  I&#x27;m screaming inside when I get eye drops, and I usually end up with them all over my face.  So when my physician suggested that I try one of the OTC dry eyes medications for the symptoms I was having, I put it off as long as possible.  Headaches, fatigue, blurry vision, itchiness...you name it.  When my dry eyes were acting up, it would actually make me mistakenly think I was tired.  But when I was researching different possible OTC remedies, I came across this product.  I mean, I saw the ointment first, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that people actually applied that stuff to their eyes.  And then I saw the gel, and thought maybe it was a happy medium.  Holy cow, am I glad I made this purchase.  All I have to do is hold my bottom eyelid down and pop a drop in there.  Instant relief.  However, every time I use the product, the relief gets better.  I&#x27;m thinking this one deserves five stars.  The gel is perfect for application purposes.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.</li>
            <li> Reducing Waste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it is difficult to squeeze out the last bit of gel from the tube while holding it in place to hit  the eye, but there is a better way. When a tube begins to be difficult to manage, open a new one, and save the old. When the new is about half used, cut the tip off the old tube just above the threads; be sure to use a clean, sterile, sharp knife. Push the new tube tip into the opening of the old tube, and squeeze the last remaining contents of the old tube into the half-full newer tube. Works great, and almost no waste.</li>
            <li> I  suffered from Dry Eye Syndrome (scratchy, itchy,  gritty red eyes)  for six years and having DES can really wear on you! I&#x27;m a  super sensitive vegan and I tried numerous products. All of them made my eyes worse, than they already were. Most of them dried my eyes out or made my eyes burn, sting, swell, and/or made my eyes light sensitive. I also reacted badly to the super expensive prescription only, Restatis  and finally I tired the tear duct plugs knows as punctum plugs, with no improvement. I was so tired of wasting my money on products that only made my eyes worse. I finally tired GenTeal Gel this is the very best product for dry, red gritty sensitive eyes. The gel lubricates and soothes the eye gently and keeps them lubricated thoughout the day and night. I can use this product without any type of adverse reactions. Now the whites of my eyes are whiter and brighter. My eyes also  appear larger,  because they are adequately lubricated. This is by far the very best product on the market for severe, gritty, red dry eyes I&#x27;ve ever tried. GenTeal has been truly a miracle worker for me, and I feel that this product will give my eyes the time to heal and will reverse the negative long term effects of having Dry Eyes Syndrome.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes, the kind that causes blurry vision and makes your eyes feel like sandpaper, I highly recommend this product. There&#x27;s nothing like it. Don&#x27;t bother with icky petroleum based nighttime ointments. This is it. Instant soothing relief that lasts all night. When I run out (and I do my best to NEVER let that happen) my eyes literally hurt. Hope you&#x27;ll give it a try and experience real dry eye relief.</li>
            <li> Bottom-Line: \\&quot;GenTeal Lubricant Dry-Eye Relief Gel\\&quot; is expensive at $12.99 a tube but, I am sold on the product and I will continue to use it each night before slumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have taken to suffering from two eye conditions, no doubt brought on by Type 2 Diabetes: chronic and painful styes and chronic and painful dry-eye.  The latter is mostly suffered in the morning after a fitful night sleep, I wake to find my eyes very dry and equally as painful to open, the dryness feels like sandpaper under my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research my ever-resourceful lovely wife found out that the former condition could be handled by a product that cleanses the eyelids (OCuSOFT Lid Scrub Eyelid Cleanser); the latter is handled by \\&quot;GenTeal Lubricant Dry-Eye Relief Gel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 10g (0.34 fl.oz) tube contains enough gel to last a good little while; I add two drops in each eye every night before bed and in the morning, very little dryness.  The gel does not blur the eye and can be applied easy enough.  Of course because it is a gel there is a little waste around the eye, but only a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;GenTeal Lubricant Dry-Eye Relief Gel\\&quot; is expensive at $12.99 a tube but, I am sold on the product and I will continue to use it each night before slumber.</li>
            <li> Most effective nighttime relief. Long lasting. Now, if someone would just hold my eye open during the night so I don&#x27;t keep missing my eye and wasting expensive drops!</li>
            <li> like this quite well.  much better for me than the gooey ointment</li>
            <li> Our eye specialist MD recommended this product.  It works perfectly, no burning or irritating to the eyes, but replaces tears you don&#x27;t have to irrigate the eyes. Ordering from Amazon allows us to buy in bulk with less hassle.</li>
            <li> I am a (cool) physician with dry eyes.  &lt;br /&gt;My strong recommendation is that if you have slight, moderate OR severe dry eyes: Select this product!&lt;br /&gt;I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH!&lt;br /&gt;Most relevant products use some type of methylcellulose as the active ingredient.  I think that over the years, I have tried a good number of the products out there: Some are good, some are great.  This product however, takes a quantum leap to the next level.  How?&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the magic is in the resilient (pharmacokinetic) delivery of the product.  In other words:  It stays there in the eye for a real long time.  I usually only need one or two applications a day.  My personal feeling is that this one is really way ahead of all the other products of this type on the market.  &lt;br /&gt;Basically what you have is a gel.  Yes!  It is a clear drop, but the drop falls onto your eye like this cool goo.  Well, a gel.  At first, I felt that it was strange.  But I remember years ago when I tried my first eye drops that felt strange too!  After using about ¼ of the tube, I came to prefer this over the typical drops.  So it is like this little drop of jell falls onto the eye, and then it melts.  I&#x27;m telling you, I quickly really got into it.  In a couple seconds, it has melted all over soothing the eye.  &lt;br /&gt;Whatever Novartis did to create the product, they did good (GenTeal Severe Dry Eye Relief ONLY in this review).  It just plain lasts a very long time!  From my experience, nothing else out there comes close to its lasting power!!  I mean, who has time to keep dropping drops into the eyes all day?  With this, I do one in the am upon rising, and one when I get home at the end of the day or something.&lt;br /&gt;BRAVO to the guys over there in the labs that actually thought this one out!</li>
            <li> I have really dry eyes and its extremely painful so when I read the reviews I really thought it was going to work for me and it didn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> I cannot give this product a great rating, because it was not what I needed for my dry eyes. It is kind of thick, but your visions clears fast after blinking a few times and it melts in your eyes. It is very lubricant like ans makes the eyes moist for a long time. My problem is, my dry eyes are caused by allergies, so they not only get very dry but they get very red and itchy. This product does nothing for red, and itchy dry eyes, but it probably very good for normal non-allergy dry eyes.</li>
            <li> We actually use this for our small dog who has severe dry eye issues.  It works wonders and I would highly suggest for you or your beloved pet.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the prescription dry eye med, it made it worse. When I told my eye doctor, he had me get this ointment. I use it at night, or if I am going to be napping, because it does blur your vision, having ointment in your eyes. It is soothing tho, and night is when I really need help.</li>
            <li> I have a moderate case of dry eyes and this product works very well to give me several hours of good relief.  A little goes a long way towards not only comfort, but for applying the gel.  I put a tiny amount carefully into each eye and blink gently until my vision clears.  After that I have a good several hours of comfort.  Using this product about 3-4 times per day really beats the eye drops I had used until now.  The gel lasts a lot longer and is so much easier to apply.  This brand was recommended to me by my optometrist and I agree with him.  I will be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have very dry eyes and this gel does the trick fast. I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I bought these after Lasik eye surgery because the picture of the box on Amazon says they are preservative free in the eye.  The box I received is different and says nothing about being preservative free.  I could have saved myself some money and a weeks wait and simply went to Shopko and gotten these.  Not happy!</li>
            <li> use it for my dog with low tear production--good for overnight use and not as greasy as some other night time meds</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as others here have pointed out - if you have truly severe dry eye, this offers relief for about 20-30 minutes tops. Drops only give me about 5 minutes so it is enough that I&#x27;ll keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this is that it only blurs your vision for ~1 minute and when it dries, it doesn&#x27;t leave some funky film around your eyelids like other more potent dry eye drops.</li>
            <li> My elderly dog sometimes sleeps with her eyes partially open and they became very red and irritated. Her vet suggested GenTeal and I have been putting a drop in each eye 1-2 times a day for the past 3 months. Her eyes are now healthy and white. The impact was visible within a couple days. She doesn&#x27;t love getting the drops but it doesn&#x27;t appear to cause her any pain or discomfort. They aren&#x27;t greasy at all and do not cause any additional buildup in the corners of her eyes. They may actually reduce buildup because her eyes are less irritated and producing less mucus in response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am maybe 1/2 to 2/3 through the tube after 3 months. It is definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome and have virtually no lubricating &amp;quot;tears&amp;quot; as a result. Ointments are hard to clean out of one&#x27;s eyes and can only be used at bedtime. No other eye drops comes close to lubricating my eyes as GenTeal Gel. &lt;br /&gt;The gel is great because it has preservatives in it, but they dissipate completely when it hits your eyes. That contributes to it&#x27;s efficacy. Products with preservatives can diminish their ability to moisturize, i.e., they sort of contain a bit of a drying element.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have severely dry eyes you can probably get away with GenTeal drops. But if you have a severe problem, the gel makes your eyes feel cool and heavenly.</li>
            <li> The gel works better for me than the drops. Ty</li>
            <li> This is by far the most efficient lubricant I have for my dry eye problem.</li>
            <li> My dry eye problem is helped a lot by using GenTeal several times a day.  Your service is always excellent.  Thankk you.</li>
            <li> Because I have glaucoma &amp; recently had  laser surgery, my opthamologist recommended that I use a drop in each eye just before going to sleep.  The drops keep my eyes from drying out while I sleep, greatly minimizing the number of times I use Refresh Optimum eye drops daily to clear my vision and focus.  Reading before sleeping is a nightly routine, and I use my prescription glaucoma drops before picking up a book so that there is a 30-60 minute lapse before using the Genteal Gel drops.  They are long-lasting and provide great relief for my eyes for 12-16 hours.  Genteal has ROCKED THE MARKET with this drop!</li>
            <li> Single pack of day time dry eye relief. It&#x27;s more practical to buy the double pack if you plan to use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> My eye surgeon recommended this product for use after my surgery and I&#x27;m glad I followed his advice. My eyes were very dry as a result of the surgery.  So, he instructed me to use this product each night to protect my eyes until I healed.  I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it.  The GenTeal Gel definitely lubricates the eye efficiently all night.  And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t sting the way other products this strong and effective might.  It has been a lifesaver after surgery.</li>
            <li> a great product for dry eyes...I love it...also use it at night or when I am having a pj day....you want to keep your eyes shut to get the best use out of it...at least that;&#x27; what I found for me that works the best..</li>
            <li> After 3 successful eye surgeries and trying almost every eye drop on the market, including 3 samples from my surgeon.....I will only use the Systane Lubricant Eye Drops in the vials.  They are preservative free, long lasting for me and instant relief.&lt;br /&gt;The GenTeal did not lubricate as well and the effect was not as long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that if you have slight burning at first when using eye drops/lubricants it is because of the eye being so dry and the burning should subside right away.  If the burning doesn&#x27;t stop then it is maybe not the right eye drop for you and of course stop using.</li>
            <li> Great drops I competition pistol,shoot and these are great.  Best moisturizing drops I every used.  I highly recommned</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes and need to work in front of computers. I tried both this and Similasan Eye Drops #3 Computer Eyes at the same time. I found GenTeal is harder to apply to eyes (need to look at the mirror) and it is easy to cause the blurry vision after applied. I have to keep wiping out the excessive gel around my eyes to get rid of the blurry vision. The Similansan Eye Drops performs much better and much more convenient. That&#x27;s my own experience of comparing two of them.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t look closely to their ingredients so I couldn&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have better product suggestions, please kindly let me know. I will be much appreciated. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for over 5 years and I love it.  Used to use an ointment at night but when I woke up, there was always a film on my eye.  Since I wear contacts, this was obscuring my vision.  The Genteal solved this problem.  It keeps my eyes moist as I sleep and there is no film in the morning.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Thanks for fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Feels cool to the eye when I put it in.  I don&#x27;t think it works any longer than refresh presevatives free vials even though it&#x27;s a gel.  Vision is blurred for a few minutes afterwards and crusty stuff forms after a while.</li>
            <li> I used the product once and immediately threw it in the trash (after briefly considering suing GenTeal). I felt like I was pouring bleach into my eyes. I ended up rinsing them for several minutes before the sting went away, and my eyes were red afterward. I&#x27;m really stunned, especially given that I had a good experience with GenTeal&#x27;s PM eye lubricant. This product, however, the GenTeal Severe Dry Eye Relief, is nightmarishly bad. Severely so.</li>
            <li> After application, it is very difficult to obtain clear vision due to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Gel&amp;#34; consistency. I only use it at bedtime and it seems to alleviate dryness somewhat. Given the choice, I prefer eyedrops instead.</li>
            <li> These eye drops are very good for my severely dry eyes. I like that they are essentially preservative free. They were very &#x27;jell-like&#x27; which I didn&#x27;t quite expect.  They work well and they dispense well into the eye.</li>
            <li> I absolutely could not and would not use ointment, too hard to apply.  Yes, this SEVERE gel works very well for me, the best product I have used so far.  Moderate to Severe does not work as well.  So be sure to get SEVERE.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with eye dryness for several years. Then the dryness got worse. So much so, I became a slave to having drops in my purse, in my car, etc - because not to have them was a real emergency. Air circulation in public buildings (such as movie theater, or just my 2 mile walk outside every day, caused me to need the drops 2-3 times within an hour or so. I had such severe redness that my eye dr prescribed an allergy drop - which turns out I did not need. Thank goodness for the pharmacist that recommended the GenTeal gel!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found for my extra sever dry eye problem.. It would of course be just as wonderful on lightly dry eye problems,or even to refresh normal eyes. Great in cold weather too.</li>
