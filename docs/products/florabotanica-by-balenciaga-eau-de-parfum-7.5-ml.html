            <li>Turkish rose, caladium (elephant ear!), etc.  </li>
            <li>So glad Kristen is the face of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Got this for my sister and she loved the smell, but the price and size is what i didnt like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting the beautiful Kristen Stewart smells a lot better than this perfume does. :</li>
            <li>it smells wonderful but the smell does wear off rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are very interesting:  mint, carnation,</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it smells great on me.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My Fragrance outlet did NOT carry this amazing perfume.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This perfume smells like spiced Rose.</li>
            <li>gorgeous in every way--love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this, maybe as much as I love Euphoria (Calvin Klein)!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice, wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>AWESOME FRAGRANCE, SO SEXY, SENSUAL, AND SOFT, NOT OVERBEARING.</li>
            <li>- now I can always have my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>Samples are supposed to be FREE!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>This has become my favorite fragance.  </li>
            <li>Jesus must LOVE</li>
            <li>They have never disappointed me with a search for anything!  </li>
            <li>Love love love heard so many good things about this scent but didn&#x27;t want to commit to a big bottle</li>
            <li>Wow, is this a wonderful scent to surround yourself with, very lively, intoxicating but fresh!!  </li>
            <li>Easy and timely delivery is the venue of AMAZON -  not just my kindle books - but</li>
            <li>The picture showed a bigger,normal sized bottle,I guess I should have read the fine print.</li>
            <li>Light and floral, not overbearing that lingers for awhile before fading away.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells like cheap junk you could get at the dime store.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is wonderful my favorite scent and the larger bottle is too expensive so this is perfect for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing, not to bold, and just right.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and own a bigger bottle at home.  </li>
            <li>like a lot and collect perfumes but this fragrance is special because it was a gift for my sister</li>
            <li>only I have to say I loved the perfume</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It did not seem to have the full fragrant as the sample I received as a gift.</li>
            <li>Balenciaga perfumes are really gorgeous, but they just don&#x27;t last on me.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quick.</li>
            <li>It is very elegant and fresh at the same time.</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening !!</li>
            <li>this scent was a color, it would be some fresh shade of green.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>100% WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>it came right away.</li>
            <li>Just got it yesterday and wearing it to work right now.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy a full bottle--when I get the $.  </li>
            <li>I should have done a tester first.</li>
            <li>I should have read the size at first.</li>
            <li>I love light , floral parfums  which have that small amount of  &amp;#34;Je ne C&#x27;est quoi &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the format you use to display your items.</li>
            <li>SO said it was very alluring.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find such a tiny version which I&#x27;ve slipped into my travel kit</li>
            <li>I thought it was a high compliment!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Great marketing campaign which I unfortunately fell for; here&#x27;s hoping others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is now my new fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful the next time.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and wanted to get a small bottle.</li>
            <li>This is another lovely floral, but get a sample first if you have past experience of perfumes not lasting on you.</li>
            <li>I thought the size of the bottle was too small for the price I paid, however I love the fragrances by Balenciaga.</li>
            <li>This is a very small sample good for only a couple of wears and I knew that purchasing this.</li>
            <li>And it clearly says not for Resale</li>
            <li>Its small, but it will last me a long time, you don&#x27;t need much, very elegant scent.</li>
            <li>,  the size allowed me to get the full experience without the heavy price.</li>
            <li>It is not cheap, but well worth it.</li>

            <li> it smells wonderful but the smell does wear off rather quickly. and I don&#x27;t like trying to open it, every time I try to unstop the bottle it spills a little out :-/</li>

            <li> If this scent was a season, it would be spring.&lt;br /&gt;If this scent was a color, it would be some fresh shade of green.&lt;br /&gt;If this scent was a feeling, it would be serenity.&lt;br /&gt;Just gorgeous in every way--love, love, love it. Quintessentially feminine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting the beautiful Kristen Stewart smells a lot better than this perfume does. : (</li>
            <li> This item arrived faster than expected. I love the smell!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent and own a bigger bottle at home.  I was pleased to find such a tiny version which I&#x27;ve slipped into my travel kit - now I can always have my favorite perfume whether on the road or back at the ranch.</li>
            <li> It makes my husband&#x27;s mouth water.  That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I knew this was a small bottle, unfortunately I don&#x27;t like the way it smells. Ugh. I should have done a tester first.</li>
            <li> I thought the fragrant was diluted. It did not seem to have the full fragrant as the sample I received as a gift.</li>
            <li> I expected a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I love light , floral parfums  which have that small amount of  &amp;#34;Je ne C&#x27;est quoi &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> AWESOME FRAGRANCE, SO SEXY, SENSUAL, AND SOFT, NOT OVERBEARING. KRISTEN STEWART IS AWESOME, AND THIS FRAGRANCE CREATED FOR HER IS 100% WORTH IT. I WILL BE BUYING LARGER SET SOON.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and wanted to get a small bottle. Was mislead when this tiny &amp;#34;SAMPLE&amp;#34; bottle came! Samples are supposed to be FREE! And it clearly says not for Resale</li>
            <li> This is a very small sample good for only a couple of wears and I knew that purchasing this. The perfume is wonderful my favorite scent and the larger bottle is too expensive so this is perfect for special occasions. This was also delivered on a timely manner it came right away. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. I wish the bottle was bigger though.</li>

            <li> Love love love heard so many good things about this scent but didn&#x27;t want to commit to a big bottle,  the size allowed me to get the full experience without the heavy price. I will definitely invest in a larger bottle in the future.</li>
            <li> Balenciaga perfumes are really gorgeous, but they just don&#x27;t last on me.  This is another lovely floral, but get a sample first if you have past experience of perfumes not lasting on you.</li>
            <li> I wrote to say I doubted this was real eau de parfum as advertised because it was so weak as to seem like water in a used bottle..  Never got a response.</li>
            <li> The picture showed a bigger,normal sized bottle,I guess I should have read the fine print.I could have bought it on E-bay for half the price that I payed for it !! I&#x27;ll be more careful the next time.I really don&#x27;t like the format you use to display your items. Thanks for listening !!</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised by the girl from the Twlight series.  The bottle is very small but with her advertising it, the larger bottles are very expensive, but I&#x27;ve already had lots of compliments on the fragrance!  Well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> awesome awesome awesome !!!! get compliments ALWAYS !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice, wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t say how happy I am with this. Smells amazing!! I will defiantly buy again. Packaging is beautiful. So glad Kristen is the face of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like spiced Rose. My hubby says it smells like incense...that&#x27;s why the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is absolutely wonderful for spring, summer. Even though it was without the box, it was a great way to test the fragrance. I will certainly buy a full bottle--when I get the $.  It is not cheap, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is now my new fragrance and I am not a fragrance lady.....so this says a lot about this parfum</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It arrived quick.</li>

            <li> Great - received it in a timely manner....This has become my favorite fragance.  Great Job!</li>
            <li> Light and floral, not overbearing that lingers for awhile before fading away.  Great size for purse.  SO said it was very alluring.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like cheap junk you could get at the dime store.  Great marketing campaign which I unfortunately fell for; here&#x27;s hoping others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> is no further than a click away to  &#x27;AMAZON.&amp;#34;  They have never disappointed me with a search for anything!  My Fragrance outlet did NOT carry this amazing perfume.&lt;br /&gt;  I began a search to fill in the sample that I loved.&lt;br /&gt;  If memory serves &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two (2) aromas.  One for home, 1-4 purse.&lt;br /&gt;My G-Son even told me that I &#x27;stank&#x27;  - great!&lt;br /&gt;  * you know boys that age - (12)&lt;br /&gt;  I thought it was a high compliment!&lt;br /&gt; Easy and timely delivery is the venue of AMAZON -  not just my kindle books - but almost everything&lt;br /&gt;  I need - with the exception of a &amp;#34;sugar - daddy.&amp;#34;  Enjoy your life!!!  Jesus must LOVE me!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Ciao,  SOBRIQUET</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it smells great on me. I thought the size of the bottle was too small for the price I paid, however I love the fragrances by Balenciaga.</li>
