    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>One of the best Rechargeable charger ever made!</li>
            <li>style shaver must be used every day or two (or even twice a day for some people) for best results.  </li>
            <li>where your thumb rests- not the best spot as I ended up turning it off accidentally a couple times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed by this razor.</li>
            <li>It is a really impressive product.</li>
            <li>This is my 5th Remington shaver over the 50 + years and the best yet.</li>
            <li>This is best one yet.  </li>
            <li>This has been a great razor!</li>
            <li>This razor has been perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>give it a star for looking very good while shaving</li>
            <li>Great shaver, the best micro screen Remington</li>
            <li>Good shaver but not the best i&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>Remington Shaver is excellent and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>In reviewing this razor I had a great opportunity to compare it to my [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this Remington does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>battery life is really great.  </li>
            <li>My skin experienced some irritation.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is a great feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Close\\&quot; one works great.</li>
            <li>I gave up on them in my youth because they irritated my skin and never did a good job on my neck.  </li>
            <li>then you are going to find this a good replacement.</li>
            <li>I get a good shave, but not as close a shave as I can get with a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it does give a good shave.</li>
            <li>-750 is certainly a good option.</li>
            <li>Shaves good and feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month now, and it really is a good razor for $80.</li>
            <li>everything is good with it except the closeness of the shave is marginal.</li>
            <li>body construction is perfect, hence the close-shave quality of the original blades (3-razor) is disputable.</li>
            <li>I have used so many brands, but this one stand out among it peers!</li>
            <li>This is my first non-Braun electric razor and I am impressed with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>shaver itself looks attractive, and the foil assembly can be removed easily for cleaning and maintenance by just pressing two nearby release buttons.  </li>
            <li>21 y.o. was thrilled to hear that his dad didn&#x27;t like it, because that means he can keep it all to himself.</li>
            <li>* Holds a nice charge&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I own the Remington MS2-390 Shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nice to have the shaving head move with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>It has rubber grips on the sides and a nice glossy shiny finish on the front.</li>
            <li>rechargeable cord and bag are also nice additions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the interest of fair play, I do have to say, however, that I have yet to find an electric shaver that does anything more than just warm my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how it has simplified my grooming needs and made it an enjoyable (cut-free) experience.</li>
            <li>Very good for time when husband needs a fast shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, both shavers feel cheap in the hand.</li>
            <li>I know they are designed for beards, but it&#x27;s curiosity, to see if they can handle the very fine hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do near as good of a job as the blades, but it works great when you are traveling or somewhere</li>
            <li>Battery life is great, and this thing is extremely easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head is nice (albeit bulky) and the shaver&#x27;s ergonomics/handling are better than most.  </li>
            <li>It also charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts, I tried it again.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>but I felt the Panasonic was slightly better in every way.  </li>
            <li>This electric razor does the job, eventually, but sometimes it seems to not be able to get a hair or two.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried several electric shavers over the years - foils and circular heads and this is the best electric shaver I have used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fits nicely in the hand although the plastic does feel a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has to do with the triple head, and also the fact that it pivots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a Braun for many years. . .</li>
            <li>The manual suggests a more thorough cleaning every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The resulting shave is comparable to the Norelco I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>as many of the Panny mid-range models (their 2 and 3 head shavers).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bulbous; the Panny feels more</li>
            <li>And, of course, if you step up to the 4 blade Panny or the 5 or 7 series Bran you&#x27;ll do even better, but you&#x27;ve also jumped up in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, of course, if you step up to the 4 blade Panny or the 5 or 7 series Bran you&#x27;ll do even better, but you&#x27;ve also jumped up in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results i got with this shaver were OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electrics shavers most of my life</li>
            <li>I have found the best way to determine how close and smooth a shave you are getting comes when you apply lotion after you shave the this shaver get the highest grade so far.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have a better opportunity to review this shaver-</li>
            <li>much* better.  </li>
            <li>shaver is great and really works all across your face.</li>
            <li>Have to charge it more often.  </li>
            <li>quality build &amp;  excellent shave plus extra set of blades &amp; foil</li>
            <li>I bought this to keep in my car, and it has become my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li>you just want an electric shaver to stick in your briefcase/toolbox/desk for \\&quot;quickie\\&quot; jobs on the run, this model is okay.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer is pretty good</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to long term use but at this point it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Closeness is pretty good - plenty close for me.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly on the beard and chin (and comfortably if you keep the beard fairly short), but not so well on the mustache.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the flexed option because it&#x27;s more comfortable and enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and the &#x27;blades&#x27; can be rinsed in water.  </li>
            <li>After all, the design is undeniably classy and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I tried this shaver on my legs, the search for the perfect shaver being one of my lifelong quests.</li>
            <li>While it has many nice features (a mind-boggling four different \\&quot;blades\\&quot;) and has a good swivel head, it does feel a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>I had a three-day growth and the shave was fairly good and fast.</li>
            <li>In summary, it is powerful and has a nice design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver was not so easy even with the rinsing under water.</li>
            <li>Yes, they made it easy to get the shaver replaced under warranty, but after repeated replacements, I just gave up on the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one gives me a close shave, recharges well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>16 y.o. liked it very much for the trimming feature for shaping his sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good looks,  high  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear they are paying attention to the successful attributes of the two leading foil makers: Panasonic and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remington needs to make one good product and stop putting out new junk every 6 months.</li>
            <li>I think that it has a comfortable handle, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>that works fine.  </li>
            <li>It also did better (in terms of closeness) than my Braun 5 series, and came pretty darn close to the shave quality of my all-time favorite foil, the Braun 7 series</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of electric razors.</li>
            <li>charging stand would be quite nice, but there&#x27;s something that I really like about the charging cord - you can shave with the cord plugged in.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D; 3 stars (because feel is important to me)eel is important to me)</li>
            <li>he was surprised, his experience has been nothing short of great and if the Braun lines are considered superior so too is their price</li>
            <li>I got a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is worth a look, but be sure to cross-shop Panasonic and Braun as well.</li>
            <li>I waited until I shaved four times with the FR-750 before I felt comfortable writing a review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great for a daily electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Also, the handle is comfortable</li>
            <li>Remington really revolutionizes the shaving process and turns it into something that&#x27;s even kind of enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I get a smooth face, and no razor burn...</li>
            <li>Everything does fit, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a primary shaver that&#x27;ll give you a close shave, move on and keep looking.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this may be good for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly $100 (plus tax, where applicable), and it just isn&#x27;t as good as the $6 disposable</li>
            <li>Clean and smooth in some places, sparse and stubbly in others</li>
            <li>The device disassembles and reassembles easily and quickly for cleaning and maintenance.</li>
            <li>This electric razor provides a very nice and painless, close shave provided you don&#x27;t let the beard get too full prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>, feels a bit higher quality, is a better value, and both are made in PRC/China.  </li>
            <li>so were able to get into the crease in my chin which is a first for an electric shaver for me.</li>
            <li>Like all that I&#x27;ve used it isn&#x27;t as close as even the cheapest disposable blade, but it&#x27;s a lot more convenient and works best when you use it daily instead of trying to tackle several days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I want is a quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Fantastic close, quick shave.  </li>
            <li>I did not get a great shave - I had to clean-up with a wet shave.</li>
            <li>the shave was much better and much closer than I have had with an electric before.</li>
            <li>must say that the Remington FR-750 gives me a closer, faster and better all-around shave then</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the brand I started with many years ago, and I always appreciated their &#x60;skip the flash and concentrate on value&#x27;</li>
            <li>This shaver incorporates a true innovation in shaving effectiveness.</li>
            <li>On a daily basis, it does a good job cleaning up and keeping my face groomed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with the area below my ears, which is responsible for most of the times I&#x27;ve cut myself shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is much better than most I&#x27;ve used in the past--too good perhaps if you&#x27;re looking to leave enough stubble to present a three-day beard look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The look is ok and kinda cool; the LED display at the bottom lets you know how much battery life you&#x27;ve got and it turns on and off at the press of a button right below</li>
            <li>Touching my face, however, makes it clear that it isn&#x27;t nearly as smooth as when I use a blade.  </li>
            <li>I have used Remington shavers for years and have found them to be adequate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For what he needs this shaver has delivered, it has a solid feel to it and very easy to use with a 1 button operation, a snap-off head cleaning which makes easy access to the blades, and the LED gauge monitors the battery life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: Yes, two thumbs up, and one thumb down, so the two thumbs win.</li>
            <li>I love this new shaver.</li>
            <li>My dear husband is pleased with this shaver,  although he still uses a razor blade when he wants a really close shave,  which is seldom!  </li>
            <li>Therefore I would recommend not buying this razor for most people unless you have very sensitive skin and do not care about a close shave.</li>
            <li>It does a serviceable job and is easy to keep clean, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough to get me to commit fully to changing to this shaver.</li>
            <li>shape is comfortable and easy to hold on to for both of us, which is important because then I tried the trimmer on the back of his neck.</li>
            <li>Braun also gives you better quality, and a more comfortable, but less close shave (</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, unless you have very soft facial hair it&#x27;s going to spend more time in the nice bag it come with than being used.</li>
            <li>But I know that&#x27;s not going to last, so I figured an electric shaver might be nice to use for more frequent shaving.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheap ones in the big box stores</li>
            <li>grow a weeks worth of beard and expect this shaver to work at all.  </li>
            <li>Young guys will love it.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the above superficial flaws of the Remington truthfully portray what lies beneath-</li>
            <li>favorite is still the Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 which is very quiet and gives a good shave when used daily.  </li>
            <li>Much gentler on my face than my last one, and a fairly close shave without applying pressure.</li>
            <li>so far, everything is OK</li>
            <li>The charge time and indicator are useful.</li>
            <li>had a full day&#x27;s growth on my face and decided to give each half a good once-over with each shaver.</li>
            <li>This is worth a look, but be sure to cross-shop Panasonic and Braun as well.baby your face better than any other brand).</li>
            <li>It managed to give me a nice clean shave, and i didnt have to repeat over the same areas too much.</li>
            <li>As close a shave as any razor I&#x27;ve owned, and comfortable;  it also does a good job on even the &#x27;tough places.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the main unit, the travel case included in the package is cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Subsequent shaves were ok and quick - about the same as the Norelco.</li>
            <li>device is lightweight and comfortable to hold with convenient thumb grips placed on each side of the shaver for better control with wet hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its a decent shaver, but there are far better ones out there on the market right now.</li>
            <li>I have found this shaver cuts the beard completely leaving the skin smooth with the right technique.</li>
            <li>Every new remington that they put out is more cheaply made than the last.</li>
            <li>And as for waiting three weeksfor your hair and skin to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the shaver: get real!</li>
            <li>It shaves a bit closer, sounds higher quality</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor in about 20 years, but I wanted to give one another try.  </li>
            <li>This was after using it daily for a week, so maybe it would get better with more use, especially since I&#x27;m not used to electric razors.  </li>
            <li>It was his first high-quality electric shaver and he loves it.  </li>
            <li>The first day I tried I had a couple of days growth.</li>
            <li>Many years later I decided to try again</li>
            <li>I looked more like a mangy homeless person than a well-groomed individual.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Norelco triple head shaver for many years with overall satisfaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, I was interested to see what their newest venture looks like.</li>
            <li>My first test on an electric shaver is always my legs.</li>
            <li>It was quite loud though, so if noise is important to you, this will be an issue for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a pretty stout beard and the FR-750 cuts it effortlessly; like a steak knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>I am mostly bald and use a shaver to shave the sides and back of my head as well as my face.</li>
            <li>Shaving gets done much faster!</li>
            <li>But what is unforgivable is that it was more like getting a facial wax than a shave.</li>
            <li>Move back and forth 2-3 times and it should cover most of your hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first charge.</li>
            <li>If it is your first time, give your skin a couple weeks to adjust.  </li>
            <li>He first tried to shave three day stubble with the razor and it was disasterous.  </li>
            <li>The razor did better this time; it did not pull his hair, but he did have to make several passes over his face in order to get all of the hair shaved.</li>
            <li>had to go back and try several times and it must&#x27;ve took a good 15 minutes or more trying to get it to shave what takes a regular razor</li>
            <li>The overall design could be better; the large head covers a good-sized area</li>
            <li>I was hoping this one, with its three foils and pivoting flat surface would be able to cut my stubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and so far so great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many different features on this razor that show that it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>the unusually shaped A/C charger makes it kind of difficult to fit everything in there comfortably.  </li>
            <li>looks very high tech and</li>
            <li>It works okay, but I find that even when I use it on very short hair I have to run it over my cheeks and neck several times in both directions to do a decent job - and I still have to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; with a disposable razor if I want a clean shave.</li>
            <li>the positive side, the shaver has a high-RPM motor and seems to hold a charge better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>I have a Braun 9595 and Ive tried panasonics and I own a remington F5790 which is better than this FR-750 and far worse than the Braun and even the panasonic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What saves this razor from a one star review is the trimmer (which works well on moustaches/goatees) and the light that indicates how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>The Remington is a much gentler shave.  </li>
            <li>I realize you are supposed to shave every day with this thing to get your face ready for it, but it never seem to take for me.</li>
            <li>I had a 2 day stubble (my hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast), and this couldn&#x27;t cut through it.  </li>
            <li>But none of that really matters to me.</li>
            <li>The razor holds a charge and charges fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s already charged so you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I paid so much for the blades</li>
            <li>which I really like. .</li>
            <li>The shave is comfortable enough and there has been no irritation.</li>
            <li>The Remington feels cheap; the Panny feels solid.</li>
            <li>real difference is when you start popping off the heads or using the head lock lever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with this purchase</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver; upgraded from 2 foil Remington &amp; BIG improvement.</li>
            <li>really, who cares about all that in regards to a shaver?</li>
            <li>, my son really likes it</li>
            <li>and I really wanted this one to work.</li>
            <li>I slowed the movement of the razer to give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe I had gone to fast.</li>
            <li>The vibration on this shaver is really just too much, and whether I am shaving my face or my head with it, every time it passes over bone (jawbone, cheekbone, etc), it rattles my skull.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast.  </li>
            <li>Remington really does shave you close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>to this razor, it charges fast and holds that charge very well.</li>
            <li>My wife and I bought this for my father-in-laws birthday really likes to way</li>
            <li>Slickest design Remington shaver I have ever purchased with much improved trimmer.</li>
            <li>Visually, it does a good job everywhere if I spend about as much time as it takes me to wet shave with a blade.  </li>
            <li>I have used a combination of Braun electric razors and regular old Gilette hand razors for many years.  </li>
            <li>It also has some nice features such as the battery gas gauge, non-slip rubber nibs on grip points, a two-way articulating head, and the ability to lock the head in multiple positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges very quickly and holds it almost as long as my Norelco.  </li>
            <li>As a black man I&#x27;ve only used one foil shaver before in my life and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>your face better than any other brand).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep charged, shaves close (close enough for a modern 21 year old guy) and is so much easier than the safety razor and</li>
            <li>I keep it at three stars because it does offer the ability to get a good visual appearance with a dry shave, which can come in handy when running late for work</li>
            <li>The shaver has a slight arc, which gives the pop-out trimmer, on the back, more room for maneuvering and making accurate cuts when tidying up sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li>This takes twice as long and doesn&#x27;t get nearly as smooth.</li>
            <li>But the following observations are still true.</li>
            <li>Ergonomically it was fine, nothing great or bad to note about that aspect.</li>
            <li>thats how much better/faster this new shaver cuts.</li>
            <li>sure, like all bad ideas, that this shaver seemed like a good idea at the time.</li>
            <li>Their previous razor was much better</li>
            <li>Perhaps older men who don&#x27;t want to give up the safety razor won&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>the shave, my neck is still the toughest area, but it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>Decent shave but</li>
            <li>errr..mimicked the most from Panasonic, with this shaver taking on the same basic form factor</li>
            <li>The FR-750 requires a slightly different technique than the MS2 390 when moving it over the skin to get a close shave, but I quickly mastered it</li>
            <li>ALSO, THE FACE IS NOT AS CLOSE AS IT WAS WITH MY OLDER MODEL.  </li>
            <li>On my Braun, there are multiple foils and the \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li>If I want a decent shave I have to use blades, and that&#x27;s just the way it is.  </li>
            <li>Good with stiff facial</li>
            <li>The three men in my household agreed to test this high quality electric men&#x27;s razor for me.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both Remington &amp; Amazon.</li>
            <li>With repeated use over time, however, it had gotten a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>It grows in very fine and lies down flat at first.</li>
            <li>After all, the folks who were happy with the shaver can&#x27;t all be wrong.</li>
            <li>As a result, I generally use the trimmer first</li>
            <li>Worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t been able to use an electric shaver before, then this might work for you - but it might take a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li>, I decided it just wasn&#x27;t worth having such a shaver.  </li>
            <li>After using the Remington for a much longer session than the Phillips, my husband still could not get even half as smooth as he does with the Phillips.  </li>
            <li>comes out with a new one that has the trimmer flush with the heads.</li>
            <li>someone else mentioned even brand new after shaving with this</li>
            <li>But does not shave off my new beard growth at all.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I&#x27;ve amassed a pretty big shaver collection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time I tried pulling the skin, brushing up the hairs at the same time to make sure they were upright and not lying down on the job.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use electric shavers, as my facial hair is pretty thick and dense.</li>
            <li>I prefer shaving dry as I get better results, but this razor allows a wet shave.</li>
            <li>I tried various durations, from a quick brush-by to up to ten seconds directly on the hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few that work fine if you use them everyday, but can&#x27;t cut my facial hair if I leave it more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li>, I would suggest that they give this one a try, and clearly my son would have been a lot happier if he had started with the Remington.</li>
            <li>instructions that came with the shaver were clear.</li>
            <li>The Remington is clearly a notch below in quality.</li>
            <li>like the battery gauge as well as a clear indicator when it needs to be charged, and that it can be used while charging.</li>
            <li>I found it harder to get a smooth shave along my jawline, but my teenage son preferred it to the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately my favorite Braun razor is no longer being made and it is getting harder and harder to get replacement cutters for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it comes to actual shaving: not so much.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver on a daily basis was also fast using the enclosed brush and tap water.</li>
            <li>: I have a soft spot for Remington shavers.</li>
            <li>I would describe my facial hair as coarse,stiff, and straight.</li>
            <li>I bought the Remington FR-750 to replace my old Remington MS2 390 that would no longer retain a charge.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was no where near as close a shave.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of the Remington FR -750.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how well built it is.</li>
            <li>There is an on button and a battery indicator with a green LED light.</li>
            <li>If this razor had alternate foils, I think it would work so much</li>
            <li>So realistically speaking, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much when I bought this shaver; but to leave entire patches of whiskers in its wake???  </li>
            <li>In spite of leaving patches, the shaver does cut long whiskers rather well, and the pop-out trimmer is pretty</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true what they say: black men can&#x27;t use foil shavers.</li>
            <li>Back in high school, I tried a few (admittedly cheap) electric razors.</li>
            <li>Shave with a disposable razor first (or buzz as short as possible with clippers) and then use this shave.  </li>
            <li>In summary, I think that it&#x27;s a decent product, but I won&#x27;t use it regularly because I get a smoother shave with a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, the idea of having to use my free hand to stretch my skin just to get a proper shave is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I thought, maybe shaving from different directions might help; so I tried it from down coming up, then up going down, then diagonally from both left and right.</li>
            <li>I tried an expensive Norelco shaver but kept using my old Remington shaver afterwards, so I decided to go back to Remington with a new shaver and am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>It does a solid job of cutting whiskers, the floating / swivel head is a big plus, and it is pretty easy to clean out after each use.  </li>
            <li>Too light to be made of anything other than plastic materials (despite both seemingly being constructed of metal parts), the Remington actually looks as fragile as it feels.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that you need to use the shaver daily for for up to 3 weeks to allow your skin and hair to get conditioned to the new shaver - so I will continue to use and update as to progress.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a new low for</li>
            <li>You should expect a no irritation shave (even when dry) and a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Second, I felt like I was trying to mow my face- after an initial sweep I had to keep working areas just to get some real</li>
            <li>For the same price or less you can get a 3 or 4 blade Panny (they have so many model numbers that it&#x27;s impossible to list all the ones that are appropriate) that offers better quality, the ability to shave wet or dry and a linear motor (keeps the speed constant regardless of the charge level).</li>
            <li>The lack of a charging stand is a non-issue since we generally put shavers in a drawer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like is this thing really working; but the smooth close shave left behind</li>
            <li>My husband frequently gets irritation from the Phillips shaver, and the Remington never gave him the slightest red area.  </li>
            <li>Really give yourself at least a weeks worth of daily shaves before passing judgement on this style</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always come back to the old safety razor.</li>
            <li>I found this razor completely incapable of shaving my neck properly.</li>
            <li>I would describe his facial hair as soft and curly.</li>
            <li>The shaver could barely give him a shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver is okay but not great.  </li>
            <li>The pivot head is kind of useless.</li>
            <li>I found that the inclusion of the one new foil did make this shaver less aggressive than the normal Remington-style shave, but it&#x27;s still rougher on the face than Panasonic or Braun.</li>
            <li>then my husband tried it on his face, it managed the curves well, including a spot on his jaw that seems to get skipped with other shavers, and the shave was very close.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is well placed on the unit, popping out far enough to use it regularly, not just \\&quot;in</li>
            <li>This was purchased for a high school aged boy.  </li>
            <li>I have a patchy kind of beard (thick in some places and thin in others) and this razor does very well.  </li>
            <li>Like most men, I hate shaving and fortunately can currently get away with shaving only about twice a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but will get most of your stub and hair on the first few times.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic uses a higher RPM motor that seems to do a better job of being less irritating and it shaves slightly closer.  </li>
            <li>Work good on tough medium thick facial hair.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> One of the best Rechargeable charger ever made!</li>
            <li> style shaver must be used every day or two (or even twice a day for some people) for best results.  </li>
            <li> where your thumb rests- not the best spot as I ended up turning it off accidentally a couple times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by this razor.</li>
            <li> It is a really impressive product.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th Remington shaver over the 50 + years and the best yet.</li>

            <li> This has been a great razor!</li>
            <li> This razor has been perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> give it a star for looking very good while shaving</li>
            <li> Great shaver, the best micro screen Remington</li>
            <li> Good shaver but not the best i&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Remington Shaver is excellent and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> In reviewing this razor I had a great opportunity to compare it to my [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this Remington does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> battery life is really great.  </li>
            <li> My skin experienced some irritation.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a great feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Close\\&quot; one works great.</li>
            <li> I gave up on them in my youth because they irritated my skin and never did a good job on my neck.  </li>
            <li> then you are going to find this a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I get a good shave, but not as close a shave as I can get with a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it does give a good shave.</li>
            <li> -750 is certainly a good option.</li>
            <li> Shaves good and feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now, and it really is a good razor for $80.</li>
            <li> everything is good with it except the closeness of the shave is marginal.</li>
            <li> body construction is perfect, hence the close-shave quality of the original blades (3-razor) is disputable.</li>
            <li> I have used so many brands, but this one stand out among it peers!</li>
            <li> This is my first non-Braun electric razor and I am impressed with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> shaver itself looks attractive, and the foil assembly can be removed easily for cleaning and maintenance by just pressing two nearby release buttons.  </li>
            <li> 21 y.o. was thrilled to hear that his dad didn&#x27;t like it, because that means he can keep it all to himself.</li>
            <li> * Holds a nice charge&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I own the Remington MS2-390 Shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nice to have the shaving head move with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice design.</li>
            <li> It has rubber grips on the sides and a nice glossy shiny finish on the front.</li>
            <li> rechargeable cord and bag are also nice additions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the interest of fair play, I do have to say, however, that I have yet to find an electric shaver that does anything more than just warm my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with how it has simplified my grooming needs and made it an enjoyable (cut-free) experience.</li>
            <li> Very good for time when husband needs a fast shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, both shavers feel cheap in the hand.</li>
            <li> I know they are designed for beards, but it&#x27;s curiosity, to see if they can handle the very fine hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do near as good of a job as the blades, but it works great when you are traveling or somewhere</li>
            <li> Battery life is great, and this thing is extremely easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head is nice (albeit bulky) and the shaver&#x27;s ergonomics/handling are better than most.  </li>
            <li> It also charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts, I tried it again.</li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> but I felt the Panasonic was slightly better in every way.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor does the job, eventually, but sometimes it seems to not be able to get a hair or two.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric shavers over the years - foils and circular heads and this is the best electric shaver I have used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fits nicely in the hand although the plastic does feel a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has to do with the triple head, and also the fact that it pivots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a Braun for many years. . .</li>
            <li> The manual suggests a more thorough cleaning every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The resulting shave is comparable to the Norelco I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> as many of the Panny mid-range models (their 2 and 3 head shavers).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulbous; the Panny feels more</li>
            <li> And, of course, if you step up to the 4 blade Panny or the 5 or 7 series Bran you&#x27;ll do even better, but you&#x27;ve also jumped up in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, of course, if you step up to the 4 blade Panny or the 5 or 7 series Bran you&#x27;ll do even better, but you&#x27;ve also jumped up in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results i got with this shaver were OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrics shavers most of my life</li>
            <li> I have found the best way to determine how close and smooth a shave you are getting comes when you apply lotion after you shave the this shaver get the highest grade so far.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have a better opportunity to review this shaver-</li>
            <li> much* better.  </li>
            <li> shaver is great and really works all across your face.</li>
            <li> Have to charge it more often.  </li>
            <li> quality build &amp;  excellent shave plus extra set of blades &amp; foil</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in my car, and it has become my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> you just want an electric shaver to stick in your briefcase/toolbox/desk for \\&quot;quickie\\&quot; jobs on the run, this model is okay.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer is pretty good</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to long term use but at this point it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Closeness is pretty good - plenty close for me.  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly on the beard and chin (and comfortably if you keep the beard fairly short), but not so well on the mustache.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the flexed option because it&#x27;s more comfortable and enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and the &#x27;blades&#x27; can be rinsed in water.  </li>
            <li> After all, the design is undeniably classy and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I tried this shaver on my legs, the search for the perfect shaver being one of my lifelong quests.</li>
            <li> While it has many nice features (a mind-boggling four different \\&quot;blades\\&quot;) and has a good swivel head, it does feel a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> I had a three-day growth and the shave was fairly good and fast.</li>
            <li> In summary, it is powerful and has a nice design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver was not so easy even with the rinsing under water.</li>
            <li> Yes, they made it easy to get the shaver replaced under warranty, but after repeated replacements, I just gave up on the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one gives me a close shave, recharges well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> 16 y.o. liked it very much for the trimming feature for shaping his sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good looks,  high  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear they are paying attention to the successful attributes of the two leading foil makers: Panasonic and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remington needs to make one good product and stop putting out new junk every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I think that it has a comfortable handle, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> that works fine.  </li>
            <li> It also did better (in terms of closeness) than my Braun 5 series, and came pretty darn close to the shave quality of my all-time favorite foil, the Braun 7 series</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of electric razors.</li>
            <li> charging stand would be quite nice, but there&#x27;s something that I really like about the charging cord - you can shave with the cord plugged in.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D; 3 stars (because feel is important to me)eel is important to me)</li>
            <li> he was surprised, his experience has been nothing short of great and if the Braun lines are considered superior so too is their price</li>
            <li> I got a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is worth a look, but be sure to cross-shop Panasonic and Braun as well.</li>
            <li> I waited until I shaved four times with the FR-750 before I felt comfortable writing a review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great for a daily electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Also, the handle is comfortable</li>
            <li> Remington really revolutionizes the shaving process and turns it into something that&#x27;s even kind of enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I get a smooth face, and no razor burn...</li>
            <li> Everything does fit, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a primary shaver that&#x27;ll give you a close shave, move on and keep looking.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this may be good for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly $100 (plus tax, where applicable), and it just isn&#x27;t as good as the $6 disposable</li>
            <li> Clean and smooth in some places, sparse and stubbly in others</li>
            <li> The device disassembles and reassembles easily and quickly for cleaning and maintenance.</li>
            <li> This electric razor provides a very nice and painless, close shave provided you don&#x27;t let the beard get too full prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> , feels a bit higher quality, is a better value, and both are made in PRC/China.  </li>
            <li> so were able to get into the crease in my chin which is a first for an electric shaver for me.</li>
            <li> Like all that I&#x27;ve used it isn&#x27;t as close as even the cheapest disposable blade, but it&#x27;s a lot more convenient and works best when you use it daily instead of trying to tackle several days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I want is a quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Fantastic close, quick shave.  </li>
            <li> I did not get a great shave - I had to clean-up with a wet shave.</li>
            <li> the shave was much better and much closer than I have had with an electric before.</li>
            <li> must say that the Remington FR-750 gives me a closer, faster and better all-around shave then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the brand I started with many years ago, and I always appreciated their &#x60;skip the flash and concentrate on value&#x27;</li>
            <li> This shaver incorporates a true innovation in shaving effectiveness.</li>
            <li> On a daily basis, it does a good job cleaning up and keeping my face groomed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with the area below my ears, which is responsible for most of the times I&#x27;ve cut myself shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is much better than most I&#x27;ve used in the past--too good perhaps if you&#x27;re looking to leave enough stubble to present a three-day beard look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The look is ok and kinda cool; the LED display at the bottom lets you know how much battery life you&#x27;ve got and it turns on and off at the press of a button right below</li>
            <li> Touching my face, however, makes it clear that it isn&#x27;t nearly as smooth as when I use a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have used Remington shavers for years and have found them to be adequate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For what he needs this shaver has delivered, it has a solid feel to it and very easy to use with a 1 button operation, a snap-off head cleaning which makes easy access to the blades, and the LED gauge monitors the battery life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendation: Yes, two thumbs up, and one thumb down, so the two thumbs win.</li>
            <li> I love this new shaver.</li>
            <li> My dear husband is pleased with this shaver,  although he still uses a razor blade when he wants a really close shave,  which is seldom!  </li>
            <li> Therefore I would recommend not buying this razor for most people unless you have very sensitive skin and do not care about a close shave.</li>
            <li> It does a serviceable job and is easy to keep clean, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough to get me to commit fully to changing to this shaver.</li>
            <li> shape is comfortable and easy to hold on to for both of us, which is important because then I tried the trimmer on the back of his neck.</li>
            <li> Braun also gives you better quality, and a more comfortable, but less close shave (</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, unless you have very soft facial hair it&#x27;s going to spend more time in the nice bag it come with than being used.</li>
            <li> But I know that&#x27;s not going to last, so I figured an electric shaver might be nice to use for more frequent shaving.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheap ones in the big box stores</li>
            <li> grow a weeks worth of beard and expect this shaver to work at all.  </li>
            <li> Young guys will love it.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the above superficial flaws of the Remington truthfully portray what lies beneath-</li>
            <li> favorite is still the Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 which is very quiet and gives a good shave when used daily.  </li>
            <li> Much gentler on my face than my last one, and a fairly close shave without applying pressure.</li>
            <li> so far, everything is OK</li>
            <li> The charge time and indicator are useful.</li>
            <li> had a full day&#x27;s growth on my face and decided to give each half a good once-over with each shaver.</li>
            <li> This is worth a look, but be sure to cross-shop Panasonic and Braun as well.baby your face better than any other brand).</li>
            <li> It managed to give me a nice clean shave, and i didnt have to repeat over the same areas too much.</li>
            <li> As close a shave as any razor I&#x27;ve owned, and comfortable;  it also does a good job on even the &#x27;tough places.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the main unit, the travel case included in the package is cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Subsequent shaves were ok and quick - about the same as the Norelco.</li>
            <li> device is lightweight and comfortable to hold with convenient thumb grips placed on each side of the shaver for better control with wet hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall its a decent shaver, but there are far better ones out there on the market right now.</li>
            <li> I have found this shaver cuts the beard completely leaving the skin smooth with the right technique.</li>
            <li> Every new remington that they put out is more cheaply made than the last.</li>
            <li> And as for waiting three weeksfor your hair and skin to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the shaver: get real!</li>
            <li> It shaves a bit closer, sounds higher quality</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor in about 20 years, but I wanted to give one another try.  </li>
            <li> This was after using it daily for a week, so maybe it would get better with more use, especially since I&#x27;m not used to electric razors.  </li>
            <li> It was his first high-quality electric shaver and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> The first day I tried I had a couple of days growth.</li>
            <li> Many years later I decided to try again</li>
            <li> I looked more like a mangy homeless person than a well-groomed individual.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco triple head shaver for many years with overall satisfaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, I was interested to see what their newest venture looks like.</li>
            <li> My first test on an electric shaver is always my legs.</li>
            <li> It was quite loud though, so if noise is important to you, this will be an issue for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a pretty stout beard and the FR-750 cuts it effortlessly; like a steak knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> I am mostly bald and use a shaver to shave the sides and back of my head as well as my face.</li>
            <li> Shaving gets done much faster!</li>
            <li> But what is unforgivable is that it was more like getting a facial wax than a shave.</li>
            <li> Move back and forth 2-3 times and it should cover most of your hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first charge.</li>
            <li> If it is your first time, give your skin a couple weeks to adjust.  </li>
            <li> He first tried to shave three day stubble with the razor and it was disasterous.  </li>
            <li> The razor did better this time; it did not pull his hair, but he did have to make several passes over his face in order to get all of the hair shaved.</li>
            <li> had to go back and try several times and it must&#x27;ve took a good 15 minutes or more trying to get it to shave what takes a regular razor</li>
            <li> The overall design could be better; the large head covers a good-sized area</li>
            <li> I was hoping this one, with its three foils and pivoting flat surface would be able to cut my stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and so far so great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many different features on this razor that show that it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> the unusually shaped A/C charger makes it kind of difficult to fit everything in there comfortably.  </li>
            <li> looks very high tech and</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I find that even when I use it on very short hair I have to run it over my cheeks and neck several times in both directions to do a decent job - and I still have to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; with a disposable razor if I want a clean shave.</li>
            <li> the positive side, the shaver has a high-RPM motor and seems to hold a charge better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> I have a Braun 9595 and Ive tried panasonics and I own a remington F5790 which is better than this FR-750 and far worse than the Braun and even the panasonic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What saves this razor from a one star review is the trimmer (which works well on moustaches/goatees) and the light that indicates how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> The Remington is a much gentler shave.  </li>
            <li> I realize you are supposed to shave every day with this thing to get your face ready for it, but it never seem to take for me.</li>
            <li> I had a 2 day stubble (my hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast), and this couldn&#x27;t cut through it.  </li>
            <li> But none of that really matters to me.</li>
            <li> The razor holds a charge and charges fairly fast.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s already charged so you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I paid so much for the blades</li>
            <li> which I really like. .</li>
            <li> The shave is comfortable enough and there has been no irritation.</li>
            <li> The Remington feels cheap; the Panny feels solid.</li>
            <li> real difference is when you start popping off the heads or using the head lock lever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with this purchase</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver; upgraded from 2 foil Remington &amp; BIG improvement.</li>
            <li> really, who cares about all that in regards to a shaver?</li>
            <li> , my son really likes it</li>
            <li> and I really wanted this one to work.</li>
            <li> I slowed the movement of the razer to give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe I had gone to fast.</li>
            <li> The vibration on this shaver is really just too much, and whether I am shaving my face or my head with it, every time it passes over bone (jawbone, cheekbone, etc), it rattles my skull.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast.  </li>
            <li> Remington really does shave you close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> to this razor, it charges fast and holds that charge very well.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this for my father-in-laws birthday really likes to way</li>
            <li> Slickest design Remington shaver I have ever purchased with much improved trimmer.</li>
            <li> Visually, it does a good job everywhere if I spend about as much time as it takes me to wet shave with a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have used a combination of Braun electric razors and regular old Gilette hand razors for many years.  </li>
            <li> It also has some nice features such as the battery gas gauge, non-slip rubber nibs on grip points, a two-way articulating head, and the ability to lock the head in multiple positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges very quickly and holds it almost as long as my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> As a black man I&#x27;ve only used one foil shaver before in my life and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li> your face better than any other brand).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep charged, shaves close (close enough for a modern 21 year old guy) and is so much easier than the safety razor and</li>
            <li> I keep it at three stars because it does offer the ability to get a good visual appearance with a dry shave, which can come in handy when running late for work</li>
            <li> The shaver has a slight arc, which gives the pop-out trimmer, on the back, more room for maneuvering and making accurate cuts when tidying up sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> This takes twice as long and doesn&#x27;t get nearly as smooth.</li>
            <li> But the following observations are still true.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically it was fine, nothing great or bad to note about that aspect.</li>
            <li> thats how much better/faster this new shaver cuts.</li>
            <li> sure, like all bad ideas, that this shaver seemed like a good idea at the time.</li>
            <li> Their previous razor was much better</li>
            <li> Perhaps older men who don&#x27;t want to give up the safety razor won&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> the shave, my neck is still the toughest area, but it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> Decent shave but</li>
            <li> errr..mimicked the most from Panasonic, with this shaver taking on the same basic form factor</li>
            <li> The FR-750 requires a slightly different technique than the MS2 390 when moving it over the skin to get a close shave, but I quickly mastered it</li>
            <li> ALSO, THE FACE IS NOT AS CLOSE AS IT WAS WITH MY OLDER MODEL.  </li>
            <li> On my Braun, there are multiple foils and the \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li> If I want a decent shave I have to use blades, and that&#x27;s just the way it is.  </li>
            <li> Good with stiff facial</li>
            <li> The three men in my household agreed to test this high quality electric men&#x27;s razor for me.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both Remington &amp; Amazon.</li>
            <li> With repeated use over time, however, it had gotten a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> It grows in very fine and lies down flat at first.</li>
            <li> After all, the folks who were happy with the shaver can&#x27;t all be wrong.</li>
            <li> As a result, I generally use the trimmer first</li>
            <li> Worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t been able to use an electric shaver before, then this might work for you - but it might take a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> , I decided it just wasn&#x27;t worth having such a shaver.  </li>
            <li> After using the Remington for a much longer session than the Phillips, my husband still could not get even half as smooth as he does with the Phillips.  </li>
            <li> comes out with a new one that has the trimmer flush with the heads.</li>
            <li> someone else mentioned even brand new after shaving with this</li>
            <li> But does not shave off my new beard growth at all.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I&#x27;ve amassed a pretty big shaver collection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time I tried pulling the skin, brushing up the hairs at the same time to make sure they were upright and not lying down on the job.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use electric shavers, as my facial hair is pretty thick and dense.</li>
            <li> I prefer shaving dry as I get better results, but this razor allows a wet shave.</li>
            <li> I tried various durations, from a quick brush-by to up to ten seconds directly on the hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few that work fine if you use them everyday, but can&#x27;t cut my facial hair if I leave it more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li> , I would suggest that they give this one a try, and clearly my son would have been a lot happier if he had started with the Remington.</li>
            <li> instructions that came with the shaver were clear.</li>
            <li> The Remington is clearly a notch below in quality.</li>
            <li> like the battery gauge as well as a clear indicator when it needs to be charged, and that it can be used while charging.</li>
            <li> I found it harder to get a smooth shave along my jawline, but my teenage son preferred it to the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my favorite Braun razor is no longer being made and it is getting harder and harder to get replacement cutters for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it comes to actual shaving: not so much.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver on a daily basis was also fast using the enclosed brush and tap water.</li>
            <li> : I have a soft spot for Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> I would describe my facial hair as coarse,stiff, and straight.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington FR-750 to replace my old Remington MS2 390 that would no longer retain a charge.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was no where near as close a shave.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of the Remington FR -750.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how well built it is.</li>
            <li> There is an on button and a battery indicator with a green LED light.</li>
            <li> If this razor had alternate foils, I think it would work so much</li>
            <li> So realistically speaking, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much when I bought this shaver; but to leave entire patches of whiskers in its wake???  </li>
            <li> In spite of leaving patches, the shaver does cut long whiskers rather well, and the pop-out trimmer is pretty</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true what they say: black men can&#x27;t use foil shavers.</li>
            <li> Back in high school, I tried a few (admittedly cheap) electric razors.</li>
            <li> Shave with a disposable razor first (or buzz as short as possible with clippers) and then use this shave.  </li>
            <li> In summary, I think that it&#x27;s a decent product, but I won&#x27;t use it regularly because I get a smoother shave with a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the idea of having to use my free hand to stretch my skin just to get a proper shave is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I thought, maybe shaving from different directions might help; so I tried it from down coming up, then up going down, then diagonally from both left and right.</li>
            <li> I tried an expensive Norelco shaver but kept using my old Remington shaver afterwards, so I decided to go back to Remington with a new shaver and am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> It does a solid job of cutting whiskers, the floating / swivel head is a big plus, and it is pretty easy to clean out after each use.  </li>
            <li> Too light to be made of anything other than plastic materials (despite both seemingly being constructed of metal parts), the Remington actually looks as fragile as it feels.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that you need to use the shaver daily for for up to 3 weeks to allow your skin and hair to get conditioned to the new shaver - so I will continue to use and update as to progress.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a new low for</li>
            <li> You should expect a no irritation shave (even when dry) and a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Second, I felt like I was trying to mow my face- after an initial sweep I had to keep working areas just to get some real</li>
            <li> For the same price or less you can get a 3 or 4 blade Panny (they have so many model numbers that it&#x27;s impossible to list all the ones that are appropriate) that offers better quality, the ability to shave wet or dry and a linear motor (keeps the speed constant regardless of the charge level).</li>
            <li> The lack of a charging stand is a non-issue since we generally put shavers in a drawer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like is this thing really working; but the smooth close shave left behind</li>
            <li> My husband frequently gets irritation from the Phillips shaver, and the Remington never gave him the slightest red area.  </li>
            <li> Really give yourself at least a weeks worth of daily shaves before passing judgement on this style</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always come back to the old safety razor.</li>
            <li> I found this razor completely incapable of shaving my neck properly.</li>
            <li> I would describe his facial hair as soft and curly.</li>
            <li> The shaver could barely give him a shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is okay but not great.  </li>
            <li> The pivot head is kind of useless.</li>
            <li> I found that the inclusion of the one new foil did make this shaver less aggressive than the normal Remington-style shave, but it&#x27;s still rougher on the face than Panasonic or Braun.</li>
            <li> then my husband tried it on his face, it managed the curves well, including a spot on his jaw that seems to get skipped with other shavers, and the shave was very close.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is well placed on the unit, popping out far enough to use it regularly, not just \\&quot;in</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a high school aged boy.  </li>
            <li> I have a patchy kind of beard (thick in some places and thin in others) and this razor does very well.  </li>
            <li> Like most men, I hate shaving and fortunately can currently get away with shaving only about twice a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but will get most of your stub and hair on the first few times.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic uses a higher RPM motor that seems to do a better job of being less irritating and it shaves slightly closer.  </li>
            <li> Work good on tough medium thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if this product would be a good replacement for the disposable razors that I&#x27;ve been using, and I must (unfortunately) say that after only a few uses I have decided to stick with the disposable instead of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2 passes, I felt some spots that were perfectly clear and other spots in the same path that still had hair - almost like it was untouched</li>
            <li> This shaver with the fourth flat foil shaves the longer hairs as well.</li>
            <li> More than once, it ruthlessly tugged at my whiskers, without making clean cuts, and gauging from the pain, managed to pull said whiskers from their sockets!</li>
            <li> Regardless of skin condition (I tried both dry and recently washed and dried), the shaver just didn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li> It also uses the flex head design with a position lock, and the flat hair comb (a flat piece in the head assembly that moves back and forth to prop up flat-lying beard hairs; also found in Brauns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see at least one other reviewer state that she always tried out men&#x27;s electric razors on her legs first.  </li>
            <li> I expected to use it occasionally but rely on traditional razors for a regular use, but it&#x27;s the opposite now.</li>
            <li> Despite this, it seems well made, and I hope it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Both long hair trimmers work properly.</li>
            <li> The batteries never last as long as they are advertised, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me anymore.</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;ve had the shaver for a few years, and it&#x27;s been discontinued and new models come out, then it becomes even more expensive to purchase blades, and they become harder to find.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting a closer shave in less time than before with the old shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the Remington looks similar to the Panny it does not fit nearly as well in your hand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any \\&quot;loose hairs\\&quot; that the FR-750 has missed, so perhaps that will not be an issue in the future.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s only used on one of the three foils, with the other two being the standard Remington</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m prone to irritation, but with a little help from some talc, this razor has given me no irritation.  </li>
            <li> really like how the razor reaches all the hard to get areas along your face.</li>
            <li> My husband has coarse facial hair that grows at about an average rate.  </li>
            <li> This way I&#x27;ll keep this one as long as it lasts. . .</li>
            <li> Not gouge-your-face rough, but you definitely know you&#x27;ve shaved after you&#x27;re done with a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased a very similar (in design, not quality) Panasonic shaver when I had the chance to receive the Remington a few months later for review via the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you&#x27;ll save money on razors in the long run.</li>
            <li> Nope, slow or fast it refused to shave my neck and tore hairs out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reviewing what other reviewers have written, I&#x27;ve decided to put this review on hold pending further testing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had several other electric shavers in my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> soured me on Remington was their steady decline in quality.</li>
            <li> Additionally, this razor is quite large, which is not good for travel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed; and if I had paid full price I&#x27;d be downright irate.  </li>
            <li> is that the trimmer will come up just to where the blades are, so you can give your face a \\&quot;once-over\\&quot; to clip any \\&quot;loose hairs\\&quot; that the shaver itself might have missed.  </li>
            <li> Not good with soft facial hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to grip, but the trimmer blade extends from the opposite side beneath the head, making it a little awkward to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A more minor complaint is the width of the foils can make shaving above the lip a bit awkward.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in hopes it will last longer than I expect it to, but it feels a little \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My initial shave was not a comfortable one.  </li>
            <li> facial hair is medium coarse, sparse and grows slowly.</li>
            <li> One of the things I noticed right away is that the actual cutting action is hard to hear or feel.</li>
            <li> There is no charging stand and the shaver lays flat on the sink which is a little unsightly.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t had thick facial hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take me too long to shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other razors on the market today, but I think it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Remington does a terrific job and provides the close shave I usually need to follow up with a hand razor to get.  </li>
            <li> If you were to pick up a Panasonic in this price range in one hand, and the Remington in the other, you&#x27;d know the answer.</li>
            <li> \\&quot; feel that I&#x27;ve come to know with other Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Says it shaves closer than any other shaver he has had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet that now I don&#x27;t worry about disturbing other people when I shave (the MS2 390 is LOUD).</li>
            <li> Maybe people who are used to electric shavers will be fine with this (because it really isn&#x27;t bad), but I&#x27;ll be sticking to my razor.</li>
            <li> The commitment to Remington goes back at least 50 years.</li>
            <li> The principle parts of the razor should last at least a year or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just average.  </li>
            <li> It does pull on some hairs that are 1/4&amp;#34; or longer, so be careful if you wait a few days between shaves.</li>
            <li> Reduced my shaving time from 6 to 7 minutes down to 3 or 4 minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Breaking it down</li>
            <li> A few other complaints--</li>
            <li> For the past few years they cheapened their designs to the point where their shavers rarely lasted longer than a year before failing in one of two ways: either a plastic hinge/attachment/clip broke, or the battery failed to retain a charge (and sometimes both).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shaver has the same problem as all others that I&#x27;ve used: it just doesn&#x27;t get a close enough</li>
            <li> I like that this Remington FR-750 shaver is lighter-weight and easier to hold and maneuver than my previous shaver.  </li>
            <li> Remington departs from their typical design and incorporates elements from Panasonic and Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable to use, particularly in the area of my moustache.</li>
            <li> and I mean whiskers, not nubs, and that&#x27;s on the flat part of my face, too.  </li>
            <li> but I guess I&#x27;m just one of those guys with tough facial hair that nothing but a very sharp razor will cut through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, getting a worse shave in the same amount of time as a blade is what drops this down for me.  </li>
            <li> This electric shaver was ordered for my son, who has had problems in the past with his other two brands (one is a Philips).  </li>
            <li> the customer new to electric shavers, or frustrated with their current one</li>
            <li> for the downsides, it is loud and uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Charge does not fit what description claims.  </li>
            <li> (usually what&#x27;s been missed on previous shaves) but the foils felt rougher than the round heads.  </li>
            <li> black no more than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> son also tested this out, he&#x27;s around 20, but the results for him were pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different electric shavers and this one isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A CLEAN SHAVE ON JAW BONE AREA, AND EVEN WORSE UNDER THE CHIN AND NECK.  </li>
            <li> My wife even asked me to put it away because it was irritating her to have the loose cord just laying there (and she has an electric razor that she keeps on the counter).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The little hairs just stood upright, fluttering their tips at the razor and making the hair-equivalent of rude noises.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Remington was trying to accomplish with this shaver, but I think a minimum requirement should be that the shaver does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: shave.</li>
            <li> in usual Remington fashion, you give up some comfort to get that level of closeness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well the \\&quot;intercept trimmer\\&quot; on the Remington worked to catch the longer hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled in the past with</li>
            <li> and I usually shave in the car.</li>
            <li> This makes it very difficult to shave off at first, especially without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> By that, I mean that I look like I shaved, but it does take a while because it takes a few passes to get all of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to shave long whiskers and fuzz on the neck with the redesigned trimmer-like I could with my F5790.</li>
            <li> When I had him read some of the negative reviews about the Remington</li>
            <li> However, it was inconvenient to store the razor for its next use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through at least thirty 2 minute sessions and battery is still going</li>
            <li> I have thick whisker.  </li>
            <li> However, the trade off is not a very great shave.  </li>
            <li> if I have a week or two old beard, the razor does occasionally pull on the hairs (unpleasant, mildly painful).  </li>
            <li> It left patches of hair and it was impossible for me to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Storage of the shaver after use was not good.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed overall compared to the 3 screen shaver from Remington that this replaced.  </li>
            <li> I thought the pivoting head was a little annoying, but it has a lock to hold it firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this one is a game changer.</li>
            <li> * Cutting is uneven.  </li>
            <li> Because of their poor quality, I didn&#x27;t pick up another electric razor until this one, 15 years</li>
            <li> now I do not have the bloody red chaffed skin from blade shaving.</li>
            <li> It does an even worse job around the chin &amp; neck areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The suggested monthly cleaning routine is cumbersome and time-consuming and a real negative.</li>
            <li> Also the recommendations to replace the screens and cutters every six months is a real negative and a turn off.</li>
            <li> And it failed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a square jaw, and the way this thing cut felt random.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry to say they still can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a travel bag, power cord, instructions and the battery</li>
            <li> Now I will admit upfront, I have a weird beard.</li>
            <li> This razor failed miserably at shaving my legs (which, by the way, are not super hairy)</li>
            <li> * Cutting is inadequate.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand why some reviewers did not like this shaver&#x27;s cutting performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It literally tore hairs out of my neck instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> No charging base - just a cord that plugs in.  </li>
            <li> Miserably.</li>
            <li> this is a terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shaver, the best micro screen Remington I have ever used. Reduced my shaving time from 6 to 7 minutes down to 3 or 4 minutes thats how much better/faster this new shaver cuts.</li>
            <li> Very good for time when husband needs a fast shave.</li>
            <li> One of the best Rechargeable charger ever made! I have used so many brands, but this one stand out among it peers!</li>
            <li> This shaver is okay but not great.  I will be comparing it to a Phillips Norelco electric shaver.  The Remington is a much gentler shave.  My husband frequently gets irritation from the Phillips shaver, and the Remington never gave him the slightest red area.  If you have sensitive skin, this may be good for you.  However, the trade off is not a very great shave.  The Remington does not get a close shave.  After using the Remington for a much longer session than the Phillips, my husband still could not get even half as smooth as he does with the Phillips.  The difference was quite noticeable by both look and touch.  Additionally, this razor is quite large, which is not good for travel.  Therefore I would recommend not buying this razor for most people unless you have very sensitive skin and do not care about a close shave.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra $$$. Much better than the cheap ones in the big box stores</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how lightweight this rechargeable shaver was when the box arrived. Despite this, it seems well made, and I hope it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> After reviewing what other reviewers have written, I&#x27;ve decided to put this review on hold pending further testing. After all, the folks who were happy with the shaver can&#x27;t all be wrong. But the following observations are still true. More soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, like all bad ideas, that this shaver seemed like a good idea at the time. After all, the design is undeniably classy and it looks great. When it comes to actual shaving: not so much. Like another reviewer, I tried this shaver on my legs, the search for the perfect shaver being one of my lifelong quests. And it failed. Miserably. Here&#x27;s the problem. Regardless of skin condition (I tried both dry and recently washed and dried), the shaver just didn&#x27;t shave very well. Under both skin conditions, I identified several hairs to be shaved (ranging from about ¼ of an inch to about ½ an inch), and the shaver just didn&#x27;t shave them. At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts, I tried it again. And again. And again. I tried various durations, from a quick brush-by to up to ten seconds directly on the hairs. Nothing. The little hairs just stood upright, fluttering their tips at the razor and making the hair-equivalent of rude noises. But I thought, \\&quot;Well of course the shaver isn&#x27;t going to shave the hairs it&#x27;s just mashed down,\\&quot; so I lifted it up and tried again. This time I tried pulling the skin, brushing up the hairs at the same time to make sure they were upright and not lying down on the job. Okay, I thought, maybe shaving from different directions might help; so I tried it from down coming up, then up going down, then diagonally from both left and right. Still nothing. As in, no effect at all. Finally, I tried just brushing the hairs upwards, but still no effect. So, I don&#x27;t get it. I&#x27;m not sure what Remington was trying to accomplish with this shaver, but I think a minimum requirement should be that the shaver does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: shave. And as for waiting three weeksfor your hair and skin to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the shaver: get real! Overall I&#x27;d give it a miss.</li>
            <li> In reviewing this razor I had a great opportunity to compare it to my [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] and I actually preferred the cheaper Panasonic, although the newer 4 blade version might be comparable priced to this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This style shaver must be used every day or two (or even twice a day for some people) for best results.  You should expect a no irritation shave (even when dry) and a very close shave.  I felt the Remington came up a bit short.  The Panasonic uses a higher RPM motor that seems to do a better job of being less irritating and it shaves slightly closer.  Both razors will tend to miss longer hairs and in some rougher patches of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t grow a weeks worth of beard and expect this shaver to work at all.  You will get hairs pulled, missed spots, etc.  Shave with a disposable razor first (or buzz as short as possible with clippers) and then use this shave.  Really give yourself at least a weeks worth of daily shaves before passing judgement on this style shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, I like the shaver okay, but I felt the Panasonic was slightly better in every way.  It shaves a bit closer, sounds higher quality, feels a bit higher quality, is a better value, and both are made in PRC/China.  I prefer shaving dry as I get better results, but this razor allows a wet shave.</li>
            <li> The three men in my household agreed to test this high quality electric men&#x27;s razor for me. They are 52, 21 and 16, and all of them currently shave with a safety razor and Edge (or a similar brand) shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 52 y.o. does not like the Remington razor and is going to stick with the safety razor. He said the Remington was not a close enough shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 21 y.o. was thrilled to hear that his dad didn&#x27;t like it, because that means he can keep it all to himself. He loves it. It&#x27;s easy to keep charged, shaves close (close enough for a modern 21 year old guy) and is so much easier than the safety razor and gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16 y.o. liked it very much for the trimming feature for shaping his sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Yes, two thumbs up, and one thumb down, so the two thumbs win. Perhaps older men who don&#x27;t want to give up the safety razor won&#x27;t like it. Young guys will love it.</li>
            <li> This electric razor does the job, eventually, but sometimes it seems to not be able to get a hair or two. I realize you are supposed to shave every day with this thing to get your face ready for it, but it never seem to take for me. There was always a stray hair or two that I had to stretch my face or use the flip out blade to try to get. I don&#x27;t think this one is a game changer. It does a serviceable job and is easy to keep clean, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough to get me to commit fully to changing to this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor in about 20 years, but I wanted to give one another try.  I gave up on them in my youth because they irritated my skin and never did a good job on my neck.  In summary, I think that it&#x27;s a decent product, but I won&#x27;t use it regularly because I get a smoother shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this Remington does not irritate my skin.  I definitely can feel it afterwards, but if I put on aftershave, there&#x27;s no lasting effects.  It&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the shave, my neck is still the toughest area, but it does a decent job.  Visually, it does a good job everywhere if I spend about as much time as it takes me to wet shave with a blade.  By that, I mean that I look like I shaved, but it does take a while because it takes a few passes to get all of the hairs.  Touching my face, however, makes it clear that it isn&#x27;t nearly as smooth as when I use a blade.  This was after using it daily for a week, so maybe it would get better with more use, especially since I&#x27;m not used to electric razors.  For me, getting a worse shave in the same amount of time as a blade is what drops this down for me.  I keep it at three stars because it does offer the ability to get a good visual appearance with a dry shave, which can come in handy when running late for work and you need to shave in the car...ahem...at stop lights.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomics of the razor work for me.  I think that it has a comfortable handle, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I can&#x27;t compare it to other razors on the market today, but I think it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A charging stand would be quite nice, but there&#x27;s something that I really like about the charging cord - you can shave with the cord plugged in.  For people like me who sometimes let the batteries get too low, this is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breaking it down, my rating is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics &#x3D; 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;Shave, visually &#x3D; 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;Shave, feel &#x3D; 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;Overall &#x3D; 3 stars (because feel is important to me)eel is important to me)</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a high school aged boy.  It was his first high-quality electric shaver and he loves it.  The men in our family only use Remington foil shavers. We have all tried the more expensive brands and we always return to Remington.  The commitment to Remington goes back at least 50 years.</li>
            <li> I must start by acknowledging the fact that I have shaved with a disposable razor for about the last 15 years, though I used an electric razor prior to that.  I wanted to see if this product would be a good replacement for the disposable razors that I&#x27;ve been using, and I must (unfortunately) say that after only a few uses I have decided to stick with the disposable instead of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;* Holds a nice charge&lt;br /&gt;* Sleek, attractive&lt;br /&gt;* Trimmer is pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* No charging base - just a cord that plugs in.  Looks rather unsightly just laying on the bathroom counter.  My wife even asked me to put it away because it was irritating her to have the loose cord just laying there (and she has an electric razor that she keeps on the counter).&lt;br /&gt;* Cutting is inadequate.  I had a 2 day stubble (my hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast), and this couldn&#x27;t cut through it.  Even with just one day&#x27;s growth, this couldn&#x27;t cut through it - even with multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;* Cutting is uneven.  I don&#x27;t have a square jaw, and the way this thing cut felt random.  After 2 passes, I felt some spots that were perfectly clear and other spots in the same path that still had hair - almost like it was untouched (hence the comment that the cutter couldn&#x27;t cut through my facial hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product.  It&#x27;s nearly $100 (plus tax, where applicable), and it just isn&#x27;t as good as the $6 disposable I have been using.  I was quite disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use electric shavers, as my facial hair is pretty thick and dense. After a wet-shave there is still a shadow. The first day I tried I had a couple of days growth. It was uncomfortable to use, particularly in the area of my moustache. I did not get a great shave - I had to clean-up with a wet shave. I tried again the following day and this time the shave was much better and much closer than I have had with an electric before. The four independently sprung head have a smaller radius of curvature so were able to get into the crease in my chin which is a first for an electric shaver for me. It is recommended that you need to use the shaver daily for for up to 3 weeks to allow your skin and hair to get conditioned to the new shaver - so I will continue to use and update as to progress. I have tried several electric shavers over the years - foils and circular heads and this is the best electric shaver I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is lightweight and comfortable to hold with convenient thumb grips placed on each side of the shaver for better control with wet hands. The shaver has a slight arc, which gives the pop-out trimmer, on the back, more room for maneuvering and making accurate cuts when tidying up sideburns, etc. The device disassembles and reassembles easily and quickly for cleaning and maintenance. It has an operating time of around 30 min per charge, but can also be operated corded if the charge runs-out. It comes with a travel-bag to store the shaver, power-cord  and cleaning brush when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you regularly use an electric shaver then you are going to find this a good replacement. If you haven&#x27;t been able to use an electric shaver before, then this might work for you - but it might take a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different electric shavers over the years and I&#x27;ve always come back to the old safety razor. Like most men, I hate shaving and fortunately can currently get away with shaving only about twice a week. But I know that&#x27;s not going to last, so I figured an electric shaver might be nice to use for more frequent shaving. Unfortunately, this shaver has the same problem as all others that I&#x27;ve used: it just doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shave, I want to be done as soon as possible. With a razor, I can go over each spot about two or three times and be done. With an electric shaver, I have to go over everything about 15 times and even then there are missed hairs. I found this razor completely incapable of shaving my neck properly. While it has many nice features (a mind-boggling four different \\&quot;blades\\&quot;) and has a good swivel head, it does feel a bit cheap. But none of that really matters to me. All I want is a quick, smooth shave. This doesn&#x27;t do it. I can shave with a razor in the shower in about 90 seconds. This takes twice as long and doesn&#x27;t get nearly as smooth. Maybe people who are used to electric shavers will be fine with this (because it really isn&#x27;t bad), but I&#x27;ll be sticking to my razor.</li>
            <li> Good shaver but not the best i&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> This electric shaver was ordered for my son, who has had problems in the past with his other two brands (one is a Philips).  When I had him read some of the negative reviews about the Remington he was surprised, his experience has been nothing short of great and if the Braun lines are considered superior so too is their price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what he needs this shaver has delivered, it has a solid feel to it and very easy to use with a 1 button operation, a snap-off head cleaning which makes easy access to the blades, and the LED gauge monitors the battery life. The shave itself is effortless, gliding over jaw, chin, etc, without his need to rub his face to get the hairs up and then dragging the shaver back and forth or side to side.  This is probably a benefit of the Remington&#x27;s pivoting capabilities, it moved over every surface without a snag. The pop-up trimmer was another detail that he mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the customer new to electric shavers, or frustrated with their current one, I would suggest that they give this one a try, and clearly my son would have been a lot happier if he had started with the Remington.</li>
            <li> I have used a combination of Braun electric razors and regular old Gilette hand razors for many years.  I&#x27;ve never felt I could get the close shave I wanted with the electric razor and usually do a final shave with the hand razor.  This is my first non-Braun electric razor and I am impressed with the closeness of the shave.  This Remington does a terrific job and provides the close shave I usually need to follow up with a hand razor to get.  The razor holds a charge and charges fairly fast.  It&#x27;s fits nicely in the hand although the plastic does feel a bit cheap.  A few other complaints--if I have a week or two old beard, the razor does occasionally pull on the hairs (unpleasant, mildly painful).  As a result, I generally use the trimmer first and then the foils and that works fine.  The trimmer is much better than most I&#x27;ve used in the past--too good perhaps if you&#x27;re looking to leave enough stubble to present a three-day beard look.  A more minor complaint is the width of the foils can make shaving above the lip a bit awkward.  It works perfectly on the beard and chin (and comfortably if you keep the beard fairly short), but not so well on the mustache.  BL--This electric razor provides a very nice and painless, close shave provided you don&#x27;t let the beard get too full prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> As a black man I&#x27;ve only used one foil shaver before in my life and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  They just don&#x27;t seem to be made to handle our coarse, curly hair.  Many years later I decided to try again and I&#x27;m sorry to say they still can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a travel bag, power cord, instructions and the battery&#x27;s already charged so you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look is ok and kinda cool; the LED display at the bottom lets you know how much battery life you&#x27;ve got and it turns on and off at the press of a button right below where your thumb rests- not the best spot as I ended up turning it off accidentally a couple times.  The overall design could be better; the large head covers a good-sized area and it&#x27;s easy to grip, but the trimmer blade extends from the opposite side beneath the head, making it a little awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing this was coming in the mail I gave myself a four-day growth to test it on.  First, the idea of having to use my free hand to stretch my skin just to get a proper shave is ridiculous.  Never have to do that with a traditional razor.  Second, I felt like I was trying to mow my face- after an initial sweep I had to keep working areas just to get some real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about ten minutes I finally threw in the towel.  Clean and smooth in some places, sparse and stubbly in others I looked more like a mangy homeless person than a well-groomed individual.  Even with the head locked in place and going across the easier planes of my chin and jawline it still missed plenty.  And don&#x27;t even get me started about my neck- I can already feel the razor bumps emerging as I type this up.  I guess it&#x27;s true what they say: black men can&#x27;t use foil shavers.</li>
            <li> I own the Remington MS2-390 Shaver.  I&#x27;ve also had several other electric shavers in my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that the Remington FR-750 gives me a closer, faster and better all-around shave then the MS2-390.  I&#x27;m sure it has to do with the triple head, and also the fact that it pivots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is really great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and it still shows \\&quot;full\\&quot;.  Granted, I don&#x27;t had thick facial hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take me too long to shave. I like the fact that the battery level also shows on the front, so you know when you need to charge it, and don&#x27;t have to guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that you can rinse the blades in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I must admit though. . .  .It doesn&#x27;t feel like a \\&quot;quality\\&quot; razor.  I&#x27;m in hopes it will last longer than I expect it to, but it feels a little \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  But, it&#x27;s been my experience, where the shaver companies tend to make their money is on replacement blades.  After you&#x27;ve had the shaver for a few years, and it&#x27;s been discontinued and new models come out, then it becomes even more expensive to purchase blades, and they become harder to find.  It&#x27;s for this reason that I don&#x27;t invest in a high-end shaver.  I had a Braun for many years. . . but I paid so much for the blades, I decided it just wasn&#x27;t worth having such a shaver.  This way I&#x27;ll keep this one as long as it lasts. . . and then \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that the MS2-390 has that this one doesn&#x27;t. . . . which I really like. . . is that the trimmer will come up just to where the blades are, so you can give your face a \\&quot;once-over\\&quot; to clip any \\&quot;loose hairs\\&quot; that the shaver itself might have missed.  I&#x27;ve not seen a shaver, before the MS2-390 which would do this.  Having said that. . . . I haven&#x27;t found any \\&quot;loose hairs\\&quot; that the FR-750 has missed, so perhaps that will not be an issue in the future.  The FR-750 does have a trimmer, which pops-up on the back.</li>
            <li> I like that this Remington FR-750 shaver is lighter-weight and easier to hold and maneuver than my previous shaver.  My initial shave was not a comfortable one.  My skin experienced some irritation.  With repeated use over time, however, it had gotten a little bit better.  I get a good shave, but not as close a shave as I can get with a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself looks attractive, and the foil assembly can be removed easily for cleaning and maintenance by just pressing two nearby release buttons.  The device comes with a convenient storage / travel pouch.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco triple head shaver for many years with overall satisfaction. I wanted to try the Remington R750 to see if there is an improvement in overall shaving satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that came with the shaver were clear. I had a three-day growth and the shave was fairly good and fast. I have no problems with the shave. Cleaning the shaver was not so easy even with the rinsing under water. Storage of the shaver after use was not good. There is no charging stand and the shaver lays flat on the sink which is a little unsightly. The manual suggests a more thorough cleaning every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested monthly cleaning routine is cumbersome and time-consuming and a real negative. Also the recommendations to replace the screens and cutters every six months is a real negative and a turn off. The principle parts of the razor should last at least a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent shaves were ok and quick - about the same as the Norelco. Cleaning the shaver on a daily basis was also fast using the enclosed brush and tap water. However, it was inconvenient to store the razor for its next use. It definitely requires a stand for overnight storage. The shave is comfortable enough and there has been no irritation. The resulting shave is comparable to the Norelco I have been using for many years. However, I would recommend the Norelco for its convenience in storage, overall cleaning and routine maintenance.</li>
            <li> Summary: Remington departs from their typical design and incorporates elements from Panasonic and Braun shavers. Decent shave but the build quality remains suspect, making this a bit of a risky purchase compared to similar Braun and Panasonic models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review: I have a soft spot for Remington shavers. It&#x27;s the brand I started with many years ago, and I always appreciated their &#x60;skip the flash and concentrate on value&#x27; designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What soured me on Remington was their steady decline in quality. For the past few years they cheapened their designs to the point where their shavers rarely lasted longer than a year before failing in one of two ways: either a plastic hinge/attachment/clip broke, or the battery failed to retain a charge (and sometimes both). Yes, they made it easy to get the shaver replaced under warranty, but after repeated replacements, I just gave up on the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was interested to see what their newest venture looks like. It&#x27;s clear they are paying attention to the successful attributes of the two leading foil makers: Panasonic and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stole..errr..mimicked the most from Panasonic, with this shaver taking on the same basic form factor as many of the Panny mid-range models (their 2 and 3 head shavers). It also uses the flex head design with a position lock, and the flat hair comb (a flat piece in the head assembly that moves back and forth to prop up flat-lying beard hairs; also found in Brauns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Braun they got the irregular shaped holes in the foil (Braun calls it Optifoil or Smartfoil). But, it&#x27;s only used on one of the three foils, with the other two being the standard Remington design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes. I got a close, smooth shave. No complaints about the shave. It also has some nice features such as the battery gas gauge, non-slip rubber nibs on grip points, a two-way articulating head, and the ability to lock the head in multiple positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only three stars? If you were to pick up a Panasonic in this price range in one hand, and the Remington in the other, you&#x27;d know the answer. The Remington feels cheap; the Panny feels solid. Same for the Braun 3 series, which is also in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Remington looks similar to the Panny it does not fit nearly as well in your hand. It&#x27;s bulbous; the Panny feels more sculpted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture doesn&#x27;t change when you turn them on - that Remington buzz just doesn&#x27;t scream quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real difference is when you start popping off the heads or using the head lock lever. The Remington is clearly a notch below in quality. It&#x27;s got that \\&quot;I&#x27;ll last for maybe a year...\\&quot; feel that I&#x27;ve come to know with other Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it does give a good shave. I can&#x27;t take that away from it. On my face it provided a closer shave than my 2 and 3 blade Panasonics, and about equaled the shave from a 4 blade Panny. It also did better (in terms of closeness) than my Braun 5 series, and came pretty darn close to the shave quality of my all-time favorite foil, the Braun 7 series (Yes, I&#x27;ve amassed a pretty big shaver collection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in usual Remington fashion, you give up some comfort to get that level of closeness. I found that the inclusion of the one new foil did make this shaver less aggressive than the normal Remington-style shave, but it&#x27;s still rougher on the face than Panasonic or Braun. Not gouge-your-face rough, but you definitely know you&#x27;ve shaved after you&#x27;re done with a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I keep thinking about the build quality. For the same price or less you can get a 3 or 4 blade Panny (they have so many model numbers that it&#x27;s impossible to list all the ones that are appropriate) that offers better quality, the ability to shave wet or dry and a linear motor (keeps the speed constant regardless of the charge level). Braun also gives you better quality, and a more comfortable, but less close shave (Braun&#x27;sbaby your face better than any other brand). And, of course, if you step up to the 4 blade Panny or the 5 or 7 series Bran you&#x27;ll do even better, but you&#x27;ve also jumped up in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud Remington&#x27;s progress in design, yet am still waiting for the build quality to show similar progress. This is worth a look, but be sure to cross-shop Panasonic and Braun as well.baby your face better than any other brand). And, of course, if you step up to the 4 blade Panny or the 5 or 7 series Bran you&#x27;ll do even better, but you&#x27;ve also jumped up in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud Remington&#x27;s progress in design, yet am still waiting for the build quality to show similar progress. This is worth a look, but be sure to cross-shop Panasonic and Braun as well.</li>
            <li> My first test on an electric shaver is always my legs. I know they are designed for beards, but it&#x27;s curiosity, to see if they can handle the very fine hair on my legs. Most fail completely.&lt;br /&gt;This one didn&#x27;t, it actually worked on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then my husband tried it on his face, it managed the curves well, including a spot on his jaw that seems to get skipped with other shavers, and the shave was very close. Not razor close, I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver gets razor close, but closer than any of the standard foils he&#x27;s used have ever gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is comfortable and easy to hold on to for both of us, which is important because then I tried the trimmer on the back of his neck. The trimmer is well placed on the unit, popping out far enough to use it regularly, not just \\&quot;in a pinch\\&quot; and the trimmer works well without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the battery gauge as well as a clear indicator when it needs to be charged, and that it can be used while charging. The lack of a charging stand is a non-issue since we generally put shavers in a drawer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His facial hair is medium coarse, sparse and grows slowly. I don&#x27;t know if it would work as well on thicker or coarser hair.</li>
            <li> The results i got with this shaver were OK. I would describe my facial hair as coarse,stiff, and straight. It managed to give me a nice clean shave, and i didnt have to repeat over the same areas too much. Ergonomically it was fine, nothing great or bad to note about that aspect. I like the included intercept trimmer(for sideburns). It was quite loud though, so if noise is important to you, this will be an issue for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son also tested this out, he&#x27;s around 20, but the results for him were pretty bad. I would describe his facial hair as soft and curly. The shaver could barely give him a shave. He had to use the pop-up trimmer and that managed to shave his facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Loud&lt;br /&gt;- Not good with soft facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good with stiff facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to clean up and it is water-safe&lt;br /&gt;- Charge indicator&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with carry pouch&lt;br /&gt;- Intercept trimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrics shavers most of my life and I&#x27;m 73 so I have some experience with them. I&#x27;ve used Norelco, Braun, Panasonic, Wahl and numerous Remingtons. I waited until I shaved four times with the FR-750 before I felt comfortable writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;The feel on my face is like a cross between my older Remington and a Braun, but I can say that this shaver gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had of all my previous shavers. One of the things I noticed right away is that the actual cutting action is hard to hear or feel. It&#x27;s like is this thing really working; but the smooth close shave left behind says yes it&#x27;s definitely working. I have a pretty stout beard and the FR-750 cuts it effortlessly; like a steak knife through butter.  I have found the best way to determine how close and smooth a shave you are getting comes when you apply lotion after you shave the this shaver get the highest grade so far. Can&#x27;t speak to long term use but at this point it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Its a re-branded shaver totally made in China of IZUMI FR-750 (MADE IN JAPAN, except the charger made in China having the PSE JET certification.) I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its body construction is perfect, hence the close-shave quality of the original blades (3-razor) is disputable. They didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try replacement blades for FLYCO FS681/682 from China, because they are compatible and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington FR-750 to replace my old Remington MS2 390 that would no longer retain a charge. The FR-750 is very quiet compared to the MS2 390. It&#x27;s so quiet that now I don&#x27;t worry about disturbing other people when I shave (the MS2 390 is LOUD). The FR-750 requires a slightly different technique than the MS2 390 when moving it over the skin to get a close shave, but I quickly mastered it and I&#x27;m getting a closer shave in less time than before with the old shaver. This shaver catches the beard cuttings so they don&#x27;t fall on my shirt. The cuttings stay inside the shaver until I&#x27;ve emptied it. The popup trimmer woks well on my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why some reviewers did not like this shaver&#x27;s cutting performance. I suspect they simply did not use it according to the instructions where one moves the shaver in a circular motion. I have found this shaver cuts the beard completely leaving the skin smooth with the right technique. I&#x27;m very please with this purchase and I recommend the Remington FR-750.</li>
            <li> Their previous razor was much better</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver; upgraded from 2 foil Remington &amp; BIG improvement. Both long hair trimmers work properly. Bought a spare at &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; price.</li>
            <li> This shaver incorporates a true innovation in shaving effectiveness. I am mostly bald and use a shaver to shave the sides and back of my head as well as my face. I have used Remington shavers for years and have found them to be adequate. There were always longer hairs that did not get shaved on my upper lip, the back of my head, on my neck and on the sides of my face. I used the trimmer to cut them off. This shaver with the fourth flat foil shaves the longer hairs as well. Shaving gets done much faster!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have a better opportunity to review this shaver- I had recently purchased a very similar (in design, not quality) Panasonic shaver when I had the chance to receive the Remington a few months later for review via the Amazon Vine program. Wow, what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shavers have a very similar shape and are almost identical in design and functionality. The overall comparison leads to an unmitigated declaration that the Remington is an inferior product in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, both shavers feel cheap in the hand. Too light to be made of anything other than plastic materials (despite both seemingly being constructed of metal parts), the Remington actually looks as fragile as it feels. Removing the foils from both, the Panasonic cutter system appears sturdy and well-built, where the Remington reveals a cheap-looking spring that reminds one of the spring in a push-button pen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, who cares about all that in regards to a shaver? It&#x27;s how it shaves and feels on the face. Fortunately, the above superficial flaws of the Remington truthfully portray what lies beneath- this is a terrible shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a full day&#x27;s growth on my face and decided to give each half a good once-over with each shaver. It didn&#x27;t take a measuring tape or a mirror to reveal that the Remington couldn&#x27;t touch the Panasonic. It was no where near as close a shave. But what is unforgivable is that it was more like getting a facial wax than a shave. More than once, it ruthlessly tugged at my whiskers, without making clean cuts, and gauging from the pain, managed to pull said whiskers from their sockets! I didn&#x27;t bleed but it did make my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That my friends is a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of the Remington FR -750. On a daily basis, it does a good job cleaning up and keeping my face groomed. In summary, it is powerful and has a nice design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*3 Foils covers a lot of ground. It&#x27;s not perfect, but will get most of your stub and hair on the first few times. Move back and forth 2-3 times and it should cover most of your hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The shaving head is flexed. It also has an option to make it stationary. I prefer the flexed option because it&#x27;s more comfortable and enjoyable shaving experience. It&#x27;s just nice to have the shaving head move with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Nice design. I was surprised on how well built it is. It has rubber grips on the sides and a nice glossy shiny finish on the front. There is an on button and a battery indicator with a green LED light. It just looks like a quality shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean. Remove the head and rinse. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Long battery life. I&#x27;m still on the first charge. I&#x27;ve been through at least thirty 2 minute sessions and battery is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington FR -750 is certainly a good option. I&#x27;m very pleased with how it has simplified my grooming needs and made it an enjoyable (cut-free) experience. Great for a daily electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Back in high school, I tried a few (admittedly cheap) electric razors. Because of their poor quality, I didn&#x27;t pick up another electric razor until this one, 15 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! They&#x27;ve come a lot way. This one gives me a close shave, recharges well, and is easy to use. I expected to use it occasionally but rely on traditional razors for a regular use, but it&#x27;s the opposite now. I&#x27;m really impressed by this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different electric shavers and this one isn&#x27;t bad.  Like all that I&#x27;ve used it isn&#x27;t as close as even the cheapest disposable blade, but it&#x27;s a lot more convenient and works best when you use it daily instead of trying to tackle several days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is still the Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 which is very quiet and gives a good shave when used daily.  I&#x27;m not sure how well the \\&quot;intercept trimmer\\&quot; on the Remington worked to catch the longer hairs (usually what&#x27;s been missed on previous shaves) but the foils felt rougher than the round heads.  The Remington is also louder than my Norelco but the trimmer works *much* better.  I found it harder to get a smooth shave along my jawline, but my teenage son preferred it to the Norelco.  I thought the pivoting head was a little annoying, but it has a lock to hold it firmly in place.  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and the &#x27;blades&#x27; can be rinsed in water.  It charges very quickly and holds it almost as long as my Norelco.  Also, the handle is comfortable but I accidentally turned it off mid-shave several times because of the position of the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my son really likes it (4 stars from him) but I went back to my Norelco (3 stars from me).</li>
            <li> THE SCREEN FALLS OUT, AND ONE OF THE CUTTERS FELL OUT.  IT&#x27;S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A CLEAN SHAVE ON JAW BONE AREA, AND EVEN WORSE UNDER THE CHIN AND NECK.  ALSO, THE FACE IS NOT AS CLOSE AS IT WAS WITH MY OLDER MODEL.  I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.  I HOPE REMINGTON WILL CONTACT ME ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE, AND TRY SOMETHING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of electronic shavers over the years and I really wanted this one to work. I&#x27;ve had a few that work fine if you use them everyday, but can&#x27;t cut my facial hair if I leave it more than a couple of days. I was hoping this one, with its three foils and pivoting flat surface would be able to cut my stubble. It works okay, but I find that even when I use it on very short hair I have to run it over my cheeks and neck several times in both directions to do a decent job - and I still have to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; with a disposable razor if I want a clean shave. My search for a satisfactory electronic shaver is still on - this doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of electric razors. but I thought I would give this one a try. Maybe my doubt came from the fact that I&#x27;d never tried a razor like the Remington Pivot and Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Shaver. I&#x27;m now a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is great and really works all across your face. I&#x27;ve struggled in the past with razor&#x27;s that don&#x27;t fully get all the stubble off but that was not the case with this one at all. The trimmer is a great feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how the razor reaches all the hard to get areas along your face. I&#x27;ve always struggled with the area below my ears, which is responsible for most of the times I&#x27;ve cut myself shaving. Now with this razor, that&#x27;s a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many different features on this razor that show that it&#x27;s the real deal. There are add ons that I didn&#x27;t even know existed. Remington really revolutionizes the shaving process and turns it into something that&#x27;s even kind of enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you&#x27;ll save money on razors in the long run. It is a really impressive product.</li>
            <li> I love this new shaver. Shaves good and feels good in my hand.  This is my 5th Remington shaver over the 50 + years and the best yet. The only draw back is battery time.  Have to charge it more often.  That&#x27;s the reason for the 4 stares.</li>
            <li> Have been using Remington Electric Razors for years. This is best one yet.  Good looks,  high  quality build &amp;  excellent shave plus extra set of blades &amp; foil...... What is not to like. Plus,  as always speedy Amazon service. Highly recommend both Remington &amp; Amazon.</li>
            <li> The razor has a sleek design and shaves short whiskers well. It is difficult to shave long whiskers and fuzz on the neck with the redesigned trimmer-like I could with my F5790. So, I returned this razor and bought replacement blades and screens for my F5790. I plan to use the F5790 until the motor dies or Remington comes out with a new one that has the trimmer flush with the heads.</li>
            <li> Every new remington that they put out is more cheaply made than the last. The FR-750 feels like a toy shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It literally tore hairs out of my neck instead of cutting them. I slowed the movement of the razer to give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe I had gone to fast. Nope, slow or fast it refused to shave my neck and tore hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;  Nothing remington can touch the Braun  nor Panasonic. I have a Braun 9595 and Ive tried panasonics and I own a remington F5790 which is better than this FR-750 and far worse than the Braun and even the panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;  Remington needs to make one good product and stop putting out new junk every 6 months.</li>
            <li> This has been a great razor! Much gentler on my face than my last one, and a fairly close shave without applying pressure. The batteries never last as long as they are advertised, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver off and on for several months, to shave both my face (daily) and my head (1-2 times weekly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side of things:  It does a solid job of cutting whiskers, the floating / swivel head is a big plus, and it is pretty easy to clean out after each use.  It also charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the downsides, it is loud and uncomfortable to use.  The vibration on this shaver is really just too much, and whether I am shaving my face or my head with it, every time it passes over bone (jawbone, cheekbone, etc), it rattles my skull.  This is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a decent shaver, but there are far better ones out there on the market right now.</li>
            <li> so far, everything is OK</li>
            <li> Fantastic close, quick shave.  Charges fast.  I have thick whisker.  I shave in the car on my way to work and get two shaves out of each charge, but this will vary with beard type and closeness you desire.  No chaffing on my tender skin.  Remington really does shave you close as a blade.  If it is your first time, give your skin a couple weeks to adjust.  I could not believe how well this Remington works and now I do not have the bloody red chaffed skin from blade shaving.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see at least one other reviewer state that she always tried out men&#x27;s electric razors on her legs first.  I thought I was the only one to do that!  This razor failed miserably at shaving my legs (which, by the way, are not super hairy) It left patches of hair and it was impossible for me to get a close shave.  I then passed this off to my husband, to see what he thought of the razor.  My husband has coarse facial hair that grows at about an average rate.  He first tried to shave three day stubble with the razor and it was disasterous.  The razor pulled at his hair, and would only cut in patches.  Not good at all.  After that fiasco, he finished shaving with his disposable razor, and tried again in two days.  The razor did better this time; it did not pull his hair, but he did have to make several passes over his face in order to get all of the hair shaved. Even with all of that passing and repassing, the shave was no where as close as a razor shave, and by that evening it looked like he hadn&#x27;t shaved at all. What saves this razor from a one star review is the trimmer (which works well on moustaches/goatees) and the light that indicates how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave.  Causes razor burn on occasion.  Wish it cut faster.  Charge does not fit what description claims.  I can only get two shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now, and it really is a good razor for $80. If you aren&#x27;t used to electric, it takes some time for your skin to adjust to the daily shaved. It doesn&#x27;t do near as good of a job as the blades, but it works great when you are traveling or somewhere you can&#x27;t lather up, it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in my car, and it has become my favorite shaver. The pivot head is kind of useless. The charge time and indicator are useful. It does pull on some hairs that are 1/4&amp;#34; or longer, so be careful if you wait a few days between shaves. But I get a smooth face, and no razor burn... and I usually shave in the car. I have already recommended this to friends.</li>
            <li> My dear husband is pleased with this shaver,  although he still uses a razor blade when he wants a really close shave,  which is seldom!  He hates to shave,  but finds this produces an acceptable appearance now that he must shave his coarse white stubble daily.&lt;br /&gt;He recommends it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this but I guess I&#x27;m just one of those guys with tough facial hair that nothing but a very sharp razor will cut through.&lt;br /&gt;As someone else mentioned even brand new after shaving with this I was left with noticeable patches all over, especially the jawline and neck areas.&lt;br /&gt;I had to go back and try several times and it must&#x27;ve took a good 15 minutes or more trying to get it to shave what takes a regular razor black no more than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a star for looking very good while shaving though.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s looks very high tech and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable cord and bag are also nice additions.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, unless you have very soft facial hair it&#x27;s going to spend more time in the nice bag it come with than being used.</li>
            <li> Now I will admit upfront, I have a weird beard. It grows in very fine and lies down flat at first. This makes it very difficult to shave off at first, especially without cutting myself. Unfortunately my favorite Braun razor is no longer being made and it is getting harder and harder to get replacement cutters for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to this razor, it charges fast and holds that charge very well. But does not shave off my new beard growth at all. And even when I let it grow out over the weekend, it still did not get all of it. I should not have to shave twice, once with this razor and once with a blade. I think the problem is with the foil. On my Braun, there are multiple foils and the \\&quot;Super Close\\&quot; one works great. If this razor had alternate foils, I think it would work so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have \\&quot;basic\\&quot; facial hair, this razor might work for you. But if you have had problems with finding that \\&quot;just right\\&quot; razor, this one is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> Work good on tough medium thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this for my father-in-laws birthday really likes to way it Shaves close to his face</li>
            <li> This razor has been perfect for me.  I have a patchy kind of beard (thick in some places and thin in others) and this razor does very well.  I also have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m prone to irritation, but with a little help from some talc, this razor has given me no irritation.  Closeness is pretty good - plenty close for me.  Battery life is great, and this thing is extremely easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and so far so great.</li>
            <li> I picked this up during a \\&quot;lightening deal\\&quot; over Christmas time.  I&#x27;m not impressed; and if I had paid full price I&#x27;d be downright irate.  I&#x27;ll run the shaver over an area of my face three times and still have whiskers when I&#x27;m through... and I mean whiskers, not nubs, and that&#x27;s on the flat part of my face, too.  It does an even worse job around the chin &amp; neck areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of fair play, I do have to say, however, that I have yet to find an electric shaver that does anything more than just warm my face.  If I want a decent shave I have to use blades, and that&#x27;s just the way it is.  So realistically speaking, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much when I bought this shaver; but to leave entire patches of whiskers in its wake???  That&#x27;s a new low for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the shaver has a high-RPM motor and seems to hold a charge better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  The pivoting head is nice (albeit bulky) and the shaver&#x27;s ergonomics/handling are better than most.  In spite of leaving patches, the shaver does cut long whiskers rather well, and the pop-out trimmer is pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the main unit, the travel case included in the package is cheap.  It uses draw strings for closure rather than a zipper, and the unusually shaped A/C charger makes it kind of difficult to fit everything in there comfortably.  Everything does fit, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want an electric shaver to stick in your briefcase/toolbox/desk for \\&quot;quickie\\&quot; jobs on the run, this model is okay.  If you&#x27;re looking for a primary shaver that&#x27;ll give you a close shave, move on and keep looking.</li>
            <li> Remington Shaver is excellent and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just average.  Disappointed overall compared to the 3 screen shaver from Remington that this replaced.  Three stars is pushing it on the rating.  everything is good with it except the closeness of the shave is marginal.</li>
            <li> As close a shave as any razor I&#x27;ve owned, and comfortable;  it also does a good job on even the &#x27;tough places.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> Bought for my father. He loves it! Says it shaves closer than any other shaver he has had.</li>
            <li> Slickest design Remington shaver I have ever purchased with much improved trimmer.</li>
            <li> I tried an expensive Norelco shaver but kept using my old Remington shaver afterwards, so I decided to go back to Remington with a new shaver and am very pleased with its performance.</li>
