            <li> Its highly fragrant so buyer beware if you don&#x27;t like hair fragrance that will linger for a few days.</li>
            <li> Since I only use it just before touch up time one bottle go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dry per se, but it just felt like hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft afterwards instead of dry and tangled like usual.</li>
            <li> Once I put this in my hair my hair started to tangle and get rough.</li>

            <li> I know it&#x27;s not an indicator of how well it works, but after years of using sulfate shampoos it&#x27;s hard to break that</li>

            <li> I have only tried the sample version of this product because I did not want to waste any money on a lousy shampoo, needless to say this shampoo did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> WELL, no more!</li>
            <li> This has to be by far the worst shampoo I have ever used in my life.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Created a lot of tangles in my hair after i washed it out and it seemed to dry out my hair a little but not much. This shampoo didnt really do anything for my hair so i will not be purchasing it again. Its highly fragrant so buyer beware if you don&#x27;t like hair fragrance that will linger for a few days.</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I have protein sensitive, low porosity hair. In addition to that, all hair is different, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is a relatively new shampoo there weren&#x27;t many reviews on the line in general, especially the shampoo, but it contains coconut, avocado, and olive oil, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo contains NO sulfates, parabens, mineral oil, petrolatum, or alcohol. It has a really pleasant smell to it, and looks similar to/has the same consistency as the ORS Creamy Aloe shampoo. It also lathers really well. I know it&#x27;s not an indicator of how well it works, but after years of using sulfate shampoos it&#x27;s hard to break that mindset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it one time my hair felt amazing! It was very soft and moisturized. It just felt healthier. Before the this shampoo, I&#x27;d been using the Organix Argan Oil shampoo, which is also sulfate free, and my hair wasn&#x27;t soft. If anything it felt thirsty if that makes sense. It wasn&#x27;t dry per se, but it just felt like hair. Comparing it to the Orgaix Macadamia Oil shampoo, which I loved, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good. It moisturized my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love the way the shampoo smells. It made my hair soft and manageable. I recommend this as the total package with the hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Just washed my hair with this.  It&#x27;s great.  It smells good and lather good</li>
            <li> Provides great slip. Very moisturizing with a great shine. This is great for relaxed hair since it tend to be dry.</li>
            <li> I have enough products purchased over the years to open a small store,or at least keep my pals well stocked with my cast alway products that promise the world, but deliver far short. WELL, no more! I have found the product of my dreams!....Eden Hydrating line of prices are the hair care line of my dreams! I have not purchased the plant based relaxer, but the shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and serum are fabulous!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great just like the rest of the line.  I purchase the oil and the leave in conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the regular conditioner after seeing not so good reviews on it.  The shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, ever. It leaves your hair super silky!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  It left my hair nourished and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The shampoo delivered as promised. I received a sample and decided to try it out. My hair felt soft afterwards instead of dry and tangled like usual. I normally don&#x27;t get results as stated by the hair products but this time I am pleasantly pleased. Definitely buying the regular size. Also, the scent is great!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good for prolonging perm time allowing you to comb easily from root to end. Plus it smells great as others have said. Purchased mine at the women expo for a great price. Since I only use it just before touch up time one bottle go a long way.  Hair products is trail an era to fit your hair type. This is a keeper pls don&#x27;t change this formula!</li>
            <li> This has to be by far the worst shampoo I have ever used in my life. I usually don&#x27;t throw products in the garbage but this crap was horrible. Once I put this in my hair my hair started to tangle and get rough. I tried it twice and both times it was just a nightmare and the conditioner does not help at all. I truly hate this product.</li>
            <li> This smells good but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo! I bought it because I trust the Creme of Nature line.  The shampoo promised to be hydrating and detangling.  I need both of those aspects for my relaxed curly hair because it tangles so easily and is very dry.  It did cleanse and detangle my hair well.  It was very moisturizing. My hair never felt stripped, tight, or dried out during the shampoo or afterward. It felt very soothing to my itchy dry scalp.  I used the conditioning treatment that came with the shampoo in a free sample.  It gave me good slip after I towel dried my hair.  I did not have to use a detangler to comb out my towel dried hair. I only wish the shampoo controlled frizz. I air dried my relaxed curly hair. I did have some frizz, but my hair dried soft and fresh. I love the fact that this shampoo is sulfate free. I have decided to switch my shampoos to sulfate free.  I have well water in my home. I wish Creme of Nature would come up with a shampoo that works with well water and hard water.  Right now I  rotate my shampoos because of my itchy dry scalp.  This is definitely a good shampoo but, I think it would work better if it controlled frizz and was made to work with well and hard water.  If you don&#x27;t have well water or hard water I think you will like this shampoo. Curly hair does tend to frizz especially when air dried, but if you don&#x27;t have issues with frizz this would be a nice shampoo to try.</li>
            <li> Yasssssssss!!!! This shampoo gave me everything I need to continue my existence in this world. I was given life. This cleaned my hair without stripping it. I use a lot of oils in my hair, so it is a must that a shampoo be able to cleanse my scalp and hair. The hair gods answered my prayers. I did my normal two washes and rinsed this out. Once I rinsed it out, I noticed that my hair was clean, yet still soft and did not feel overly dry. I immediately fell in love. This will be a new staple of mine!!</li>
            <li> The item was received within the estimated delivery time. I used it to remove the Wen product buildup from my scalp. My hair did not show any significant changes i.e. texture or appearance.</li>
            <li> Leaves my newly natural hair soft and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I have only tried the sample version of this product because I did not want to waste any money on a lousy shampoo, needless to say this shampoo did not disappoint. The shampoo left my hair so soft, that I was shocked since this was my first sulfate free shampoo that I used. I would recommend this shampoo for anyone who wants clean hair without the dry brittle sensation.</li>
            <li> I really luv the Cream of Nature line straight from Eden. I will stock up on this product, luv the naturals oils in this product which is healthy for your hair. This shampoo makes you hair soft and silky. Would highly recommend the whole line for those that prefer straight hair over the natural look.</li>
            <li> This hydrating shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair so soft and moisturized. Not harsh in any way, very happy with this product!</li>
