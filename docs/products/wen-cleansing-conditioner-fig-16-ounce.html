            <li> Fragrance somewhat unpleasant, kind of medicinal smelling.</li>
            <li> I mostly flat iron it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 5 weeks I realized that other reviews are lead by emotion vs fact, not following directions properly, or different hair types get different results.</li>
            <li> I tried it many times and my hair felt waxy, greasy, dirty, flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Now, I find I need to alternate with other shampoos...</li>

            <li> I do not care for the slight mint smell mixed with fig.</li>
            <li> Not too much that it was making my hair worse.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other products on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird when you use it at first because it doesn&#x27;t suds up when you wash it but trust me, you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> , 4 pumps for the nap of the neck (turning upside down to do this), and 4 pumps on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I turn my head upside down and rub shampoo from my forehead to the crown.</li>
            <li> less break eg</li>
            <li> Ponytail holders are leaving less indentions in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy this Wen product.  </li>
            <li> , my scalp is so oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday</li>
            <li> It was not a product for me, Maybe for someone with thick dried out hair....</li>
            <li> and ive got really thick hair...</li>
            <li> Just like it states, it doesn&#x27;t lather, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t spread.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it exclusive from QVC but the tax and shipping and handling on it are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Fake fake fake don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong product for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> It has never been difficult to spread this non-lathering shampoo into all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> -Don&#x27;t be afraid to adjust the amount</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m finished with all aspects of the shower I turn the water to cold and rinse the shampoo out with cold water.</li>
            <li> This FIG product smells really bad &amp; I was very disappointed in it.  </li>

            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve tried...even got the613.. but love this one not really no smell to it...and no my hair didnt Fall out...less break eg and ive got really thick hair...</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. I cannot tolerate the stuff in regular shampoos that make it sudsy. I have been using this brand for about ten years. My scalp no longer itches or is rashy.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo/Conditioner, I will never use anything else.  My hair is thicker, shinier and healthier and my hairdresser can&#x27;t figure out why my hair grows out so quickly.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  The only thing I would say is you don&#x27;t need to use as much as the instructions say to.  My hair is short and I use 2-3 pumps.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo that my hair responds well to.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I tried it many times and my hair felt waxy, greasy, dirty, flat and lifeless. It was not a product for me, Maybe for someone with thick dried out hair.... Maybe. It seems to build on the hair too. Waste of money. I will stick with my Joico products.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy this Wen product.  I bought the wrong product for my hair type.  It left my hair dry &amp; extremely frizzy.  I lost $32.00 on this product &amp; cannot recommend it to anyone.  This FIG product smells really bad &amp; I was very disappointed in it.  Buy this product at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I do not care for the slight mint smell mixed with fig. I couldn&#x27;t even finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen products however they are quite expensive . Smells great my hair is soft with a lot of body.  Great product</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair in great condition  and is gentle on my color.  I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as often when using Wen. I&#x27;ve tried everything g else and went back to Wen. Nothing preforms as good.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews before buying this. What I have discovered is that you have to weed through the reviews, as is with any product review. After using this product for 5 weeks I realized that other reviews are lead by emotion vs fact, not following directions properly, or different hair types get different results. So, I will try to keep to the facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my hair...&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes just above the shoulders (medium length), naturally wavy, my scalp is so oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday my hair looks like I bathed it in mayo without rinsing, med-thick, naturally auburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I tried the pomegranate and fig, both smell amazing! I started out using the recommended 16 pumps. It was too much. Not too much that it was making my hair worse. Too much that wasn&#x27;t needed for the amount of $, so I now use 12 pumps and get great results. -Don&#x27;t be afraid to adjust the amount you use.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes more time and effort to work this shampoo in your hair vs regular shampoo. Just like it states, it doesn&#x27;t lather, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t spread. It does. I divided 12 pumps into 3 segments. 4 pumps for the front of my head, 4 pumps for the nap of the neck (turning upside down to do this), and 4 pumps on the crown of my head. It takes 2-4 minutes to rub it all over. I turn my head upside down and rub shampoo from my forehead to the crown. I hold my head upright to massage shampoo from the neck to the crown. Massage like the hair salon does, with your fingertips, not fingernails. Lastly, bring the length of your hair in and spread it through it. It has never been difficult to spread this non-lathering shampoo into all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. It sits on my hair while I do everything else.&lt;br /&gt;4. I love HOT showers, I massage the shampoo in using hot water. When I&#x27;m finished with all aspects of the shower I turn the water to cold and rinse the shampoo out with cold water. I rinse thoroughly, then spread one pump throughout for leave in. This one pump is harder to spread, so I just do the best I can on the length and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results...&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair is super soft, shiny, and brilliantly vibrant. It is so vibrant my hubby asked me, after a couple of weeks, if I had dyed my hair. My daughter commented on how shiny and vibrant it was and asked what I was doing to it (she is 18).&lt;br /&gt;2. I didn&#x27;t use any other products on it so I could see the actual results. No moose, gels, sprays, etc. I mostly flat iron it. I decided to curl it. It&#x27;s the best results I&#x27;ve ever gotten. The curl lasts all day, whereas it used to fall out quickly. Ponytail holders are leaving less indentions in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for my hair type I have had awesome results. My hair looks and feels healthy and beautiful! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Wen Cleansing Conditioner is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my hair.  The directions say to use a ton of the product, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t take that much.  I&#x27;m a runner so I wash my chin-length hair every day.  I use 2-4 pumps for the first wash, 1-2 pumps for the ends, and then 1 pump as a leave-in conditioner.  Longer hair would definitely need more.  A 16-oz bottle lasts me about 7.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> It definitely made a difference in the texture of my hair.  Great product; unlike any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  My hair stays clean and manageable for days.  Highly recommend for those with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived early. Smells good. Pump did not come with product as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and have enjoyed healthy looking and feeling hair.  Even my hair colorist commented on it.  Now, I find I need to alternate with other shampoos...sometimes clarifying because of possible buildup...which happens with most shampoos</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the product, definitely made my hair more manageable.  Fragrance somewhat unpleasant, kind of medicinal smelling.</li>
            <li> Expensive but definitively amazing results!</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple weeks.  It didn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I went back to my regular routine of shampoo and Conditioner and my hair is better now than it was using WEN.</li>
            <li> I love Wen cleansing conditioner and have been using Wen for the last 5 months.  I really like the smell of the fig cleansing conditioner.  My hair is much healthier looking since switching to Wen.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I will use it always!</li>
            <li> Fake fake fake don&#x27;t waste your time! This product does not have the by chaz Dean written on the bottle the All true products do I&#x27;m livid</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for over five years and I absolutely love it. I use the fig because it is the most moisturizing and works well for my hair type. I do the Japanese permanent  straightening treatment twice a year,  a double process color treatment , and I heat style my hair , which would be a recipe for disaster without Wen. My hair is so silky smooth and shiny that you would never know that I put my hair through all of that torture. Even my hairdresser is amazed at the condition of my hair and by the fact that I&#x27;m not bald. LOL I give Wen all of the credit. I&#x27;m not particularly crazy about the fragrance of the fig conditioner but who cares when the results are nothing short of a miracle. It&#x27;s weird when you use it at first because it doesn&#x27;t suds up when you wash it but trust me, you will get used to it. Its not available in too many places. I used to buy it exclusive from QVC but the tax and shipping and handling on it are ridiculous. Amazon has the best prices and there is no shipping and handling. So, you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this &amp;#34;fig&amp;#34; fragrance actually has a  menthol/mint smell to it and leaves your scalp feeling medicated and &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;. The overwhelming smell of the menthol almost completely masks any fig smell.  I was too embarrassed to have my hair smell like that before going out on a date and had to rewash with something pleasant and feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I expected it to come with a pump but it just came with the straw portion - there was no pump part.</li>
