            <li>I had to keep taking the blades apart and re-adjusting  them to get cleaner lines and still didn&#x27;t get as good a cut as the t-edger.</li>

            <li>It is a good size, quality product, fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is nice size, easy to handle and trims very good.</li>
            <li>It does a very good and clean edging and trimming job.</li>

            <li>I already own a pair of detailers and I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My Favorite trimmer!</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li>So, I decided to go with a corded trimmer and am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love how close the shave is!  </li>
            <li>My favorite trimmers!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE HOW THEY CUT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on the hand; easy to hold, control, and maintain.</li>
            <li>Just the perfect tool for a good new look</li>
            <li>2 day shipping awesome.. light and cuts easy</li>
            <li>The Wahl delivers a very nice cut that is easy to control.</li>
            <li>Very handy, easy to use, weighs almost nothing.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing detailer, I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I just shaved with it and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This works amazing and shaves so close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;T-blade is nice touch, can get into nose/ear openings</li>
            <li>I own the Andis T outliner and skyliner which will be sitting on the shelf now.</li>
            <li>it creates incredibly nice edges, without any burn or scratches on my head.</li>
            <li>Hence, I can end up with some inconveniently-long growth on my face, beyond what my shaver can effectively remove.  </li>
            <li>I thought this might be nice for side burns, necklines and beards.</li>
            <li>Everyone talked about the great reviews and how much better it is but its ok.</li>
            <li>I really liked this clipper.  </li>
            <li>Got a nice shape up to my hair with ease.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has nice quality and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I liked the Clippers i would buy again</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have used Wahl hair clippers since I was a kid</li>
            <li>After adjusting the Detailers and giving them a go, I was thourougly impressed with the results and the blades stay much cooler as well.</li>
            <li>I lined my beard up nice with it</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>and I started to think who knows what kind of germs are on this trimmer</li>
            <li>I bought my Wahl Detailer over 4 years ago and I still own it to this day.</li>
            <li>The included guards are a nice bonus as well.</li>
            <li>That would be a nice improvement.</li>
            <li>Nice looking trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is simply effective at whatever you throw at it.  </li>
            <li>To be nice</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair</li>
            <li>Gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice detailer.</li>
            <li>Ive been lookiny for a nice edger that can also lower my beard.  </li>
            <li>The guards that come with this are much thicker in person and are perfect!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these trimmers to anybody who has a beard or likes to do their own line-ups.</li>
            <li>Nice product .cheap</li>
            <li>Never gets hotter than warm.</li>
            <li>Nice set of detailers</li>
            <li>NEVER EVER CUT YOUR OWN HAIR.</li>
            <li>and I liked the way it looks</li>
            <li>The design is good, and works better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>: Mikey tried it, Mikey liked it.</li>
            <li>Feel nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>My wife liked the size and ease with which the Peanut cut and trimmed my hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice shape-up clippers.</li>
            <li>but wahl came out with a great product which is this one, very light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>&quot; never did a very good job but the \\&quot;trimmers\\&quot; got pretty darn close when shaving my head.</li>
            <li>and they cut very good crisp lines.</li>
            <li>Best in the market so far!!</li>
            <li>Great compact size , not like my full size buzzer.  </li>
            <li>Great addition having all the guards available for many styles of cuts.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and gets all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>cuts closer than my Andies but quieter and very easy to grip.</li>
            <li>My favorite razor after buying many!</li>
            <li>The wahl 5 star is one of the best trimmers, it gives a crispy clean line right out the box.</li>
            <li>there is no gainsaying, the detailer is by far the best trimmer i have ever used..and believe me, it details just as the name implies!</li>
            <li>Works great and worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Trimmers for about a month now, and these are by far the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional 8081-5star Series Detailer is perfect.</li>
            <li>The 8081 is, by far, the best grooming accessory I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>These Detailers cut professionally and feel awesome in my hand.  </li>
            <li>These are by far THE Best trimmers, PERIOD.</li>
            <li>It comes with three guards that are suitable for sideburns and cleaning around your ear.  </li>
            <li>this is by far the best clipper  l have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I am a part time barber, and I was looking for something that would perform better than the equipment I currently own, that is when a friend recommended I consider Amazon as a source to shop for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the hero trimmers didn&#x27;t feel like they were the best quality as far as the feel of the clipper.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best beard and mustache trimmer I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li>Trims beard perfectly, and shaves the neck allllmost as close as an old fashioned shave with no tugging/pulling.</li>
            <li>My wife said this is the best thing period compared to my old ones.  </li>
            <li>Best I got so far...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all the cut is extremely good and smooth.</li>
            <li>Excellent shipping, arrived early.</li>
            <li>The motor on these is very powerful, they feel really good in the had</li>
            <li>This is simply the best trimmer I have ever owned, and I have owned many!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even really shave with a razor anymore because it cuts so good!</li>
            <li>FINALLY ONE THAT WORKS, WE ARE BOTH HAPPY, LOL</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for that... crisp clean lines, and it has have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>because I hot wired the motor in the garage and the motor works great.</li>
            <li>Very accurate.</li>
            <li>Use it to shave my head twice a week very smooth</li>
            <li>Clippers are very important tools.</li>
            <li>very light too.</li>
            <li>Very precise.</li>
            <li>Even so, after all that frustration, it requires a very very light touch.</li>
            <li>Very smooth for lining, NOT for shaving though.</li>
            <li>Got these trimmers, zero gapped them with the included tool, and they shave right nice!  </li>
            <li>It is very accurate and you can get a very nice and crisp corners on your edge.  </li>
            <li>Great motor that runs smooth and cool.</li>
            <li>The motor is nice and strong.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional 8081 clipper does a very good job in trimming my husband&#x27;s hair and works well.</li>
            <li>They where the best until they started making this very loud noise and not cutting!</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Perfect for lining up facial hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t need it either time, but it made me feel like I was doing SOMETHING to keep it running better.  </li>
            <li>Still quite pleased with it, two years in.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; gold lettering on the grip is mostly worn off now.  </li>
            <li>anyways i love it</li>
            <li>To my surprise \\&quot;I Love Them\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s smaller and works awesome!!!</li>
            <li>I was able to get closer with a $10 battery operated trimmer.</li>
            <li>Star Detailer\\&quot; was my next attempt at finding the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Better...</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s absolutely in love with them.  </li>
            <li>Many people are complaining about hair and rust on their units.  </li>
            <li>Item returned promptly with awesome customer service from amazon, will receive product from different seller.</li>
            <li>This one is so much better than my Wahl cordless.</li>
            <li>Works great with straight line edging.</li>
            <li>They have a power cord so you will always be able to use them no matter what type of trimming you need to do.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had more attachments.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m looking to buy a more reliable clipper</li>
            <li>and if you are looking to buy something more reliable I would suggest the and is T outliner.  </li>
            <li>This is a top of the line trimmer.</li>
            <li>After looking all over for a good quality trimmer I am happy to have finally found one.</li>
            <li>I love the size and the power.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times and I have not had one pulled hair yet.  </li>
            <li>Does not pull hairs like the Peanut and provides a more even cut.</li>
            <li>the motor has plenty of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t adjusted the blades, and it seems that these aren&#x27;t shipped with the adjustment tool anymore, but I&#x27;m sure you can still adjust it closer if you desire.</li>
            <li>It is a truly stylish device.</li>
            <li>I love this clipper.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the beige edgers.</li>
            <li>Nice and light.</li>
            <li>Five Stars (and more)</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll get better with it</li>
            <li>the more I do it.</li>
            <li>The blades are also customizable so you can move the blades up for a more up close</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more durable replacement for the store bought Wahl I had.</li>
            <li>I truly do love the 120 vac trimmer from Wahl.</li>
            <li>but I am so pleased with this product that I must.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>They have outlasted the most.</li>
            <li>Make sure to put one or to drops of the blade oil on the blade</li>
            <li>I tried them the same day and was really impressed.</li>
            <li>Anyways that&#x27;s my review of the Wahl detailer, 1 out of 5 stars, thought it would be better...</li>
            <li>which I have found to be the best trimmer at balding my head because they will bald me in one pass and give the closest shave as possible without a razor.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more I got it before the estimate</li>
            <li>cause their skin is more tender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start this review off saying I am 100% satisfied with this trimmer, it exceeds my needs.</li>
            <li>This one works much better than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the wahl trimmers</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>Settled on this Wahl and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re glad we bought it.</li>
            <li>We really have not had any issues with Amazon.com that would imply a used product, and the issues we have had were resolved immediately by Amazon&#x27;s great costumer service.  </li>
            <li>The trimmers were not positioned in the appropriate molded plastic section of the container</li>
            <li>They are better and cheaper that the Andis trimmers.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this detailer.  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li>I do recommend! :)</li>
            <li>Does a great job and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>it definitely is one of the best outliners.</li>
            <li>given the primary intent of the trimmer is for beards and goatees, it would have been nice to see some more granular length options here.  </li>
            <li>I love these trimmers.</li>
            <li>1) many people have been claiming they got used hair trimmers because there was hair in the blades.</li>
            <li>Bought this clipper on the advice of a veteran Barber, it is the best edger to me you can buy.  </li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>Wished they gave more clip sizes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re actually better than I thought</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably have this for 10 years or more.  </li>
            <li>and I love the cord plugged to wall</li>
            <li>So if you only need 1/16\\&quot; - 3/16\\&quot; guides, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>These cut great THANKS</li>
            <li>Whoever tested and packaged this product  could do a better job of removing all the test clippings.  </li>
            <li>then it would be perfect especially for the timid children that already are scared to get they hair cut.</li>
            <li>A push/click or slide button would have been a better design in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had this many years ago.</li>
            <li>It would have saved me the hassles of dealing with razors and magic shave.  </li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>but it makes more noise and doesn&#x27;t cut as close.</li>
            <li>more words</li>
            <li>but I think this will change (for the better)</li>
            <li>after I use them more.</li>
            <li>I have used many cordless and cord shavers.</li>
            <li>i seen soooo many reviews that said this does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buy more products when i need them,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work on heads as well, but...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it&#x27;s not made in China.</li>
            <li>mostly bought this item for the corded plug.</li>
            <li>Living overseas has a disadvantage of not being able to go to a barber who knows how to give an edge up.</li>
            <li>My favorite for edging and trimming needs.</li>
            <li>These look like they were better made</li>
            <li>but it takes more touches which could cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>I use this product for my beard and love it.</li>
            <li>The item is ok is not all that</li>
            <li>The quality of the machine is top notch as well.</li>
            <li>Got this as a replacement for my Andis clippers and these work much better than my Andis Clippers.  </li>
            <li>I love it, works&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even trim my grand kids hair and wife&#x27;s hair with it.  </li>
            <li>These trimmers are probably THE BEST I&#x27;ve used in my hairstyling career, I would definitely recommend it to all professionals.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it works, but it&#x27;s got a longer cord than I would ever need.</li>
            <li>Most things do.</li>
            <li>I use this to shave my head and my face if I have gone more than 4 days with out shaving my face.</li>
            <li>I love these detailers.</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love this clipper.</li>
            <li>I doubt I could have found a better unit</li>
            <li>Style liner 2 are better</li>
            <li>I think this is better than any face shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love how close they cut hair</li>
            <li>Now he is able to use this trimmer without any issues and it cuts so close to the skin</li>
            <li>This was better than my Wahl Peanut.</li>
            <li>so i am hoping that this product will do better.</li>
            <li>Excellent product was for a present and my nephew lives it</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>Much much better than the cheapie Wahl I used</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to pass it across my face too many times to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I love it, my line-up is more define.</li>
            <li>The Berret trimmer used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>Leave no hair left over BEST TRIMMERS EVER!</li>
            <li>The build quality on this one seemed a bit better</li>
            <li>Love the t-blade,  but when I was cleaning up my boyfriend&#x27;s neckline, the trimmers bit him.</li>
            <li>and it works better than my andis t-outliner</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE&lt;</li>
            <li>Good quality product at the right price.</li>
            <li>You would have to adjust it on your own which I still need to learn but other than that, it is a great product!</li>
            <li>Gives me a really close shave and trim!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited about receiving this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>If I had bought this trimmer first I would be in love with these because they feel like its a better quality clipper, but the cut is not as good as the hero.  </li>
            <li>Quality seems very good, and I&#x27;ve generally been quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>the are the best Liners/Detailers to purchase on the market last very long and dependable  can easily replace blades from sallys !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Work really nice and leave a clean line every time.</li>
            <li>the wahl makes sharper lines and it doesnt get hot like the andis not saying that the andis isnt a good product the wahl just seems better</li>
            <li>On the positive side, though, Wahl has upgraded the blade to a wider T-shape, which was a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
            <li>This is truly a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very clean cut.</li>
            <li>shaves very clean my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A VERY CLEAN HAIRCUT.&lt;br /&gt;ALTHOUGH</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to use also.</li>
            <li>it is very light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone willing to buy a good product</li>
            <li>The good thing about the 5 star is it never got hot after prolonged use and</li>
            <li>So powerful, l like it very much!!!!....</li>
            <li>Best dry shave.</li>
            <li>I use this for my face and this is the best and closest dry shave trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It is an okay trimmer with a decent motor and you are able to do good line ups with it.  </li>
            <li>I was grateful to find what I needed in this Wahl (corded, short trim lengths, good quality, good reviews, and USA made).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade is a great size and it works well so far!  </li>
            <li>Great product and shipped pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>anyway, I decided on this one due to  its great reviews and fair price.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and light but really powerful!  </li>
            <li>and they are built to last and operate flawlessly if you clean them after usage and you oil the blades before each trimming.  </li>
            <li>Very good I have two of them for the last 8 years</li>
            <li>powerful and amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is better than the cheap hair clippers you can get at CVS, WaLmart or Target.</li>
            <li>Nice peice of tool it small and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>They stay cool much longer than my T Outliers which is great.</li>
            <li>this is the most precise trimmer i have ever used.</li>
            <li>And most importantly to me</li>
            <li>If your a bald guy like me get this shaver, the rotary motor is so much better than the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I love how light they are.</li>
            <li>Love this detailed liners.</li>
            <li>An unexpected bonus: it looks great.</li>
            <li>fast ship, good price,</li>
            <li>Nice and powerful</li>
            <li>Cuts super clean lines I love it!</li>
            <li>He was excited and pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li>the fuse blew or there was a spark in it, and to return it would have costed more than the original amount because i ordered it from america</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep them clean and lubricate them with oil after each use...</li>
            <li>It does everything I need easily and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a clean cut</li>
            <li>Does everything it promised, ear hair, mustache hair, sideburns, nose hairs, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>My job requires me to stay well groomed, but because I mostly work with creatives, I don&#x27;t have to be perfectly clean shaven.</li>
            <li>and I can move and shape up easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>It is lite and handles easily.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see if in two years it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>So unless you want to blow 40 clams on a grimy, used trimmer, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I strongly advise anyone and everyone to not purchase this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Seems like there&#x27;s a weak/not strong motor.</li>
            <li>so far they clean really good and close to the skin makes for a nice clean line.</li>
            <li>Definitely be gentle with lining because they will puncture the skin, but beyond that for the price Im very satisfied with the detailers.</li>
            <li>T liner is also amazing for trimming around the ear and when lining up the hairline it makes it a easier crisp line.</li>
            <li>I became aware of this when y best friend of over 10 years who has become my personal barber was lining me up a month ago..</li>
            <li>It cuts without pulling, it is precise and it has easily interchangeable blades.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use with both hands comfortably.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>both are fine but recommend the Wahl 5 star.</li>
            <li>Just maintain the product and it will work just fine</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>It was fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Super for trimming my Goatee!</li>
            <li>Work adequately for up to 2 years, then they begin to progressively have greater difficulty holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon has top notch customer service and sent out a shipping label after hearing about this.</li>
            <li>Strong smooth motor.</li>
            <li>Price here was better than I could find at supply store and it came very fast!</li>
            <li>works great and easy to work  and is a very solid product.</li>
            <li>I spent the money on the Wahl Super trimmer thinking I would get the best and because I could have the hair tattoo attachment.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li>Best little trimmer i have used yet</li>
            <li>Its almost perfect if it was a little quiter  </li>
            <li>They were perfect for doing a little manscaping as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, a compact, powerful, and fine performing trimmer (even the cord and the switch are of better quality).</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product that continues to make me a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>very precise right out of the box.</li>
            <li>if it was a little more powerful it would be the best trimmer available.</li>
            <li>The clippers are clean, very sharp, and is excellent in giving edge ups.</li>
            <li>Accurate edge up.</li>
            <li>Its not that accurate</li>
            <li>It is great for trimming back hair.</li>
            <li>But there appears not to be any supplemental guard sets available for this model, which uses narrower-width attachments.  </li>
            <li>done.very light weight.</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for about 3 weeks, and enjoy the shave it gives me.</li>
            <li>Imagine that your head was as smooth as smooth could be because you just shaved it with a razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Seems like it could be a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>but you have to be light on the skin with it or it will cut/irritate.&lt;br /&gt;Small</li>
            <li>Does not line precisely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that I really enjoy these.</li>
            <li>works like a light saber, what ever hair you touch its gon</li>
            <li>Wahl unit is light making it easier to use and to travel with.  </li>
            <li>and they said they didn&#x27;t have any combs to fit this model.  </li>
            <li>Smooth sound also.</li>
            <li>and none of the heads would  fit securely anymore .  </li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a reason this one is cheap.</li>
            <li>I always wanted a rotary clipper for a close cut and smooth operation, but held off because of the cost.</li>
            <li>but it feels smooth.</li>
            <li>its so precise that when you cut hair it looks like you came out of the barbershop.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is fantastic</li>
            <li>After suffering through two battery powered beard trimmers I had it with cheap battery powered models and started Amazon shopping.  </li>
            <li>Great Solid</li>
            <li>Easy to clean after every shave</li>
            <li>Add up 6 x $15 for the cheap ones and I am saving money.</li>
            <li>He went to use them today and the blades were filled with hair.</li>
            <li>Extremely light...</li>
            <li>Comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li>so smooth</li>
            <li>Quite more powerful than my T outliner.</li>
            <li>Description said, this product \\&quot;Includes free blade adjustment tool\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t get hot like Andis trimmers, they stay cool the whole time you cut and cut great.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas for our son, who wanted a more powerful trimmer than the rechargeable ones.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li>and I had free shipping as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and fits comfortable in your hands</li>
            <li>More than worth the money.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, no defects and amazing quality</li>
            <li>They were great until they died 7 months later.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my son for a trimmer, says he uses them to even shave as they do such a great job.</li>
            <li>It did so quite smoothly and that attests to the safety of this model.</li>
            <li>and I can unreservedly recommend this fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li>and I believe you will enjoy it...too</li>
            <li>with these its always smooth</li>
            <li>As a bald man this beauty allows me to keep a good looking scalp nearly as close cut as shaving while avoid the barbershop.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a good bit of money buying trimmers capable of giving my lining definition and this is by far the best ive used, so i would recommend this product to anyone, because when it comes to hair, no one does it better than Wahl</li>
            <li>so far is good</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far, so good with this.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, despite a good motor and perfect size for shaping and trimming, the blade has already begun to wear out.</li>
            <li>Love them, they work great &amp; just what I expected.</li>
            <li>but truth be told my old wahl t-edger is a superior product out the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Powerful&#x3D; Cuts quickly and effectively and blades don&#x27;t get hot</li>
            <li>hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detailer stays fairly cool, is light and is so easy to use that I dropped them on the floor one day</li>
            <li>The 0 gap is phenomenal, right out of the package.</li>
            <li>Very powerful for their size too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product received quickly and in good packaged condition.&lt;br /&gt;Product was NEW and UNUSED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On to the good: the trimmers are perfect size, surprisingly quiet, very sharp, and seem to be sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is a smooth clean close cut without all the noise.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, and gives a clean, smooth cut</li>
            <li>They cut clean and precise.</li>
            <li>Perfect product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Still nice and quiet, running strong!</li>
            <li>After I recieved my clippers in the mail I opened one to just take a look, and they looked liked a Professional set of clippers!!</li>
            <li>worth a buy!</li>
            <li>other than that it was a good trimmer!</li>
            <li>, I was excited to order these in hopes of getting that laser crisp line that I love for my ceaser cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid user of andis products, I have both the Styliner II and T-Outliner and after reading many reviews on the Detailer decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>When I received this product it had been resealed in its original package.  </li>
            <li>I wish the company provided better instructions since no mention is made in the instructions they sent as to how exactly to use the preset (3) trimmer add ons.</li>
            <li>The clippers also were not in plastic , the plastic that the clippers originally came in was laying beide them in the box .....</li>
            <li>The shaver worked well, we kept it in it&#x27;s original box in our bedroom.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight but really details and lines hairlines very precisely.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good and the price was decent.  </li>
            <li>that fit this trimmer (most guides are too large).</li>
            <li>The size makes it easy to maneuver around especially when doing designs... and the motor stays cool for a good period of time.</li>
            <li>I love it , it&#x27;s light weight , quiet , and cleans up pretty good.</li>
            <li>i know they ganna be worth it due to the fact wahl been creating great clippers and trimmers since most of us was in pampers.....</li>
            <li>New is nice, like a car.  </li>
            <li>would just like to say that unlike others mine came brand new in its own box no hair clipping or finger prints.</li>
            <li>Super closer and accurate shave.</li>
            <li>The one thing I really WISH was available for it, is a more comprehensive set of guard attachments.  </li>
            <li>If there is a hint of stubble around my hair line I use a woman&#x27;s eyebrow razor (shaper or whatever you call it) to get that clean barber look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quietness - ease of use and the close clean cut it delivers...</li>
            <li>i the clean cut and line up areas.</li>
            <li>You still need to clean up your space after using them.  </li>
            <li>0 gap to the max, your gonna get a clean cut</li>
            <li>But for a bald man trying to keep a clean look</li>
            <li>Gets the job done crispy and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and does a great job, but I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days and already am searching for a quieter trimmer.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve been more than pleased.</li>
            <li>It cuts to the skin clean without having to worry about ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It can also be used to cut a bald head clean with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Can also use the blade straight to your face if you&#x27;re careful for perfect shaping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sacrifice using a cord for a cut this clean and close.</li>
            <li>Clean cuts and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>This Wahl Detailer cuts Afro hair quick and smooth.</li>
            <li>The motor is great to it has a powerful kick but has a low hum.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of effort to give a really clean cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head ever since I joined the US Army in 2005, I&#x27;ve gone through countless numbers of balding clippers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I kept them oiled and clean.</li>
            <li>I eventually ended up deciding that the Wahl Peanut trimmer would be a good bet, mainly based on the positive reviews it receives on Amazon and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>packed very cheap but works very well.</li>
            <li>I received this machine &amp; started using it right away!</li>
            <li>It has a strong motor, cuts easily, and has a wide blade which is great because i use it for my whole head.</li>
            <li>I finally bought a better trimmer and this one is great for the price (so far).</li>
            <li>Light weight and cuts precisely and came exactly as it advertise by seller.</li>
            <li>Small convenient Powerful clipper very impressive</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and quickly, with a minimum of noise and fuss.  </li>
            <li>I opened the package and found the trimmer guard off and blade full of someones trimmings.</li>
            <li>It comes with an adjustment tool so that you can get a true zero shave.</li>
            <li>I personally dislike close shaving making these a good alternative for me.</li>
            <li>The only pro is, they are good for cleaning the line on a fade</li>
            <li>I keep reading and reading but countined to see only good reviews.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>My husband has a full beard and a shaved head.</li>
            <li>I got this one and realized instantly that I was good to go.  </li>
            <li>I love them so much I ordered another pair.</li>
            <li>These trimmers work as good as the Andis T outliners in my opinion and the only set that I have found to compete with them too.</li>
            <li>my old barber uses this detailer so i decided to get one of my own....</li>
            <li>Stays cool after prolong use n evern when zero gaped the sharpness doesn&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li>This product overall is good .</li>
            <li>but I made sure I cleaned it very well before I used it .</li>
            <li>It works good but IM guessing it is a second hand item.</li>
            <li>I felt that the guides were good enough but</li>
            <li>so it feels good to hold above head while shaving.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH AND POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT ALSO.</li>
            <li>quiet, lightweight, cuts the hair good.</li>
            <li>i love the product i bought, it is working very well</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts so good, I&#x27;m simply speechless.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like to shave) and to maintain my buzzed head between trips to the barber, which this trimmer is more than capable of handling.  </li>
            <li>I really wanna love this, but at the moment I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li>Forget the negative comments these clippers are the best i have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Full power, all the time.</li>
            <li>But a good product and I did not send them back.</li>
            <li>blade guide is 1/4&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t expect to maintain a long beard with this&lt;br /&gt;Seems well built, sturdy, good fit and finish</li>
            <li>Other than that they do a great job &amp; gives that clean cut without the clippers biting...</li>
            <li>It is the right amount of sharpness, comfortable to use, doesn&#x27;t cut the boys&#x27; skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>but they fit in my hand really well and are super easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I zero gapped the blades and wow amazing how crisp and precise they are.  </li>
            <li>They get warm after 20 minutes of use but they cool off completely after 5 minutes so the trade off is worth it.    </li>
            <li>its small and cheap, but it cuts very well, does not overheat, the blades can be adjusted to zero overlap which i have done and they are excellent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a warm feeling than actually being hot.</li>
            <li>Also great for detailing my hair and my son&#x27;s hair, my son loves it to finish because it&#x27;s sharp and does not bite.</li>
            <li>i been in the game over 8 years now, and this product is good, does not get hot like the andis outliners which are great trimmers too</li>
            <li>Great liner but hella sharp</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also returned&lt;br /&gt;the andis super liner &amp;#34;the wahls smokes it&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item was from \\&quot;Quick E Shop and Fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>neck and neck with my super trimmers.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are by far the most comfortable I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Overall I was satisfied with most of my purchases</li>
            <li>I would go to the barber and pay him $13plus a generous tip only to get home and not be real happy with the fade plus hair would start to grow back in one day on the faded area.</li>
            <li>Not only do I look better which makes me feel better</li>
            <li>Powerful motor, wide blade, and precision cut make these attractive clippers a worthy addition to your grooming routine.</li>
            <li>Overall I think anyone would be pleased to have these once you adjust the blade comfortably!</li>
            <li>, that is very close and even good for sensitive skin like mine is.  </li>
            <li>As an African American with ingrown hair issues, this trimmer is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to a regular size shaver just know that this is a tad smaller but does that job superbly</li>
            <li>they dont heat up as quick as andis</li>
            <li>and I must say they have improved the model 8081 tremendously.</li>
            <li>I also got Lime Sec and that is a great complimentary sent for the summer months.</li>
            <li>this product does come with the t wide blade and has a very powerful motor that cuts really good and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wahl products in the past and had very good luck with them.  </li>
            <li>Cuts pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, heavy quality, comes with guards and USE THEM</li>
            <li>This trimmer is great for shaving your face, this is the main purpose i purchased it for, shaving hair on my face and body, and trimming and lining the back of my neck and tapering all around....</li>
            <li>My new Wahl trimmer is much, much better.  </li>
            <li>and most, if not all the products listed are typically new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Small lightweight &#x3D; Great maneuverability and less arm fatigue&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was expecting to be bigger than it was, as my previous Wahl was rather bulky, but it fits perfectly in your hand and makes using it really easy.  </li>
            <li>Told me that these are far better at keeping cool and trimming around pet&#x27;s ears etc., than anything she&#x27;s had before.  </li>
            <li>A couple notes to achieve good resultsit helps to cut your hair dry and often.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, a pretty good trimmer overall.</li>
            <li>it cause it a clean cut works very well light, powerful, and quite.</li>
            <li>and  it&#x27;ll last you many years!</li>
            <li>Next time he stopped by he looked so handsome with a 5 o&#x27;clock trimmed shadow!</li>
            <li>these delivered EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>THEY DON&#x27;T GET HOT!</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!!</li>
            <li>Brand new factory sealed box, they work great definitely going to put these to use.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Detailers make my edge ups so crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>On the strenght that I like a crisp clean cut.</li>
            <li>Great product crisp sharp lines ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold on the detailers, however if your coming from the outliners it takes a little time to get used to it, but you will definitely be happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great little clipper.</li>
            <li>Im happy with them and this will def keep me out of the barbers chair a little while longer.</li>
            <li>i even got the md blade and still cant cut close and sharp like the wahls its truly powerful!!!!</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and do my own shape ups and this clipper never gave me a hard time.</li>
            <li>The clippers are light weight and do not heat up a fast as heavier clippers.</li>
            <li>It is very high-quality and precise.</li>
            <li>Amazing, quiet motor but not lacking any power!</li>
            <li>This is a smooth, quite, and HIGH QUALITY unit!</li>
            <li>Overall an amazing trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money I saved in trips to the barbershop</li>
            <li>I basically use these clippers for shaving and keeping my outline fresh between haircuts.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful like they say.</li>
            <li>It would be handy to have them for maintenance before your next haircut.    </li>
            <li>For something that looks metal and old-school like this, I was expecting a very solid metal switch that gives a nice &amp;#34;clunk&amp;#34; when flipped.  </li>
            <li>As many barbers will tell you, this particular trimmer is recommended for use on sensitive easily bruised skin.</li>
            <li>They were either biting or just not cutting close enough to get a nice crispy line up.</li>
            <li>Do not buy, for your own sake (and personal hygiene).</li>
            <li>I use it for my own personal use at the house, but even my barber uses this and he loves it.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a different kind to use as trimmer</li>
            <li>I had an old battery powered Wahl clipper I used for many years.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it👍</li>
            <li>&quot; I like it better than my old wahl plug in</li>
            <li>Answer is, yes, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I thought it more important to  warn future buyers.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment indeed.</li>
            <li>The motor on these is powerful.  </li>
            <li>A fresh cut looks like about 1 to 2 days of stubble after a razor shave.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money in my book.</li>
            <li>This clipper is extremely powerful.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I&#x27;ve suffered with finding a shaving solution that wouldn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin flare up.</li>
            <li>so worth</li>
            <li>There must&#x27;ve been some kind of short or the motor was dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when they&#x27;re adjusted it takes a bit of practice to not get a bunch of cuts but it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite trimmer to date.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Both clippers have powerful motors.</li>
            <li>I can now safely hold it against my skin from nearly any angle and it cuts without scratching.</li>
            <li>it is worth it...</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice little detailer.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a 4 because, the motor on it is much louder than any other trimmers I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>These are very lightweight, not what I was used to and the blade knicked a client the first day, had to adjust they work fine now</li>
            <li>These are very good trimmers, they cut with precision and are quiet when in use, they make sharp clean cuts with no snagging or pulling of skin and or hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are plenty of other good clippers out there that don&#x27;t come pre-loaded with someone else&#x27;s hair, fingerprints and rust.  </li>
            <li>Other than that is good.</li>
            <li>The stuff on mine rubbed right off.</li>
            <li>I tried to zero gap them but for the life of me I could not get these to cut right.</li>
            <li>THEY WERE RIGHT.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the price was right, about $40 for a $70 product.</li>
            <li>got it right</li>
            <li>I ordered this &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; and for some reason I can&#x27;t recall right now</li>
            <li>Out of the box it wasn&#x27;t adjusted just right</li>
            <li>Just wanted to squash this used clippers with hair in them business right away.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done right out the box.</li>
            <li>Practically maintenance-free, with guards that are at the right length for what I want.</li>
            <li>This trimmer gives a close shave, is just the right size, and is built with quality workmanship.</li>
            <li>I used them right out the box... just oiled the blades and started trimming.</li>
            <li>right if you can&#x27;t set them yourself and if you don&#x27;t know anyone can set them for</li>
            <li>Used these Wahl trimmers right out of the box with no adjustment and have no doubt that I will continue to use these from here on out.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it works well.</li>
            <li>get them right the way dont think twice</li>
            <li>Been doing hair for 19 years its easy to tell when things are not brand new.</li>
            <li>Light weight, and small which is good for me.</li>
            <li>I did not get as clean a line so much</li>
            <li>My main concern is it falling on the floor since there&#x27;s no grip or ridges, just smooth surface.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best trimmers out there for everyday use shape ups and maintaining well groomed, a little maintenance and trimmer will last you 5-8 years of 4-6 times a week use, might need a change of blades once or twice but great machine for the value.</li>
            <li>Very easy to operate and switch out the different attachments.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and used it, trusting the condition was good, especially since the accessories were in new packaging.</li>
            <li>I have very large hands.</li>
            <li>Powerful and doesn&#x27;t get hot or noisy while using it.  </li>
            <li>So, after doing a little research I heard these blades were the best ones to buy to give yourself a tape up and trimming facial hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will get a little better after the breaking in period.</li>
            <li>I enjoy that I am learning a new trade and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>It feel solid, the motor is powerful and I&#x27;m glad I chose this unit.</li>
            <li>There great for cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li>I can easily do razor lines, clean up beards without the razor bumps appearing, and doing designs with such ease.</li>
            <li>Also, the trimmer has a nice weight to it, gives the impression that it really is built to last.  </li>
            <li>Super light, super quiet.</li>
            <li>It gives such a clean finish to hairlines and makes edging really easy.</li>
            <li>Received my clippers and they have worked very nice since I have owned them for the past month.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are super sharp and leave a nice crisp haircut.</li>
            <li>My previous battery operated trimmer had very cheap guards that would easily break.  </li>
            <li>I was turned off when I opened the box, do not have good feelings about this product being new, when I opened the package and the guarded wasn&#x27;t on, and no plastic protection film on the trimmer, blade was little rusty.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is light weight, easy to hold, and has a long power cord.</li>
            <li>best feature of this trimmer is how easily it goes through even tough facial hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>Shipping speed was very much on time.</li>
            <li>so be very gentle.</li>
            <li>Clipper is still running just fine, no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li>The cut razor sharp and the most important thing...</li>
            <li>The get hot very fast.</li>
            <li>But exactly 1 year after buying it bloew.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK for me, I keep my hair short anyway.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts stubble hair much better than the Andis T Outliner I had for a year even with proper cleaning and maintenance.</li>
            <li>so overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Theses are the first trimmers I have encountered that I use in all areas.  </li>
            <li>Well, after the first use, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this hair trimmer since it will last more than a year and pay for itself.</li>
            <li>I oiled the blades for first use and voila.  </li>
            <li>first order I received had accesories still in plastic bag</li>
            <li>i was in the UK when i first saw the detailer...</li>
            <li>initially, i was capitivated by the size but was more astonished by the workability....</li>
            <li>The metal on the end where the blade is reflects light from the ceiling directly onto the part of my beard</li>
            <li>I was looking for some smaller trimmer/clipers, so I would be able to get a closer and sharper trim for my beard.</li>
            <li>Fast and powerful.</li>
            <li>design stunned me when I first opened the package.</li>
            <li>Even after adjusting the blade on the andis edgers I could never get that crisp line up.</li>
            <li>I did not pay for a used trimmer and most definitely did not pay for one with hair on it.</li>
            <li>I called WAHL and they told me to send them in to their repair shop in IL and THEY FIXED THEM FOR FREE.</li>
            <li>First Made in USA.  </li>
            <li>first pair</li>
            <li>At first didnt want to get one that wasnt battery operated but dont mind the wire.  </li>
            <li>At first I attributed that to the clippers boxing around the box.</li>
            <li>I double checked to make sure I didn&#x27;t order a used product.</li>
            <li>So buyer beware, I&#x27;m sure after I ship this product back and get a refund that it&#x27;ll be shipped out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As advertised and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>First day using it and it burned out.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is exactly what you, the Everyman, want to shave with.</li>
            <li>First of all I received these in about 4 days.</li>
            <li>Spend the difference and get this the first time.</li>
            <li>As a barber I constantly look for an edge in the latest tools.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Andis trimmers for the past 8 years and they are also great and powerful clippers but in my opinion the Wahl detailers are better for me because I mainly do personal grooming and they are light weight, much smaller than the andis trimmer, so it makes it a lot easier to edge yourself up.</li>
            <li>To top it off theyre quiet and don&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>and it refuses to get HOT.</li>
            <li>There was hair in the blades, the top was starting to rust, and there were fingerprints all over the handle.  </li>
            <li>Upon opening it the clippers were used with hair still in the blade and body was pretty scratched up.</li>
            <li>Wahl chrome pro get hot, really hot.</li>
            <li>First off, I couldn&#x27;t believe the reviews that stated they thought they received a used product when purchasing this item from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Trimmer for the first time through some recommendations from some friends.</li>
            <li>I am a license barber in the state of California and have purchased and used many different clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li>I found hair on it when I first received it.</li>
            <li>My sons first statement was ,\\&quot;Dad</li>
            <li>The first time I received this item, when opened it was used already there wore hairs and scratches on it.</li>
            <li>I pulled mine out and sure enough hair in the blades (KEEP READING).</li>
            <li>pretty close to it.</li>
            <li>now today is the first time i have used them and compare to my osters (which i have 2 of)</li>
            <li>I use these mostly to trim my beard and edge the back of my head and around my ears.</li>
            <li>i was dissapointed with the clipper, as soon as i plugged it in the first time to use it</li>
            <li>My personal favorite trimmer.</li>
            <li>They did not cut crisp straght out of the box</li>
            <li>They are louder than some trimmers but its not annoying or too loud.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not this time.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I really like my Wahl 5* Detailer.  </li>
            <li>Love the 3 attachments; they&#x27;re all short, so seek elsewhere if you want to leave your hair</li>
            <li>I think these are more similar to the andis clippers I&#x27;ve had for almost 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Feels, and how well it worked on the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back give another review after some more use.</li>
            <li>I fried the first ones in Sri Lanka.</li>
            <li>You really get your money&#x27;s worth at this price.</li>
            <li>, if you are like me and just want to find a barber shop quality trimmer for your beard - nothing more nothing less, this is a fine choice.  </li>
            <li>Evidently they sold me what somebody had used.</li>
            <li>As always, Amazon support was first rate.</li>
            <li>Tried it the first night</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid Andis clipper guy</li>
            <li>Would recommend to any one looking for professional grade clippers for cheap.</li>
            <li>the cut is crisp.</li>
            <li>Lighter and more reliable than multiple Andis trimmers I have owned</li>
            <li>Using the Wahl I can get pretty close to what shaving looks like and in some parts of my face</li>
            <li>It has consistently given me a close even shave for two years now.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer provides me the ability to perform a quick and neat trim to&lt;br /&gt;correspond with the particular booking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old trimmer was a cheap battery powered one that lasted about four uses before the batteries died.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son after many different corded/cordless shavers did not do the job for him.</li>
            <li>First time in years I have seen his face.</li>
            <li>I got this trimmer as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, it does the job</li>
            <li>My husband loves to edge up with these cause they leave a crisp line as well.</li>
            <li>They come pretty close to zero gaped out of the box, might need some adjusting to get a close crisp lining.</li>
            <li>If I was looking for trimmers for the first time this would not be my first choice, but it will work.</li>
            <li>I really got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely encourage everybody to get this product, it is light weight, much better than  Andis professional trimmer.</li>
            <li>With the Andis trimmers it doesn&#x27;t get as close, you could always see the hair left over no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li>First time use with these there</li>
            <li>Heavy handed barbers may need to stay away from these, BUT they are still good to have.</li>
            <li>The Detailer does not have that, so it is pretty easy to line yourself up, but it is not as strong as other trimmers when it comes to motor speed.</li>
            <li>This will outlast 4 or 5 cheap plastic units easily; $40 well spent once is better than $15 several times.    </li>
            <li>They are very quiet, easy to hold, and are actually pretty fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the old one, but I love the new one.</li>
            <li>Very good shape up machine very powerful and sharp will recomend to any barber lookin for a small powerful machine</li>
            <li>I owned a previous pair of these and loved them so much when the motor started to die</li>
            <li>Shaves closer and even more comfortably so than the previous trimmer</li>
            <li>but so far im very happy with them and will  keep my other trimmers as back ups</li>
            <li>Nice trimmers small and unique doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the best clippers Wahl has ever made ... doesn&#x27;t get hot due to rotary motor ....</li>
            <li>Amazing, doesn&#x27;t get hot like other trimmers.</li>
            <li>As a black man having a trimmer that has the ability obtain these sharp clean lines is important for a fresh professional look and this trimmer does a great job.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, i thought it might shave a little closer, but it will do!</li>
            <li>If your going to fade or keep any length of hair for a flat top this is your unit.  </li>
            <li>I own 3 other types of trimmers</li>
            <li>This thing is smaller than you&#x27;d expect but it cuts right though my full beard like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li>Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased: Sharp, powerful, can make precise, finite edges and trim down with larger movements.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and easy on the skin and leaves a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li>He knew I had been in the market for a good set of clippers that could do the job of close fades and bald&#x27;s and that I had tried several differnt clippers that had often been returned to the store on the same day of purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet, light, and powerful.</li>
            <li>do get hot, it just takes MUCH longer (30+ minutes), and even when they are hot...</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer recently and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Australia sucks for finding things like this and if you can find them..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used an Andy&#x27;s trimmer, but they tend to get hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Overall I would definitely say these clippers are a good investment.</li>
            <li>if ordering this trimmer first thing out of the box is check the blades with a white tissue and make sure youre getting what you paid for a new trimmer!</li>
            <li>I bought this one after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you found this review of use please provide positive feedback.</li>
            <li>I used it the first time and my hairline was much sharper even before adjusting the blade to get a closer cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and compact so you can hold it in pretty much in any angle without the fear of dropping it and messing up your lines.</li>
            <li>Just switched to this and can&#x27;t believe how much closer and how much quieter this is!</li>
            <li>I loved it because it was so small and neat and did the job well.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer, small but does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good detailer but don&#x27;t last for long considering the price.</li>
            <li>This trimmer fits very smoothly in the hand is is smaller compared to most other trimmers.</li>
            <li>They cut really close right out of the box much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I had a little rust on my unit, but barely noticeable and it doesn&#x27;t impede the great trimming that the unit provides.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find additional guards that fit this--however, I&#x27;ve noticed they must be out there, because not only does my local Great Clips barber use a guard that happens to fit, but the local Petsmart uses an off-brand set that fit this exact</li>
            <li>Easy on the hand, quiet as ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, precise and has a long cord for ease of use.  </li>
            <li>I was not ordering a used item, and the item description certainly doesn&#x27;t say so.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this trimmer to a friend.  </li>
            <li>the blades clean after each use and add a drop of oil to the blades while running - adds 25 seconds to the shaving routine, but keeps this thing sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have owned several sets of clippers over the past 15 years and these are by far the best from a cut standpoint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted I bought it for longevity and right now it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
            <li>I received a brand New item, no fingerprints, and these things cut like butter right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Cuts sharp lines and everything else, it does not get hot when using for more than 30 minutes</li>
            <li>The bare blade cuts clean to the skin, then the lowest guide does not cut close to the level of stubble.  </li>
            <li>It is so powerful and sharp that it is easy to go a bit overboard, trimming more than originally planned.  </li>
            <li>not* make any guide combs larger than this that will fit this trimmer, and as far as I&#x27;m aware there are no guide combs available from other manufacturers that will fit this detailer.</li>
            <li>Small and light, runs very cool.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp very professional</li>
            <li>As always, clean and oil before and after each use and it will treat you right for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for a few weeks, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Wahl wouldn&#x27;t invest in a few extra pieces of plastic to keep their customers happy.</li>
            <li>I really wish Amazon let you distinguish feedback on the order fulfillment vs the product itself.</li>
            <li>The trimmers were not packaged very well to begin with</li>
            <li>Very close cut.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it cuts the hair real close to the skin( after adjusting the blade)</li>
            <li>be gentle...</li>
            <li>and i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>Also, feels very sturdy and appears well</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000H7O5M0 Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer]]    </li>
            <li>I noticed the \\&quot;Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>They trim very close.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>looked much thinner and shinier, so I could see where that could be a reasonable misconception.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor shaves very close but it will probably &#x27;nick&#x27; you.  </li>
            <li>I then decided to give my face a try and must admit, the results were better than expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Makes grooming much easier.</li>
            <li>I love this clipper just wish I would have know they were going to send me the wide blade</li>
            <li>As much hype around these &amp; the peanuts</li>
            <li>I have these Detailers up for sale now for just $30 because I despise them so much.</li>
            <li>(really bald fading)</li>
            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>The Clippers work well, but none of the included red guides actually fit the product</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer to maintain my beard and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really a case included anymore either.</li>
            <li>It worked well straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the whole purpose tho.  </li>
            <li>I was back to smooth skin in about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>So really all I can say is that it appears to be well-built.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>You really feel the difference as compared to one of the rechargeable razors.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think anything would really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like these trimmers</li>
            <li>The do cut close and really dig them and u would to.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional gives you that fresh fade look.</li>
            <li>This is absolute S</li>
            <li>The trimmer works really well and doesn&#x27;t pinch, but I work in a barber shop and it&#x27;s the noisiest trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>TO STRUGGLE AND GO OVER THE HAIRS TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I was really serprised</li>
            <li>straight out the box</li>
            <li>Have had mine for a year, very durable use it every day in my shop.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to someone that doesn&#x27;t mind noisy trimmers but cut very well.</li>
            <li>It hits really close.</li>
            <li>Thanks you</li>
            <li>In the case involving the Wahl Clippers, I have Been very displeased.......</li>
            <li>I received the box, I should have know then that something was unusual because it was not fully  sealed ....</li>
            <li>However these when adjusted close either cut or really irritated my skin</li>
            <li>I really like these trimmers.</li>
            <li>quite cut!&lt;br /&gt;Loved them so much would defitnetly recommend its lile using a pencil</li>
            <li>The whole length of the power cord got frayed and burnt.</li>
            <li>Thanks alot -_- for ruining my trust with you guys.</li>
            <li>they really work well and trim close.</li>
            <li>they shve very close,</li>
            <li>Work very well to trim &amp; shape as desired.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good.i really like it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I can maneuver really well with these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>This trimmer only has 3 beard guides, and there aren&#x27;t any additional available anywhere online.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Work very well.  </li>
            <li>still need to use the straight edge to get the sharpest line and closest shave</li>
            <li>Very durable and well constructed.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t even switch on the moment I opened it straight from the box.</li>
            <li>A real one and a real Pro on his business AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li>It is in the price range of your remingtons and norelcos except it is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why its going to sound different.</li>
            <li>price and fast deliver</li>
            <li>even after all that this trimmer cutt my hair better then i expected.</li>
            <li>This costs too much to be a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>is very</li>
            <li>He hero trimmer had the best, cleanest cut I&#x27;ve seen on a trimmer in my 10 years of cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>The hero has a fast motor which seems to give it a cleaner cut on one touch.  </li>
            <li>It cuts your skin to much.</li>
            <li>If you have several years of experience and a light touch, I think you should try this trimmer as this blade is a HITTER out the box.</li>
            <li>thanks to Amazon rushing the shipping at no additional charge...</li>
            <li>It is compact and extremely fast...</li>
            <li>Well worth the money so far.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>it actually feels like a smooth shave without the acne afterwards.</li>
            <li>I like how light they are and the noise reduction that it has especially when linking up around the ear.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>(you know how much is on the line there).</li>
            <li>Ive been cutting hair for 14 years and these are again the best.</li>
            <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really feel this was used or returned or something.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the ideal length for me would be somewhere in between, ie.</li>
            <li>The T blade makes detail work around the ears much easier.</li>
            <li>Cuts very close to scalp.  </li>
            <li>Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor</li>
            <li>Precision lines, very close cut, and come with 3 clip on guards for fading.</li>
            <li>If you want it real close</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nice to have a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t go dead while trimming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will do the same with whatever old haircutter you have if you buy this one or the TOL</li>
            <li>My older trimmers seemed noisy and bulky in comparison to these streamline clippers that are incredibly quiet and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>it reportedly does or doesn&#x27;t and whether it is liked or disliked comments</li>
            <li>After trimming down to a 1.5 length and noticing the smoothest, most consistent 1.5 I had EVER seen, I removed the guard from the trimmer and sharpened up my neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light and sharp.</li>
            <li>They are small in size but they have a powerful rotary motor that makes trimming painless, quick and precise.  </li>
            <li>Engine is very powerful and quiet and cut to perfection.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and can cut my entire head with them.</li>
            <li>Fresh out the box, light weight, strong motor, and the new T Extra Wide blade slams the competition...</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s small, light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The cord was not wrapped as I see new items wrapped when you first receive them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and sharp and gets the job done... satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It is small and perfect for maneuvering in tight spots.  </li>
            <li>It stays sharp after many uses.</li>
            <li>If you are a novice, I would recommend another trimmer, probably an Andis Outliner II since the blade is a lot more manageable while zero-gapped, while still giving you a sharp line.</li>
            <li>your familiar with Oster clippers this blade gets the equivalent as low as a 00000 blade which is lowest</li>
            <li>i was edging my hairline, and i didnt feel like it left a clean edge as the Detailers do.</li>
            <li>I used to take a razor to my head(OUCH).The shave was to clean for a fade plus sometimes it would leave razor marks on my head and my regular clippers would not fade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, long story short, this unit is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m NOT a professional hair dresser,just started to hair my own hair recently.</li>
            <li>The optional guard sets available for standard clippers are too large (wide) for this one, and won&#x27;t fit it.</li>
            <li>Very precise and sharp!</li>
            <li>Good for keeping the facial hair trimmed and neat, also if I don&#x27;t want to take the hair on my head all the way down to the skin.  </li>
            <li>After using the earlier model for quite some time and getting it wet many, many times, it finally went &#x27;poof&#x27; and shorted out.</li>
            <li>I prefer the regular 5 star blade specially for the designs</li>
            <li>footprint&#x3D; If it was the same weight but a little larger, hand fitment would be ideal.</li>
            <li>The powerful motor and wide trimmer makes shaving quick and painless.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d recommend this trimmers to any who is seeking a sharp light weight easy to handle pair of trimmers</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for simple buzz cuts or clean razor shaves.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s more expensive but, in this case, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m not sure what kind of plastic storage box this thing once came with</li>
            <li>I have had Wahl Clippers in the past but they were the kind you can get at CVS for $20.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several months now and get good results when cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>First time, in my life I am satisfy with a professional trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very close and tight, in my opinion better than the others.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d be able to find some guides/combs that fit this trimmer, but I am having a very hard time finding longer guides</li>
            <li>I used my uncle&#x27;s to do a shape up lately, it was very precise with no cutting at all (to get cut with these</li>
            <li>5-star Detailer is the better trimmer, hands down.</li>
            <li>A little sharp in the beginning but with care, it really gives you a great edge.</li>
            <li>seems all the trimmers are used or returned itmes and should not be listed as new!</li>
            <li>Quiet powerful and sharp need not say more.</li>
            <li>This Wahl, with it&#x27;s rotary motor is top notch and half the price of some.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it all grows back in time!    </li>
            <li>Classic 76 cuts hair</li>
            <li>Maybe some of their more expensive stuff is better</li>
            <li>I will order another and hope this is a one time problem with this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li>I just got it and the detailer is a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>The only thing better is if they came with a personal barber!</li>
            <li>Extra points for the fact that it actually looks stylish.</li>
            <li>When turned on the motor started strong, 10 seconds later it lost a good bit of power, then another 10 seconds go by and it regains power, then loses power, going back and forth.</li>
            <li>This one has outlasted them and if it dies I will more than likely purchase another one of the same.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot 100 times to make sure the hair is all the same length, so close</li>
            <li>These trimmers are my main trimmers.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer is light, easy to manuever, powerful n sharp.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers over the Andis Superliners.  </li>
            <li>High quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have Pseudofolliculitis barbae (razor bumps).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Wahl 8081 trimmer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend buying a pair.</li>

            <li>Highly recommmended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I only shave/trim right next to a wall outlet anyways, and wanted one that always ran at full strength so that it didn&#x27;t pull.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not get even warm after 15-20 minutes, the blades are sharp, and it is quiet.</li>
            <li>Nice, sharp, my hairline is ruined in the front and I&#x27;m only 17</li>
            <li>I appreciate its precision, but wish it was a little more user-friendly.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m just a little more cautious.</li>
            <li>A must have for all up and coming and professional barbers!!</li>
            <li>the Waldorf is where I had the clippers delivered .......being in NYC I could have very easily had gone out to purchase them , but my time would not allow me to do that, so tht is why I spent the extra money, $20 which was the overnite rush fee , to have them delivered to me .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Easily controlled, adjustable and sharp.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had this one perhaps three weeks, and it serves my needs very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much lighter than my old trimmer</li>
            <li>I tried the Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper before these which got me close to being bald but didn&#x27;t really bald my head like these clippers would.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work really well</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very well constructed, it feels natural in the hand</li>
            <li>Small light weight and powerful</li>
            <li>Great long (and thick) power cord.</li>
            <li>The barber uses a straight razor which leaves the edge on my beard and side burns extra crisp.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s probably worth buying.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solidly built, powerful, and not overly noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just thought they were normal size.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts as low as it can get, it&#x27;s shave-like.</li>
            <li>It is about 2/3s the length of a normal trimmer.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s just small enough to where you can get some really good shaping in without any hassle.</li>
            <li>True enough every barber will tell you the Andis T-Outliners are number one but since the Detailers have come the Andis hasnt seen much action.</li>
            <li>if you use one with low power it could pull at your hair and cause pain, i dont have to worry about any of that with this, just plug it in and it has full power consistently and shaves close enough to my liking gets rid of the hairs with no tug or Pull!</li>
            <li>Worth the extra 20 bucks for a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; item</li>
            <li>I was able to use them on a few people</li>
            <li>Solid build quality and runs strong, but it either has dull/overly sharp blades or doesn&#x27;t trim right.</li>
            <li>Me and my clients both recommend this trimmer to any barbers new or old!!</li>
            <li>I love these, this is what I had been looking for thanks to not wanting to commit to the initial purchase of detalilers I ended up with some other useful items such as; Andis zero gapper and promate blades for my t-outliner</li>
            <li>so that I had to use a razor blade to clean up the loose hairs.</li>
            <li>it did get me slightly nauseous, but what made me return the machine was when I got a nice big cut</li>
            <li>Clippers are small and lightweight, but easy to hold and do not get hot like the Andis T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a trimmer strong enough in order to avoid the jamming of the blades, I have try several brands already with no satisfaction until now.</li>
            <li>Every couple months I put a drop of the supplied oil onto the blades (still have half the original bottle left) and twice now I have pulled the blades off to inspect the slides and clean out any hair inside.  </li>
            <li>Trimmers arrived in time... cut nice and sharp, but you have to b careful and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure because you will scar yourself.</li>
            <li>very powerful ... small and easy to use especially for kids ....</li>
            <li>The rotary motor doesnt do much for me other than it stays cool.</li>
            <li>I use the Trimmer to go short, and to edge up the cut, giving it a nice tight line around all edges.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased these trimmers after owning an older model of Wahl Detail Trimmers and I have to agree with all of the positive reviews that this particular model has received.  </li>
            <li>the motor from the Wahl detailer sounds very cheap and the when you run your finger across the blades it feels rough, but with the Andis t outliner, you do the same</li>
            <li>I am generally far more sensitive on the back of my neck, which requires me to use 2 different trimmers--Andis Outliners II in the front area for the sharpness and Andis Styleliners on my neck for the comfort.  </li>
            <li>really like the size, small enough to fit in your hand, and large enough to fit in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They cut extremely well though, so I&#x27;m trying to over look the sound.</li>
            <li>&quot; to adjust the blade, but DID NOT even use it, they are so sharp, crisp right out the box...</li>
            <li>i even bought this because now i have to get a new 1.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still waiting for the new ones to come in...</li>
            <li>This time I thought I would try something new.     </li>
            <li>I contacted amazon once again  and was assured I would get a new replacement trimmer.</li>
            <li>This has happened since it was new.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the metal trim of the detailer was damaged with dents in it and they did not run as if new.</li>
            <li>They have been threw two deployments and still working like they are new.</li>
            <li>Product arrived with hair all over the blades (Supposedly new).</li>
            <li>They cut like new for the rest of the deployment (5 months)</li>
            <li>Decided to go with a new pair.</li>
            <li>Read some reviews about ppl getting used products but mine were brand new</li>
            <li>Im buying a new product, so I should be receiving a NEW product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This clipper arrived used even though it was sold as new.</li>
            <li>like it gave me a new line.</li>
            <li>but you can rest assure their new, mine looked like they had been used.</li>
            <li>i cant live with out it</li>
            <li>bought these clippers for my hubby, they were listed as new.</li>
            <li>live in Santiago of Chile.</li>
            <li>It came in brand new packaging  as stated.  </li>
            <li>Are the new models not adjustable?</li>
            <li>Mine looked brand new, smelled brand new ...</li>
            <li>live in europe.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl</li>
            <li>Product was used but sold as new.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and is as if it was new.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t upkeep the blade, now I need a new one after 5 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>The description says the clippers are new.  </li>
            <li>but it time for a new one</li>
            <li>So I ordered a new one</li>
            <li>PLEASE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW WAHL DETAILES!</li>
            <li>The detailers are the best trimmer that i have used it such a smooth, powerful,and sharp razor like cutting blades.</li>
            <li>They left a huge red line on my clients neck and cut them time after time.</li>
            <li>The Detailers are too wide (T-Liners) to edge clean curves.</li>
            <li>Hits well and with the wide t blade it clean corners with ease.</li>
            <li>In short--if you are fed up with the cheap, flimsy plastic products which seem to have monopolized consumer&#x27;s pool of selection for the last two generations, look no further.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot smaller than your standard hair clippers- which i had primarily to trim my beard.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to shaving.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t use a razor because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of elderly and children as clients, which have very sensitive necks.</li>
            <li>The blade adjustment tool was not included with either the first (used) trimmer sent or the second (new) one sent as the replacement.</li>
            <li>Finally I find something that really works!</li>
            <li>The tee blade is good for a crisp straight line, but it also scraped and cut customers necks and cut behind ears, had more of a difficult time with children</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with them being small</li>
            <li>Have used these professionally for years couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>He told me, \\&quot;WOW!</li>
            <li>To say am disappointed would be the world&#x27;s greatest understatement.</li>
            <li>When my last one stopped working I decided to try and find one of a higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the exact same pair.</li>
            <li>but yet is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, gets the job done right the first time.</li>
            <li>Thought about ordering a new part and fixing them myself, sending them to get fixed, or buying a new pair of trimmers.</li>
            <li>No vacuum feature means that cut hairs fall to the ground/counter top, but that vacuum feature is not essential in my mind.  </li>
            <li>The only thing about the tool is i noticed it wasnt Exactly zero overlap, so i had to push on the top blade a little harder till they were as closely accurate as possible.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t press down, lightly touch the line</li>
            <li>From day 1 this shaver has done its job in a clean sharp manner.</li>
            <li>it keeps me clean and sharp</li>
            <li>Love the specially designed attachments that reach into difficult areas like under the nose.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and accurate trimmers.</li>
            <li>To start, the reviewers are right on the money; they are super sharp right out of the box, so little adjusting was needed for my detailing.</li>
            <li>I thought it was odd when I opened the package and the guarded wasn&#x27;t on.</li>
            <li>Small lightweight cuts very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>electric cord is quite long, obviously designed for professional use (i.e., a barber chair), I like the little toggle on-off switch (easy to operate), the unit is very quiet and the cutters allow very precise trimming.  </li>
            <li>This is a sweet little trimmer that is quiet, powerful and works well with no drama or issues.  </li>
            <li>This is a very powerful, very sharp trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The clippers work fine so far, so other than that, I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes the detailing and finishing of a cut look sharp and clean!</li>
            <li>Will only use it on certain men..</li>
            <li>They are light, they don&#x27;t overheat and are very precise in cutting.  </li>
            <li>It made a little sound and it stopped working i</li>
            <li>i gave them 4 stars only because the andis t-liners offer a little bit more precision.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be for them to use a wire cord that is a little lighted gauge and more flexible.</li>
            <li>they are super sharp.</li>
            <li>I was pretty decent at lining up my beard before with a pair of Andis clippers and now since I have these I&#x27;m able to step up my game!</li>
            <li>I paid full price for a NEW device not full price for a USED device.  </li>
            <li>so I took out my screwdriver and set it to zero and the lines were instantly very sharp and clean.</li>
            <li>Again great for cutting bald too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Problem is that the many years were not kind to it, and I was frequently maintaining it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this set, but back they must go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional or anything, but these clippers have given a crisp lining every time I used them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the largest guard (size &#x27;1-1/2&#x27; as marked), for my haircuts.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting professional looking results.</li>
            <li>I have another old wahl trimmer thats still going(10 years).....</li>
            <li>Now early January, 2016.  </li>
            <li>Needed professional</li>
            <li>No lie, this is a professional grade trimmer.</li>
            <li>With the pro tool set these clippers cut like a professional pair of clippers should.  </li>
            <li>Clippers just came and all I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>cord&#x3D; make it easier to reach far outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for doing line-ups on my hair and facial hair and find it very convenient.</li>
            <li>I got to know about this machine from a professional barber who used it to trim my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to acquire one for my beard because I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My only real problem was that the blades arrived misaligned, but I adjusted it so all is well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s what a professional barber would use.  </li>
            <li>but if I keep it short I can maintain a very close cut with none of the inconvenience of shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For all young barbers , get 2 pair of  Outliner T- Blade clippers .</li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional Detailer is a wonder.  </li>
            <li>If you are a professional barber,&lt;br /&gt;you should upgrade to these.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t get razor bumps--</li>
            <li>makes  a loud noise and it pulls the hair instead  of outline the trimming.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to give these Wahl Professional a shot.</li>
            <li>If it works as well as my old unit it will outlast me...</li>
            <li>Sounds like a loud tattoo gun in someone&#x27;s ear.  </li>
            <li>Cuts hair like butter, feels solid in the hand, and seems to be very well built.</li>
            <li>This product far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an old no-name trimmer that I&#x27;d bought almost 10 years ago and has served me well.  </li>
            <li>Bought two one for me one for my son for christmas as his old one battery one was giving up.</li>
            <li>After one week of professional use, the blade has started grabbing some customers&#x27; hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was early</li>
            <li>Very quiet and shaved very well...  </li>
            <li>My barber recommended this to me (he uses one all day long) when I complained that the cheap beard/mustache groomers were pretty much junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even called Wahl factory direct and they told me that they don&#x27;t make any additional guides for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The 3/16\\&quot; cuts too deep and shows too much skin, and the 1/16\\&quot; guide might as well not exist because it just leaves a bit of stubble.</li>
            <li>The middle guide doesn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li>Wahl Professional 8081</li>
            <li>but aint nobody got time for straight edge daily.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is quiet.</li>
            <li>So far I give them four stars</li>
            <li>Truly professional quality.</li>
            <li>but I like the reliability and professional power of this unit.</li>
            <li>never had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>it really is whisper quiet.</li>
            <li>So far i have not had any problems.</li>
            <li>This machine works well so far.</li>
            <li>I only bought this because the Andis trimmers heat up way too fast and break my power outlets.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want a loud t-liners all in your customers ear.</li>
            <li>Gives a close professional cut.</li>
            <li>I have a wahl professional for my dogs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this set by far tops the competition.</li>
            <li>Loud by default.</li>
            <li>I bought this as an early Christmas gift to my husband since he always wanted one.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it last for more than a few dozen uses.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4-star review is that I wish it had a few more guides.</li>
            <li>Powerful, yet quiet enough.</li>
            <li>I like the compact design and the fact that it does a good job cutting a straight edge.</li>
            <li>I praise these to the utmost for being able to trim my incredibly thick beard.</li>
            <li>Very light and small, does not get hot after 10 minutes of use like other products.</li>
            <li>I just received the clippers today and did not get to enjoy them because they had hair on them and looked used i have put in my return and a replacement if the new ones come in the same i will be returning for the full refund not happy at the moment.</li>
            <li>Sharp... nice little trimmer for the price. .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wished I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to purchase an upgrade; it took half the time it used to take with my old trimmers for an even better result.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a bit stiff when short, then you want to make sure you watch out for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other trimmers (i hear) get too hot after 5-7minutes of use so, these have them beat!    </li>
            <li>Andis unit trimms a little closer than the Wahl but is significantly heavier and a bit unwieldy.  </li>
            <li>These Wahl&#x27;s make sharp straight lines!!  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and true.  </li>
            <li>I found out the hard way as i did my own moustache last week for the first time and notice that a day later i cut too deep</li>
            <li>The trimmer is small and easy to maneuver when giving yourself a lineup.</li>
            <li>However, you get very short combs and don&#x27;t expect the other Wahl combs to fit.  </li>
            <li>trimmer is small and compact, so it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace a cheap rechargeable 1.5 year trimmer that seems to be designed to be trashed as the battery never lasts and is not easily changed.    </li>
            <li>You can completely forget taking it with you anywhere, since once unplugged and in a suitcase for a few hours you have to plug it back in for 2 or more days to get the blades to BARELY move again.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazingly sharp &amp; powerful.</li>
            <li>I hope they are penalized for selling used personal hygiene products as new!</li>
            <li>well I received third replacement order and again same issue ( dings and hair on blades) to comfirm this I took a white tissue papaer and wiped the blade with it and sure enough tiny hairs on blades.</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 different trimmers the Classic 76 with a 0A 1.2mm blade, the Andis T-outliner, and this model.  </li>
            <li>only complaint I have is my fault for getting the &#x27;wide head&#x27; detailer - I wish the head was smaller to get more detailed areas.</li>
            <li>My first lasted probably 2 years or so, and my last only made it about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white guy using this mainly for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>Cool little detailer.</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to get clean edges and to not cut someone.</li>
            <li>Its sharp right out of the box</li>
            <li>And I had to adjust the blades of it because it&#x27;s so sharp right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better at handling it, but it will leave your next red all over for a couple of days if you aren&#x27;t extra careful.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to any hairy male</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone, and will buy another one in the event that my current on wears out.</li>
            <li>It is not only light in weight, but it also provides a very sharply defined cut as well.</li>
            <li>EASY TO HANDLE AND GIVES PRECISE CUTTING AND SHAPING.  </li>
            <li>its also small and light weight i have some wahl senior&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Then one day after being in use for about 2 mins I heard a small \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound come from them</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting a nob to stop it from making that lowed buzzing sound trimmers usually make.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clippers came on time and it was exactly what I expected besides its not 0 gap.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are worth the money, I just wish they would change the listing to reflect the actual included accessories so future buyers aren&#x27;t misled.</li>
            <li>When I bought my first one it did not come with a wide blade even though it still cut into skin</li>
            <li>Not what i expected the replacement item to be as the first product i received didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this detailer for a few months, both for true &#x27;detailing&#x27; and as a hair clipper.  </li>
            <li>I expected this trimmer to edge a little better.</li>
            <li>when they were brand new i actually cut my boyfriend&#x27;s forehead while doing the line up  </li>
            <li>If it breaks I can actually just swap it out for a new one.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my edge up looking new and I have received multiple compliments from it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to pass off the product as &#x27;new&#x27; at least clean the damn thing.</li>
            <li>They are great for line ups and cutting hair short .</li>
            <li>I dont really know much about trimmers, but I have been going to barbers and never see them having trouble doing a line up, but as I may not be doing it correctly</li>
            <li>I am carefully considering the possibility of a legal action.</li>
            <li>Its pretty small but is built very well.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed by the Peanut, which I thought was supposed to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>Sorry my spelling sucks lol!     Ray</li>
            <li>nothing wrong with it at all good purchase overall.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin and coarse hair</li>
            <li>but after I adjusted the blade and zero gapped them they cut crisp and sharp.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li>Not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>Blade is adjusted to its sharpest point but when I cut hair with it its not sharp.</li>
            <li>As it has sharp blades and it does not get hot in your hands.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a busy person who&#x27;s overcommitted in your professional and personal life to the point where looming tasks begin to accumulate mass and take on dark amorphous shapes that rob you of peaceful sleep and ride you like a circus donkey in your waking hours, don&#x27;t purchase this item from NORTHEAST BEAUTY...</li>
            <li>Does the job and gives me a clean line up with little to no razor bumps with proper care and technique.</li>
            <li>It had been so long since I had a decent shave at home</li>
            <li>you need a little powerful detailer, then go for it.</li>
            <li>I like Wahl products but this item is too small to cut hair nicely, especially the fine hair of my 90 y/o father.</li>
            <li>I mean it works fine but was just upset to the fact it was used before .</li>
            <li>All good just  have to be careful tightening the screws on the outside too hard or it&#x27;ll crack the plastic part of the back of the clipper when adjusting it back together</li>
            <li>really well, to be expected when new&lt;</li>
            <li>The Wahl pro Detailers are made to give professional results and stand years of daily abuse.  </li>
            <li>1.2mm is not close enough to give the nearly shaved look I</li>
            <li>the way, I&#x27;ve owned 3 different models of professional grade andis clippers.</li>
            <li>The *only* thing negative about this product is that I wish it came with a greater range of attachments than only the 0.5, 1, and 1.5 cm ones which are included.</li>
            <li>i would totally recommend this clipper to anyone whether a professional or just like me saving money on hair cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though this product set my wife and I off guard, it does appear to functionally work (though we only plugged it in thus far).  </li>
            <li>Then I plug in the trimmer to the outlet and that very second I do , the trimmer explodes making a loud pop noise.</li>
            <li>and I spent probably a 1/2 an hour trying to get it straight.  </li>
            <li>I wanted some professional T-liners that would last because the others always broke on me within a year.</li>
            <li>Eventually it barely operates even when plugged in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 different andis trimmers and this by far blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li>Once adjusted this baby will zip hair off in one slow smooth pass, with or without the attachments for adjusting length.</li>
            <li>Now I can give myself that fresh faded look everyday.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good quality item, but I wanted a clipper for hair &amp; beard cutting.  </li>
            <li>so therefore it&#x27;s just there now, haven&#x27;t been able to use it or anything, and it&#x27;s still broken.</li>
            <li>Seems to be built alot better then the lower end versions that I&#x27;ve bought and broken over the years.</li>
            <li>Takes a little tinkering to get the blade set right ( which wasn&#x27;t even close out of the box).</li>
            <li>Its very light so you dont get tired as fast as other trimmers.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to hold and control but yet very powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall it doesn&#x27;t get hot, the cord is long enough and the blades are sharp, and it feels very durable.</li>
            <li>Sorry for Wahl that Beauty Fulfillment is selling their clippers as new, but won&#x27;t even take the time to be sure that all the hair is removed from the blades.</li>
            <li>The clippers are solid, they cut hair well, the only drawback is that they where used and sold as new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This trimmer sounds less powerful, but don&#x27;t let the fairly low noise level fool you.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, once I used this one the very first time, my old Remington haircutter (which was only one year old and already falling apart) went immediately into the trash can.  </li>
            <li>I use it to line up one of my son&#x27;s hair and shave my other son&#x27;s whole head.</li>
            <li>The detils I can produce with these sharp clippers really make the designs I create pop even before I color the design.</li>
            <li>It is quite sharp so be reasonable and don&#x27;t rush the task.</li>
            <li>Second, manufacturers intentionally put rechargeable batteries of average quality in cordless trimmers so that after a short while they will start losing charge fast and you will buy a new unit out of frustration.    </li>
            <li>I was greatful for the free shipping, but took 2 and half weeks to get to Jersey!!!</li>
            <li>From other reviews, apparently I&#x27;m not the only one; maybe ALL of these are used and some are just cleaned better, or looked at less closely by the recipient.     </li>
            <li>but i noticed trimmer seemd to have the issue above seemed to be in used condition and small hairs on blades also two small dings on top chrome cover I contacted Amazon and explained the issue they sent me a replacement with same issue (hairs on blades and small dings on top chrome plate)</li>
            <li>The clipper wasn&#x27;t sealed very well to begin with (not in plastic shell, just open in a closed box).</li>
            <li>But if im going to be honest, when these die on my ill probably go back to my t-outliner.</li>
            <li>is just hella low its good for designs and cutting the front hair line</li>
            <li>Not a shave but more like 1-2 days of stubble left behind.  </li>
            <li>Pay a little extra money for the right tool.</li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t want to read the ramblings of an English major) --</li>
            <li>This trimmer, however i can use daily, quickly and with very little irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li>I mean that hair is getting sliced edge ups look clean, but you have to set them</li>
            <li>these are great and you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>The common beard trimmers are too big for precise trimming and the motor is not powerful enough to make trimming fast and painless.  </li>
            <li>one thing I did knock this down for was that the switch feels very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Really let down in Amazon on this one.</li>
            <li>this from USA + a step down converter works out much</li>
            <li>I ordered these trimmers earlier this year, used them for a bit when I first got them but realized that the blade was a little off on one side</li>
            <li>Having had the trouble free experience of owning the previous version of this trimmer for approximately 7 years before it &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;, the decision to purchase this newer version was a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;One notable difference between the 2 is the absence of a blade adjustment tool from the box.</li>
            <li>I had been looking at several models but chose this one because I wanted it for the same reason as my old clipper set, simply to trim my beard and line out the back of my hair line.  </li>
            <li>They cut very close and are very sharp.</li>
            <li>Very sharp straight out the box.</li>
            <li>i got it with the new t wide blade and let me tell u</li>
            <li>I use these to trim my facial hair as close as possible using no guides or guards, just the bare clippers.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is small, powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li>The item listed as new, but once I received the Clippers they were clearly used due to the amount of hair still in the blades!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to travel with me and the guards are the right sizes for trimming the beard.</li>
            <li>I started having doubts and decided to look at it closer under a light to confirm my fears made from those previous reviewers I ignored, and I indeed found little flakes of facial hair all around the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the previous review prior to mine</li>
            <li>The big benefit with this razor is it&#x27;s constant high power due to the fact that it&#x27;s not battery powered.</li>
            <li>Good for trimming but is limited if you are cutting your entire beard.</li>
            <li>It is better than the picture- its a little hard to see in the pictures.</li>
            <li>these really get the job done with little effort whatsoever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the product made me ask Lhhilfo the new business due to failure.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>The switch was already in the switch-on position (not common for a cutting product, and really caught us off guard when we plugged it in for the first time),&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>

            <li> The best part about these clippers is I have been able to use them to do hair art which is great for business.</li>

            <li> Good seller to do business.</li>
            <li> My Brother told me he needed some really good clippers</li>
            <li> With these and the Wahl Balding Clipping, I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> Good bye razor irritation and bumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good clipper like everybody else says.</li>

            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head and we purchased this shaver because we had had good luck with Wahl products before.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep taking the blades apart and re-adjusting  them to get cleaner lines and still didn&#x27;t get as good a cut as the t-edger.</li>
            <li> good</li>

            <li> To her suprise, this Wahl Pro 8081 was a good replacement for the Peanut.  </li>

            <li> Bought the wahl detailer trimmer after so many great reviews (YouTube)</li>
            <li> This item was better than I thought and it gives a great cut.  </li>
            <li> Great product, better than the andis t outliner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am very pleased with these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Works great for my beard and my bushy eyebrows :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I like the product and it works great than most of the machines I have used</li>
            <li> It is a good size, quality product, fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice size, easy to handle and trims very good.</li>
            <li> It does a very good and clean edging and trimming job.</li>
            <li> again nothing impressive, the trimmers cut, have good power, light weight, easy to handle and maneuver in your hand.</li>
            <li> The price is outstanding!</li>
            <li> It trims so close, I love it!</li>
            <li> I already own a pair of detailers and I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My Favorite trimmer!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> So, I decided to go with a corded trimmer and am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love how close the shave is!  </li>
            <li> My favorite trimmers!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> BUT I LOVE HOW THEY CUT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on the hand; easy to hold, control, and maintain.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect tool for a good new look</li>
            <li> 2 day shipping awesome.. light and cuts easy</li>
            <li> The Wahl delivers a very nice cut that is easy to control.</li>
            <li> Very handy, easy to use, weighs almost nothing.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing detailer, I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I just shaved with it and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This works amazing and shaves so close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;T-blade is nice touch, can get into nose/ear openings</li>
            <li> I own the Andis T outliner and skyliner which will be sitting on the shelf now.</li>
            <li> it creates incredibly nice edges, without any burn or scratches on my head.</li>
            <li> Hence, I can end up with some inconveniently-long growth on my face, beyond what my shaver can effectively remove.  </li>
            <li> I thought this might be nice for side burns, necklines and beards.</li>
            <li> Everyone talked about the great reviews and how much better it is but its ok.</li>
            <li> I really liked this clipper.  </li>
            <li> Got a nice shape up to my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has nice quality and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I liked the Clippers i would buy again</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have used Wahl hair clippers since I was a kid</li>
            <li> After adjusting the Detailers and giving them a go, I was thourougly impressed with the results and the blades stay much cooler as well.</li>
            <li> I lined my beard up nice with it</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> and I started to think who knows what kind of germs are on this trimmer</li>
            <li> I bought my Wahl Detailer over 4 years ago and I still own it to this day.</li>
            <li> The included guards are a nice bonus as well.</li>
            <li> That would be a nice improvement.</li>
            <li> Nice looking trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is simply effective at whatever you throw at it.  </li>
            <li> To be nice</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair</li>
            <li> Gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice detailer.</li>
            <li> Ive been lookiny for a nice edger that can also lower my beard.  </li>
            <li> The guards that come with this are much thicker in person and are perfect!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these trimmers to anybody who has a beard or likes to do their own line-ups.</li>
            <li> Nice product .cheap</li>
            <li> Never gets hotter than warm.</li>
            <li> Nice set of detailers</li>
            <li> NEVER EVER CUT YOUR OWN HAIR.</li>
            <li> and I liked the way it looks</li>
            <li> The design is good, and works better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> : Mikey tried it, Mikey liked it.</li>
            <li> Feel nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> My wife liked the size and ease with which the Peanut cut and trimmed my hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice shape-up clippers.</li>
            <li> but wahl came out with a great product which is this one, very light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> &quot; never did a very good job but the \\&quot;trimmers\\&quot; got pretty darn close when shaving my head.</li>
            <li> and they cut very good crisp lines.</li>
            <li> Best in the market so far!!</li>
            <li> Great compact size , not like my full size buzzer.  </li>
            <li> Great addition having all the guards available for many styles of cuts.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and gets all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> cuts closer than my Andies but quieter and very easy to grip.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor after buying many!</li>
            <li> The wahl 5 star is one of the best trimmers, it gives a crispy clean line right out the box.</li>
            <li> there is no gainsaying, the detailer is by far the best trimmer i have ever used..and believe me, it details just as the name implies!</li>
            <li> Works great and worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Trimmers for about a month now, and these are by far the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8081-5star Series Detailer is perfect.</li>
            <li> The 8081 is, by far, the best grooming accessory I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> These Detailers cut professionally and feel awesome in my hand.  </li>
            <li> These are by far THE Best trimmers, PERIOD.</li>
            <li> It comes with three guards that are suitable for sideburns and cleaning around your ear.  </li>
            <li> this is by far the best clipper  l have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I am a part time barber, and I was looking for something that would perform better than the equipment I currently own, that is when a friend recommended I consider Amazon as a source to shop for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the hero trimmers didn&#x27;t feel like they were the best quality as far as the feel of the clipper.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best beard and mustache trimmer I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> Trims beard perfectly, and shaves the neck allllmost as close as an old fashioned shave with no tugging/pulling.</li>
            <li> My wife said this is the best thing period compared to my old ones.  </li>
            <li> Best I got so far...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all the cut is extremely good and smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping, arrived early.</li>
            <li> The motor on these is very powerful, they feel really good in the had</li>
            <li> This is simply the best trimmer I have ever owned, and I have owned many!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even really shave with a razor anymore because it cuts so good!</li>
            <li> FINALLY ONE THAT WORKS, WE ARE BOTH HAPPY, LOL</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for that... crisp clean lines, and it has have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> because I hot wired the motor in the garage and the motor works great.</li>
            <li> Very accurate.</li>
            <li> Use it to shave my head twice a week very smooth</li>
            <li> Clippers are very important tools.</li>
            <li> very light too.</li>
            <li> Very precise.</li>
            <li> Even so, after all that frustration, it requires a very very light touch.</li>
            <li> Very smooth for lining, NOT for shaving though.</li>
            <li> Got these trimmers, zero gapped them with the included tool, and they shave right nice!  </li>
            <li> It is very accurate and you can get a very nice and crisp corners on your edge.  </li>
            <li> Great motor that runs smooth and cool.</li>
            <li> The motor is nice and strong.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8081 clipper does a very good job in trimming my husband&#x27;s hair and works well.</li>
            <li> They where the best until they started making this very loud noise and not cutting!</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Perfect for lining up facial hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need it either time, but it made me feel like I was doing SOMETHING to keep it running better.  </li>
            <li> Still quite pleased with it, two years in.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; gold lettering on the grip is mostly worn off now.  </li>
            <li> anyways i love it</li>
            <li> To my surprise \\&quot;I Love Them\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s smaller and works awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I was able to get closer with a $10 battery operated trimmer.</li>
            <li> Star Detailer\\&quot; was my next attempt at finding the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Better...</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s absolutely in love with them.  </li>
            <li> Many people are complaining about hair and rust on their units.  </li>
            <li> Item returned promptly with awesome customer service from amazon, will receive product from different seller.</li>
            <li> This one is so much better than my Wahl cordless.</li>
            <li> Works great with straight line edging.</li>
            <li> They have a power cord so you will always be able to use them no matter what type of trimming you need to do.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had more attachments.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m looking to buy a more reliable clipper</li>
            <li> and if you are looking to buy something more reliable I would suggest the and is T outliner.  </li>
            <li> This is a top of the line trimmer.</li>
            <li> After looking all over for a good quality trimmer I am happy to have finally found one.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the power.</li>
            <li> I have used this many times and I have not had one pulled hair yet.  </li>
            <li> Does not pull hairs like the Peanut and provides a more even cut.</li>
            <li> the motor has plenty of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t adjusted the blades, and it seems that these aren&#x27;t shipped with the adjustment tool anymore, but I&#x27;m sure you can still adjust it closer if you desire.</li>
            <li> It is a truly stylish device.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper.  </li>
            <li> Way better than the beige edgers.</li>
            <li> Nice and light.</li>
            <li> Five Stars (and more)</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll get better with it</li>
            <li> the more I do it.</li>
            <li> The blades are also customizable so you can move the blades up for a more up close</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more durable replacement for the store bought Wahl I had.</li>
            <li> I truly do love the 120 vac trimmer from Wahl.</li>
            <li> but I am so pleased with this product that I must.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> They have outlasted the most.</li>
            <li> Make sure to put one or to drops of the blade oil on the blade</li>
            <li> I tried them the same day and was really impressed.</li>
            <li> Anyways that&#x27;s my review of the Wahl detailer, 1 out of 5 stars, thought it would be better...</li>
            <li> which I have found to be the best trimmer at balding my head because they will bald me in one pass and give the closest shave as possible without a razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more I got it before the estimate</li>
            <li> cause their skin is more tender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this review off saying I am 100% satisfied with this trimmer, it exceeds my needs.</li>
            <li> This one works much better than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the wahl trimmers</li>
            <li> i love it...</li>
            <li> Settled on this Wahl and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re glad we bought it.</li>
            <li> We really have not had any issues with Amazon.com that would imply a used product, and the issues we have had were resolved immediately by Amazon&#x27;s great costumer service.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers were not positioned in the appropriate molded plastic section of the container</li>
            <li> They are better and cheaper that the Andis trimmers.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this detailer.  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> I do recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Does a great job and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> it definitely is one of the best outliners.</li>
            <li> given the primary intent of the trimmer is for beards and goatees, it would have been nice to see some more granular length options here.  </li>
            <li> I love these trimmers.</li>
            <li> 1) many people have been claiming they got used hair trimmers because there was hair in the blades.</li>
            <li> Bought this clipper on the advice of a veteran Barber, it is the best edger to me you can buy.  </li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> Wished they gave more clip sizes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually better than I thought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have this for 10 years or more.  </li>
            <li> and I love the cord plugged to wall</li>
            <li> So if you only need 1/16\\&quot; - 3/16\\&quot; guides, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> These cut great THANKS</li>
            <li> Whoever tested and packaged this product  could do a better job of removing all the test clippings.  </li>
            <li> then it would be perfect especially for the timid children that already are scared to get they hair cut.</li>
            <li> A push/click or slide button would have been a better design in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had this many years ago.</li>
            <li> It would have saved me the hassles of dealing with razors and magic shave.  </li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> but it makes more noise and doesn&#x27;t cut as close.</li>
            <li> more words</li>
            <li> but I think this will change (for the better)</li>
            <li> after I use them more.</li>
            <li> I have used many cordless and cord shavers.</li>
            <li> i seen soooo many reviews that said this does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to buy more products when i need them,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work on heads as well, but...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love the fact it&#x27;s not made in China.</li>
            <li> mostly bought this item for the corded plug.</li>
            <li> Living overseas has a disadvantage of not being able to go to a barber who knows how to give an edge up.</li>
            <li> My favorite for edging and trimming needs.</li>
            <li> These look like they were better made</li>
            <li> but it takes more touches which could cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> I use this product for my beard and love it.</li>
            <li> The item is ok is not all that</li>
            <li> The quality of the machine is top notch as well.</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement for my Andis clippers and these work much better than my Andis Clippers.  </li>
            <li> I love it, works&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even trim my grand kids hair and wife&#x27;s hair with it.  </li>
            <li> These trimmers are probably THE BEST I&#x27;ve used in my hairstyling career, I would definitely recommend it to all professionals.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it works, but it&#x27;s got a longer cord than I would ever need.</li>
            <li> Most things do.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and my face if I have gone more than 4 days with out shaving my face.</li>
            <li> I love these detailers.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely love this clipper.</li>
            <li> I doubt I could have found a better unit</li>
            <li> Style liner 2 are better</li>
            <li> I think this is better than any face shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love how close they cut hair</li>
            <li> Now he is able to use this trimmer without any issues and it cuts so close to the skin</li>
            <li> This was better than my Wahl Peanut.</li>
            <li> so i am hoping that this product will do better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product was for a present and my nephew lives it</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> Much much better than the cheapie Wahl I used</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to pass it across my face too many times to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I love it, my line-up is more define.</li>
            <li> The Berret trimmer used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Leave no hair left over BEST TRIMMERS EVER!</li>
            <li> The build quality on this one seemed a bit better</li>
            <li> Love the t-blade,  but when I was cleaning up my boyfriend&#x27;s neckline, the trimmers bit him.</li>
            <li> and it works better than my andis t-outliner</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE&lt;</li>
            <li> Good quality product at the right price.</li>
            <li> You would have to adjust it on your own which I still need to learn but other than that, it is a great product!</li>
            <li> Gives me a really close shave and trim!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about receiving this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> If I had bought this trimmer first I would be in love with these because they feel like its a better quality clipper, but the cut is not as good as the hero.  </li>
            <li> Quality seems very good, and I&#x27;ve generally been quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> the are the best Liners/Detailers to purchase on the market last very long and dependable  can easily replace blades from sallys !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Work really nice and leave a clean line every time.</li>
            <li> the wahl makes sharper lines and it doesnt get hot like the andis not saying that the andis isnt a good product the wahl just seems better</li>
            <li> On the positive side, though, Wahl has upgraded the blade to a wider T-shape, which was a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut.</li>
            <li> shaves very clean my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A VERY CLEAN HAIRCUT.&lt;br /&gt;ALTHOUGH</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to use also.</li>
            <li> it is very light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone willing to buy a good product</li>
            <li> The good thing about the 5 star is it never got hot after prolonged use and</li>
            <li> So powerful, l like it very much!!!!....</li>
            <li> Best dry shave.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face and this is the best and closest dry shave trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It is an okay trimmer with a decent motor and you are able to do good line ups with it.  </li>
            <li> I was grateful to find what I needed in this Wahl (corded, short trim lengths, good quality, good reviews, and USA made).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade is a great size and it works well so far!  </li>
            <li> Great product and shipped pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> anyway, I decided on this one due to  its great reviews and fair price.  </li>
            <li> It is nice and light but really powerful!  </li>
            <li> and they are built to last and operate flawlessly if you clean them after usage and you oil the blades before each trimming.  </li>
            <li> Very good I have two of them for the last 8 years</li>
            <li> powerful and amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is better than the cheap hair clippers you can get at CVS, WaLmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Nice peice of tool it small and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> They stay cool much longer than my T Outliers which is great.</li>
            <li> this is the most precise trimmer i have ever used.</li>
            <li> And most importantly to me</li>
            <li> If your a bald guy like me get this shaver, the rotary motor is so much better than the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I love how light they are.</li>
            <li> Love this detailed liners.</li>
            <li> An unexpected bonus: it looks great.</li>
            <li> fast ship, good price,</li>
            <li> Nice and powerful</li>
            <li> Cuts super clean lines I love it!</li>
            <li> He was excited and pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li> the fuse blew or there was a spark in it, and to return it would have costed more than the original amount because i ordered it from america</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you keep them clean and lubricate them with oil after each use...</li>
            <li> It does everything I need easily and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a clean cut</li>
            <li> Does everything it promised, ear hair, mustache hair, sideburns, nose hairs, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> My job requires me to stay well groomed, but because I mostly work with creatives, I don&#x27;t have to be perfectly clean shaven.</li>
            <li> and I can move and shape up easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> It is lite and handles easily.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see if in two years it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> So unless you want to blow 40 clams on a grimy, used trimmer, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I strongly advise anyone and everyone to not purchase this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Seems like there&#x27;s a weak/not strong motor.</li>
            <li> so far they clean really good and close to the skin makes for a nice clean line.</li>
            <li> Definitely be gentle with lining because they will puncture the skin, but beyond that for the price Im very satisfied with the detailers.</li>
            <li> T liner is also amazing for trimming around the ear and when lining up the hairline it makes it a easier crisp line.</li>
            <li> I became aware of this when y best friend of over 10 years who has become my personal barber was lining me up a month ago..</li>
            <li> It cuts without pulling, it is precise and it has easily interchangeable blades.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use with both hands comfortably.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> both are fine but recommend the Wahl 5 star.</li>
            <li> Just maintain the product and it will work just fine</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> It was fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Super for trimming my Goatee!</li>
            <li> Work adequately for up to 2 years, then they begin to progressively have greater difficulty holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon has top notch customer service and sent out a shipping label after hearing about this.</li>
            <li> Strong smooth motor.</li>
            <li> Price here was better than I could find at supply store and it came very fast!</li>
            <li> works great and easy to work  and is a very solid product.</li>
            <li> I spent the money on the Wahl Super trimmer thinking I would get the best and because I could have the hair tattoo attachment.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> Best little trimmer i have used yet</li>
            <li> Its almost perfect if it was a little quiter  </li>
            <li> They were perfect for doing a little manscaping as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, a compact, powerful, and fine performing trimmer (even the cord and the switch are of better quality).</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that continues to make me a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> very precise right out of the box.</li>
            <li> if it was a little more powerful it would be the best trimmer available.</li>
            <li> The clippers are clean, very sharp, and is excellent in giving edge ups.</li>
            <li> Accurate edge up.</li>
            <li> Its not that accurate</li>
            <li> It is great for trimming back hair.</li>
            <li> But there appears not to be any supplemental guard sets available for this model, which uses narrower-width attachments.  </li>
            <li> done.very light weight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about 3 weeks, and enjoy the shave it gives me.</li>
            <li> Imagine that your head was as smooth as smooth could be because you just shaved it with a razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Seems like it could be a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> but you have to be light on the skin with it or it will cut/irritate.&lt;br /&gt;Small</li>
            <li> Does not line precisely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that I really enjoy these.</li>
            <li> works like a light saber, what ever hair you touch its gon</li>
            <li> Wahl unit is light making it easier to use and to travel with.  </li>
            <li> and they said they didn&#x27;t have any combs to fit this model.  </li>
            <li> Smooth sound also.</li>
            <li> and none of the heads would  fit securely anymore .  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a reason this one is cheap.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a rotary clipper for a close cut and smooth operation, but held off because of the cost.</li>
            <li> but it feels smooth.</li>
            <li> its so precise that when you cut hair it looks like you came out of the barbershop.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is fantastic</li>
            <li> After suffering through two battery powered beard trimmers I had it with cheap battery powered models and started Amazon shopping.  </li>
            <li> Great Solid</li>
            <li> Easy to clean after every shave</li>
            <li> Add up 6 x $15 for the cheap ones and I am saving money.</li>
            <li> He went to use them today and the blades were filled with hair.</li>
            <li> Extremely light...</li>
            <li> Comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li> so smooth</li>
            <li> Quite more powerful than my T outliner.</li>
            <li> Description said, this product \\&quot;Includes free blade adjustment tool\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t get hot like Andis trimmers, they stay cool the whole time you cut and cut great.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas for our son, who wanted a more powerful trimmer than the rechargeable ones.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> and I had free shipping as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and fits comfortable in your hands</li>
            <li> More than worth the money.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, no defects and amazing quality</li>
            <li> They were great until they died 7 months later.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son for a trimmer, says he uses them to even shave as they do such a great job.</li>
            <li> It did so quite smoothly and that attests to the safety of this model.</li>
            <li> and I can unreservedly recommend this fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I believe you will enjoy it...too</li>
            <li> with these its always smooth</li>
            <li> As a bald man this beauty allows me to keep a good looking scalp nearly as close cut as shaving while avoid the barbershop.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a good bit of money buying trimmers capable of giving my lining definition and this is by far the best ive used, so i would recommend this product to anyone, because when it comes to hair, no one does it better than Wahl</li>
            <li> so far is good</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so far, so good with this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, despite a good motor and perfect size for shaping and trimming, the blade has already begun to wear out.</li>
            <li> Love them, they work great &amp; just what I expected.</li>
            <li> but truth be told my old wahl t-edger is a superior product out the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Powerful&#x3D; Cuts quickly and effectively and blades don&#x27;t get hot</li>
            <li> hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detailer stays fairly cool, is light and is so easy to use that I dropped them on the floor one day</li>
            <li> The 0 gap is phenomenal, right out of the package.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for their size too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product received quickly and in good packaged condition.&lt;br /&gt;Product was NEW and UNUSED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On to the good: the trimmers are perfect size, surprisingly quiet, very sharp, and seem to be sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth clean close cut without all the noise.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, and gives a clean, smooth cut</li>
            <li> They cut clean and precise.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Still nice and quiet, running strong!</li>
            <li> After I recieved my clippers in the mail I opened one to just take a look, and they looked liked a Professional set of clippers!!</li>
            <li> worth a buy!</li>
            <li> other than that it was a good trimmer!</li>
            <li> , I was excited to order these in hopes of getting that laser crisp line that I love for my ceaser cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of andis products, I have both the Styliner II and T-Outliner and after reading many reviews on the Detailer decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it had been resealed in its original package.  </li>
            <li> I wish the company provided better instructions since no mention is made in the instructions they sent as to how exactly to use the preset (3) trimmer add ons.</li>
            <li> The clippers also were not in plastic , the plastic that the clippers originally came in was laying beide them in the box .....</li>
            <li> The shaver worked well, we kept it in it&#x27;s original box in our bedroom.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight but really details and lines hairlines very precisely.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good and the price was decent.  </li>
            <li> that fit this trimmer (most guides are too large).</li>
            <li> The size makes it easy to maneuver around especially when doing designs... and the motor stays cool for a good period of time.</li>
            <li> I love it , it&#x27;s light weight , quiet , and cleans up pretty good.</li>
            <li> i know they ganna be worth it due to the fact wahl been creating great clippers and trimmers since most of us was in pampers.....</li>
            <li> New is nice, like a car.  </li>
            <li> would just like to say that unlike others mine came brand new in its own box no hair clipping or finger prints.</li>
            <li> Super closer and accurate shave.</li>
            <li> The one thing I really WISH was available for it, is a more comprehensive set of guard attachments.  </li>
            <li> If there is a hint of stubble around my hair line I use a woman&#x27;s eyebrow razor (shaper or whatever you call it) to get that clean barber look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quietness - ease of use and the close clean cut it delivers...</li>
            <li> i the clean cut and line up areas.</li>
            <li> You still need to clean up your space after using them.  </li>
            <li> 0 gap to the max, your gonna get a clean cut</li>
            <li> But for a bald man trying to keep a clean look</li>
            <li> Gets the job done crispy and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and does a great job, but I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days and already am searching for a quieter trimmer.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve been more than pleased.</li>
            <li> It cuts to the skin clean without having to worry about ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used to cut a bald head clean with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Can also use the blade straight to your face if you&#x27;re careful for perfect shaping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sacrifice using a cord for a cut this clean and close.</li>
            <li> Clean cuts and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This Wahl Detailer cuts Afro hair quick and smooth.</li>
            <li> The motor is great to it has a powerful kick but has a low hum.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of effort to give a really clean cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head ever since I joined the US Army in 2005, I&#x27;ve gone through countless numbers of balding clippers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I kept them oiled and clean.</li>
            <li> I eventually ended up deciding that the Wahl Peanut trimmer would be a good bet, mainly based on the positive reviews it receives on Amazon and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> packed very cheap but works very well.</li>
            <li> I received this machine &amp; started using it right away!</li>
            <li> It has a strong motor, cuts easily, and has a wide blade which is great because i use it for my whole head.</li>
            <li> I finally bought a better trimmer and this one is great for the price (so far).</li>
            <li> Light weight and cuts precisely and came exactly as it advertise by seller.</li>
            <li> Small convenient Powerful clipper very impressive</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly and quickly, with a minimum of noise and fuss.  </li>
            <li> I opened the package and found the trimmer guard off and blade full of someones trimmings.</li>
            <li> It comes with an adjustment tool so that you can get a true zero shave.</li>
            <li> I personally dislike close shaving making these a good alternative for me.</li>
            <li> The only pro is, they are good for cleaning the line on a fade</li>
            <li> I keep reading and reading but countined to see only good reviews.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> My husband has a full beard and a shaved head.</li>
            <li> I got this one and realized instantly that I was good to go.  </li>
            <li> I love them so much I ordered another pair.</li>
            <li> These trimmers work as good as the Andis T outliners in my opinion and the only set that I have found to compete with them too.</li>
            <li> my old barber uses this detailer so i decided to get one of my own....</li>
            <li> Stays cool after prolong use n evern when zero gaped the sharpness doesn&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li> This product overall is good .</li>
            <li> but I made sure I cleaned it very well before I used it .</li>
            <li> It works good but IM guessing it is a second hand item.</li>
            <li> I felt that the guides were good enough but</li>
            <li> so it feels good to hold above head while shaving.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH AND POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT ALSO.</li>
            <li> quiet, lightweight, cuts the hair good.</li>
            <li> i love the product i bought, it is working very well</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts so good, I&#x27;m simply speechless.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like to shave) and to maintain my buzzed head between trips to the barber, which this trimmer is more than capable of handling.  </li>
            <li> I really wanna love this, but at the moment I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Forget the negative comments these clippers are the best i have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Full power, all the time.</li>
            <li> But a good product and I did not send them back.</li>
            <li> blade guide is 1/4&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t expect to maintain a long beard with this&lt;br /&gt;Seems well built, sturdy, good fit and finish</li>
            <li> Other than that they do a great job &amp; gives that clean cut without the clippers biting...</li>
            <li> It is the right amount of sharpness, comfortable to use, doesn&#x27;t cut the boys&#x27; skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> but they fit in my hand really well and are super easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I zero gapped the blades and wow amazing how crisp and precise they are.  </li>
            <li> They get warm after 20 minutes of use but they cool off completely after 5 minutes so the trade off is worth it.    </li>
            <li> its small and cheap, but it cuts very well, does not overheat, the blades can be adjusted to zero overlap which i have done and they are excellent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a warm feeling than actually being hot.</li>
            <li> Also great for detailing my hair and my son&#x27;s hair, my son loves it to finish because it&#x27;s sharp and does not bite.</li>
            <li> i been in the game over 8 years now, and this product is good, does not get hot like the andis outliners which are great trimmers too</li>
            <li> Great liner but hella sharp</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also returned&lt;br /&gt;the andis super liner &amp;#34;the wahls smokes it&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item was from \\&quot;Quick E Shop and Fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> neck and neck with my super trimmers.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are by far the most comfortable I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Overall I was satisfied with most of my purchases</li>
            <li> I would go to the barber and pay him $13plus a generous tip only to get home and not be real happy with the fade plus hair would start to grow back in one day on the faded area.</li>
            <li> Not only do I look better which makes me feel better</li>
            <li> Powerful motor, wide blade, and precision cut make these attractive clippers a worthy addition to your grooming routine.</li>
            <li> Overall I think anyone would be pleased to have these once you adjust the blade comfortably!</li>
            <li> , that is very close and even good for sensitive skin like mine is.  </li>
            <li> As an African American with ingrown hair issues, this trimmer is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to a regular size shaver just know that this is a tad smaller but does that job superbly</li>
            <li> they dont heat up as quick as andis</li>
            <li> and I must say they have improved the model 8081 tremendously.</li>
            <li> I also got Lime Sec and that is a great complimentary sent for the summer months.</li>
            <li> this product does come with the t wide blade and has a very powerful motor that cuts really good and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl products in the past and had very good luck with them.  </li>
            <li> Cuts pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful, heavy quality, comes with guards and USE THEM</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for shaving your face, this is the main purpose i purchased it for, shaving hair on my face and body, and trimming and lining the back of my neck and tapering all around....</li>
            <li> My new Wahl trimmer is much, much better.  </li>
            <li> and most, if not all the products listed are typically new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Small lightweight &#x3D; Great maneuverability and less arm fatigue&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was expecting to be bigger than it was, as my previous Wahl was rather bulky, but it fits perfectly in your hand and makes using it really easy.  </li>
            <li> Told me that these are far better at keeping cool and trimming around pet&#x27;s ears etc., than anything she&#x27;s had before.  </li>
            <li> A couple notes to achieve good resultsit helps to cut your hair dry and often.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, a pretty good trimmer overall.</li>
            <li> it cause it a clean cut works very well light, powerful, and quite.</li>
            <li> and  it&#x27;ll last you many years!</li>
            <li> Next time he stopped by he looked so handsome with a 5 o&#x27;clock trimmed shadow!</li>
            <li> these delivered EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> THEY DON&#x27;T GET HOT!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!!</li>
            <li> Brand new factory sealed box, they work great definitely going to put these to use.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Detailers make my edge ups so crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> On the strenght that I like a crisp clean cut.</li>
            <li> Great product crisp sharp lines ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on the detailers, however if your coming from the outliners it takes a little time to get used to it, but you will definitely be happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great little clipper.</li>
            <li> Im happy with them and this will def keep me out of the barbers chair a little while longer.</li>
            <li> i even got the md blade and still cant cut close and sharp like the wahls its truly powerful!!!!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and do my own shape ups and this clipper never gave me a hard time.</li>
            <li> The clippers are light weight and do not heat up a fast as heavier clippers.</li>
            <li> It is very high-quality and precise.</li>
            <li> Amazing, quiet motor but not lacking any power!</li>
            <li> This is a smooth, quite, and HIGH QUALITY unit!</li>
            <li> Overall an amazing trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money I saved in trips to the barbershop</li>
            <li> I basically use these clippers for shaving and keeping my outline fresh between haircuts.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful like they say.</li>
            <li> It would be handy to have them for maintenance before your next haircut.    </li>
            <li> For something that looks metal and old-school like this, I was expecting a very solid metal switch that gives a nice &amp;#34;clunk&amp;#34; when flipped.  </li>
            <li> As many barbers will tell you, this particular trimmer is recommended for use on sensitive easily bruised skin.</li>
            <li> They were either biting or just not cutting close enough to get a nice crispy line up.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, for your own sake (and personal hygiene).</li>
            <li> I use it for my own personal use at the house, but even my barber uses this and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a different kind to use as trimmer</li>
            <li> I had an old battery powered Wahl clipper I used for many years.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it👍</li>
            <li> &quot; I like it better than my old wahl plug in</li>
            <li> Answer is, yes, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I thought it more important to  warn future buyers.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment indeed.</li>
            <li> The motor on these is powerful.  </li>
            <li> A fresh cut looks like about 1 to 2 days of stubble after a razor shave.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money in my book.</li>
            <li> This clipper is extremely powerful.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I&#x27;ve suffered with finding a shaving solution that wouldn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin flare up.</li>
            <li> so worth</li>
            <li> There must&#x27;ve been some kind of short or the motor was dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when they&#x27;re adjusted it takes a bit of practice to not get a bunch of cuts but it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite trimmer to date.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Both clippers have powerful motors.</li>
            <li> I can now safely hold it against my skin from nearly any angle and it cuts without scratching.</li>
            <li> it is worth it...</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice little detailer.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 4 because, the motor on it is much louder than any other trimmers I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> These are very lightweight, not what I was used to and the blade knicked a client the first day, had to adjust they work fine now</li>
            <li> These are very good trimmers, they cut with precision and are quiet when in use, they make sharp clean cuts with no snagging or pulling of skin and or hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are plenty of other good clippers out there that don&#x27;t come pre-loaded with someone else&#x27;s hair, fingerprints and rust.  </li>
            <li> Other than that is good.</li>
            <li> The stuff on mine rubbed right off.</li>
            <li> I tried to zero gap them but for the life of me I could not get these to cut right.</li>
            <li> THEY WERE RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the price was right, about $40 for a $70 product.</li>
            <li> got it right</li>
            <li> I ordered this &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; and for some reason I can&#x27;t recall right now</li>
            <li> Out of the box it wasn&#x27;t adjusted just right</li>
            <li> Just wanted to squash this used clippers with hair in them business right away.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done right out the box.</li>
            <li> Practically maintenance-free, with guards that are at the right length for what I want.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gives a close shave, is just the right size, and is built with quality workmanship.</li>
            <li> I used them right out the box... just oiled the blades and started trimming.</li>
            <li> right if you can&#x27;t set them yourself and if you don&#x27;t know anyone can set them for</li>
            <li> Used these Wahl trimmers right out of the box with no adjustment and have no doubt that I will continue to use these from here on out.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it works well.</li>
            <li> get them right the way dont think twice</li>
            <li> Been doing hair for 19 years its easy to tell when things are not brand new.</li>
            <li> Light weight, and small which is good for me.</li>
            <li> I did not get as clean a line so much</li>
            <li> My main concern is it falling on the floor since there&#x27;s no grip or ridges, just smooth surface.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers out there for everyday use shape ups and maintaining well groomed, a little maintenance and trimmer will last you 5-8 years of 4-6 times a week use, might need a change of blades once or twice but great machine for the value.</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate and switch out the different attachments.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and used it, trusting the condition was good, especially since the accessories were in new packaging.</li>
            <li> I have very large hands.</li>
            <li> Powerful and doesn&#x27;t get hot or noisy while using it.  </li>
            <li> So, after doing a little research I heard these blades were the best ones to buy to give yourself a tape up and trimming facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will get a little better after the breaking in period.</li>
            <li> I enjoy that I am learning a new trade and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> It feel solid, the motor is powerful and I&#x27;m glad I chose this unit.</li>
            <li> There great for cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> I can easily do razor lines, clean up beards without the razor bumps appearing, and doing designs with such ease.</li>
            <li> Also, the trimmer has a nice weight to it, gives the impression that it really is built to last.  </li>
            <li> Super light, super quiet.</li>
            <li> It gives such a clean finish to hairlines and makes edging really easy.</li>
            <li> Received my clippers and they have worked very nice since I have owned them for the past month.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are super sharp and leave a nice crisp haircut.</li>
            <li> My previous battery operated trimmer had very cheap guards that would easily break.  </li>
            <li> I was turned off when I opened the box, do not have good feelings about this product being new, when I opened the package and the guarded wasn&#x27;t on, and no plastic protection film on the trimmer, blade was little rusty.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is light weight, easy to hold, and has a long power cord.</li>
            <li> best feature of this trimmer is how easily it goes through even tough facial hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> Shipping speed was very much on time.</li>
            <li> so be very gentle.</li>
            <li> Clipper is still running just fine, no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li> The cut razor sharp and the most important thing...</li>
            <li> The get hot very fast.</li>
            <li> But exactly 1 year after buying it bloew.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK for me, I keep my hair short anyway.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts stubble hair much better than the Andis T Outliner I had for a year even with proper cleaning and maintenance.</li>
            <li> so overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Theses are the first trimmers I have encountered that I use in all areas.  </li>
            <li> Well, after the first use, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this hair trimmer since it will last more than a year and pay for itself.</li>
            <li> I oiled the blades for first use and voila.  </li>
            <li> first order I received had accesories still in plastic bag</li>
            <li> i was in the UK when i first saw the detailer...</li>
            <li> initially, i was capitivated by the size but was more astonished by the workability....</li>
            <li> The metal on the end where the blade is reflects light from the ceiling directly onto the part of my beard</li>
            <li> I was looking for some smaller trimmer/clipers, so I would be able to get a closer and sharper trim for my beard.</li>
            <li> Fast and powerful.</li>
            <li> design stunned me when I first opened the package.</li>
            <li> Even after adjusting the blade on the andis edgers I could never get that crisp line up.</li>
            <li> I did not pay for a used trimmer and most definitely did not pay for one with hair on it.</li>
            <li> I called WAHL and they told me to send them in to their repair shop in IL and THEY FIXED THEM FOR FREE.</li>
            <li> First Made in USA.  </li>
            <li> first pair</li>
            <li> At first didnt want to get one that wasnt battery operated but dont mind the wire.  </li>
            <li> At first I attributed that to the clippers boxing around the box.</li>
            <li> I double checked to make sure I didn&#x27;t order a used product.</li>
            <li> So buyer beware, I&#x27;m sure after I ship this product back and get a refund that it&#x27;ll be shipped out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As advertised and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First day using it and it burned out.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what you, the Everyman, want to shave with.</li>
            <li> First of all I received these in about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Spend the difference and get this the first time.</li>
            <li> As a barber I constantly look for an edge in the latest tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Andis trimmers for the past 8 years and they are also great and powerful clippers but in my opinion the Wahl detailers are better for me because I mainly do personal grooming and they are light weight, much smaller than the andis trimmer, so it makes it a lot easier to edge yourself up.</li>
            <li> To top it off theyre quiet and don&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> and it refuses to get HOT.</li>
            <li> There was hair in the blades, the top was starting to rust, and there were fingerprints all over the handle.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening it the clippers were used with hair still in the blade and body was pretty scratched up.</li>
            <li> Wahl chrome pro get hot, really hot.</li>
            <li> First off, I couldn&#x27;t believe the reviews that stated they thought they received a used product when purchasing this item from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Trimmer for the first time through some recommendations from some friends.</li>
            <li> I am a license barber in the state of California and have purchased and used many different clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> I found hair on it when I first received it.</li>
            <li> My sons first statement was ,\\&quot;Dad</li>
            <li> The first time I received this item, when opened it was used already there wore hairs and scratches on it.</li>
            <li> I pulled mine out and sure enough hair in the blades (KEEP READING).</li>
            <li> pretty close to it.</li>
            <li> now today is the first time i have used them and compare to my osters (which i have 2 of)</li>
            <li> I use these mostly to trim my beard and edge the back of my head and around my ears.</li>
            <li> i was dissapointed with the clipper, as soon as i plugged it in the first time to use it</li>
            <li> My personal favorite trimmer.</li>
            <li> They did not cut crisp straght out of the box</li>
            <li> They are louder than some trimmers but its not annoying or too loud.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not this time.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I really like my Wahl 5* Detailer.  </li>
            <li> Love the 3 attachments; they&#x27;re all short, so seek elsewhere if you want to leave your hair</li>
            <li> I think these are more similar to the andis clippers I&#x27;ve had for almost 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Feels, and how well it worked on the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back give another review after some more use.</li>
            <li> I fried the first ones in Sri Lanka.</li>
            <li> You really get your money&#x27;s worth at this price.</li>
            <li> , if you are like me and just want to find a barber shop quality trimmer for your beard - nothing more nothing less, this is a fine choice.  </li>
            <li> Evidently they sold me what somebody had used.</li>
            <li> As always, Amazon support was first rate.</li>
            <li> Tried it the first night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid Andis clipper guy</li>
            <li> Would recommend to any one looking for professional grade clippers for cheap.</li>
            <li> the cut is crisp.</li>
            <li> Lighter and more reliable than multiple Andis trimmers I have owned</li>
            <li> Using the Wahl I can get pretty close to what shaving looks like and in some parts of my face</li>
            <li> It has consistently given me a close even shave for two years now.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer provides me the ability to perform a quick and neat trim to&lt;br /&gt;correspond with the particular booking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old trimmer was a cheap battery powered one that lasted about four uses before the batteries died.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son after many different corded/cordless shavers did not do the job for him.</li>
            <li> First time in years I have seen his face.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, it does the job</li>
            <li> My husband loves to edge up with these cause they leave a crisp line as well.</li>
            <li> They come pretty close to zero gaped out of the box, might need some adjusting to get a close crisp lining.</li>
            <li> If I was looking for trimmers for the first time this would not be my first choice, but it will work.</li>
            <li> I really got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I will definitely encourage everybody to get this product, it is light weight, much better than  Andis professional trimmer.</li>
            <li> With the Andis trimmers it doesn&#x27;t get as close, you could always see the hair left over no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li> First time use with these there</li>
            <li> Heavy handed barbers may need to stay away from these, BUT they are still good to have.</li>
            <li> The Detailer does not have that, so it is pretty easy to line yourself up, but it is not as strong as other trimmers when it comes to motor speed.</li>
            <li> This will outlast 4 or 5 cheap plastic units easily; $40 well spent once is better than $15 several times.    </li>
            <li> They are very quiet, easy to hold, and are actually pretty fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the old one, but I love the new one.</li>
            <li> Very good shape up machine very powerful and sharp will recomend to any barber lookin for a small powerful machine</li>
            <li> I owned a previous pair of these and loved them so much when the motor started to die</li>
            <li> Shaves closer and even more comfortably so than the previous trimmer</li>
            <li> but so far im very happy with them and will  keep my other trimmers as back ups</li>
            <li> Nice trimmers small and unique doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best clippers Wahl has ever made ... doesn&#x27;t get hot due to rotary motor ....</li>
            <li> Amazing, doesn&#x27;t get hot like other trimmers.</li>
            <li> As a black man having a trimmer that has the ability obtain these sharp clean lines is important for a fresh professional look and this trimmer does a great job.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, i thought it might shave a little closer, but it will do!</li>
            <li> If your going to fade or keep any length of hair for a flat top this is your unit.  </li>
            <li> I own 3 other types of trimmers</li>
            <li> This thing is smaller than you&#x27;d expect but it cuts right though my full beard like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased: Sharp, powerful, can make precise, finite edges and trim down with larger movements.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and easy on the skin and leaves a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li> He knew I had been in the market for a good set of clippers that could do the job of close fades and bald&#x27;s and that I had tried several differnt clippers that had often been returned to the store on the same day of purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet, light, and powerful.</li>
            <li> do get hot, it just takes MUCH longer (30+ minutes), and even when they are hot...</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer recently and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Australia sucks for finding things like this and if you can find them..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used an Andy&#x27;s trimmer, but they tend to get hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Overall I would definitely say these clippers are a good investment.</li>
            <li> if ordering this trimmer first thing out of the box is check the blades with a white tissue and make sure youre getting what you paid for a new trimmer!</li>
            <li> I bought this one after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you found this review of use please provide positive feedback.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time and my hairline was much sharper even before adjusting the blade to get a closer cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and compact so you can hold it in pretty much in any angle without the fear of dropping it and messing up your lines.</li>
            <li> Just switched to this and can&#x27;t believe how much closer and how much quieter this is!</li>
            <li> I loved it because it was so small and neat and did the job well.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, small but does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good detailer but don&#x27;t last for long considering the price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer fits very smoothly in the hand is is smaller compared to most other trimmers.</li>
            <li> They cut really close right out of the box much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had a little rust on my unit, but barely noticeable and it doesn&#x27;t impede the great trimming that the unit provides.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find additional guards that fit this--however, I&#x27;ve noticed they must be out there, because not only does my local Great Clips barber use a guard that happens to fit, but the local Petsmart uses an off-brand set that fit this exact</li>
            <li> Easy on the hand, quiet as ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, precise and has a long cord for ease of use.  </li>
            <li> I was not ordering a used item, and the item description certainly doesn&#x27;t say so.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this trimmer to a friend.  </li>
            <li> the blades clean after each use and add a drop of oil to the blades while running - adds 25 seconds to the shaving routine, but keeps this thing sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have owned several sets of clippers over the past 15 years and these are by far the best from a cut standpoint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted I bought it for longevity and right now it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
            <li> I received a brand New item, no fingerprints, and these things cut like butter right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Cuts sharp lines and everything else, it does not get hot when using for more than 30 minutes</li>
            <li> The bare blade cuts clean to the skin, then the lowest guide does not cut close to the level of stubble.  </li>
            <li> It is so powerful and sharp that it is easy to go a bit overboard, trimming more than originally planned.  </li>
            <li> not* make any guide combs larger than this that will fit this trimmer, and as far as I&#x27;m aware there are no guide combs available from other manufacturers that will fit this detailer.</li>
            <li> Small and light, runs very cool.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp very professional</li>
            <li> As always, clean and oil before and after each use and it will treat you right for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Wahl wouldn&#x27;t invest in a few extra pieces of plastic to keep their customers happy.</li>
            <li> I really wish Amazon let you distinguish feedback on the order fulfillment vs the product itself.</li>
            <li> The trimmers were not packaged very well to begin with</li>
            <li> Very close cut.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> it cuts the hair real close to the skin( after adjusting the blade)</li>
            <li> be gentle...</li>
            <li> and i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Also, feels very sturdy and appears well</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000H7O5M0 Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer]]    </li>
            <li> I noticed the \\&quot;Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> They trim very close.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> looked much thinner and shinier, so I could see where that could be a reasonable misconception.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor shaves very close but it will probably &#x27;nick&#x27; you.  </li>
            <li> I then decided to give my face a try and must admit, the results were better than expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Makes grooming much easier.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper just wish I would have know they were going to send me the wide blade</li>
            <li> As much hype around these &amp; the peanuts</li>
            <li> I have these Detailers up for sale now for just $30 because I despise them so much.</li>
            <li> (really bald fading)</li>
            <li> Really like it</li>
            <li> The Clippers work well, but none of the included red guides actually fit the product</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to maintain my beard and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really a case included anymore either.</li>
            <li> It worked well straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the whole purpose tho.  </li>
            <li> I was back to smooth skin in about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> So really all I can say is that it appears to be well-built.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> You really feel the difference as compared to one of the rechargeable razors.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think anything would really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like these trimmers</li>
            <li> The do cut close and really dig them and u would to.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional gives you that fresh fade look.</li>
            <li> This is absolute S</li>
            <li> The trimmer works really well and doesn&#x27;t pinch, but I work in a barber shop and it&#x27;s the noisiest trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> TO STRUGGLE AND GO OVER THE HAIRS TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I was really serprised</li>
            <li> straight out the box</li>
            <li> Have had mine for a year, very durable use it every day in my shop.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to someone that doesn&#x27;t mind noisy trimmers but cut very well.</li>
            <li> It hits really close.</li>
            <li> Thanks you</li>
            <li> In the case involving the Wahl Clippers, I have Been very displeased.......</li>
            <li> I received the box, I should have know then that something was unusual because it was not fully  sealed ....</li>
            <li> However these when adjusted close either cut or really irritated my skin</li>
            <li> I really like these trimmers.</li>
            <li> quite cut!&lt;br /&gt;Loved them so much would defitnetly recommend its lile using a pencil</li>
            <li> The whole length of the power cord got frayed and burnt.</li>
            <li> Thanks alot -_- for ruining my trust with you guys.</li>
            <li> they really work well and trim close.</li>
            <li> they shve very close,</li>
            <li> Work very well to trim &amp; shape as desired.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>

            <li> I can maneuver really well with these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This trimmer only has 3 beard guides, and there aren&#x27;t any additional available anywhere online.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Work very well.  </li>
            <li> still need to use the straight edge to get the sharpest line and closest shave</li>
            <li> Very durable and well constructed.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even switch on the moment I opened it straight from the box.</li>
            <li> A real one and a real Pro on his business AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> It is in the price range of your remingtons and norelcos except it is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why its going to sound different.</li>
            <li> price and fast deliver</li>
            <li> even after all that this trimmer cutt my hair better then i expected.</li>
            <li> This costs too much to be a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> is very</li>
            <li> He hero trimmer had the best, cleanest cut I&#x27;ve seen on a trimmer in my 10 years of cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> The hero has a fast motor which seems to give it a cleaner cut on one touch.  </li>
            <li> It cuts your skin to much.</li>
            <li> If you have several years of experience and a light touch, I think you should try this trimmer as this blade is a HITTER out the box.</li>
            <li> thanks to Amazon rushing the shipping at no additional charge...</li>
            <li> It is compact and extremely fast...</li>
            <li> Well worth the money so far.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> it actually feels like a smooth shave without the acne afterwards.</li>
            <li> I like how light they are and the noise reduction that it has especially when linking up around the ear.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> (you know how much is on the line there).</li>
            <li> Ive been cutting hair for 14 years and these are again the best.</li>
            <li> really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really feel this was used or returned or something.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the ideal length for me would be somewhere in between, ie.</li>
            <li> The T blade makes detail work around the ears much easier.</li>
            <li> Cuts very close to scalp.  </li>
            <li> Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor</li>
            <li> Precision lines, very close cut, and come with 3 clip on guards for fading.</li>
            <li> If you want it real close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nice to have a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t go dead while trimming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you will do the same with whatever old haircutter you have if you buy this one or the TOL</li>
            <li> My older trimmers seemed noisy and bulky in comparison to these streamline clippers that are incredibly quiet and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> it reportedly does or doesn&#x27;t and whether it is liked or disliked comments</li>
            <li> After trimming down to a 1.5 length and noticing the smoothest, most consistent 1.5 I had EVER seen, I removed the guard from the trimmer and sharpened up my neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light and sharp.</li>
            <li> They are small in size but they have a powerful rotary motor that makes trimming painless, quick and precise.  </li>
            <li> Engine is very powerful and quiet and cut to perfection.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and can cut my entire head with them.</li>
            <li> Fresh out the box, light weight, strong motor, and the new T Extra Wide blade slams the competition...</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s small, light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The cord was not wrapped as I see new items wrapped when you first receive them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and sharp and gets the job done... satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It is small and perfect for maneuvering in tight spots.  </li>
            <li> It stays sharp after many uses.</li>
            <li> If you are a novice, I would recommend another trimmer, probably an Andis Outliner II since the blade is a lot more manageable while zero-gapped, while still giving you a sharp line.</li>
            <li> your familiar with Oster clippers this blade gets the equivalent as low as a 00000 blade which is lowest</li>
            <li> i was edging my hairline, and i didnt feel like it left a clean edge as the Detailers do.</li>
            <li> I used to take a razor to my head(OUCH).The shave was to clean for a fade plus sometimes it would leave razor marks on my head and my regular clippers would not fade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, long story short, this unit is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT a professional hair dresser,just started to hair my own hair recently.</li>
            <li> The optional guard sets available for standard clippers are too large (wide) for this one, and won&#x27;t fit it.</li>
            <li> Very precise and sharp!</li>
            <li> Good for keeping the facial hair trimmed and neat, also if I don&#x27;t want to take the hair on my head all the way down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> After using the earlier model for quite some time and getting it wet many, many times, it finally went &#x27;poof&#x27; and shorted out.</li>
            <li> I prefer the regular 5 star blade specially for the designs</li>
            <li> footprint&#x3D; If it was the same weight but a little larger, hand fitment would be ideal.</li>
            <li> The powerful motor and wide trimmer makes shaving quick and painless.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d recommend this trimmers to any who is seeking a sharp light weight easy to handle pair of trimmers</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for simple buzz cuts or clean razor shaves.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s more expensive but, in this case, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not sure what kind of plastic storage box this thing once came with</li>
            <li> I have had Wahl Clippers in the past but they were the kind you can get at CVS for $20.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several months now and get good results when cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> First time, in my life I am satisfy with a professional trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very close and tight, in my opinion better than the others.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d be able to find some guides/combs that fit this trimmer, but I am having a very hard time finding longer guides</li>
            <li> I used my uncle&#x27;s to do a shape up lately, it was very precise with no cutting at all (to get cut with these</li>
            <li> 5-star Detailer is the better trimmer, hands down.</li>
            <li> A little sharp in the beginning but with care, it really gives you a great edge.</li>
            <li> seems all the trimmers are used or returned itmes and should not be listed as new!</li>
            <li> Quiet powerful and sharp need not say more.</li>
            <li> This Wahl, with it&#x27;s rotary motor is top notch and half the price of some.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it all grows back in time!    </li>
            <li> Classic 76 cuts hair</li>
            <li> Maybe some of their more expensive stuff is better</li>
            <li> I will order another and hope this is a one time problem with this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li> I just got it and the detailer is a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only thing better is if they came with a personal barber!</li>
            <li> Extra points for the fact that it actually looks stylish.</li>
            <li> When turned on the motor started strong, 10 seconds later it lost a good bit of power, then another 10 seconds go by and it regains power, then loses power, going back and forth.</li>
            <li> This one has outlasted them and if it dies I will more than likely purchase another one of the same.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot 100 times to make sure the hair is all the same length, so close</li>
            <li> These trimmers are my main trimmers.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is light, easy to manuever, powerful n sharp.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers over the Andis Superliners.  </li>
            <li> High quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have Pseudofolliculitis barbae (razor bumps).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Wahl 8081 trimmer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend buying a pair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommmended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I only shave/trim right next to a wall outlet anyways, and wanted one that always ran at full strength so that it didn&#x27;t pull.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not get even warm after 15-20 minutes, the blades are sharp, and it is quiet.</li>
            <li> Nice, sharp, my hairline is ruined in the front and I&#x27;m only 17</li>
            <li> I appreciate its precision, but wish it was a little more user-friendly.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just a little more cautious.</li>
            <li> A must have for all up and coming and professional barbers!!</li>
            <li> the Waldorf is where I had the clippers delivered .......being in NYC I could have very easily had gone out to purchase them , but my time would not allow me to do that, so tht is why I spent the extra money, $20 which was the overnite rush fee , to have them delivered to me .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Easily controlled, adjustable and sharp.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had this one perhaps three weeks, and it serves my needs very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much lighter than my old trimmer</li>
            <li> I tried the Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper before these which got me close to being bald but didn&#x27;t really bald my head like these clippers would.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work really well</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very well constructed, it feels natural in the hand</li>
            <li> Small light weight and powerful</li>
            <li> Great long (and thick) power cord.</li>
            <li> The barber uses a straight razor which leaves the edge on my beard and side burns extra crisp.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s probably worth buying.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly built, powerful, and not overly noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just thought they were normal size.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts as low as it can get, it&#x27;s shave-like.</li>
            <li> It is about 2/3s the length of a normal trimmer.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just small enough to where you can get some really good shaping in without any hassle.</li>
            <li> True enough every barber will tell you the Andis T-Outliners are number one but since the Detailers have come the Andis hasnt seen much action.</li>
            <li> if you use one with low power it could pull at your hair and cause pain, i dont have to worry about any of that with this, just plug it in and it has full power consistently and shaves close enough to my liking gets rid of the hairs with no tug or Pull!</li>
            <li> Worth the extra 20 bucks for a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; item</li>
            <li> I was able to use them on a few people</li>
            <li> Solid build quality and runs strong, but it either has dull/overly sharp blades or doesn&#x27;t trim right.</li>
            <li> Me and my clients both recommend this trimmer to any barbers new or old!!</li>
            <li> I love these, this is what I had been looking for thanks to not wanting to commit to the initial purchase of detalilers I ended up with some other useful items such as; Andis zero gapper and promate blades for my t-outliner</li>
            <li> so that I had to use a razor blade to clean up the loose hairs.</li>
            <li> it did get me slightly nauseous, but what made me return the machine was when I got a nice big cut</li>
            <li> Clippers are small and lightweight, but easy to hold and do not get hot like the Andis T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a trimmer strong enough in order to avoid the jamming of the blades, I have try several brands already with no satisfaction until now.</li>
            <li> Every couple months I put a drop of the supplied oil onto the blades (still have half the original bottle left) and twice now I have pulled the blades off to inspect the slides and clean out any hair inside.  </li>
            <li> Trimmers arrived in time... cut nice and sharp, but you have to b careful and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure because you will scar yourself.</li>
            <li> very powerful ... small and easy to use especially for kids ....</li>
            <li> The rotary motor doesnt do much for me other than it stays cool.</li>
            <li> I use the Trimmer to go short, and to edge up the cut, giving it a nice tight line around all edges.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased these trimmers after owning an older model of Wahl Detail Trimmers and I have to agree with all of the positive reviews that this particular model has received.  </li>
            <li> the motor from the Wahl detailer sounds very cheap and the when you run your finger across the blades it feels rough, but with the Andis t outliner, you do the same</li>
            <li> I am generally far more sensitive on the back of my neck, which requires me to use 2 different trimmers--Andis Outliners II in the front area for the sharpness and Andis Styleliners on my neck for the comfort.  </li>
            <li> really like the size, small enough to fit in your hand, and large enough to fit in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They cut extremely well though, so I&#x27;m trying to over look the sound.</li>
            <li> &quot; to adjust the blade, but DID NOT even use it, they are so sharp, crisp right out the box...</li>
            <li> i even bought this because now i have to get a new 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for the new ones to come in...</li>
            <li> This time I thought I would try something new.     </li>
            <li> I contacted amazon once again  and was assured I would get a new replacement trimmer.</li>
            <li> This has happened since it was new.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the metal trim of the detailer was damaged with dents in it and they did not run as if new.</li>
            <li> They have been threw two deployments and still working like they are new.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with hair all over the blades (Supposedly new).</li>
            <li> They cut like new for the rest of the deployment (5 months)</li>
            <li> Decided to go with a new pair.</li>
            <li> Read some reviews about ppl getting used products but mine were brand new</li>
            <li> Im buying a new product, so I should be receiving a NEW product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This clipper arrived used even though it was sold as new.</li>
            <li> like it gave me a new line.</li>
            <li> but you can rest assure their new, mine looked like they had been used.</li>
            <li> i cant live with out it</li>
            <li> bought these clippers for my hubby, they were listed as new.</li>
            <li> live in Santiago of Chile.</li>
            <li> It came in brand new packaging  as stated.  </li>
            <li> Are the new models not adjustable?</li>
            <li> Mine looked brand new, smelled brand new ...</li>
            <li> live in europe.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl</li>
            <li> Product was used but sold as new.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and is as if it was new.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t upkeep the blade, now I need a new one after 5 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> The description says the clippers are new.  </li>
            <li> but it time for a new one</li>
            <li> So I ordered a new one</li>
            <li> PLEASE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW WAHL DETAILES!</li>
            <li> The detailers are the best trimmer that i have used it such a smooth, powerful,and sharp razor like cutting blades.</li>
            <li> They left a huge red line on my clients neck and cut them time after time.</li>
            <li> The Detailers are too wide (T-Liners) to edge clean curves.</li>
            <li> Hits well and with the wide t blade it clean corners with ease.</li>
            <li> In short--if you are fed up with the cheap, flimsy plastic products which seem to have monopolized consumer&#x27;s pool of selection for the last two generations, look no further.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than your standard hair clippers- which i had primarily to trim my beard.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to shaving.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t use a razor because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of elderly and children as clients, which have very sensitive necks.</li>
            <li> The blade adjustment tool was not included with either the first (used) trimmer sent or the second (new) one sent as the replacement.</li>
            <li> Finally I find something that really works!</li>
            <li> The tee blade is good for a crisp straight line, but it also scraped and cut customers necks and cut behind ears, had more of a difficult time with children</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with them being small</li>
            <li> Have used these professionally for years couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> He told me, \\&quot;WOW!</li>
            <li> To say am disappointed would be the world&#x27;s greatest understatement.</li>
            <li> When my last one stopped working I decided to try and find one of a higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are the exact same pair.</li>
            <li> but yet is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, gets the job done right the first time.</li>
            <li> Thought about ordering a new part and fixing them myself, sending them to get fixed, or buying a new pair of trimmers.</li>
            <li> No vacuum feature means that cut hairs fall to the ground/counter top, but that vacuum feature is not essential in my mind.  </li>
            <li> The only thing about the tool is i noticed it wasnt Exactly zero overlap, so i had to push on the top blade a little harder till they were as closely accurate as possible.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press down, lightly touch the line</li>
            <li> From day 1 this shaver has done its job in a clean sharp manner.</li>
            <li> it keeps me clean and sharp</li>
            <li> Love the specially designed attachments that reach into difficult areas like under the nose.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and accurate trimmers.</li>
            <li> To start, the reviewers are right on the money; they are super sharp right out of the box, so little adjusting was needed for my detailing.</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd when I opened the package and the guarded wasn&#x27;t on.</li>
            <li> Small lightweight cuts very close and smooth.</li>
            <li> electric cord is quite long, obviously designed for professional use (i.e., a barber chair), I like the little toggle on-off switch (easy to operate), the unit is very quiet and the cutters allow very precise trimming.  </li>
            <li> This is a sweet little trimmer that is quiet, powerful and works well with no drama or issues.  </li>
            <li> This is a very powerful, very sharp trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The clippers work fine so far, so other than that, I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes the detailing and finishing of a cut look sharp and clean!</li>
            <li> Will only use it on certain men..</li>
            <li> They are light, they don&#x27;t overheat and are very precise in cutting.  </li>
            <li> It made a little sound and it stopped working i</li>
            <li> i gave them 4 stars only because the andis t-liners offer a little bit more precision.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be for them to use a wire cord that is a little lighted gauge and more flexible.</li>
            <li> they are super sharp.</li>
            <li> I was pretty decent at lining up my beard before with a pair of Andis clippers and now since I have these I&#x27;m able to step up my game!</li>
            <li> I paid full price for a NEW device not full price for a USED device.  </li>
            <li> so I took out my screwdriver and set it to zero and the lines were instantly very sharp and clean.</li>
            <li> Again great for cutting bald too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Problem is that the many years were not kind to it, and I was frequently maintaining it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this set, but back they must go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional or anything, but these clippers have given a crisp lining every time I used them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the largest guard (size &#x27;1-1/2&#x27; as marked), for my haircuts.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting professional looking results.</li>
            <li> I have another old wahl trimmer thats still going(10 years).....</li>
            <li> Now early January, 2016.  </li>
            <li> Needed professional</li>
            <li> No lie, this is a professional grade trimmer.</li>
            <li> With the pro tool set these clippers cut like a professional pair of clippers should.  </li>
            <li> Clippers just came and all I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li> cord&#x3D; make it easier to reach far outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for doing line-ups on my hair and facial hair and find it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I got to know about this machine from a professional barber who used it to trim my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to acquire one for my beard because I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My only real problem was that the blades arrived misaligned, but I adjusted it so all is well.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s what a professional barber would use.  </li>
            <li> but if I keep it short I can maintain a very close cut with none of the inconvenience of shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For all young barbers , get 2 pair of  Outliner T- Blade clippers .</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional Detailer is a wonder.  </li>
            <li> If you are a professional barber,&lt;br /&gt;you should upgrade to these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t get razor bumps--</li>
            <li> makes  a loud noise and it pulls the hair instead  of outline the trimming.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to give these Wahl Professional a shot.</li>
            <li> If it works as well as my old unit it will outlast me...</li>
            <li> Sounds like a loud tattoo gun in someone&#x27;s ear.  </li>
            <li> Cuts hair like butter, feels solid in the hand, and seems to be very well built.</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an old no-name trimmer that I&#x27;d bought almost 10 years ago and has served me well.  </li>
            <li> Bought two one for me one for my son for christmas as his old one battery one was giving up.</li>
            <li> After one week of professional use, the blade has started grabbing some customers&#x27; hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was early</li>
            <li> Very quiet and shaved very well...  </li>
            <li> My barber recommended this to me (he uses one all day long) when I complained that the cheap beard/mustache groomers were pretty much junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even called Wahl factory direct and they told me that they don&#x27;t make any additional guides for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The 3/16\\&quot; cuts too deep and shows too much skin, and the 1/16\\&quot; guide might as well not exist because it just leaves a bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> The middle guide doesn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional 8081</li>
            <li> but aint nobody got time for straight edge daily.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is quiet.</li>
            <li> So far I give them four stars</li>
            <li> Truly professional quality.</li>
            <li> but I like the reliability and professional power of this unit.</li>
            <li> never had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> it really is whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> So far i have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> This machine works well so far.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because the Andis trimmers heat up way too fast and break my power outlets.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want a loud t-liners all in your customers ear.</li>
            <li> Gives a close professional cut.</li>
            <li> I have a wahl professional for my dogs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this set by far tops the competition.</li>
            <li> Loud by default.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an early Christmas gift to my husband since he always wanted one.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it last for more than a few dozen uses.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4-star review is that I wish it had a few more guides.</li>
            <li> Powerful, yet quiet enough.</li>
            <li> I like the compact design and the fact that it does a good job cutting a straight edge.</li>
            <li> I praise these to the utmost for being able to trim my incredibly thick beard.</li>
            <li> Very light and small, does not get hot after 10 minutes of use like other products.</li>
            <li> I just received the clippers today and did not get to enjoy them because they had hair on them and looked used i have put in my return and a replacement if the new ones come in the same i will be returning for the full refund not happy at the moment.</li>
            <li> Sharp... nice little trimmer for the price. .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wished I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to purchase an upgrade; it took half the time it used to take with my old trimmers for an even better result.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a bit stiff when short, then you want to make sure you watch out for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other trimmers (i hear) get too hot after 5-7minutes of use so, these have them beat!    </li>
            <li> Andis unit trimms a little closer than the Wahl but is significantly heavier and a bit unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> These Wahl&#x27;s make sharp straight lines!!  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and true.  </li>
            <li> I found out the hard way as i did my own moustache last week for the first time and notice that a day later i cut too deep</li>
            <li> The trimmer is small and easy to maneuver when giving yourself a lineup.</li>
            <li> However, you get very short combs and don&#x27;t expect the other Wahl combs to fit.  </li>
            <li> trimmer is small and compact, so it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a cheap rechargeable 1.5 year trimmer that seems to be designed to be trashed as the battery never lasts and is not easily changed.    </li>
            <li> You can completely forget taking it with you anywhere, since once unplugged and in a suitcase for a few hours you have to plug it back in for 2 or more days to get the blades to BARELY move again.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazingly sharp &amp; powerful.</li>
            <li> I hope they are penalized for selling used personal hygiene products as new!</li>
            <li> well I received third replacement order and again same issue ( dings and hair on blades) to comfirm this I took a white tissue papaer and wiped the blade with it and sure enough tiny hairs on blades.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different trimmers the Classic 76 with a 0A 1.2mm blade, the Andis T-outliner, and this model.  </li>
            <li> only complaint I have is my fault for getting the &#x27;wide head&#x27; detailer - I wish the head was smaller to get more detailed areas.</li>
            <li> My first lasted probably 2 years or so, and my last only made it about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white guy using this mainly for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Cool little detailer.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to get clean edges and to not cut someone.</li>
            <li> Its sharp right out of the box</li>
            <li> And I had to adjust the blades of it because it&#x27;s so sharp right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better at handling it, but it will leave your next red all over for a couple of days if you aren&#x27;t extra careful.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to any hairy male</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone, and will buy another one in the event that my current on wears out.</li>
            <li> It is not only light in weight, but it also provides a very sharply defined cut as well.</li>
            <li> EASY TO HANDLE AND GIVES PRECISE CUTTING AND SHAPING.  </li>
            <li> its also small and light weight i have some wahl senior&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Then one day after being in use for about 2 mins I heard a small \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound come from them</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting a nob to stop it from making that lowed buzzing sound trimmers usually make.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clippers came on time and it was exactly what I expected besides its not 0 gap.</li>
            <li> Overall, they are worth the money, I just wish they would change the listing to reflect the actual included accessories so future buyers aren&#x27;t misled.</li>
            <li> When I bought my first one it did not come with a wide blade even though it still cut into skin</li>
            <li> Not what i expected the replacement item to be as the first product i received didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this detailer for a few months, both for true &#x27;detailing&#x27; and as a hair clipper.  </li>
            <li> I expected this trimmer to edge a little better.</li>
            <li> when they were brand new i actually cut my boyfriend&#x27;s forehead while doing the line up  </li>
            <li> If it breaks I can actually just swap it out for a new one.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my edge up looking new and I have received multiple compliments from it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to pass off the product as &#x27;new&#x27; at least clean the damn thing.</li>
            <li> They are great for line ups and cutting hair short .</li>
            <li> I dont really know much about trimmers, but I have been going to barbers and never see them having trouble doing a line up, but as I may not be doing it correctly</li>
            <li> I am carefully considering the possibility of a legal action.</li>
            <li> Its pretty small but is built very well.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the Peanut, which I thought was supposed to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> Sorry my spelling sucks lol!     Ray</li>
            <li> nothing wrong with it at all good purchase overall.</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin and coarse hair</li>
            <li> but after I adjusted the blade and zero gapped them they cut crisp and sharp.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li> Not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> Blade is adjusted to its sharpest point but when I cut hair with it its not sharp.</li>
            <li> As it has sharp blades and it does not get hot in your hands.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a busy person who&#x27;s overcommitted in your professional and personal life to the point where looming tasks begin to accumulate mass and take on dark amorphous shapes that rob you of peaceful sleep and ride you like a circus donkey in your waking hours, don&#x27;t purchase this item from NORTHEAST BEAUTY...</li>
            <li> Does the job and gives me a clean line up with little to no razor bumps with proper care and technique.</li>
            <li> It had been so long since I had a decent shave at home</li>
            <li> you need a little powerful detailer, then go for it.</li>
            <li> I like Wahl products but this item is too small to cut hair nicely, especially the fine hair of my 90 y/o father.</li>
            <li> I mean it works fine but was just upset to the fact it was used before .</li>
            <li> All good just  have to be careful tightening the screws on the outside too hard or it&#x27;ll crack the plastic part of the back of the clipper when adjusting it back together</li>
            <li> really well, to be expected when new&lt;</li>
            <li> The Wahl pro Detailers are made to give professional results and stand years of daily abuse.  </li>
            <li> 1.2mm is not close enough to give the nearly shaved look I</li>
            <li> the way, I&#x27;ve owned 3 different models of professional grade andis clippers.</li>
            <li> The *only* thing negative about this product is that I wish it came with a greater range of attachments than only the 0.5, 1, and 1.5 cm ones which are included.</li>
            <li> i would totally recommend this clipper to anyone whether a professional or just like me saving money on hair cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though this product set my wife and I off guard, it does appear to functionally work (though we only plugged it in thus far).  </li>
            <li> Then I plug in the trimmer to the outlet and that very second I do , the trimmer explodes making a loud pop noise.</li>
            <li> and I spent probably a 1/2 an hour trying to get it straight.  </li>
            <li> I wanted some professional T-liners that would last because the others always broke on me within a year.</li>
            <li> Eventually it barely operates even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 different andis trimmers and this by far blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li> Once adjusted this baby will zip hair off in one slow smooth pass, with or without the attachments for adjusting length.</li>
            <li> Now I can give myself that fresh faded look everyday.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good quality item, but I wanted a clipper for hair &amp; beard cutting.  </li>
            <li> so therefore it&#x27;s just there now, haven&#x27;t been able to use it or anything, and it&#x27;s still broken.</li>
            <li> Seems to be built alot better then the lower end versions that I&#x27;ve bought and broken over the years.</li>
            <li> Takes a little tinkering to get the blade set right ( which wasn&#x27;t even close out of the box).</li>
            <li> Its very light so you dont get tired as fast as other trimmers.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to hold and control but yet very powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall it doesn&#x27;t get hot, the cord is long enough and the blades are sharp, and it feels very durable.</li>
            <li> Sorry for Wahl that Beauty Fulfillment is selling their clippers as new, but won&#x27;t even take the time to be sure that all the hair is removed from the blades.</li>
            <li> The clippers are solid, they cut hair well, the only drawback is that they where used and sold as new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This trimmer sounds less powerful, but don&#x27;t let the fairly low noise level fool you.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, once I used this one the very first time, my old Remington haircutter (which was only one year old and already falling apart) went immediately into the trash can.  </li>
            <li> I use it to line up one of my son&#x27;s hair and shave my other son&#x27;s whole head.</li>
            <li> The detils I can produce with these sharp clippers really make the designs I create pop even before I color the design.</li>
            <li> It is quite sharp so be reasonable and don&#x27;t rush the task.</li>
            <li> Second, manufacturers intentionally put rechargeable batteries of average quality in cordless trimmers so that after a short while they will start losing charge fast and you will buy a new unit out of frustration.    </li>
            <li> I was greatful for the free shipping, but took 2 and half weeks to get to Jersey!!!</li>
            <li> From other reviews, apparently I&#x27;m not the only one; maybe ALL of these are used and some are just cleaned better, or looked at less closely by the recipient.     </li>
            <li> but i noticed trimmer seemd to have the issue above seemed to be in used condition and small hairs on blades also two small dings on top chrome cover I contacted Amazon and explained the issue they sent me a replacement with same issue (hairs on blades and small dings on top chrome plate)</li>
            <li> The clipper wasn&#x27;t sealed very well to begin with (not in plastic shell, just open in a closed box).</li>
            <li> But if im going to be honest, when these die on my ill probably go back to my t-outliner.</li>
            <li> is just hella low its good for designs and cutting the front hair line</li>
            <li> Not a shave but more like 1-2 days of stubble left behind.  </li>
            <li> Pay a little extra money for the right tool.</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t want to read the ramblings of an English major) --</li>
            <li> This trimmer, however i can use daily, quickly and with very little irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li> I mean that hair is getting sliced edge ups look clean, but you have to set them</li>
            <li> these are great and you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The common beard trimmers are too big for precise trimming and the motor is not powerful enough to make trimming fast and painless.  </li>
            <li> one thing I did knock this down for was that the switch feels very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Really let down in Amazon on this one.</li>
            <li> this from USA + a step down converter works out much</li>
            <li> I ordered these trimmers earlier this year, used them for a bit when I first got them but realized that the blade was a little off on one side</li>
            <li> Having had the trouble free experience of owning the previous version of this trimmer for approximately 7 years before it &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;, the decision to purchase this newer version was a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;One notable difference between the 2 is the absence of a blade adjustment tool from the box.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at several models but chose this one because I wanted it for the same reason as my old clipper set, simply to trim my beard and line out the back of my hair line.  </li>
            <li> They cut very close and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp straight out the box.</li>
            <li> i got it with the new t wide blade and let me tell u</li>
            <li> I use these to trim my facial hair as close as possible using no guides or guards, just the bare clippers.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is small, powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li> The item listed as new, but once I received the Clippers they were clearly used due to the amount of hair still in the blades!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to travel with me and the guards are the right sizes for trimming the beard.</li>
            <li> I started having doubts and decided to look at it closer under a light to confirm my fears made from those previous reviewers I ignored, and I indeed found little flakes of facial hair all around the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the previous review prior to mine</li>
            <li> The big benefit with this razor is it&#x27;s constant high power due to the fact that it&#x27;s not battery powered.</li>
            <li> Good for trimming but is limited if you are cutting your entire beard.</li>
            <li> It is better than the picture- its a little hard to see in the pictures.</li>
            <li> these really get the job done with little effort whatsoever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the product made me ask Lhhilfo the new business due to failure.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> The switch was already in the switch-on position (not common for a cutting product, and really caught us off guard when we plugged it in for the first time),&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> This product is high quality, very sharp and 1/2 as load as the Peanut Trimmer.</li>
            <li> but once you set it right, my friends they hit so so hard</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re interested in buying this trimmer it would help to buy a blade less wide which wahl can supply.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure to whatever it is you&#x27;re cutting, it should be fine though.  </li>
            <li> I mainly uses the edgers to line up my hairline and shape up what little mustache and goatee I can grow.</li>
            <li> This definitely is a few steps above the cheap Wal-Mart trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I wanted that professional sharp lineup and boy</li>
            <li> THEY ARE VERY SHARP WHEN BRAND NEW...</li>
            <li> Another useful tip is that the 8081 5 star is the red one with the T wide blade, the other model is a black one with the standard blade</li>
            <li> The T Outliners however through my long experience of owning a pair, often times left red marks and burns just about everytime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, lightweight and has an extra long cord.  </li>
            <li> Rechargeable batteries CAN potentially make some sense to me, but only if they have a long life &amp; you can eventually replace them.</li>
            <li> terrific till i dropped it in the toilet.  </li>
            <li> Loud and the human color looks pretty bad, cuts pretty well, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> when I first used them on my client after receiving them, he kept saying &amp;#34;Ouch&amp;#34; , I assumed I was pressing too hard so softened my touch , the screams continued.....</li>
            <li> and I searched a very long time as i was tired of cheap, rechargeable trimmers.</li>
            <li> The motor is not as strong as the Wahl hero, however the  problem with the Wahl hero is the design makes it difficult to line the front of your hair because the gold part in the front will hit your forehead before the actual blade.</li>
            <li> Becareful if your heavy handed and careful around sensitive areas they are very sharp.. cut really crisp</li>
            <li> Never had a complaint of getting too hot.</li>
            <li> A long strand of human hair.</li>
            <li> last a long time, durable.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> I should have bought a home unit except I wanted one that would last a long time,</li>
            <li> A major irritant for me is also the fact that most manufacturers do not offer combined corded\cordless operation on their less expensive models.  </li>
            <li> As a client in good standing , I feel that a new pair is the least I should get and my rush fee returned or something comparable !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll save these to clean up my neck or if i need to trim my neckline but other than that, not good for shapeups unless you want to push your hairline back.</li>
            <li> Be careful you can cut your self easily on this setting never use the trimmer upside down or press it too hard against the skin.</li>
            <li> My first reaction when I opened the box was &#x27;this thing is small!&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you really have to use it until it heats up</li>
            <li> Second the blade precision is a joke when it comes to cutting 20 or more heads.</li>
            <li> The set I received has black fibers in it and a coating of oil (old looking) on the blade.</li>
            <li> (However, we recognized that this finding alone does not equal a used product via potential for rough shipping),&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite get as close as my Braun 7 series shaver but much closer than your base line trimmer found at most retail stores</li>
            <li> Small but &amp;#34;POWERFUL&amp;#34; very sharp when &amp;#34;0 Gap&amp;#34; definately worth it.</li>
            <li> Small but powerful &amp; very sharp .</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional Trimmer was listed as &amp;#34;NEW.&amp;#34; However, when it arrived, it had hair still trapped within the blades, meaning that this product had previously been used before I received it, rendering it completely unsterile.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed was the blades initially were quite sharp when used alone</li>
            <li> I switched to this after several other trimmers, and have personally recommended it to all my bearded friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are pretty sharp so be careful while using and are lightweight, but a little loud however not unexpected with such a small trimmer</li>
            <li> you really have to try hard).  </li>
            <li> They seem dull, very noisy when they are in operation and do not provide the advertised performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to be used even for edging, so the only thing it&#x27;s good for is those silly little designs people carve into their heads.</li>
            <li> any problems.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I chose this trimmer is because it&#x27;s corded, I was tired of cordless trimmers that didn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and required frequent charging.</li>
            <li> If I wait more than 3 days before cutting I get a lot of pulling</li>
            <li> It turned what used to be a hassle (an uncomfortable one at that) to a two to three minuet pain free job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is long, flexible&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li> I bought this to cut my two sons&#x27; hair, ages 12 and 10, after years of paying for haircuts and wasting time waiting in long lines at barbershops.  </li>
            <li> it took this long to find it..</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I am not a professional barber nor do I cut hair.  </li>
            <li> Be careful using on back of the neck till you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took so long to go to a corded trimmer.</li>
            <li> , long answer to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the long blade helps get the corners A must buy</li>
            <li> Actually they were quieter than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not a set of clippers, so I&#x27;m not using it to cut long hair.</li>
            <li> Being smaller than I expected, is a plus.</li>
            <li> I tried to adjust blades and all just look into something else if you want to use it for long term.</li>
            <li> long cord.</li>
            <li> Long cord too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> am not a professional barber</li>
            <li> The trimmer I recieved was apparently used before, because there were a few hair trimmings left in the blades.</li>
            <li> I bout this trimmer for my fiancé because he needed a new pair and I have grown tired of him complaining about his old ones.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this model because the units with rechargeable batteries seemed to last a year or less before they simply stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The most disturbing part was the fact that the blades had a black lint/oil-like substance all over it and 2 brown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s box had dents and mild rips in it as if someone carelessly tried to open it prior,&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> And when I say they don&#x27;t suck, I mean both that they work VERY well, and they do not feature the vacuum feature found on some other units.  </li>
            <li> These pro models may be a little more expensive but in the end you will save yourself a lot of frustration and time.</li>
            <li> I personally did not find them to be so sharp as to cut or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed at how sharp and quiet they are..</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because I have owned several pair of trimmers and the only one got the job done was the Andis T Outliners.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviews here indicate, the product arrived with obvious signs of use.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to get that really sharp edge-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clippers didn&#x27;t come sharp enough as sold</li>
            <li> As result I received 2nd degree burns to the inside of my fingers due to me holding the plug when I inserted it into the outlet.</li>
            <li> In fact, at times it seems to be almost too sharp, slicing bumps open as though it were a passing thought.  </li>
            <li> Actually too sharp.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to other barbers</li>
            <li> In my opinion they have to be set because they don&#x27;t come factory sharp enough</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not aware of a single rechargeable trimmer or haircutter on the market that allows you to open up the casing and replace the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for cutting beards and also for cutting hair, and it works excellent for both.  </li>
            <li> At first it seemed small, but it fits well in my hand and the cutting edge is of adequate size.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t feel durable but only time will tell as I&#x27;ve only had them for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I  had the Wahl professional  2000 trimmer clipper, which was loud and did a poor  job.</li>
            <li> Please take what I say into consideration; I don&#x27;t know what this dealer (Amazon?) is doing, but these are DEFINITELY not new.</li>
            <li> Nowhere in the product description does it suggest that the clippers are not new.  </li>
            <li> , it shaves very very close (be careful not to press too hard or you will bleed!)</li>
            <li> The ones with the integrated vaccum are useless because the vaccum is not powerful enough to keep things clean.  </li>
            <li> Am not gonna award even a single star.</li>
            <li> No heating, excessive vibration, or loud noise.  </li>
            <li> the motor is not powerful enough .</li>
            <li> /&gt;AU$125+postage is the current average price...</li>
            <li> im a white male with thick facial hair</li>
            <li> Having that said - he used them on me to get a close detail on my sideburns and moustache that was equal to that of my former barber who had been cutting my hair since my freshman year of HS - 1992 - needless to say I was warned that the blades are sharp and it&#x27;s no need to have to pull or dig deep for a good cut.</li>
            <li> The clipper guard was not on the clipper but just loose in the box.</li>
            <li> so i been researching on line and on you tube been watching what trimmers are barbers using to get such a clean line since i am cutting mens hair all day</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard down and back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Im still using the same blades and there just as sharp!</li>
            <li> Mine also came with hair in it already (tiny black hairs) - granted not many, but clearly it was used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super quiet</li>
            <li> As a previous owner of the Andis Styliner II trimmer, these are in a class above in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered them half way through my deployment to cut my hair and trim my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Now I can assume the black substance might have been the lubricating oil, but the lint-like quality and 2 hairs point to this product being used/refurbished prior to us receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Half the size of regular haircutters, but twice the power and versatility.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the model I received was a dud or if this product has somehow changed overall, nonetheless, this experience has me shopping for an alternate trimmer.</li>
            <li> It still cuts close, though very slightly less close as compared to the earlier iteration of the  8081.</li>
            <li> But when i tested them out, I was quickly proven wrong.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very close to the skin without irritation, tugging, or slowing down through my thick beard.</li>
            <li> First, with cordless-only trimmers, you will eventually forget to recharge it and be very frustrated if you have an important meeting or occasion that day ...  </li>
            <li> expecting the Wahl 8081 to last a lifetime, given the light use that I need it for (short mustache &amp; goatee trimming twice/week), and the fact that I can travel with &amp; and bang-around my ANCIENT corded Remington trimmer (which lacks adjustable cutting lengths, but still works!)</li>
            <li> Be careful if you try to shave back of neck with them because they are very very sharp and could irritate  or cut your skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new trimmer for facial hair and tired of the problems with rechargeables units.</li>
            <li> It was in a rather empty box, rattling around, and had black tiny pieces in the blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I finally had to give in and start shopping for a new trimmer when even a 10 second power outage would render my Norelco useless.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the long cutting surface makes it a little challenging to trim my upper lip.</li>
            <li> The T Wide is small enough and powerful enough to get those hard to reach spots with ease  such as behind the ear or beard/ mustache area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the motor is a little bit louder than the T Outliner but noise doesn&#x27;t matter...</li>
            <li> My neck was still a little tender the next morning, but it cleared up by lunch.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it might feel out of balance, especially with the cord, but doesn&#x27;t feel bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;It trimmed my hair fine.</li>
            <li> The blade was even dull looking as if they were an old return.</li>
            <li> I quickly found that I had endless options and had a difficult time deciding what to buy.</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I decided to go back to the cordless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really a con</li>
            <li> Received item and opened it to find that the device was not seated in the molded tray and askew.  </li>
            <li> Coming with a wide blade exacerbates the problem.  </li>
            <li> One should be a bit careful with it however.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful.</li>
            <li> The one thing to be careful with when  it&#x27;s set to zero</li>
            <li> but I still adjusted the blades for an even closer trim just be careful when you  adjust the blades because with a 0 gap it&#x27;s a lot easier to cut yourself or your clients.</li>
            <li> The motor is relatively silent, keeps my hair very short (as close to a razor as reasonably possible), and I have not experienced any discomfort or razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> Be careful though, this is the sharpest blade wahl makes.</li>
            <li> so if you want the T-wide get the red 8081 if you don&#x27;t want to waste your money on another blade vice versa.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy and unwieldy, but quiet for a clipper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real fond of.  </li>
            <li> If there was a downside (not really) but it would be that this does not cut at the stubble level.  </li>
            <li> So be careful if you zero gap them.</li>
            <li> plugged into the wall all the time, otherwise the motor will drag.</li>
            <li> careful  </li>
            <li> Only had a few months lets see how it holds up to time</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these that I spent almost $60 on from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> but be careful when adjusting screws.</li>
            <li> Careful of the power and sharpness</li>
            <li> No complaints, this thing is every thing I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what expected, needs to be put on zero overlap</li>
            <li> This clipper runs a little louder than other clippers of this type but that is the only drawback to me.</li>
            <li> but they are useless to me if I cant get them to cut right.</li>
            <li> so far it has been pretty bad shaving my neck as it constantly snags and pulls my skin leaving little cuts.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer, a Peanut, would last half a year before needing a blade change.  </li>
            <li> I had some minor razor burn after usage, but figured the blade was just a little rough and tried to adjust.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought those reviewers were going over-the-top with a bad review, and I decided to buy it anyway expecting a brand new trimmer, wrapped in plastic-wrap and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing, this cutter is sharp so be careful if you are using it on your neck line or other areas.</li>
            <li> I use these clippers at least twice a week, so of course, with cleaning and lubricant these will defintely last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on people with sensitive skin unless you seriously adjust the blades</li>
            <li> The little bottle of trimmer oil it came with is long gone, and I&#x27;m using the mineral oil I use on my chef&#x27;s knives to keep it slicked up.  </li>
            <li> The replacement item came with a rusty blade and minor scratches with little hairs still in the blade...</li>
            <li> /&gt;this wahl gives close cuts not so sharp on the line ups</li>
            <li> and they were sharp, but I wanted sharper.  </li>
            <li> I wish I oiled mine regularly (in the past)</li>
            <li> So I bought Wahl&#x27;s other 2 clippers with lithium ion.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> A few minor issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has already been mentioned in other reviews as well.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned that the blades may be too sharp.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that the bottom housing of the trimmer contains a HOOK which holds the spring that counteracts the force of the motor to make the blades move.  </li>
            <li> One pair don&#x27;t set the blade the other adjust the blade flush .</li>
            <li> blade is sharp.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the other one star users warning.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt them like other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Walh came out with the detailer and claim they cut like non other.</li>
            <li> sharp lines</li>
            <li> I had been using a larger one and a small one and this does both jobs.</li>
            <li> If you want extreme detail your going to need the wahl detailers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless electric shavors and clippers over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I recommend to other professionals.</li>
            <li> Once you adjust the blade to get even with the guard the cut will be extremely close.</li>
            <li> The blade is really sharp</li>
            <li> Gives you a sharp look when you are done.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 months, the blade area was full of rust and it was cutting my husband to ribbons.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after dealing with cheaper wahl (and other brands) products.</li>
            <li> The stock blade is sharper than any other blade I&#x27;ve used as is.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a matter of the under blade sticking out past the upper protection blade.</li>
            <li> Other signs of use include chips and finger prints.</li>
            <li> These trimmers work extremely well.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t even that sharp on the beard either.</li>
            <li> clippers are really sharp and you&#x27;ll need to adjust them.</li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers state they are sharp out the box...</li>
            <li> not as sharp as the andis t outliner.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed hairstylist, and in the past I have only used Andis trimmers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but very solid.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very well built and plenty of power compared to my old $18 Wal-Mart battery trimmer (very lame).</li>
            <li> and I was looking forward to not have to do the tedious process of \\&quot;zero gapping\\&quot; the balde for a super crisp line/close shave without cutting myslef from blade overlap.     </li>
            <li> and I say please, be very careful.</li>
            <li> Hard to do my mustache properly with the wide head.</li>
            <li> Just as everyone else says it&#x27;s very sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful because they are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do it nearly as much and with enough use I could operate it in a manner without cutting skin.  </li>
            <li> ohh boyyyy after using this trimmer my whole face was red and itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> Already broken after about 1.5 months of professional use!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 4 other products from different manufacturers that are designed specifically for beard trimming and they don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> My biggest issue with any other set that I have purchased was having to go back over my head 40 times before the clipper would not cut through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I must say that it is very sharp, too sharp.</li>
            <li> had to adjust the blade a little, but that is always expected on a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> The other half was absent, and there was no tag or paperwork that would suggest the need for one.&lt;br /&gt;5)  </li>
            <li> All the other trimmers that I had previously owned survived for maybe 1 year.  </li>
            <li> I like that they are sharp but their a little bit to sharp.</li>
            <li> Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;And when I plugged it into electricity is simply not working and how hard I tried</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I had terrible experiances from shaving by other trimmers, but I have never had any problem with Wahl Professional 8081 and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> He has very thick and coarse facial hair and has trouble finding one that will cut through it without pulling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my set for at least 3 years and use them constantly to line my hair up after a trim and they do their job well.</li>
            <li> Now I have trimmers that are useless, I was trying to get away from spending so much on razors</li>
            <li> and I cut my hair at least every 2 weeks and trimmed my facial hair every week with the 1/16&amp;#34</li>
            <li> only negative I can mention is the Wahl packaging, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t held immobile in the Wahl box and it got all scuffed up while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its small not a loud as the peanut ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American male in college and have been cutting  my hair and others&#x27; hair for years now, always used Andis or Oster trimmers.</li>
            <li> now I have dark scars at hairline smdh ..</li>
            <li> These are the worst I have this trimmer before and loved it</li>
            <li> Solid, metal body, cast, sturdy blade covering, and thick, durable cord.</li>
            <li> I loved my Remington beard trimmer but the battery life was terrible.  </li>
            <li> However, if you use it with casual, gentle pressure, you can get a shave out of this that rivals that of a Mach 3 or Fusion</li>
            <li> AND THEY ALL BROKE DOWN WITHIN A YEAR.</li>
            <li> I bought it with another set of clippers that I use to cut the hair down.  </li>
            <li> , no sign of slowing down at all.  </li>
            <li> Detailer\\&quot; has gotten me down into that one day growth time frame.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to grind the blade down, and that makes my life easier.</li>
            <li> I dropped it down now</li>
            <li> hands down.</li>
            <li> I like to shave my head down to a stubble once every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I no longer dread trimming down my engineer&#x27;s goatee.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is sharp--don&#x27;t bear down or you&#x27;ll get razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Man these are sharp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say a lot about this little trimmer, you can read all the other reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I used to use &amp;#34;andes&amp;#34; brand but got tired of the same screw always coming loose, these make less noise</li>
            <li> (meaning wont cut you but very sharp).</li>
            <li> it borders on being a deadly weapon, so be careful!</li>
            <li> Be warned though these clippers are very sharp and will cut.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time on other t outliners wahl</li>
            <li> very sharp out the box</li>
            <li> /&gt;First month was VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and enables you to do close line ups.</li>
            <li> the teeth feels very sharp.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a narrower cutting head, the cord is unnecessarily heavy duty for the size of the motor and stiff and it came with a duplicate 1 1/2 comb instead of the full complement,</li>
            <li> Works on Black hair.  </li>
            <li> After having to replace 2 or 3 in less than 2 years, I decided to try this model.  </li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic cordless beard &amp; mustache trimmer previous.  </li>
            <li> What if the previous user had HIV?  </li>
            <li> One of the sellers wrote that the black material on the blade is test fibers and oil from the Wahl factory.</li>
            <li> The woman I spoke to worked in manufacturing previously and said I should return this item.</li>
            <li> My wife and I just received the the Wahl Trimmer and ran into an odd issue we never encountered before.  </li>
            <li> again I tried them and maybe I got a slight improvement...</li>
            <li> Then I noticed the black plastic packaging with scratches.</li>
            <li> trashed others i bought previously..</li>
            <li> Ill keep it short and simple.  </li>
            <li> I swear, I feel like my barber is rendered useless  now (especially with their recent price hike).</li>
            <li> This cuts closer, cleaner with less pull.</li>
            <li> The previous trimmer was a corded, Wahl Peanut.  </li>
            <li> The blade on this trimmer is wider than that of the previous 1, and comes zero gapped out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the start, I was kinda worried that I picked the wrong clippers, mainly because of its size.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer is very sharp and does not choke when you are cutting hair very fast.</li>
            <li> These trimmers were either too sharp or plain defective.</li>
            <li> Overall this trimmer isn&#x27;t bad just be prepared to buy extra parts for maintenance if you want something that will last try the</li>
            <li> these are not full size clippers.</li>
            <li> Not cool on all levels.</li>
            <li> From the first time you power it on, no adjustment to the blade is needed unless you want an even sharper line that will sacrifice cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> I chose this Wahl Pro 8081 over another Peanut due to the poor reviews that I had read by people who had recently purchased ANOTHER Peanut.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I was using smaller personal trimmers to keep my line up somewhat sharp in between barber shop visits but they weren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> I have a light hand and usually have no need to adjust trimmers or clippers, however this item caused Razor Burns with each use, I eventually got frustrated and opted to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clippers messed up less that a few months after purchasing.</li>
            <li> So close that my skin was actually a little irritated and</li>
            <li> I did see a little bit of what people are describing, but I think it&#x27;s some sort of residue from manufacturing process.</li>
            <li> Even though this thing is little, it packs a punch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like something a little longer for my beard and the 1-1/2</li>
            <li> is a little shorter than I want to be.&lt;br /&gt;• </li>
            <li> As a barber i did tweak it a little bit</li>
            <li> but these are a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Batteries are a toxic poisonous mess in our waste stream.</li>
            <li> At that point you&#x27;re either resigning yourself to using a weak instrument that is no longer even portable (I stubbornly did this for the last couple of years), or you&#x27;re throwing the darn thing away, since the batteries cannot be removed/</li>
            <li> but they are a lot sharper and require a little pressure unlike the Detailers.</li>
            <li> It does vibrate a little bit.</li>
            <li> Beats Andis hands down!</li>
            <li> Cuts sharp as well!!</li>
            <li> they came out the box cutting very close.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unsanitary and dangerous.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have these clippers in your clipper collection then you&#x27;re missing out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> I realized if I want to buy a beard trimmer that isn&#x27;t some trouble prone, guaranteed to die in two years, cordless model I have to seek out one online.  </li>
            <li> People that use a clipper design that is over 40 yrs are missing out..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money with this garbage.</li>
            <li> Received my unit a few days ago and have used it to cut both dense and sparse hair as well as line work.</li>
            <li> Trimmer arrived dead.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything but waste my time and printer ink.</li>
            <li> I would still have to do a few passes with these</li>
            <li> This did come with a few snap-on combs, I use the 1.5&amp;#34; comb when trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a few months now along with my T Outliers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> While unboxing this trimmer I realized it&#x27;s missing the Pro-Set tool.</li>
            <li> A few weeks in, and after applying some anti-rust, disinfecting clipper spray, the blade shows rust.</li>
            <li> I did get a refund, but also had my time wasted.</li>
            <li> Since it arrived I have been using everyday.</li>
            <li> buy andis t-outliner dont waste your time on this</li>
            <li> I have some acne and shaving only makes it worse.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> She was concerned that this Wahl Pro 8081 might be too bulky and heavy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time, get yours today.</li>
            <li> I was running into emergency situations where I had to shave but the batteries in my rechargeable trimmer would be dead.</li>
            <li> Those razors usually come in a 3 pack for $4, but be carefull since they are sharp!    </li>
            <li> The razor is small in your hand and even shaving slow and carefully, I find nicks when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come with some guides, so you can trim down hair without cutting it completely off.  </li>
            <li> when they say sharp they don&#x27;t mean the blade</li>
            <li> Work well, just a little small for my hands.</li>
            <li> This one is small, heavy and cuts through my beard with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> There were a few small hairs in the blades, but from my understanding you have to test the item before you ship it?</li>
            <li> Bought cheaper rechargeable one and it doesn&#x27;t shave as well and bogs down if hair is thick.  </li>
            <li> but lately the Andis product quality has been going down.</li>
            <li> Smelling it raw, it smells like cleaner.</li>
            <li> In that area it not only could not cut the stubble, it actually was a bit painful to do so, no matter what direction the trimmer was held.  </li>
            <li> When I used even some of the top rated Li-Ion powered trimmers, I developed a psychological complex from those times when they&#x27;d slow down and snag on my thick hair, resulting in a dreadful, painful experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to shave, which makes it a little hard to see what I&#x27;m working</li>
            <li> try to add to this review as times goes on in case it fails to perform later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three less-expensive rechargeable trimmers, it seems that it&#x27;s always the batteries that go, usually three or four months in.  </li>
            <li> But when I got the trimmer and saw the small hair particles on the machine  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews</li>
            <li> The unit is small but has a quality heft that lends a premium feel to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> So not sure how this product exists.</li>
            <li> aftr taking a close look at the clippers, I noticed that 2 of the teeth in the center of the blade were broken.......</li>
            <li> It is small and should travel well.  </li>
            <li> and it comes with a small bottle of oil.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is small.</li>
            <li> No more rashes or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Andis products.</li>
            <li> I have tougher than average facial hair growth but this trimmer doesn&#x27;t even know that it is cutting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think people would be able to tell the difference between this and a shave, at the worst they&#x27;ll think you have a 5&#x27;o clock shadow which is still professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> This one comes with three attachments, a small brush, and a small oil container.  </li>
            <li> I use this to keep my hair short as I am balding, but unfortunately I have to either go for the 1.0 guard comb or no guard comb because the 1/2 guard comb arrived damaged and unusable.  </li>
            <li> I usually use trimmers to shave my face instead of using a razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> If you have used Andi&#x27;s trimmers in the past, the Wahl will take some time getting use to.</li>
            <li> far as the cutting is concerned....</li>
            <li> Having grown tired of the cordless trimmers that seemed to always grow weak from dying batteries, I went online to find a corded option that the local stores didn&#x27;t seem to have.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely upset and lucky that it wasn&#x27;t worst than it was.</li>
            <li> He has lots of facial hair and used to hate to trim, but said he now actually enjoys trimming.</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews on here stating how this product came as &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; due to various reasons.</li>
            <li> , I thought it could be used for cutting in general.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I waited so long.</li>
            <li> The T- wide blade is very helpful in cutting the corners and leaving a boxed and uncrooked shape up!!</li>
            <li> There was half of a broken plastic tie (the type seen in clothing that attaches to a tag).  </li>
            <li> This has broken previous trimmers.</li>
            <li> The truth is that this is either not a new item or fake.</li>
            <li> dont push to hard</li>
            <li> YOU DONT HAVE TO CUT HARD</li>
            <li> It gets dull in 4 months, but does the job.</li>
            <li> It feels like if you switched it too hard it would break.  </li>
            <li> i even got the wahl detailers sharpened and still didnt do the job the corners dont hit its just hard to use it.</li>
            <li> Picked this up after I dropped my Wahl clippers on the hard tile.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it anymore, and it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
            <li> but at least you don&#x27;t have to worry about a tool not keeping its charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They will mow through your thick hair without any problem.</li>
            <li> They motor slowly gets weaker over time.</li>
            <li> I mean im</li>
            <li> I mean that&#x27;s wat you mean and</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied at ALL with them!</li>
            <li> Found mines with possibly other people&#x27;s hair on it when it arrived not HAPPY !!!!!!</li>
            <li> but they mean the points of the trimmer when detailing it scraps the sh#t out of your neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber, but I have been cutting my hair &amp; others for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> it is i use it for trimming and cutting my beard when it gets long.</li>
            <li> Price does not always mean quality and my Super trimmer has been the worst purchase.</li>
            <li> Seriously??</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re ridiculously overpriced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has nothing bad to say about it at all, and he wishes we would have found it earlier.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say except that the cord is inconvenient, but</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and dangerous.</li>
            <li> The blades were way to sharp and their dangerous to use against your skin.</li>
            <li> I will never go to any other after cutting with these.</li>
            <li> I was dumb and threw out the box before I realized this.  </li>
            <li> I had just been through a long &amp; painful experience with battery operated trimmers that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> and so I am left extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of some Andis t outline II&#x27;s but they were alright, but you would need a barbers blade (and that thing is tough to use on yourself).</li>
            <li> No more andis trimmers for me!!  </li>
            <li> and i can assure you that they are less expensive on here!  </li>
            <li> BUT DON&#x27;T LAST FOR CRAP.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying someone $15 to use a number one guide.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the blade is adjustable so you can control the closeness to the skin and avoid broken skin.</li>
            <li> This hook often breaks resulting in the trimmer losing power or failing if the hook is completely broken.  </li>
            <li> and then the 1 cent chinese switch broke, leaving the unit totally worthless.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Basically got tired of razor shaving and</li>
            <li> Got the package was suspicious about it because some of the seals were broken opened  the trimmer box and there is hair all over it.</li>
            <li> No happy medium.</li>
            <li> I got really tired of replacing my otherwise-still-functional beard trimmer every 2-4 years when the battery pooched out.  </li>
            <li> A veil of poorly performing trimmer blades.  </li>
            <li> Then I noticed it was just in the tips of the blades not underneath or behind.</li>
            <li> I used this machine a few times but people kept complaining I was cutting them with the machine.</li>
            <li> Cuts close without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of investing in shavers that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying (and eventually throwing away) rechargeable beard trimmers that don&#x27;t cut that well, and then die after 2 years.</li>
            <li> the 1/2 guard comb, but alas like I said it is unusable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my girlfriend is a beautician and i was tired of her hurting my neck.</li>
            <li> The other shavers would irritate his skin so bad he eventually quit shaving.</li>
            <li> Decent trimmer hampered by terrible guides.</li>
            <li> and you hate that you wished you could have found out about it a long time ago?</li>
            <li> I tried them on another client and they were not as dramatic</li>
            <li> By far this is the worst experience I have ever had with a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> No more stinky and painful Nair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to open a box of clippers and find someone else&#x27;s hair!!!</li>
            <li> After doing some research I see this is very common!</li>
            <li> These are so scary to use.</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> so I think that and some careless delivery men are to blame.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sad</li>
            <li> After further investigation of the devise I noticed specs of hair in the blades, which is utterly disgusting and unprofessional.</li>
            <li> so I can fail soon deal.  </li>
            <li> You can go wrong this purchase..</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with Wahl.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry the product had to take a hit for it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this added to your set of clipping tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a million Andis, of course the infamous t edger which were a beast until these hit the market.</li>
            <li> But wait... it gets worse!</li>
            <li> but very disappointed they were not new in the process of disinfecting them now</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed as there is no mention whatsoever in the product description that this item is not new.</li>
            <li> However, the trimmer arrived not secured in the box , no plastic around product or box, coord not tied, a couple of small areas scratched, and the worst of it is: the blade attached to the trimmer is dirty, greasy and appears to have small amounts of someone else&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair was on the blade which was very disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> it came broken and chipped very unhappy</li>
            <li> They get as close as you can without cutting yourself or using a razor.     </li>
            <li> This trimmer is prone to cutting into skin.  </li>
            <li> I believe the equipment that you have does make the difference when it comes to cutting hair.</li>
            <li> It has taken my hair cutting to another level.</li>
            <li> The longest cutting guide is 1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Backing up on this setting to avoid cutting the skin caused them to cut ineffective.</li>
            <li> I changed the blade, and it was still cutting people.</li>
            <li> Tried cutting hair with this Wahl detailer but the blade pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has been cutting hair for around 17 years</li>
            <li> ive been cutting for 4 years</li>
            <li> Came out of the box cutting close but not to close.</li>
            <li> A must if your a Barber, Stylist, or just cutting your hair.</li>
            <li> Imagine the horror and disappointing look on our faces when the item was opened to discover that the blade was rusting.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very difficult to handle.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say they are bad.</li>
            <li> it wasnt bad like to the point that it was bleeding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the bad: the mention blade adjustment tool and plastic storage case were not included in the packaging, nor were they listed in or on the packaging as included accessories.</li>
            <li> Me or my brother had nothing bad to say....</li>
            <li> and it would cause some skin irritation when I was detailing, but it&#x27;s not as bad now</li>
            <li> I had one before but it became bad after 4 years.</li>
            <li> I have had bad luck with trimmers but this thing here is the truth.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s bad for business.</li>
            <li> No chargers or batteries to go bad, and all the power I could want.  </li>
            <li> a lot easier than hand tearing or cutting with scissors ..!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the batteries are terrible.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Check out Youtube, and even buy a set to try for yourself, you will NOT be disappointed !  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the Wahl detailer.</li>
            <li> I find that to be very disgusting.</li>
            <li> Awful, trimmers shredded my clients neck, blade was defective and defiantly used.</li>
            <li> but it did not matter because this is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> this  caused the trimmer to make a horrible racket ....</li>
            <li> Terrible hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Totally disgusted.</li>
            <li> this is horrible because this causes the blade to cut and nick whomever I am working on....</li>
            <li> Well this is crap!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Disgusted by the hair.  </li>
            <li> these clippers are horrible</li>
            <li> RUSTING BLADES HORRIBLE.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Have used it 3 times now to shave my head. Super closer and accurate shave. Highly recommended for simple buzz cuts or clean razor shaves.</li>
            <li> Use it to shave my head twice a week very smooth</li>
            <li> PURCHASED 3 PAIR AND THEY ALL BROKE DOWN WITHIN A YEAR. I ONLY USED THEM 2-3 TIMES A WEEK. SMDH! THEY LOOK GOOD AND CUT GOOD BUT DON&#x27;T LAST FOR CRAP.</li>
            <li> These are so scary to use.Extremely sharp and dangerous.I adjusted them 5 different times and no luck.They left a huge red line on my clients neck and cut them time after time.And yes I know how to adjust the blades I have been doing it for years.</li>
            <li> I love these. It is great for trimming back hair. No more stinky and painful Nair. My hairdresser paid $60 for the same one. Very happy</li>
            <li> Brand new factory sealed box, they work great definitely going to put these to use.</li>
            <li> UThe sharpest edging clippers I have ever used. The Andis clippers don&#x27;t come close to these!!</li>
            <li> I love these!! Great Product!!</li>
            <li> this is coming from a guy or has return ever liner i ever bought from walmart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also returned&lt;br /&gt;the andis super liner &amp;#34;the wahls smokes it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;the andis outliner gts experience could not test that it came defective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this wahl gives close cuts not so sharp on the line ups but maybe i dont know how to do it like a pro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but buy this its awsome</li>
            <li> I bout this trimmer for my fiancé because he needed a new pair and I have grown tired of him complaining about his old ones. He was excited and pleased with my choice. I bought them for his personal but  now he uses them on his clients.</li>
            <li> The clippers are clean, very sharp, and is excellent in giving edge ups.</li>
            <li> Sorry for Wahl that Beauty Fulfillment is selling their clippers as new, but won&#x27;t even take the time to be sure that all the hair is removed from the blades. I find that to be very disgusting. The blade was even dull looking as if they were an old return. I really wanted this set, but back they must go.</li>
            <li> 5/1/15 - Just received this&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than I expected&lt;br /&gt;Longest blade guide is 1/4&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t expect to maintain a long beard with this&lt;br /&gt;Seems well built, sturdy, good fit and finish&lt;br /&gt;T-blade is nice touch, can get into nose/ear openings&lt;br /&gt;Has a toggle switch to power off/on&lt;br /&gt;Cord is long, flexible&lt;br /&gt;Cuts really well, to be expected when new&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Will try to add to this review as times goes on in case it fails to perform later.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave. Perfect for lining up facial hair.</li>
            <li> These liners are awesome. I tried them out the box and they were sharp, but I wanted sharper.  I zero gapped the blades and wow amazing how crisp and precise they are.  Honestly the best liners Ive ever used.  I own the Andis T outliner and skyliner which will be sitting on the shelf now.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband last year. I loved it because it was so small and neat and did the job well. But exactly 1 year after buying it bloew. My husband was using it and it just hear &#x27;packs&amp;#34; and it stopped worrking. Now he had 2 set so this 1 was used just to neated the hairline so it wasnt put under pressure. Im sorry i even bought this because now i have to get a new 1.</li>
            <li> i have had a pair of these for a year now and i am happy.  I didn&#x27;t purchase them on amazon but i do shop on here alot and i can assure you that they are less expensive on here!  I am not a pro barber (never went to school for it), but i have been cutting my own and my friends hair for about 15 years.  These clippers are a God send!  i gave them 4 stars only because the andis t-liners offer a little bit more precision. These wahl clippers are ideal for pro and at home barbers and they work really good on hair lines and beards for all hair textures.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional Trimmer was listed as &amp;#34;NEW.&amp;#34; However, when it arrived, it had hair still trapped within the blades, meaning that this product had previously been used before I received it, rendering it completely unsterile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional or anything, but these clippers have given a crisp lining every time I used them.  They also don&#x27;t overheat.</li>
            <li> I dont really know much about trimmers, but I have been going to barbers and never see them having trouble doing a line up, but as I may not be doing it correctly I can&#x27;t say they are bad. I enjoy that I am learning a new trade and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I really wish Amazon let you distinguish feedback on the order fulfillment vs the product itself. The trimmer I recieved was apparently used before, because there were a few hair trimmings left in the blades. From other reviews, apparently I&#x27;m not the only one; maybe ALL of these are used and some are just cleaned better, or looked at less closely by the recipient.     I was not ordering a used item, and the item description certainly doesn&#x27;t say so. This is no reflection on the product itself. Item was from \\&quot;Quick E Shop and Fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> They are very  good edgers, they don&#x27;t heat up, they are light weight, and they cut really good!  Just make sure you keep them clean and lubricate them with oil after each use...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this detailer for a few months, both for true &#x27;detailing&#x27; and as a hair clipper.  Quality seems very good, and I&#x27;ve generally been quite pleased with it.  The one thing I really WISH was available for it, is a more comprehensive set of guard attachments.  I&#x27;ve been using the largest guard (size &#x27;1-1/2&#x27; as marked), for my haircuts.  That&#x27;s OK for me, I keep my hair short anyway.  But I keep wishing for a larger size (for a longer cut).  I realize this is a &#x27;detailer&#x27; set, not a dedicated &#x27;clipper&#x27;.  But there appears not to be any supplemental guard sets available for this model, which uses narrower-width attachments.  The optional guard sets available for standard clippers are too large (wide) for this one, and won&#x27;t fit it.</li>
            <li> I already owned a pair of the Wahl Pro Trimmers and I wanted to gift these to a co-worker. My order came in on time but there was a scratch on the trimmer and they wouldn&#x27;t turn on. The trimmers were not packaged very well to begin with so I think that and some careless delivery men are to blame. I contacted the seller and the next day they sent me shipping instructions to exchange the trimmers. I&#x27;m still waiting for the new ones to come in...</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, this thing works great....Don&#x27;t press down, lightly touch the line or you will cut the skin-and get line scabs</li>
            <li> Very close cut. Accurate edge up. I&#x27;ve had these for over a year. Still runs good.</li>
            <li> Works on Black hair.  I bought this to cut my two sons&#x27; hair, ages 12 and 10, after years of paying for haircuts and wasting time waiting in long lines at barbershops.  I bought it with another set of clippers that I use to cut the hair down.  I use the Trimmer to go short, and to edge up the cut, giving it a nice tight line around all edges.  It is the right amount of sharpness, comfortable to use, doesn&#x27;t cut the boys&#x27; skin, etc.  I like it&#x27;s sleek feel and design.  The motor is nice and strong.  I would recommend it.  It&#x27;s well worth the money I saved in trips to the barbershop and I&#x27;m getting professional looking results.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time! Super for trimming my Goatee! and nose hairs too! Wahl makes great products! I have another old wahl trimmer thats still going(10 years).....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my set for at least 3 years and use them constantly to line my hair up after a trim and they do their job well. They get as close as you can without cutting yourself or using a razor.     If there is a hint of stubble around my hair line I use a woman&#x27;s eyebrow razor (shaper or whatever you call it) to get that clean barber look. Those razors usually come in a 3 pack for $4, but be carefull since they are sharp!    They get warm after 20 minutes of use but they cool off completely after 5 minutes so the trade off is worth it.    Other trimmers (i hear) get too hot after 5-7minutes of use so, these have them beat!    It comes with a blade adjustment tool that lets you line the blade and guard up so there is zero-overlap (meaning wont cut you but very sharp). I wish I oiled mine regularly (in the past) so they may last longer but since they still sell them I&#x27;ll consider buying a spare by years end.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> Small and light, runs very cool. Once adjusted to zero overlap with the tool they give you it creates incredibly nice edges, without any burn or scratches on my head. The only thing about the tool is i noticed it wasnt Exactly zero overlap, so i had to push on the top blade a little harder till they were as closely accurate as possible. The T Outliners however through my long experience of owning a pair, often times left red marks and burns just about everytime i was edging my hairline, and i didnt feel like it left a clean edge as the Detailers do. And i did zero overlap the t outliners as well. I&#x27;m sold on the detailers, however if your coming from the outliners it takes a little time to get used to it, but you will definitely be happy with this purchase. Great trimmers!</li>
            <li> Purchased this clipper because I have rather dense facial hair that grows quite rapidly, and I am occasionally not quite as diligent about shaving as I should be.  Hence, I can end up with some inconveniently-long growth on my face, beyond what my shaver can effectively remove.  I&#x27;ve gone through three less-expensive rechargeable trimmers, it seems that it&#x27;s always the batteries that go, usually three or four months in.  So far I&#x27;ve had this one perhaps three weeks, and it serves my needs very well.  It cuts cleanly and quickly, with a minimum of noise and fuss.  No heating, excessive vibration, or loud noise.  For the money, I&#x27;d say it was a very good value indeed.  I think I finally ended my cycle of burning out and buying trimmers with this one, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!  EDIT:  It is now the end of August, 2012.  Trimmer is still getting used about once a week, and is still running as well as when it was purchased.  Every couple months I put a drop of the supplied oil onto the blades (still have half the original bottle left) and twice now I have pulled the blades off to inspect the slides and clean out any hair inside.  Didn&#x27;t need it either time, but it made me feel like I was doing SOMETHING to keep it running better.  Still quite pleased with it, two years in.  EDIT:  It is now the beginning of April, 2014.  Still working great, no sign of slowing down at all.  I keep the blades oiled periodically and brush off the hair, and it just keeps working!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; gold lettering on the grip is mostly worn off now.  EDIT:  Now early January, 2016.  Clipper is still running just fine, no trouble at all.  The little bottle of trimmer oil it came with is long gone, and I&#x27;m using the mineral oil I use on my chef&#x27;s knives to keep it slicked up.  Still nice and quiet, running strong!</li>
            <li> I basically use these clippers for shaving and keeping my outline fresh between haircuts. They cut really close right out of the box much better than I expected. They are a lot smaller than my Andis Styliner II and I was worried that I&#x27;d dropped them but they fit in my hand really well and are super easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my hubby. He he is a barber by profession and he swears by this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer . Stylist for 12 years. Needed professional and I got it!</li>
            <li> These are the worst I have this trimmer before and loved it I recieved this one and it has cut multiple clients</li>
            <li> I wanted a detail trimmer with a cord from the start, but I could not find one. Everything was cordless. I struggled shaving with a rechargeable shaver and decided I had enough. Wahl is a solid brand, and once I found a CORDED trimmer I bought it. I have been very pleased with it and would recommend this one to others.</li>
            <li> I had this item for a while now, and it gets the job done. The clippers are light weight and do not heat up a fast as heavier clippers.</li>
            <li> I recieved trimmer a fews days ago. I opened the package and found the trimmer guard off and blade full of someones trimmings. Looks like they used it once then sent it back. I do not have time to send it back for i am going on vacation.</li>
            <li> It works great! it cuts the hair real close to the skin( after adjusting the blade) i use it to cut the mens  hair and beards really great for line ups and designs...when they were brand new i actually cut my boyfriend&#x27;s forehead while doing the line up  it wasnt bad like to the point that it was bleeding but it did leave a scar so be careful dont push to hard be gentle...its also small and light weight i have some wahl senior&#x27;s and it feels like im lifting weights by the time im done with a haircut my arm is sore lol anyways i love it and i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> Avesome! Thanks a lot! Super Great Seller! Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> They where the best until they started making this very loud noise and not cutting!</li>
            <li> I was looking for trimmers for bald headed guys and after researching serveral trimmers and because of company claim and reviews, well I am here say if you want a trimmer that will cut as claimed this is not the one.  Now I have trimmers that are useless, I was trying to get away from spending so much on razors now I have to go back to buying razors. VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I bought this one after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting to be bigger than it was, as my previous Wahl was rather bulky, but it fits perfectly in your hand and makes using it really easy.  Also, feels very sturdy and appears well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has already paid for itself, saving me three barbershop visits.  I got tired of paying someone $15 to use a number one guide.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000H7O5M0 Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer]]    I am a hairstylist. Clippers are very important tools. I use them all the time. I use the Wahl Senior and I use the Oster-T Finisher Trimmers. The Oster-T Finishers have alway had the power to clip the thickest of hair. This time I thought I would try something new.     I noticed the \\&quot;Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer\\&quot;. The Trimmer comes with 3 clip-on guards. I thought this might be nice for side burns, necklines and beards. To my surprise \\&quot;I Love Them\\&quot;. They are quite. The motor is powerful like they say. They trim very close. I think they trim closer them my Oster-T Finishers. Give them a try. The clipper would be very nice to have at home. The guards might be to short for an all over beard trim but they would be great for beveling the edges of your home haircut or beard. It would be handy to have them for maintenance before your next haircut.    Bottom line, I think you will like them.</li>
            <li> Works great and as described. Very good detailer.</li>
            <li> No lie, this is a professional grade trimmer. Takes a little tinkering to get the blade set right ( which wasn&#x27;t even close out of the box). Once adjusted this baby will zip hair off in one slow smooth pass, with or without the attachments for adjusting length. Be forwarned however, if you use it without any of the included guards for various lengths and don&#x27;t have the blade set properly it borders on being a deadly weapon, so be careful!</li>
            <li> I became aware of this when y best friend of over 10 years who has become my personal barber was lining me up a month ago.. He knew I had been in the market for a good set of clippers that could do the job of close fades and bald&#x27;s and that I had tried several differnt clippers that had often been returned to the store on the same day of purchase. Having that said - he used them on me to get a close detail on my sideburns and moustache that was equal to that of my former barber who had been cutting my hair since my freshman year of HS - 1992 - needless to say I was warned that the blades are sharp and it&#x27;s no need to have to pull or dig deep for a good cut. I found out the hard way as i did my own moustache last week for the first time and notice that a day later i cut too deep but it&#x27;s healed and I still look good. I recommend it for it&#x27;s quietness - ease of use and the close clean cut it delivers... (I REPEAT YOU DONT HAVE TO CUT HARD IT WILL DO THE WORK FOR YOU - OTHERWISE EXPECT A RED  FACE THE NEXT DAY.)  great product it&#x27;s sad it took this long to find it..</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to shaving. How ever using this gives you a perfect 5 o-clock shadow...  I use it for my face and head...</li>
            <li> Bought these after receiving an hair cut from my brother. Theses were pretty good and impressive i the clean cut and line up areas. neck and neck with my super trimmers. def. reccommended.</li>
            <li> You will not regret buying this! It&#x27;s so much lighter than my old trimmer and I&#x27;m very happy now, it&#x27;s smaller and works awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the reviews and its a good product. Its not that accurate but it gets the job done.very light weight. But seemed like the trimmer i got was used/refurbished had a couple scratches on it. But i do like the design of it. worth a buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TRIMMER!!! I used it the first time and my hairline was much sharper even before adjusting the blade to get a closer cut. This trimmer cuts stubble hair much better than the Andis T Outliner I had for a year even with proper cleaning and maintenance. The only downside is that the motor is a little bit louder than the T Outliner but noise doesn&#x27;t matter...it&#x27;s all about performance and this trimmer delivers that perfectly! It&#x27;s lightweight and compact so you can hold it in pretty much in any angle without the fear of dropping it and messing up your lines. A baby can hold this thing. Highly recommend! 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> its small and cheap, but it cuts very well, does not overheat, the blades can be adjusted to zero overlap which i have done and they are excellent. very light too.</li>
            <li> The blades were way to sharp and their dangerous to use against your skin. When trimming up the back of my neck it tore up my skin. I like that they are sharp but their a little bit to sharp. Today i will be returning them.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have these clippers in your clipper collection then you&#x27;re missing out.  With the pro tool set these clippers cut like a professional pair of clippers should.  I highly recommend these clippers over the Andis Superliners.  I returned the Superliners because they did not have the power that these have.  They are light, they don&#x27;t overheat and are very precise in cutting.  If you want that Steve Harvey shape up please add the Wahl Pro 5-Star clippers to your arsenal.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to pick a trimmer. I was disappointed by the Peanut, which I thought was supposed to be pretty good. This trimmer blows it out the water. It comes with an adjustment tool so that you can get a true zero shave. It is very quiet, light, and powerful. It makes shaving a lot quicker and my shaves are closer and cleaner looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about 3 weeks, and enjoy the shave it gives me. It&#x27;s not super quiet and I do have to go over spots at different angles to get proper length for facial hair. However given the price and the different sets of guards that come with it, I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> They are pretty sharp so be careful while using and are lightweight, but a little loud however not unexpected with such a small trimmer so overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  One reviewer said that you could adjust the cut length, but I don&#x27;t see any way to do so.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are by far the most comfortable I have ever used.  I am generally far more sensitive on the back of my neck, which requires me to use 2 different trimmers--Andis Outliners II in the front area for the sharpness and Andis Styleliners on my neck for the comfort.  Theses are the first trimmers I have encountered that I use in all areas.  Additionally, the machine is very quiet and comes with a blade adjuster.  This is truly a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use these to trim my facial hair as close as possible using no guides or guards, just the bare clippers. They really do a great job at making me have \\&quot;just enough\\&quot; growth. I personally dislike close shaving making these a good alternative for me.</li>
            <li> High quality trimmer. My husband loved it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m one of those guys who&#x27;s gone through countless battery operated trimmers to shave my head. \\&quot;Clippers\\&quot; never did a very good job but the \\&quot;trimmers\\&quot; got pretty darn close when shaving my head. Recently, after reading all the rave reviews, I tried the Wahl \\&quot;Balding Clippers\\&quot; and was thoroughly unimpressed. I was able to get closer with a $10 battery operated trimmer. So, the Wahl \\&quot;8081 5 Star Detailer\\&quot; was my next attempt at finding the perfect solution. Well, after the first use, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me compare in terms of number of days growth from razor shaving. Imagine that your head was as smooth as smooth could be because you just shaved it with a razor and shaving cream. We&#x27;ll call that \\&quot;day zero\\&quot; growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most battery operated trimmers got me into day two or three growth&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl \\&quot;Balding Clippers\\&quot; got me into about day four to five growth&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl \\&quot;8081 Detailer\\&quot; has gotten me down into that one day growth time frame. So close that my skin was actually a little irritated and I needed to put on some after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, I&#x27;d recommend giving this one a shot if you&#x27;re looking for as close to razor shaving of your head as possible (without using a razor). The \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is light weight, easy to hold, and has a long power cord.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great edger. It&#x27;s light weight but really details and lines hairlines very precisely. This clipper runs a little louder than other clippers of this type but that is the only drawback to me. I also like the fact that the blade is adjustable so you can control the closeness to the skin and avoid broken skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Wahl Trimmer for about two years. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, it still does the job well. This product is better than the cheap hair clippers you can get at CVS, WaLmart or Target. I would recommend this hair trimmer since it will last more than a year and pay for itself. Even though this are hair trimmers, I use them as hair clippers to shave my head, I like to use the attachments for it. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> One of the best trimmers for shape ups and line ups</li>
            <li> Cuts sharp lines and everything else, it does not get hot when using for more than 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I went from the Andis t-outliner to this. Everyone talked about the great reviews and how much better it is but its ok. The rotary motor doesnt do much for me other than it stays cool. But if im going to be honest, when these die on my ill probably go back to my t-outliner.</li>
            <li> I really liked this clipper.  New is nice, like a car.  After a few uses, I decided to go back to the cordless.  So I bought Wahl&#x27;s other 2 clippers with lithium ion.  Better...with no cord.  My dear friend, who also does dog grooming, needed these.  She&#x27;s absolutely in love with them.  Told me that these are far better at keeping cool and trimming around pet&#x27;s ears etc., than anything she&#x27;s had before.  And the dogs don&#x27;t mind the buzzing a bit.  So I would say if a cord bothers you, get the lithium.</li>
            <li> Works great. No issues.</li>
            <li> Clippers just came and all I can say is WOW.  From the start, I was kinda worried that I picked the wrong clippers, mainly because of its size.  But when i tested them out, I was quickly proven wrong.  I oiled the blades for first use and voila.  Got a nice shape up to my hair with ease. A must have set in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> read reviews on this trimmer and noticed there were several reviews that mentioned customers had received returned /used trimmers with hair on the trimmer blades.  I chose to order this trimmer based to reviews of the trimmer itself and hoped  i wouldnt come across the issue mentioned above.  first order I received had accesories still in plastic bag but i noticed trimmer seemd to have the issue above seemed to be in used condition and small hairs on blades also two small dings on top chrome cover I contacted Amazon and explained the issue they sent me a replacement with same issue (hairs on blades and small dings on top chrome plate) I contacted amazon once again  and was assured I would get a new replacement trimmer. well I received third replacement order and again same issue ( dings and hair on blades) to comfirm this I took a white tissue papaer and wiped the blade with it and sure enough tiny hairs on blades. seems all the trimmers are used or returned itmes and should not be listed as new! if ordering this trimmer first thing out of the box is check the blades with a white tissue and make sure youre getting what you paid for a new trimmer!</li>
            <li> Small but &amp;#34;POWERFUL&amp;#34; very sharp when &amp;#34;0 Gap&amp;#34; definately worth it.</li>
            <li> Many people are complaining about hair and rust on their units.  I did see a little bit of what people are describing, but I think it&#x27;s some sort of residue from manufacturing process. The stuff on mine rubbed right off. Someone also claimed that the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; was mannequin hair that they test these on at the factory...I can&#x27;t confirm that, but the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on mine didn&#x27;t look like human hair...looked much thinner and shinier, so I could see where that could be a reasonable misconception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I did knock this down for was that the switch feels very flimsy.  For something that looks metal and old-school like this, I was expecting a very solid metal switch that gives a nice &amp;#34;clunk&amp;#34; when flipped.  Not the case...this is a plastic switch with a lot of play, and when you switch it back and forth, you almost feel like it&#x27;s not going to lock in place.  The clippers work fine so far, so other than that, I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviews. This razor shaves very close but it will probably &#x27;nick&#x27; you.  It works great as a trimmer; with the attachments in-place. If you want to use it for a close shave, it may irritate and nick your skin.  I use it to shave my face and neck and it&#x27;s very difficult to handle.  The razor is small in your hand and even shaving slow and carefully, I find nicks when I&#x27;m done.  I never had these &#x27;problems&#x27; with the Wahl Groomsman models.  I wanted to try this model because the units with rechargeable batteries seemed to last a year or less before they simply stopped working.  After having to replace 2 or 3 in less than 2 years, I decided to try this model.  It works as described, but used as a shaver it can cause skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Overall I was satisfied with most of my purchases</li>
            <li> Very good I have two of them for the last 8 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected. Very Satisfied!</li>
            <li> use or three days a week</li>
            <li> Cool little detailer.Seems like it could be a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazingly sharp &amp; powerful.Yet,it still allows for dexterity.Further, I think it&#x27;s an asset that its corded.That should give it years of service w/o worrying about charging Batt&#x27;s or they&#x27;re inevitanble demise.</li>
            <li> Even though this thing is little, it packs a punch. Let me start by saying, I am not a professional barber nor do I cut hair.  Before purchasing this product I was using smaller personal trimmers to keep my line up somewhat sharp in between barber shop visits but they weren&#x27;t cutting it. The trimmer is small and easy to maneuver when giving yourself a lineup. I then decided to give my face a try and must admit, the results were better than expected. It doesn&#x27;t quite get as close as my Braun 7 series shaver but much closer than your base line trimmer found at most retail stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Small lightweight &#x3D; Great maneuverability and less arm fatigue&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&#x3D; Cuts quickly and effectively and blades don&#x27;t get hot&lt;br /&gt;Sharp&#x3D; Precision and close shave&lt;br /&gt;Long cord&#x3D; make it easier to reach far outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Sharp&#x3D; Not really a con but you have to be light on the skin with it or it will cut/irritate.&lt;br /&gt;Small footprint&#x3D; If it was the same weight but a little larger, hand fitment would be ideal. I have very large hands.</li>
            <li> i was in the UK when i first saw the detailer...initially, i was capitivated by the size but was more astonished by the workability....there is no gainsaying, the detailer is by far the best trimmer i have ever used..and believe me, it details just as the name implies! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I thought this beard trimmer worked good  and cut close. Be careful using on back of the neck till you get used to it. It will cut you! other than that it was a good trimmer!</li>
            <li> Yeeeeeeaaah Boooooooooy</li>
            <li> I was very excited about receiving this product after reading the reviews. However, the trimmer arrived not secured in the box , no plastic around product or box, coord not tied, a couple of small areas scratched, and the worst of it is: the blade attached to the trimmer is dirty, greasy and appears to have small amounts of someone else&#x27;s hair.  Who does that? Item returned promptly with awesome customer service from amazon, will receive product from different seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for doing line-ups on my hair and facial hair and find it very convenient. As many barbers will tell you, this particular trimmer is recommended for use on sensitive easily bruised skin. I am one of those people, and decided to buy it. It did not disappoint. Very light and small, does not get hot after 10 minutes of use like other products. I&#x27;m not sure how long you really have to use it until it heats up but it hasn&#x27;t happened with me as of yet. The blades were set perfectly out the box so I did not have to set the blades.</li>
            <li> I expected this trimmer to edge a little better. But overall it is manageable but not as close shaving as an&lt;br /&gt;actual razor blade.</li>
            <li> Well built and a quality piece of equipment. Looks like it will last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a great trimmer, this is it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took so long to go to a corded trimmer. This one is so much better than my Wahl cordless.</li>
            <li> Awful, trimmers shredded my clients neck, blade was defective and defiantly used. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because when I recieved this it was nothing like the picture and did not work. Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the trimmer. I got to know about this machine from a professional barber who used it to trim my hair. I decided to acquire one for my beard because I have a sensitive skin. It shaved close to a razor with no bumps, it&#x27;s been a week now. I highly recommend this if you have Pseudofolliculitis barbae (razor bumps). Let the hair grow out a bit before shaving it, and avoid shaving across the grain.</li>
            <li> From day 1 this shaver has done its job in a clean sharp manner. Makes grooming much easier. The blades are sharp and easy on the skin and leaves a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has nice quality and lightweight. Works great with straight line edging. The angle edging ie around the ears is not the greatest buts works fine.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper just wish I would have know they were going to send me the wide blade I prefer the regular 5 star blade specially for the designs</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the price.....</li>
            <li> I liked the Clippers i would buy again</li>
            <li> Received item and opened it to find that the device was not seated in the molded tray and askew.  The clipper guard was not on the clipper but just loose in the box. After further investigation of the devise I noticed specs of hair in the blades, which is utterly disgusting and unprofessional. I paid full price for a NEW device not full price for a USED device.  Seriously??</li>
            <li> I was turned off when I opened the box, do not have good feelings about this product being new, when I opened the package and the guarded wasn&#x27;t on, and no plastic protection film on the trimmer, blade was little rusty.</li>
            <li> Trimmers arrived in time... cut nice and sharp, but you have to b careful and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure because you will scar yourself. My only real problem was that the blades arrived misaligned, but I adjusted it so all is well.</li>
            <li> As much hype around these &amp; the peanuts, I was excited to order these in hopes of getting that laser crisp line that I love for my ceaser cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these to no one. Does not line precisely. Leaves a lot of hair on the head which will cause you to push the hair line back noticebly.  (&amp; yes even with adjusting) leaves lines on head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead &amp; went back to my 5 star razor edgers. I have these Detailers up for sale now for just $30 because I despise them so much. The only pro is, they are good for cleaning the line on a fade (really bald fading) &amp; but the guards are a joke too.</li>
            <li> I am using the Detailer for beard trimming.  I have tried at least 4 other products from different manufacturers that are designed specifically for beard trimming and they don&#x27;t work well.  The ones with the integrated vaccum are useless because the vaccum is not powerful enough to keep things clean.  You still need to clean up your space after using them.  The common beard trimmers are too big for precise trimming and the motor is not powerful enough to make trimming fast and painless.  A major irritant for me is also the fact that most manufacturers do not offer combined corded\cordless operation on their less expensive models.  You want to have the possibility to use your trimmer in corded mode for 2 reasons: First, with cordless-only trimmers, you will eventually forget to recharge it and be very frustrated if you have an important meeting or occasion that day ...  Second, manufacturers intentionally put rechargeable batteries of average quality in cordless trimmers so that after a short while they will start losing charge fast and you will buy a new unit out of frustration.    The Wahl pro Detailers are made to give professional results and stand years of daily abuse.  They are small in size but they have a powerful rotary motor that makes trimming painless, quick and precise.  They have a power cord so you will always be able to use them no matter what type of trimming you need to do.  Honestly, I have used Wahl hair clippers since I was a kid and they are built to last and operate flawlessly if you clean them after usage and you oil the blades before each trimming.  These pro models may be a little more expensive but in the end you will save yourself a lot of frustration and time.</li>
            <li> Clippers came on time and it was exactly what I expected besides its not 0 gap. You would have to adjust it on your own which I still need to learn but other than that, it is a great product!</li>
            <li> This definitely is a few steps above the cheap Wal-Mart trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past. I like that they include the oil to use on the blades and that it doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every time. I use a thumb-tac in the wall by my mirror to hang these up when I&#x27;m not using them. A few minor issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• I wish it had more attachments. I&#x27;d like something a little longer for my beard and the 1-1/2 is a little shorter than I want to be.&lt;br /&gt;• The metal on the end where the blade is reflects light from the ceiling directly onto the part of my beard I&#x27;m trying to shave, which makes it a little hard to see what I&#x27;m working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I really enjoy these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the bad: the mention blade adjustment tool and plastic storage case were not included in the packaging, nor were they listed in or on the packaging as included accessories. This has already been mentioned in other reviews as well. Disappointing but not a big deal. On to the good: the trimmers are perfect size, surprisingly quiet, very sharp, and seem to be sturdy. Other reviewers mentioned that the blades may be too sharp. I personally did not find them to be so sharp as to cut or irritate my skin. Overall, they are worth the money, I just wish they would change the listing to reflect the actual included accessories so future buyers aren&#x27;t misled.</li>
            <li> I have several reasons for giving this trimmer 3 stars. It is an okay trimmer with a decent motor and you are able to do good line ups with it.  It is small and perfect for maneuvering in tight spots.  But it has several defects for which I could not give it additional stars.  This trimmer is prone to cutting into skin.  Coming with a wide blade exacerbates the problem.  When I bought my first one it did not come with a wide blade even though it still cut into skin it didn&#x27;t do it nearly as much and with enough use I could operate it in a manner without cutting skin.  So if you&#x27;re interested in buying this trimmer it would help to buy a blade less wide which wahl can supply.  The other problem is that the bottom housing of the trimmer contains a HOOK which holds the spring that counteracts the force of the motor to make the blades move.  This hook often breaks resulting in the trimmer losing power or failing if the hook is completely broken.  I bought two of these clippers within 3 years with the same problem.  So now I&#x27;m looking to buy a more reliable clipper and if you are looking to buy something more reliable I would suggest the and is T outliner.  I used my uncle&#x27;s to do a shape up lately, it was very precise with no cutting at all (to get cut with these you really have to try hard).  I have heard of people owing T outliners for decades with no problems.  Overall this trimmer isn&#x27;t bad just be prepared to buy extra parts for maintenance if you want something that will last try the And is T outliners.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some smaller trimmer/clipers, so I would be able to get a closer and sharper trim for my beard. this was excatly what I needed. Small light weight and powerful, everyone swears I get my beard beard taped by a pro.    I would definetly recommand!    Sorry my spelling sucks lol!     Ray</li>
            <li> Small but powerful &amp; very sharp . Really like it</li>
            <li> I tried these trimmers for two weeks. I tried to zero gap them but for the life of me I could not get these to cut right. They were either biting or just not cutting close enough to get a nice crispy line up. The motor on these is very powerful, they feel really good in the had but they are useless to me if I cant get them to cut right.</li>
            <li> The Clippers work well, but none of the included red guides actually fit the product (i.e. they don&#x27;t clip on and/or stay on).</li>
            <li> This is a top of the line trimmer. Great for self-cuts as well as barbers. It stays sharp after many uses.</li>
            <li> I finally bought a better trimmer and this one is great for the price (so far). I would recommend to anyone willing to buy a good product</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic cordless beard &amp; mustache trimmer previous.  My new Wahl trimmer is much, much better.  Fast and powerful. I use it to trim both my beard and mustache.  One should be a bit careful with it however.  It is so powerful and sharp that it is easy to go a bit overboard, trimming more than originally planned.  Luckily, it all grows back in time!    I highly recommend the Wahl 8081 trimmer.</li>
            <li> works like a light saber, what ever hair you touch its gonna cut. 0 gap to the max, your gonna get a clean cut</li>
            <li> Nice peice of tool it small and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand.Light weight and cuts precisely and came exactly as it advertise by seller.Shipping speed was very much on time. I also bought another one for a friend who saw me with it and like it.Good seller to do business.</li>
            <li> It cut me the fist time I used it.</li>
            <li> After looking all over for a good quality trimmer I am happy to have finally found one. It is better than the picture- its a little hard to see in the pictures. Works great and worth the money</li>
            <li> I got this to shape up my son and myself. I love the size and the power. Just as everyone else says it&#x27;s very sharp so be careful. No complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It is small enough to hold and control but yet very powerful.</li>
            <li> This item was used. I have requested a refund. I will not order this item again.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to maintain my beard and it works very well.  It&#x27;s powerful, precise and has a long cord for ease of use.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 sets for Christmas gifts. My Brother told me he needed some really good clippers so, I went searching and reading reviews. Thanks to the previous review prior to mine they said all good things!! I keep reading and reading but countined to see only good reviews. After I recieved my clippers in the mail I opened one to just take a look, and they looked liked a Professional set of clippers!! I was impressed!!! Since I got 2 I figured I would try a set(I like to take off my sideburns and shape them up;D. After using them there was no way I was gonna give them away so, I kept them!! Me or my brother had nothing bad to say.... Also, the company I purchased from made my delivery in 2days!!</li>
            <li> Very precise. This worked great for about 5 months and then the 1 cent chinese switch broke, leaving the unit totally worthless. I know this because I hot wired the motor in the garage and the motor works great. I could visually tell you that the switch mechanism is one of the cheapest things coming out of China.  I am going to buy again and not use the switch anymore (just plug it in and leave in on position). Hopefully it last for more than a few dozen uses. Register this product and hold them to the warranty if needed. I guess I have replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers, blades seem to be holding a edge.  I have used this many times and I have not had one pulled hair yet.  I would recommend this to anyone, from beard trimming to trimming the personal areas.</li>
            <li> My son in law loves it.</li>
            <li> Solid build quality and runs strong, but it either has dull/overly sharp blades or doesn&#x27;t trim right. It pokes your skin often. This has happened since it was new.</li>
            <li> Great just use it for my beard</li>
            <li> Full disclosure I use this trimmer off label.  As a bald man this beauty allows me to keep a good looking scalp nearly as close cut as shaving while avoid the barbershop.  I have tried 3 different trimmers the Classic 76 with a 0A 1.2mm blade, the Andis T-outliner, and this model.  Short answer this is the best for my purpose, long answer to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Classic 76 cuts hair the best of the three, it&#x27;s what a professional barber would use.  If your going to fade or keep any length of hair for a flat top this is your unit.  It cuts without pulling, it is precise and it has easily interchangeable blades.  These run around $100 and will last for years.  But for a bald man trying to keep a clean look the lowest blade 0A 1.2mm is not close enough to give the nearly shaved look I prefer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis unit trimms a little closer than the Wahl but is significantly heavier and a bit unwieldy.  It works well for the indented use of cleaning around the ear etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl unit is light making it easier to use and to travel with.  A couple notes to achieve good resultsit helps to cut your hair dry and often.  If I wait more than 3 days before cutting I get a lot of pulling but if I keep it short I can maintain a very close cut with none of the inconvenience of shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review of use please provide positive feedback.</li>
            <li> I just put in my order today for these trimmers...all my clippes are nothing but wahl...i cant wait till my trimmers come in...i know they ganna be worth it due to the fact wahl been creating great clippers and trimmers since most of us was in pampers.....and with all the great reviews i see on here...i know its worth the money !!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great trimmer, this is it.  However, you get very short combs and don&#x27;t expect the other Wahl combs to fit.  I even went to a hair supplies store where all the hair dressers get their equipment and they said they didn&#x27;t have any combs to fit this model.  I was dumb and threw out the box before I realized this.  If I still had the box it would be returned.</li>
            <li> After someone took my trusty Oster clipper, I had to go searching for a replacement to handle my facial hair. I quickly found that I had endless options and had a difficult time deciding what to buy. I eventually ended up deciding that the Wahl Peanut trimmer would be a good bet, mainly based on the positive reviews it receives on Amazon and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I found the Peanut to be lacking. I used it once and went back to Amazon to find something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5-star Detailer is the better trimmer, hands down. Love the specially designed attachments that reach into difficult areas like under the nose. Does not pull hairs like the Peanut and provides a more even cut. Never trips up.. the motor has plenty of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t adjusted the blades, and it seems that these aren&#x27;t shipped with the adjustment tool anymore, but I&#x27;m sure you can still adjust it closer if you desire. There isn&#x27;t really a case included anymore either. On the positive side, though, Wahl has upgraded the blade to a wider T-shape, which was a pleasant surprise for me. This trimmer is quieter than the Peanut.. not whisper-quiet, but definitely not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design stunned me when I first opened the package. It is a truly stylish device. Great long (and thick) power cord. I highly recommend this trimmer and I&#x27;ll be returning the Peanut soon.</li>
            <li> I got this for my beard and it works perfectly.  It was in a rather empty box, rattling around, and had black tiny pieces in the blades.  I don&#x27;t know if it was returned, used or if it isn&#x27;t something left over from testing.  One star off for the raised eyebrow moment.  I wish it had a number two attachment.  I would use it for a haircut!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of andis products, I have both the Styliner II and T-Outliner and after reading many reviews on the Detailer decided to give them a try. I mainly uses the edgers to line up my hairline and shape up what little mustache and goatee I can grow. Even after adjusting the blade on the andis edgers I could never get that crisp line up. After adjusting the Detailers and giving them a go, I was thourougly impressed with the results and the blades stay much cooler as well.</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews on here stating how this product came as &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; due to various reasons. I honestly thought those reviewers were going over-the-top with a bad review, and I decided to buy it anyway expecting a brand new trimmer, wrapped in plastic-wrap and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened up the package to discover the actual trimmer wasn&#x27;t wrapped up inside the retail box. It was placed in a spot where it wasn&#x27;t suppose to go. I started having doubts and decided to look at it closer under a light to confirm my fears made from those previous reviewers I ignored, and I indeed found little flakes of facial hair all around the trimmer. Please take what I say into consideration; I don&#x27;t know what this dealer (Amazon?) is doing, but these are DEFINITELY not new. Do not buy, for your own sake (and personal hygiene).</li>
            <li> These are very good trimmers, they cut with precision and are quiet when in use, they make sharp clean cuts with no snagging or pulling of skin and or hair. The price is outstanding!</li>
            <li> I wear a bald head and only go to the barbershop every 2 weeks when I take my son.  The barber uses a straight razor which leaves the edge on my beard and side burns extra crisp.  He does the detail work and the initial balding with this model clipper and he raves about them.  I bought them on his recommendation.  I love this clipper.  I&#x27;ll still be going to the barbershop every 2 weeks.  But now on my off week, I&#x27;ll still be looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve owned 3 different models of professional grade andis clippers. This Wahl, with it&#x27;s rotary motor is top notch and half the price of some.  With these and the Wahl Balding Clipping, I&#x27;m good to go.  Good bye razor irritation and bumps.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!!!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done crispy and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american barber , licensed for over 20 years . This clipper does not come close to the outliner T-Blade clipper , number one the motor is not powerful enough . Second the blade precision is a joke when it comes to cutting 20 or more heads. The motor determines movement of the blade. For all young barbers , get 2 pair of  Outliner T- Blade clippers . One pair don&#x27;t set the blade the other adjust the blade flush . Andis  Outliner clippers have a monopoly when it comes to precisioning shape ups or edge ups.</li>
            <li> The product came to me with hair on it. I read a review b4 I bought with a guy who said he had the same issue. Thought it was a one time thing. But I guess not. I did not pay for a used trimmer and most definitely did not pay for one with hair on it. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it had been resealed in its original package.  When I opened the package I found the product to have already been used with hair still on it.  Additionally, the metal trim of the detailer was damaged with dents in it and they did not run as if new.</li>
            <li> Great! It worked well straight out of the box. I lined my beard up nice with it and it did n  ot irritate my skin. Way better than the beige edgers.</li>
            <li> It came on time. As a barber i did tweak it a little bit But it is still an awesome machine</li>
            <li> My husband has a full beard and a shaved head. He says these clippers are great for his head and face.</li>
            <li> I mean im an Andiis guy. That&#x27;s all ive had all my life. But some1 who was on the same boat as me said to try this and it will change everything. THEY WERE RIGHT. SHARPNESS I mean that&#x27;s wat you mean and the long blade helps get the corners A must buy</li>
            <li> Works as described .. a lot easier than hand tearing or cutting with scissors ..! I feel like I got what I paid for..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Trimmers for about a month now, and these are by far the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever purchased. To start, the reviewers are right on the money; they are super sharp right out of the box, so little adjusting was needed for my detailing. Definitely be gentle with lining because they will puncture the skin, but beyond that for the price Im very satisfied with the detailers. If I had to choose between these and the overly priced andis trimmers, its the Wahl detailers all day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good clipper like everybody else says. Like another reviewer I bought the peanut from Sally&#x27;s and ended up returning it. I also have a pair of Andis Styliners that work good, but are heavier and can run hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detailer stays fairly cool, is light and is so easy to use that I dropped them on the floor one day and it busted apart...broke the chrome plate off and the housing so it did not hold the blade properly.  I called WAHL and they told me to send them in to their repair shop in IL and THEY FIXED THEM FOR FREE. All I paid for is shipping one way. That was 3 years ago and they still cut strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t find that type of customer service anymore.</li>
            <li> powerful and amazing product. I will always buy wahl products because they last longer than andis and i would recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!  Basically got tired of razor shaving and having my wife pluck hairs out of the tens of bumps on my face. Got these trimmers, zero gapped them with the included tool, and they shave right nice!  Is it to the skin like a razor?  Not quite, but so close.  That&#x27;s the whole purpose tho.  Don&#x27;t cut too close so that your hairs are not causing bumps.  Spot on.  I was back to smooth skin in about two weeks.  I&#x27;m sold and would definitely purchase another pair.</li>
            <li> Finally a beard trimmer that doesn&#x27;t suck.  I realized if I want to buy a beard trimmer that isn&#x27;t some trouble prone, guaranteed to die in two years, cordless model I have to seek out one online.  I got this one and realized instantly that I was good to go.  First Made in USA.  Nice.  Second it has a power switch that isn&#x27;t some molded-in-the-plastic so I can fail soon deal.  That&#x27;s a bat switch.  If it breaks I can actually just swap it out for a new one.  And the cord looks like it would be at home on my dad&#x27;s Milwaukee Steel hammer drill from the 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Granted I bought it for longevity and right now it&#x27;s brand new.  So really all I can say is that it appears to be well-built.  Let&#x27;s see if in two years it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Must buy!!! I received this machine &amp; started using it right away! It came perfectly adjusted ! Sharp enough to get clean edges and to not cut someone.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cut hair to the grain and I found hairs on it when I unpacked it, meaning someone else had used it before me. Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> These cut sooooo close. Love them!!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and ignored them thinking that when you go to a barber his clippers are also used. But when I got the trimmer and saw the small hair particles on the machine  it did get me slightly nauseous, but what made me return the machine was when I got a nice big cut and I started to think who knows what kind of germs are on this trimmer and I&#x27;m using it on an opened wound .... back you go.</li>
            <li> Great little clipper. Nice and light. Cuts well.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional Detailer is a wonder.  It does everything I need easily and efficiently.  Question:  where can I buy the red plastic trimming guides?  I lost the 1/16th guide.</li>
            <li> These are the best trimmers i have ever purchased.People that use a clipper design that is over 40 yrs are missing out..Oh.they were &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen to the &amp;#34;haters&#x27; This is the best buy you could make. I am so amazed at how sharp and quiet they are..If you are a professional barber,&lt;br /&gt;you should upgrade to these. Wahl has out done itself..Five Stars (and more)</li>
            <li> The razor is well made. blade is sharp. Works very well. You really feel the difference as compared to one of the rechargeable razors. Combs seem a bit brittle, but that should be alright.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I must say that it is very sharp, too sharp. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t get razor bumps--so I didn&#x27;t think anything would really irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve gotten better at handling it, but it will leave your next red all over for a couple of days if you aren&#x27;t extra careful.  I appreciate its precision, but wish it was a little more user-friendly. Maybe I&#x27;ll get better with it the more I do it. Overall, it&#x27;s probably worth buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, lightweight and has an extra long cord.  Being so lightweight it&#x27;s easy to use with both hands comfortably.</li>
            <li> I really like these trimmers first pair ive bought in 5 or so years.  At first didnt want to get one that wasnt battery operated but dont mind the wire.  The do cut close and really dig them and u would to.  So fork out the cash and pick up these retro bangers!!!</li>
            <li> It is a good size, quality product, fits in your hand nicely. My barber recommended it.  You will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of clippers to detail my beard.  This product is perfect for that... crisp clean lines, and it has have never looked better.  One thing, this cutter is sharp so be careful if you are using it on your neck line or other areas.</li>
            <li> I bought my Wahl Detailer over 4 years ago and I still own it to this day. I use it for my own personal use at the house, but even my barber uses this and he loves it. Since I&#x27;ve only used mine for personal use, I didn&#x27;t have to change my blades for up to 3 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is small and compact, so it&#x27;s easy to handle. The blades are also customizable so you can move the blades up for a more up close cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  Love this product and recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a clean cut</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more durable replacement for the store bought Wahl I had. I purchased this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It trims so close, I love it! I would compare the closeness of the trim to that of one day of hair growth after having shaved my head with a razor. It feel solid, the motor is powerful and I&#x27;m glad I chose this unit.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut. Smooth sound also.</li>
            <li> I already own a pair of detailers and I am very pleased with them. I believe the equipment that you have does make the difference when it comes to cutting hair. I own 3 other types of trimmers but I always reach for my detailers. I love them so much I ordered another pair. The Wahl Detailers make my edge ups so crisp and clean. It has taken my hair cutting to another level. Be warned though these clippers are very sharp and will cut. Heavy handed barbers may need to stay away from these, BUT they are still good to have.</li>
            <li> Exceeds my expectations. I had just been through a long &amp; painful experience with battery operated trimmers that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I truly do love the 120 vac trimmer from Wahl.</li>
            <li> best trimmer out ther i got it with the new t wide blade and let me tell u i didnt have to adjust the blade or nothing not like my andis i even got the md blade and still cant cut close and sharp like the wahls its truly powerful!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it , it&#x27;s light weight , quiet , and cleans up pretty good. I would definitely buy this again !</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the other one star users warning. These came used. I thought it was odd when I opened the package and the guarded wasn&#x27;t on. At first I attributed that to the clippers boxing around the box. Then I say it. Their was human hair in the blade already. A long strand of human hair. Could from any part of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I double checked to make sure I didn&#x27;t order a used product. Indeed, it stated \\&quot;new\\&quot;. I was quite upset, seeing as now they have been pulling this stunt for a while now. So buyer beware, I&#x27;m sure after I ship this product back and get a refund that it&#x27;ll be shipped out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a picture of said hair in the blades. [...]</li>
            <li> I use these clippers to shave with and have been for about 3 yrs.now! Im still using the same blades and there just as sharp! I have to use a razor to get any closer! Great product!</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, small but does what it is supposed to. I would recommend this trimmer to others looking for a inexpensive but reliable one</li>
            <li> Good seller .. Good product ..😃</li>
            <li> Got the package was suspicious about it because some of the seals were broken opened  the trimmer box and there is hair all over it. Didn&#x27;t use them yet but very disappointed they were not new in the process of disinfecting them now</li>
            <li> bought this for my son for his birthday, he loves it and it has become the family&#x27;s tool for the men haircuts and trims.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in a 220v socket and the cable burnt. Now when i try to put it on it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8081-5star Series Detailer is perfect. I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews but I am so pleased with this product that I must. I used to take a razor to my head(OUCH).The shave was to clean for a fade plus sometimes it would leave razor marks on my head and my regular clippers would not fade. The Wahl Professional gives you that fresh fade look. I am not kidding.I would go to the barber and pay him $13plus a generous tip only to get home and not be real happy with the fade plus hair would start to grow back in one day on the faded area. Now I can give myself that fresh faded look everyday. Not only do I look better which makes me feel better but I am saving $60 a month plus valuable time. This is a truly a 5star product. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the price was right, about $40 for a $70 product. This has already paid for it self with two fades. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality product at the right price. As advertised and was exactly what I was looking for. Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> First day using it and it burned out. I&#x27;ve been using detailers for years and this product they sent me SUCKED</li>
            <li> Best Clippers I ever had. They have outlasted the most. They have been threw two deployments and still working like they are new.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money with this garbage. It skin hurts a lot</li>
            <li> Beautiful, heavy quality, comes with guards and USE THEM or you will cut into the skin.  It does a very good and clean edging and trimming job.</li>
            <li> Lasted 40 days, used it twice then it would not turn on anymore and i could not return it either. I bought and used clipper oil and the brushes but it did not matter because this is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> Very good, but gets warm.</li>
            <li> I bought it 01/27/2015 the blade does not stay in place makes  a loud noise and it pulls the hair instead  of outline the trimming. I would not  tell my friends to buy this one..  I had to buy a different kind to use as trimmer</li>
            <li> Product arrived with hair all over the blades (Supposedly new). Please and I say please, be very careful. I am carefully considering the possibility of a legal action. What if the previous user had HIV?  Please be careful.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers out there for everyday use shape ups and maintaining well groomed, a little maintenance and trimmer will last you 5-8 years of 4-6 times a week use, might need a change of blades once or twice but great machine for the value. perfect for detailing and designs. Thank you</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard down and back of my neck.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a trimmer strong enough in order to avoid the jamming of the blades, I have try several brands already with no satisfaction until now. The machine cuts beard and regular hair as well with no problems and doesn&#x27;t jam. No need to pass the blades in the same place twice. Finally I find something that really works!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a battery powered wahl trimmer which degraded  in about two years. Since all the securing tabs are made of plastic, it  looks like they lost their shape from the heat  and none of the heads would  fit securely anymore .  this  caused the trimmer to make a horrible racket ....anyway, I decided on this one due to  its great reviews and fair price.  I&#x27;m  very satisfied with my purchase. I get a very nice close shave since I set it to zero overlap. The one thing to be careful with when  it&#x27;s set to zero overlap  is the angle if the blade when it touches your face. The bottom plate has be parallel to your skin at all times or you will get \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; by the blades. It takes a couple of  shaves to develop a good technique with it but once you do it&#x27;s a great  trimmer . Make sure to put one or to drops of the blade oil on the blade and  it&#x27;ll last you many years!</li>
            <li> I will restrain myself from gushing about this product overmuch. In short--if you are fed up with the cheap, flimsy plastic products which seem to have monopolized consumer&#x27;s pool of selection for the last two generations, look no further. This trimmer is exactly what you, the Everyman, want to shave with. Solid, metal body, cast, sturdy blade covering, and thick, durable cord. I have owned this piece for over two years and have had no difficulties with it; I have not oiled it or given it any maintenance. I wrap it up and stick it in a bag after every use, and the cord hasn&#x27;t given out in the slightest. It has served me so well that if it happens to break in ten years, I have no doubt I will look to buy another one. This will outlast 4 or 5 cheap plastic units easily; $40 well spent once is better than $15 several times.    TL;DR (didn&#x27;t want to read the ramblings of an English major) --&gt; buy the s*** out of this thing because it rocks.    The *only* thing negative about this product is that I wish it came with a greater range of attachments than only the 0.5, 1, and 1.5 cm ones which are included.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good quality item, but I wanted a clipper for hair &amp; beard cutting.  This one is only for very short hair and edges.  The longest cutting guide is 1/4\\&quot;.  My fault:  I did not consider the specs and description carefully enough, so I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Received my unit a few days ago and have used it to cut both dense and sparse hair as well as line work. Let me just say I am astounded! The alignment out the box is superb. The unit is small but has a quality heft that lends a premium feel to the trimmer. The included guards are a nice bonus as well. As a previous owner of the Andis Styliner II trimmer, these are in a class above in my opinion. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use if for my head and for my beard and it works great.  Powerful and doesn&#x27;t get hot or noisy while using it.  Well built piece of equipment I plan to have for years to come. (I&#x27;ve had it for about 2yrs now)  The only thing I noticed was the blades initially were quite sharp when used alone and it would cause some skin irritation when I was detailing, but it&#x27;s not as bad now or I&#x27;m just a little more cautious.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing. I ordered them half way through my deployment to cut my hair and trim my facial hair. I was a little hesitant because I have owned several pair of trimmers and the only one got the job done was the Andis T Outliners. I have owned several Andis T outliner and all but one quit working prematurely. So, I decided to give these Wahl Professional a shot. First of all I received these in about 4 days. I tried them the same day and was really impressed. These trimmers work as good as the Andis T outliners in my opinion and the only set that I have found to compete with them too. They cut like new for the rest of the deployment (5 months) and I cut my hair at least every 2 weeks and trimmed my facial hair every week with the 1/16&amp;#34; guard.  On my way back to the states we stopped somewhere where I had to use a power converter and I didn&#x27;t know. Plugged them in and poof they were fried and didn&#x27;t work anymore. I immediately ordered another pair and had them waiting for me when I got home. My wife used these when she cut my hair and now she has a set ordered for herself to use at her salon. I have read a couple reviews where people were complaining about not receiving the 1/16&amp;#34; guard. Mine had all of the gaurds listed on the box. The 1/16&amp;#34; is labeled as 1/2. Assuming that&#x27;s what number guard it is. These are very good quality and plus they come with three guard attachments. I highly recommend these for anyone.</li>
            <li> Terrible hair clippers. Don&#x27;t cut hair.... So not sure how this product exists. Maybe some of their more expensive stuff is better but there&#x27;s a reason this one is cheap. You WILL have to buy something different. I refused to buy another wahl after getting this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> This product is high quality, very sharp and 1/2 as load as the Peanut Trimmer. Wish it came with a #2 attachment.</li>
            <li> I had an old battery powered Wahl clipper I used for many years. I always wanted a rotary clipper for a close cut and smooth operation, but held off because of the cost. Well now that I have it I am sorry I waited so long. This is a smooth clean close cut without all the noise. If it works as well as my old unit it will outlast me...My only suggestion would be for them to use a wire cord that is a little lighted gauge and more flexible. That would be a nice improvement.</li>
            <li> Trimmer arrived dead. Never made a noise. Never cut a hair. Didn&#x27;t do anything but waste my time and printer ink. Replacement of the trimmer isn&#x27;t an option for the seller NORTHEAST BEAUTY... my only option is to return for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re a busy person who&#x27;s overcommitted in your professional and personal life to the point where looming tasks begin to accumulate mass and take on dark amorphous shapes that rob you of peaceful sleep and ride you like a circus donkey in your waking hours, don&#x27;t purchase this item from NORTHEAST BEAUTY... because you might get the one I&#x27;m returning. I should probably mark it with a red dot or something.  I&#x27;m gonna go look for a sharpie.</li>
            <li> This is absolute S***!! do not purchase this trimmer... I read good reviews about it and thought, why not try it out, so I ordered it, it came on time and when I used it did not meet my expectations. The detailing isn&#x27;t very good, you have to go over it about 2-3 times, I prefer the Andis t outliner because the motor is very powerful and it cuts perfect!👌 the motor from the Wahl detailer sounds very cheap and the when you run your finger across the blades it feels rough, but with the Andis t outliner, you do the same but it feels smooth. Anyways that&#x27;s my review of the Wahl detailer, 1 out of 5 stars, thought it would be better... But no! If you want a good trimmer, get the Andis t outliner, it is a bit pricy but it&#x27;s worth it👍</li>
            <li> Best dry shave. I also use it for my kids line up. It does not hurt them like other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I used these for about a year before they stopped working on me. They got to the point where they would just not cut my hair anymore. I tried adjusting them and they just would not work the same anymore. I used to use these to shave my head bald. I tried the Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper before these which got me close to being bald but didn&#x27;t really bald my head like these clippers would. I would still have to do a few passes with these so that is why they get the 4 star review. These also don&#x27;t give as close a shave as the [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis T-Outliner Trimmer with T-Blade (04710)]] which I have found to be the best trimmer at balding my head because they will bald me in one pass and give the closest shave as possible without a razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works really well and doesn&#x27;t pinch, but I work in a barber shop and it&#x27;s the noisiest trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Sounds like a loud tattoo gun in someone&#x27;s ear.  It&#x27;s powerful and does a great job, but I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days and already am searching for a quieter trimmer.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS BASICALLY LIKE A PEN.  EASY TO HANDLE AND GIVES PRECISE CUTTING AND SHAPING.  yOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO STRUGGLE AND GO OVER THE HAIRS TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> did not realize it was 110v plugged it into  220v outlet and burnt it out .emailed whal for help getting parts to repair got no reply</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more I got it before the estimate I was really serprised excellent shape.u guys tell me look at my pic u guys say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* .* .*.*.*  all day</li>
            <li> I was trying to adjust my t-outliner blades and broke a wire that connects to the motor. Thought about ordering a new part and fixing them myself, sending them to get fixed, or buying a new pair of trimmers. Decided to go with a new pair. Did some research, watched some youtube vids and I kept hearing barbers recommend the wahl detailer. I decided to go with them, which was a great choice. I received them yesterday opened them up and tried them out on myself. There great for cutting your own hair. Light and easy to use. I didn&#x27;t even adjust them they came out the box cutting very close. If your thinking about this purchase I&#x27;m my opinion these are great and you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed. Read some reviews about ppl getting used products but mine were brand new</li>
            <li> The tee blade is good for a crisp straight line, but it also scraped and cut customers necks and cut behind ears, had more of a difficult time with children cause their skin is more tender. Will only use it on certain men.. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> They are great for line ups and cutting hair short . Best in the market so far!! You can go wrong this purchase..</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after the one I had died. I did not like the old one, but I love the new one. It is a plug-in and has no battery, works like a charm and is a joy to use. I wish the company provided better instructions since no mention is made in the instructions they sent as to how exactly to use the preset (3) trimmer add ons.</li>
            <li> These are the best beard trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I praise these to the utmost for being able to trim my incredibly thick beard.</li>
            <li> Great, Meet expectations.</li>
            <li> Work really nice and leave a clean line every time. Very light and easy to use also. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The 8081 is, by far, the best grooming accessory I&#x27;ve owned.  Powerful motor, wide blade, and precision cut make these attractive clippers a worthy addition to your grooming routine.</li>
            <li> Bought cheaper rechargeable one and it doesn&#x27;t shave as well and bogs down if hair is thick.  Spend the difference and get this the first time.</li>
            <li> best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned works well, last a long time, durable. so bought a second pair. fast ship, good price,</li>
            <li> This Wahl is perfect. I had one before but it became bad after 4 years. I found the same model on Amazon which I did not hesitate to buy because I like it!</li>
            <li> got this shape up clipper in february and its been 4 months that I have been using it. I cut my own hair and do my own shape ups and this clipper never gave me a hard time. its so precise that when you cut hair it looks like you came out of the barbershop. The T- wide blade is very helpful in cutting the corners and leaving a boxed and uncrooked shape up!! i would totally recommend this clipper to anyone whether a professional or just like me saving money on hair cuts. I give this product a 5 star. says it in its name as well. no doubt.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is fantastic I use it for line ups and even to make a line to fade it cuts through the thickest hair like butter don&#x27;t waste your time on other t outliners wahl got it right</li>
            <li> As a barber I constantly look for an edge in the latest tools. Walh came out with the detailer and claim they cut like non other. In my experience, I just couldn&#x27;t get them to do what the reviews say they can. I zero gapped them, but at this setting cut the skin on some clients. Backing up on this setting to avoid cutting the skin caused them to cut ineffective. No happy medium. I&#x27;ll stick with ANDIS trimmers from now on!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this review off saying I am 100% satisfied with this trimmer, it exceeds my needs. Its sharp right out of the box but I still adjusted the blades for an even closer trim just be careful when you  adjust the blades because with a 0 gap it&#x27;s a lot easier to cut yourself or your clients. I&#x27;ve been using Andis trimmers for the past 8 years and they are also great and powerful clippers but in my opinion the Wahl detailers are better for me because I mainly do personal grooming and they are light weight, much smaller than the andis trimmer, so it makes it a lot easier to edge yourself up. These trimmers are a lot smaller and lighter than the andis line of trimmers but the didn&#x27;t sacrifice power when producing these lightweight trimmers. To top it off theyre quiet and don&#x27;t get hot. Overall I&#x27;d recommend this trimmers to any who is seeking a sharp light weight easy to handle pair of trimmers these really get the job done with little effort whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had or used every andis trimmer and outliner out there. this trimmer was cheaper than them too. straight out the box this trimmer out performed and kicked butt. sharp lines and it refuses to get HOT. im so so happy with it</li>
            <li> I opened the box and noticed that they we used. I saw hair in the guards, and the guards were rusting. I did not buy a used pair, yet I received one.</li>
            <li> I have tried several trimmers, especifically andis. This one works much better than others.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get even warm after 15-20 minutes, the blades are sharp, and it is quiet. My skin is very sensitive and I had terrible experiances from shaving by other trimmers, but I have never had any problem with Wahl Professional 8081 and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good trimmers.  Im an African American male and I bought these to edge my hair.  It is very accurate and you can get a very nice and crisp corners on your edge.  I will definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> These Detailers cut professionally and feel awesome in my hand.  They were a great buy!</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviews here indicate, the product arrived with obvious signs of use.  There was hair in the blades, the top was starting to rust, and there were fingerprints all over the handle.  Nowhere in the product description does it suggest that the clippers are not new.  Yet the ones I received obviously were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of other good clippers out there that don&#x27;t come pre-loaded with someone else&#x27;s hair, fingerprints and rust.  So unless you want to blow 40 clams on a grimy, used trimmer, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the wahl trimmers I&#x27;ve zero gap them and they cut very good crisp lines.</li>
            <li> I have owned this trimmer for about a year before i sold them to a friend and they worked great. I would only use these for outlining and egding not for a clipper. Only reason I sold to upgrade to andis T outliner but these are a little cheaper and they work just fine. Update after some went by with the Andis T outliner I have concluded that I rather have the 5 star detailer over the andis outliner. the wahl makes sharper lines and it doesnt get hot like the andis not saying that the andis isnt a good product the wahl just seems better both are fine but recommend the Wahl 5 star.</li>
            <li> The detailers are the best trimmer that i have used it such a smooth, powerful,and sharp razor like cutting blades. I can easily do razor lines, clean up beards without the razor bumps appearing, and doing designs with such ease. Me and my clients both recommend this trimmer to any barbers new or old!!</li>
            <li> Lightweight easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> One of the sellers wrote that the black material on the blade is test fibers and oil from the Wahl factory. THIS IS UNTRUE. The set I received has black fibers in it and a coating of oil (old looking) on the blade. I CALLED THE WAHL FACTORY. The truth is that this is either not a new item or fake. Wahl says they test ALL blades before leaving the factory with white thread and all materials are brushed and cleaned before leaving. The woman I spoke to worked in manufacturing previously and said I should return this item.</li>
            <li> I owned a previous pair of these and loved them so much when the motor started to die I bought another pair.</li>
            <li> my old barber uses this detailer so i decided to get one of my own....it cuts like butter...i love it...it keeps me clean and sharp</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased: Sharp, powerful, can make precise, finite edges and trim down with larger movements. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to get that really sharp edge-up. I&#x27;ve had them for 2.5 years and use them bi-monthly and the blade is only now beginning to lose some sharpness. This is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> The box the clippers came in was taped with scotch tape. Upon opening it the clippers were used with hair still in the blade and body was pretty scratched up. Unsanitary.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, i thought it might shave a little closer, but it will do!</li>
            <li> The Wahl 8051 5 star series detailer trimmer that I receive was actually not trimmer I order. It&lt;br /&gt;was the clippers. Totally disgusted.</li>
            <li> It works great, and the battery never wears out (because it doesn&#x27;t have one!).  I got really tired of replacing my otherwise-still-functional beard trimmer every 2-4 years when the battery pooched out.  This one is small, heavy and cuts through my beard with no problems at all.  None of that pulling that you get with battery trimmers when they&#x27;re not fully charged.  Great product.</li>
            <li> One good trimmer. Have had mine for a year, very durable use it every day in my shop.</li>
            <li> After suffering through two battery powered beard trimmers I had it with cheap battery powered models and started Amazon shopping.  Settled on this Wahl and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric cord is quite long, obviously designed for professional use (i.e., a barber chair), I like the little toggle on-off switch (easy to operate), the unit is very quiet and the cutters allow very precise trimming.  This did come with a few snap-on combs, I use the 1.5&amp;#34; comb when trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can mention is the Wahl packaging, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t held immobile in the Wahl box and it got all scuffed up while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this unit from a Norelco trimmer.  Night and day.  I feel as if a veil has been lifted from my eyes.  A veil of poorly performing trimmer blades.  Although my metaphor might suck, these trimmers do not.  And when I say they don&#x27;t suck, I mean both that they work VERY well, and they do not feature the vacuum feature found on some other units.  No vacuum feature means that cut hairs fall to the ground/counter top, but that vacuum feature is not essential in my mind.  Just another bell and whistle while the core feature, the trimmer, is sub par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, long story short, this unit is amazing.  Cuts hair like butter, feels solid in the hand, and seems to be very well built.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8081 clipper does a very good job in trimming my husband&#x27;s hair and works well. I had been using a larger one and a small one and this does both jobs. We&#x27;re glad we bought it.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 4 because, the motor on it is much louder than any other trimmers I&#x27;ve experienced. They cut extremely well though, so I&#x27;m trying to over look the sound. I recommend this to someone that doesn&#x27;t mind noisy trimmers but cut very well.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks, but it works great. Very easy to operate and switch out the different attachments.</li>
            <li> These are very wonderful clippers. I&#x27;m just breaking into to the barber trade and I wanted to have the best tools. This trimmer is one of the best tools for the job.</li>
            <li> Amazing trimmer!  It hits really close. Becareful if your heavy handed and careful around sensitive areas they are very sharp.. cut really crisp</li>
            <li> Exelent product. Thanks you</li>
            <li> Dear Sir,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered several items from Amazon.com.......in every case I was very pleased. In the case involving the Wahl Clippers, I have Been very displeased.......I am a Celebrity MakeUp artist who works on high profile clients.  This job has me to stay on the road quite a bit......when I ordered with the Wahl Clippers, I was in the middle of a 3week press junket tour with my client......I was in NYC , staying at the Walorf Astoria at the time , just arriving from being in Europe for 2 weeks.....the Waldorf is where I had the clippers delivered .......being in NYC I could have very easily had gone out to purchase them , but my time would not allow me to do that, so tht is why I spent the extra money, $20 which was the overnite rush fee , to have them delivered to me .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the box, I should have know then that something was unusual because it was not fully  sealed .... The clippers also were not in plastic , the plastic that the clippers originally came in was laying beide them in the box ..... The cord was not wrapped as I see new items wrapped when you first receive them and  also the bag that the clipper attachments came in were opened and had hair on them ....... I should have sent back then , but because the the pair I had blew out while I was in Paris working, I went on and kept them.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers have been problems since I received them......when I first used them on my client after receiving them, he kept saying &amp;#34;Ouch&amp;#34; , I assumed I was pressing too hard so softened my touch , the screams continued.....I  borrowed my colleagues pair and ad no problem.....I tried them on another client and they were not as dramatic but they said the same thing...... The clippers were nicking them......aftr taking a close look at the clippers, I noticed that 2 of the teeth in the center of the blade were broken.......this is horrible because this causes the blade to cut and nick whomever I am working on....I got 3 uses out of the clippers since I got them and when I went back home , I picked up my cordless clippers , they are not as powerful but at least they don&#x27;t nick , and have been using them until I had time to write to you...... It seems as if you must have read my mind because I received this email today as I am coming home for a 4 day break , before I am back out on the road on the 4th of Sept.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Amazon , what I do about getting another pair of clippers to replace these .......I do love what these clippers have to offer, but in the state they are in , they are useless...... As a client in good standing , I feel that a new pair is the least I should get and my rush fee returned or something comparable !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derrick Rutledge</li>
            <li> I like these clippers. I&#x27;ve had them for a few months now along with my T Outliers. The T Wide is small enough and powerful enough to get those hard to reach spots with ease  such as behind the ear or beard/ mustache area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers didn&#x27;t come sharp enough as sold so I adjusted them like I all my trimmers. However these when adjusted close either cut or really irritated my skin so beware when adjusting. That&#x27;s my only caution. They stay cool much longer than my T Outliers which is great. I like the combo of the two. Overall I think anyone would be pleased to have these once you adjust the blade comfortably!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, just as advertised. Wahl seems to have consistently good products. I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> I shave my head twice a week. I have been searching for a clipper to make this process easier. For those of you that seek to use these to strictly shave your head;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When properly zero gapped, they get close. Not razor close, but as another reviewer mentioned... probably a two-day-old close.&lt;br /&gt;They will mow through your thick hair without any problem. My biggest issue with any other set that I have purchased was having to go back over my head 40 times before the clipper would not cut through my thick hair. These do not suffer that problem. If I am in a rush and am not going for perfection, I can shave my head in 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;They do get hot, it just takes MUCH longer (30+ minutes), and even when they are hot... it&#x27;s more of a warm feeling than actually being hot. Wahl chrome pro get hot, really hot. These do not reach even close to that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with them. I didn&#x27;t have to grind the blade down, and that makes my life easier.</li>
            <li> My wife and I just received the the Wahl Trimmer and ran into an odd issue we never encountered before.  This experience will definitely make us take the listed reviews to heart in our next purchases.  First off, I couldn&#x27;t believe the reviews that stated they thought they received a used product when purchasing this item from Amazon.  After-all, it is not ebay.com and most, if not all the products listed are typically new.  We really have not had any issues with Amazon.com that would imply a used product, and the issues we have had were resolved immediately by Amazon&#x27;s great costumer service.  However, like some of the reviewers suggested, we feel the product we received was utilized and/or refurbished before we got it.  Our reasons are as followed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The product&#x27;s box had dents and mild rips in it as if someone carelessly tried to open it prior,&lt;br /&gt;2) The trimmers were not positioned in the appropriate molded plastic section of the container (However, we recognized that this finding alone does not equal a used product via potential for rough shipping),&lt;br /&gt;3) The switch was already in the switch-on position (not common for a cutting product, and really caught us off guard when we plugged it in for the first time),&lt;br /&gt;4) There was half of a broken plastic tie (the type seen in clothing that attaches to a tag).  The other half was absent, and there was no tag or paperwork that would suggest the need for one.&lt;br /&gt;5)  The most disturbing part was the fact that the blades had a black lint/oil-like substance all over it and 2 brown hairs.  Now I can assume the black substance might have been the lubricating oil, but the lint-like quality and 2 hairs point to this product being used/refurbished prior to us receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this product set my wife and I off guard, it does appear to functionally work (though we only plugged it in thus far).  Even though this experience was unsettling, we are sure Amazon will rectify the problem.  It is just a shame to see products arrive in this condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a good bit of money buying trimmers capable of giving my lining definition and this is by far the best ive used, so i would recommend this product to anyone, because when it comes to hair, no one does it better than Wahl</li>
            <li> Used clippers 2x, During second use clippers just stopped working.  Of course i dont have the packaging anymore so I&#x27;m stuck with clippers that don&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Every edge up i did the customer gave me a compliment. If you want extreme detail your going to need the wahl detailers.</li>
            <li> so far is good i did my nephew haircut, its was perfect</li>
            <li> One of the best if not the best outliners. Very sharp, gets the job done right the first time.</li>
            <li> I really like these trimmers. They are better and cheaper that the Andis trimmers.</li>
            <li> Great Solid quite cut!&lt;br /&gt;Loved them so much would defitnetly recommend its lile using a pencil</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with Wahl.  Their balding clippers are excellent.  I ordered this &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; and for some reason I can&#x27;t recall right now, I thought it could be used for cutting in general.  It&#x27;s too small to be used even for edging, so the only thing it&#x27;s good for is those silly little designs people carve into their heads.</li>
            <li> Just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this detailer.  The blade is a great size and it works well so far!  No complaints or criticisms at this time.</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations.  It is not only light in weight, but it also provides a very sharply defined cut as well.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s small enough to travel with me and the guards are the right sizes for trimming the beard.</li>
            <li> I used to use &amp;#34;andes&amp;#34; brand but got tired of the same screw always coming loose, these make less noise and I&#x27;ve had NO problems since using them!!!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I feel as if I need to for this one. I keep my head bald. But I can&#x27;t use a razor because I have very sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve used countless electric shavors and clippers over the past 10 years. I can say that this trimmer works the best for me.  I use it about once every 4-5 days. The motor is relatively silent, keeps my hair very short (as close to a razor as reasonably possible), and I have not experienced any discomfort or razor bumps.  Great trimmer. I also use it to line up my beard (when I grow it out). I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.  When this motor gives out, I plan on purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Great for lineups! Be careful though, this is the sharpest blade wahl makes. Does a great job, just use a sure hand around the ears and neck.</li>
            <li> I have had bad luck with trimmers but this thing here is the truth. works great and easy to work  and is a very solid product. would have been 5 stars but did not come with case. packed very cheap but works very well. hope this helps</li>
            <li> Very happy with this! My favorite razor after buying many!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Trimmer for the first time through some recommendations from some friends. Once I received the trimmer i proceeded to open it from its box. Nice looking trimmer. Then I plug in the trimmer to the outlet and that very second I do , the trimmer explodes making a loud pop noise. The whole length of the power cord got frayed and burnt. As result I received 2nd degree burns to the inside of my fingers due to me holding the plug when I inserted it into the outlet. I am extremely upset and lucky that it wasn&#x27;t worst than it was. I DO NOT RECOMMEND the Wahl detailer trimmer to anyone. I am a license barber in the state of California and have purchased and used many different clippers and trimmers. By far this is the worst experience I have ever had with a Wahl trimmer. I strongly advise anyone and everyone to not purchase this trimmer. I hope someone contacts me about this issue. I have taken pictures of the incident I speak of.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Sharpest trimmer on market!!!!</li>
            <li> Could someone please let me know if this is good for shaping goatee&#x27;s?  I want a trimmer/groomer that can get a close (fade) look.  Please let me know if this is the best for that purpose, or if should go with something else.</li>
            <li> Date: 11.20.2013&lt;br /&gt;Went out on a limb and bought this despite all of the reviews saying they had received theirs already used. Mine also came with hair in it already (tiny black hairs) - granted not many, but clearly it was used. The box was not sealed and the product was not even in its given holding area within the carry case. Geez the guard wasnt even on the trimmer. I even bought it from one of the best reviewed sellers: NORTHEAST BEAUTY. And FULLFILLMENT WAS DONE BY AMAZON! Well this is crap! Im buying a new product, so I should be receiving a NEW product.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know what else to say. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! I WANT A REFUND!</li>
            <li> This is a trimmer designed best for shaping up your hair line. It also is great for cleaning up and lining up your beard and mustache line as well. As a black man having a trimmer that has the ability obtain these sharp clean lines is important for a fresh professional look and this trimmer does a great job. Out of the box it wasn&#x27;t adjusted just right so I took out my screwdriver and set it to zero and the lines were instantly very sharp and clean. Be careful you can cut your self easily on this setting never use the trimmer upside down or press it too hard against the skin. This trimmer fits very smoothly in the hand is is smaller compared to most other trimmers. It was delivered a day after the fastest delivery time so that wasn&#x27;t a problem either.  Another useful tip is that the 8081 5 star is the red one with the T wide blade, the other model is a black one with the standard blade so if you want the T-wide get the red 8081 if you don&#x27;t want to waste your money on another blade vice versa. This was unclear when I was searching for which one to buy and I spent probably a 1/2 an hour trying to get it straight.  Overall it doesn&#x27;t get hot, the cord is long enough and the blades are sharp, and it feels very durable. When looking for a trimmer after asking people from word of mouth, searching youtube.com, and reading reviews on here,I was stuck between this one and one of the andis series but the 40 dollar price, ease of use, smaller size, and cooler functioning made me choose this one and I don&#x27;t regret it. I would certainly recommend this trimmer to a friend.  Hope this review helps</li>
            <li> Sharp... nice little trimmer for the price. .</li>
            <li> Amazingly great clippers, great for linings, cuts close and leaves your face looking like you just got shaved with a blade.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is light, easy to manuever, powerful n sharp. Stays cool after prolong use n evern when zero gaped the sharpness doesn&#x27;t bite. N i didn&#x27;t adjust the blade to zero. Already came zeroed out the box. Great trimmer!</li>
            <li> This clipper arrived used even though it was sold as new. The lettering on the handle was worn and there was hair in the box. The guard was not on the trimmer. Absolutely unsanitary and dangerous. Really let down in Amazon on this one.</li>
            <li> This product overall is good . But keep in mind that it comes used. I found hair on it when I first received it. Was going to return it but I made sure I cleaned it very well before I used it . I mean it works fine but was just upset to the fact it was used before .</li>
            <li> Nice, sharp, my hairline is ruined in the front and I&#x27;m only 17 but I used this and its like it gave me a new line. Light weight, and small which is good for me. I do recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Product came in time doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought. Seems like there&#x27;s a weak/not strong motor.</li>
            <li> Bought it specifically to buzz my head. Does a great job and cuts very close. Its pretty small but is built very well.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected the replacement item to be as the first product i received didn&#x27;t work... The replacement item came with a rusty blade and minor scratches with little hairs still in the blade... It works good but IM guessing it is a second hand item. Thanks alot -_- for ruining my trust with you guys.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on amazon reveiws, I love my amazon reveiwers!&lt;br /&gt;Realized afterwards that this was the best price for the product too.&lt;br /&gt;The person I bought it for looks great, like they went to the barber;long and short of it it definitely is one of the best outliners.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an old no-name trimmer that I&#x27;d bought almost 10 years ago and has served me well.  Problem is that the many years were not kind to it, and I was frequently maintaining it. It also wasn&#x27;t that good at edging like it was when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer sounds less powerful, but don&#x27;t let the fairly low noise level fool you.  The trimmer is simply effective at whatever you throw at it.  In fact, at times it seems to be almost too sharp, slicing bumps open as though it were a passing thought.  As long as you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure to whatever it is you&#x27;re cutting, it should be fine though.  I also noticed that it did a decent job at shaving slightly longer body hair such as arm and leg, provided you run it &amp;#34;mow&amp;#34; style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one area I felt it fell short was with any sort of short, coarse stubble, such as that you would find just above your mustache area but below your nostrils (assuming you trim that area regularly).  In that area it not only could not cut the stubble, it actually was a bit painful to do so, no matter what direction the trimmer was held.  This isn&#x27;t such a deal breaker, and depending on the style of hair for your face, you may not even notice it.  If you have coarse, curly hair that&#x27;s a bit stiff when short, then you want to make sure you watch out for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with some guides, so you can trim down hair without cutting it completely off.  I felt that the guides were good enough but given the primary intent of the trimmer is for beards and goatees, it would have been nice to see some more granular length options here.  Again, not a dealbreaker, just an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product for a good price. It is small and should travel well.  I use this to shave my face every morning.  It shaves just close enough. If I use a regular razor, I get razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer recently and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Australia sucks for finding things like this and if you can find them.. they&#x27;re ridiculously overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;AU$125+postage is the current average price... Rip off!!&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing this from USA + a step down converter works out much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;It works as it should since it runs on a rotary motor so it&#x27;s operation isn&#x27;t affected by AU 50 Hz.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very light and sharp. These Wahl&#x27;s make sharp straight lines!!  Be careful if you try to shave back of neck with them because they are very very sharp and could irritate  or cut your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice little detailer. It&#x27;s solidly built, powerful, and not overly noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside to this is that I bought it for beard trimming, but the trimmer only includes three guide combs (1/2, 1, and 1-1/2 sizes). Wahl does *not* make any guide combs larger than this that will fit this trimmer, and as far as I&#x27;m aware there are no guide combs available from other manufacturers that will fit this detailer. I&#x27;ve also not found out whether or not you can purchase replacement guide combs for this detailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a little powerful detailer, then go for it. If you need a guide comb larger than a 1-1/2, you&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmers. Great motor that runs smooth and cool. I use it to line up one of my son&#x27;s hair and shave my other son&#x27;s whole head. Never had a complaint of getting too hot. Cuts so close it leaves my son&#x27;s head shiny. Any shorter and he&#x27;d need a razor to shave it. Good product. Just shop around to find it the cheapest, cause everyone likes a bargain. You&#x27;ll be happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is very sharp and does not choke when you are cutting hair very fast. it is very light weight and easy to handle. if it was a little more powerful it would be the best trimmer available.</li>
            <li> Bought two one for me one for my son for christmas as his old one battery one was giving up. they really work well and trim close. My sons first statement was ,\\&quot;Dad you don&#x27;t even have to use a razor!\\&quot; I like it better than my old wahl plug in and it does trim closer.</li>
            <li> Very good shape up machine very powerful and sharp will recomend to any barber lookin for a small powerful machine</li>
            <li> A bit heavy and unwieldy, but quiet for a clipper and does what we require.  At this point of usage, we would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The first time I received this item, when opened it was used already there wore hairs and scratches on it. To be nice I returned the item and requested exchange. However, the second time it was the same story I received used item ones again! Therefor I am returning it for good. Ps: those items wore both shipped from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Quiet powerful and sharp need not say more.</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers. They cut very close and are very sharp. I got these to shave my face with. they shve very close, so close I don&#x27;t have to shave for two days. I highly recommend buying a pair.</li>
            <li> 2 day shipping awesome.. light and cuts easy</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work really well and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I chose this trimmer is because it&#x27;s corded, I was tired of cordless trimmers that didn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and required frequent charging. It&#x27;s just nice to have a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t go dead while trimming.</li>
            <li> These are by far THE Best trimmers, PERIOD. Fresh out the box, light weight, strong motor, and the new T Extra Wide blade slams the competition...Got rid of my andis and babyliss pro gold titanium for these and definitely don&#x27;t miss them. My Favorite trimmer! I will never go to any other after cutting with these. I have the \\&quot;pro-set tool\\&quot; to adjust the blade, but DID NOT even use it, they are so sharp, crisp right out the box...No Lie! Check out Youtube, and even buy a set to try for yourself, you will NOT be disappointed !  youtube refs: vickthebarber, ronclassickuts</li>
            <li> Bought the wahl detailer trimmer after so many great reviews (YouTube) On the strenght that I like a crisp clean cut. Out the box I tried them wasn&#x27;t too impressed...had to touch up 2 or 3 times to sharpen my lines up. I zero-gapped them and again I tried them and maybe I got a slight improvement...again nothing impressive, the trimmers cut, have good power, light weight, easy to handle and maneuver in your hand. Good clippers to have but I&#x27;m definitely still looking for that trimmer that delivers crisp/clean lines after one touch up....keep in mind I cut my own hair I&#x27;m not a baber.</li>
            <li> Work very well to trim &amp; shape as desired.</li>
            <li> Just maintain the product and it will work just fine</li>
            <li> Wonderful trimmer. Great for trimming the ball sack!</li>
            <li> I like it, but there is a problem.  After one week of professional use, the blade has started grabbing some customers&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt; My previous trimmer, a Peanut, would last half a year before needing a blade change.  I will order another and hope this is a one time problem with this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great clippers for the price!!!</li>
            <li> These are awesome!! Very close and tight, in my opinion better than the others.</li>
            <li> This frigin thing could shave a sasquatch</li>
            <li> This item was better than I thought and it gives a great cut.  I like this product.  It was early and I have had no problems.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Efficient and meets the expectations for trimming and close shaving.</li>
            <li> Great clipper. Gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> Just purchased the Detailers and they just arrived.  A couple observations. 1) many people have been claiming they got used hair trimmers because there was hair in the blades. I pulled mine out and sure enough hair in the blades (KEEP READING). Then I noticed it was just in the tips of the blades not underneath or behind. Then I noticed the black plastic packaging with scratches. Then I noticed it isn&#x27;t hair it&#x27;s plastic shavings. I&#x27;m going out on a limb and assuming the majority of people who are claiming they got clippers with hair, probably have clippers with plastic. Also just wanted to point out these are not full size clippers. I thought they were. I&#x27;m okay with them being small just thought they were normal size. I&#x27;ll write another review after I use them. Just wanted to squash this used clippers with hair in them business right away.</li>
            <li> Have used these professionally for years couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Man these are sharp! I love these, this is what I had been looking for thanks to not wanting to commit to the initial purchase of detalilers I ended up with some other useful items such as; Andis zero gapper and promate blades for my t-outliner these however are fire looks like razor line up or pretty close to it. If these break I&#x27;m buying then over again as these are sharper than t outliner stop thinking about these and get them they are 60 at Sally but you can rest assure their new, mine looked like they had been used.</li>
            <li> i been looking for good trimmers so i been researching on line and on you tube been watching what trimmers are barbers using to get such a clean line since i am cutting mens hair all day and i saw these often so i decided to try them out. now today is the first time i have used them and compare to my osters (which i have 2 of) so far they clean really good and close to the skin makes for a nice clean line. i will need to use them longer and see how they hold up but so far im very happy with them and will  keep my other trimmers as back ups</li>
            <li> I am a barber and these work perfect. Some of the reviews I read before purchase were by non professionals that do not know how to use this tool. I recommend to other professionals. Price here was better than I could find at supply store and it came very fast!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice size, easy to handle and trims very good. But can&#x27;t use it to edge with since the blades will severely burn the skin. It leaves red welts wherever the head touches the skin.</li>
            <li> I use these mostly to trim my beard and edge the back of my head and around my ears. It is very high-quality and precise.</li>
            <li> Cut good, I train my hair and my mustache</li>
            <li> not the item in the pic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good.i really like it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  The item listed as new, but once I received the Clippers they were clearly used due to the amount of hair still in the blades!! I returned them and ordered from a different supplier.</li>
            <li> Bought this clipper on the advice of a veteran Barber, it is the best edger to me you can buy.  It keeps my edge up looking new and I have received multiple compliments from it.  Alot of people do not want to go to the Barber shop every week, so use this edge yourself up daily to go an extra week with this clipper.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. I used to use the andis T-outliners so in comparison i choose the Wahl. The 0 gap is phenomenal, right out of the package. I use these clippers at least twice a week, so of course, with cleaning and lubricant these will defintely last a long time.</li>
            <li> the trimmer itself is great...but came with hair on the blade when it was supposed to be &amp;#34;New&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> excellent, good product.</li>
            <li> Amazing detailer, I am loving it. It does what I bought it for, which is to shave my bear before I smoothing with wahl 5 star shaver. Also great for detailing my hair and my son&#x27;s hair, my son loves it to finish because it&#x27;s sharp and does not bite. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for the best clipper out there.</li>
            <li> i was dissapointed with the clipper, as soon as i plugged it in the first time to use it the fuse blew or there was a spark in it, and to return it would have costed more than the original amount because i ordered it from america and i&#x27;m living in ireland so therefore it&#x27;s just there now, haven&#x27;t been able to use it or anything, and it&#x27;s still broken.</li>
            <li> One of the best. Wished they gave more clip sizes.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price for it too. It&#x27;s fast and sharp and gets the job done... satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are very very nice quality.  I was very impressed with the quality of the material and build of this product.  They are very quiet, easy to hold, and are actually pretty fun to use.  Very powerful for their size too.  I use it to trimm my sideburns and trim some body hair as well and it is amazing!  It comes with three guards that are suitable for sideburns and cleaning around your ear.  I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best little trimmer i have used yet</li>
            <li> So far so good. Nice detailer. I can maneuver really well with these.</li>
            <li> Answer is, yes, it is worth it.  The best haircutter/razor I have ever owned.  Half the size of regular haircutters, but twice the power and versatility.  No joke.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, and gives a clean, smooth cut, that is very close and even good for sensitive skin like mine is.  I use it for cutting beards and also for cutting hair, and it works excellent for both.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going to buy a cheap/crappy one ever again.  Seriously, once I used this one the very first time, my old Remington haircutter (which was only one year old and already falling apart) went immediately into the trash can.  I&#x27;m sure you will do the same with whatever old haircutter you have if you buy this one or the TOL (most expensive) WAHL if you can afford that one, which I can&#x27;t yet but if this one ever goes out I will probably buy this one again or the Top-O-the-Line one that WAHL also makes that is about twice this cost.  Highly recommended. 9/10</li>
            <li> i cant live with out it</li>
            <li> clippers messed up less that a few months after purchasing. I do not recommend this product to be purchassed</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually better than I thought</li>
            <li> Saw the reviews before making my decision. I&#x27;ve also used an Andy&#x27;s trimmer, but they tend to get hot pretty fast. Not with the Wahl. Superb quality, as always.&lt;br /&gt;Just the best Trimmer i&#x27;ve ever bought. Worth every penny, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts as low as it can get, it&#x27;s shave-like.</li>
            <li> Ive been lookiny for a nice edger that can also lower my beard.  I was torn between this and the andis T with 3 guards.  I just shaved with it and it is amazing.  Engine is very powerful and quiet and cut to perfection.  My biggest concern before buying it was the quality of the guards.  My previous battery operated trimmer had very cheap guards that would easily break.  The guards that come with this are much thicker in person and are perfect!  I will re review thos product in 6 months to see if it still holds up</li>
            <li> Very quiet and shaved very well...  i have never felt good with shaving...  trashed others i bought previously.. Wahl products is value for money anytime</li>
            <li> My barber recommended this to me (he uses one all day long) when I complained that the cheap beard/mustache groomers were pretty much junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve been more than pleased. Sure, it&#x27;s more expensive but, in this case, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and easy to operate. And you have to be cautious when using it. I dropped it down now the toggle switch is playing, I don&#x27;t what to do.</li>
            <li> Great Buzzer.  My wife loves it too, she is a stylist.  Great compact size , not like my full size buzzer.  Great for buzzing lines in the boys hair too. Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> While unboxing this trimmer I realized it&#x27;s missing the Pro-Set tool. I look at the picture of what should be in the box and it&#x27;s not on there either. I then realize Whal has updated the Detailer to use a 1/4\\&quot; wider blade. I&#x27;m guessing this has something to do with it. I&#x27;ve done my homework on the trimmer and I was looking forward to not have to do the tedious process of \\&quot;zero gapping\\&quot; the balde for a super crisp line/close shave without cutting myslef from blade overlap.     Also I&#x27;m not sure what kind of plastic storage box this thing once came with but all I have is a flimsy plastic divider that seperates the items inside the box.    I called Wahl and the rep had no idea the the Detailer was updated.     I can&#x27;t comment on how well this trimmer works because I didn&#x27;t even bother to plug it in.</li>
            <li> I shave my head three times a week and this thing is amazing!  It is nice and light but really powerful!  Easy to clean after every shave and it comes with a small bottle of oil.  I just buy a can of air and blow it out after every use.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a cheap rechargeable 1.5 year trimmer that seems to be designed to be trashed as the battery never lasts and is not easily changed.    I use this to shave my head and beard, it shaves very very close (be careful not to press too hard or you will bleed!) and was perfectly set out of the box for minimum overlap.  I&#x27;ll probably have this for 10 years or more.  Add up 6 x $15 for the cheap ones and I am saving money.</li>
            <li> I cut hair for a living. These trimmers were either too sharp or plain defective. They cut a customer&#x27;s neck twice the second day I used them. That&#x27;s bad for business.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy from DependableResource! I would leave feedback on their seller profile but because I posted speedy delivery and removed my initial feedback, I cannot leave feedback on their page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these clippers for my hubby, they were listed as new. He went to use them today and the blades were filled with hair. DISGUSTING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could tell you about the quality of the product but we didn&#x27;t use it. I thought it more important to  warn future buyers. I&#x27;m sorry the product had to take a hit for it. Avoid DependableResource as the seller if you buy this.</li>
            <li> Try not to take it apart yourself. It has a great design ergonomic feel. Very quiet and I love the cord plugged to wall</li>
            <li> This trimmer only has 3 beard guides, and there aren&#x27;t any additional available anywhere online. I even called Wahl factory direct and they told me that they don&#x27;t make any additional guides for this trimmer. So if you only need 1/16\\&quot; - 3/16\\&quot; guides, this is perfect for you. But the guides just don&#x27;t cut it. The 3/16\\&quot; cuts too deep and shows too much skin, and the 1/16\\&quot; guide might as well not exist because it just leaves a bit of stubble. The middle guide doesn&#x27;t help much either. Decent trimmer hampered by terrible guides. I don&#x27;t know why Wahl wouldn&#x27;t invest in a few extra pieces of plastic to keep their customers happy. Going back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Solid hairliner. It gets dull in 4 months, but does the job. Extremely light... so it feels good to hold above head while shaving. Personally used to bald head.Prefer to go machine low instead of razor blade low, so as not to get razor bumps. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Bought this one for my son who was going off to college. He said it was a world&#x27;s difference from the one he used at home. He has lots of facial hair and used to hate to trim, but said he now actually enjoys trimming. He told me, \\&quot;WOW! What a difference. So I gave this one five stars from his testimony. Well worth the price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Constantly trips my bathroom outlet&#x27;s breaker, so I can&#x27;t use that outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is my fault for getting the &#x27;wide head&#x27; detailer - I wish the head was smaller to get more detailed areas. Hard to do my mustache properly with the wide head.</li>
            <li> Amazing, doesn&#x27;t get hot like other trimmers. Comfortable in my hand and i like the design compared to the Andis T-outliners</li>
            <li> These cut great THANKS</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional 8081 Didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Santiago of Chile.</li>
            <li> Work very well.  Whoever tested and packaged this product  could do a better job of removing all the test clippings.  Otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> Its almost perfect if it was a little quiter  then it would be perfect especially for the timid children that already are scared to get they hair cut. Other than that they do a great job &amp; gives that clean cut without the clippers biting...</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I have ever used. It shaves so close like a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I used this machine a few times but people kept complaining I was cutting them with the machine. I changed the blade, and it was still cutting people.</li>
            <li> Was so used to Andis Clippers, decided to take a chance and try the Wahl 5-star Detailer...and man!!!! I&#x27;ve been impressed. Gives me a really close shave and trim!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the trimmer that I received. It does a great job, and I didn;t have to pay an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> A little sharp in the beginning but with care, it really gives you a great edge. Worth the investment indeed.</li>
            <li> great for lining up my beard. still need to use the straight edge to get the sharpest line and closest shave but aint nobody got time for straight edge daily. This trimmer, however i can use daily, quickly and with very little irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl products in the past and had very good luck with them.  Very durable and well constructed.  The only con I can say about this product is the tiny toggle switch I&#x27;m not real fond of.  It feels like if you switched it too hard it would break.  A push/click or slide button would have been a better design in my opinion.  But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have had Wahl Clippers in the past but they were the kind you can get at CVS for $20. I wanted some professional T-liners that would last because the others always broke on me within a year. These are the best clippers I have ever had, I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ALWAYS STAYED WITH THE WAHL PRODUCTS, BUT MY CORDLESS CLIPPERS WERE NO MATCH FOR THIS PRODUCT... SMOOTH AND POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT ALSO.</li>
            <li> The cut is so close it tears my skin up. I took it to a barber who said it can&#x27;t be adjusted. They are unusable.</li>
            <li> These are very good clippers for shaving or shaping up your beard.  They are also very good for line-ups.  Clippers are small and lightweight, but easy to hold and do not get hot like the Andis T-Outliners.  The motor on these is powerful.  Once you adjust the blade to get even with the guard the cut will be extremely close. Almost like shaving with razor.  Highly recommmended.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done right out the box. You don&#x27;t need to be a pro to use this clipper. Very happy I got it</li>
            <li> As a pro hair stylist I use these trimmers daily, over and over. They cut clean and precise. The blade is really sharp and I don&#x27;t have them zeroed. I have a lot of elderly and children as clients, which have very sensitive necks. I would recommend these trimmers to anybody who has a beard or likes to do their own line-ups. My personal favorite trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts pretty smoothly.  Great product and shipped pretty quickly.  No issues with product and will recommend to others who cut hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent trimmer.  As an African American with ingrown hair issues, this trimmer is the perfect solution.  It cuts to the skin clean without having to worry about ingrown hairs.  It cuts, to me, as close as a razor, and does not scratch at all.  One swipe and no need to go back over the same spot twice.  I wish I had this many years ago. It would have saved me the hassles of dealing with razors and magic shave.  Not only does this trim, it can give you a total shave.  It can also be used to cut a bald head clean with no problem.  the guide works well for keeping the beard trim.  If there was a downside (not really) but it would be that this does not cut at the stubble level.  The bare blade cuts clean to the skin, then the lowest guide does not cut close to the level of stubble.  It cuts a fairly low beard.</li>
            <li> Great product, better than the andis t outliner</li>
            <li> this is by far the best clipper  l have ever purchased. It came in brand new packaging  as stated.  the rotary  motor is the best feature.</li>
            <li> I love these but they didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now to shave my head bald twice a week and trim my mustache about three times a week. It works very well and is quiet. At first it seemed small, but it fits well in my hand and the cutting edge is of adequate size. I have a larger one but it makes more noise and doesn&#x27;t cut as close. A fresh cut looks like about 1 to 2 days of stubble after a razor shave. My mother was a barber and used Wahl brand. This will be my third one in about 25 years. They last a long time. You get what you pay for this is worth the money. If I lost it or broke it by abusing it, I would buy this same one again.</li>
            <li> All good just  have to be careful tightening the screws on the outside too hard or it&#x27;ll crack the plastic part of the back of the clipper when adjusting it back together</li>
            <li> I just got it and the detailer is a decent trimmer. I am wondering how to zero gap this because when I remove the two screws holding the T-wide blade the blade does not come off the trimmer. What should I do? Are the new models not adjustable?</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even switch on the moment I opened it straight from the box. To say am disappointed would be the world&#x27;s greatest understatement. I was looking forward to a product that would work perfectly for me for a change. Am not gonna award even a single star.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine.  Very easy to use and gets all the hairs.  Gives you a sharp look when you are done.  I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post future updates.</li>
            <li> Worth the money in my book. Rechargeable trimmers never last and the power doesn&#x27;t even come close. It also comes with a &amp;#34;half&amp;#34; attachment for the perfect stubble length. Can also use the blade straight to your face if you&#x27;re careful for perfect shaping.</li>
            <li> Its small not a loud as the peanut .. but I must say I was happy with this my edge up and crispy!</li>
            <li> A real one and a real Pro on his business AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> Great product crisp sharp lines ..Everything i thought they would be 👍👌</li>
            <li> It is in the price range of your remingtons and norelcos except it is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;three more words</li>
            <li> This clipper is extremely powerful. Its lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t feel durable but only time will tell as I&#x27;ve only had them for a few weeks. They did not cut crisp straght out of the box but after I adjusted the blade and zero gapped them they cut crisp and sharp. Actually too sharp. So be careful if you zero gap them. I hear that after you break the in (use them for a while) the extra sharpness wears off. They are louder than some trimmers but its not annoying or too loud. It just sounds like the power of the motor operating. Actually they were quieter than I expected. They have a  rotary motor ( as opposed to a magnetic motor) so that&#x27;s why its going to sound different. So far I give them four stars but I think this will change (for the better) after I use them more. I&#x27;m am very pleased with these trimmers.</li>
            <li> I have used many cordless and cord shavers. I use this for my face and this is the best and closest dry shave trimmer I have ever had. Asked my barber what to get and he suggested this one which he used as well. Done with cordless!! I&#x27;ll sacrifice using a cord for a cut this clean and close. Don&#x27;t even really shave with a razor anymore because it cuts so good!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and accurate trimmers.</li>
            <li> Nice product .cheap price and fast deliver</li>
            <li> so far, so good with this.  I am liking it a lot. quiet, lightweight, cuts the hair good.</li>
            <li> i will rate for 7 star but suddenly it works only on 120v not support 220v</li>
            <li> The clippers are solid, they cut hair well, the only drawback is that they where used and sold as new. ultimately i would give them a 5 had they not been used</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, despite a good motor and perfect size for shaping and trimming, the blade has already begun to wear out. The clipper wasn&#x27;t sealed very well to begin with (not in plastic shell, just open in a closed box). I went ahead and used it, trusting the condition was good, especially since the accessories were in new packaging. I had some minor razor burn after usage, but figured the blade was just a little rough and tried to adjust. A few weeks in, and after applying some anti-rust, disinfecting clipper spray, the blade shows rust. Can&#x27;t use it anymore, and it&#x27;s too late to return. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My barber used on me and he recommend me to buy it. I&#x27;m really happy with this clippers they are super sharp.</li>
            <li> this is the most precise trimmer i have ever used. Nice and sharp very professional</li>
            <li> Mine looked brand new, smelled brand new ... the box was pristine ... but the safety cover was NOT on the trimmer.... Did anyone else experience this ?&lt;br /&gt;(it was in the box, however.... just not clipped on the trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if the distributor cleaned out all  &#x27;manufacturing protection materials&#x27; (that everyone else is describing as hairs)&lt;br /&gt;&amp; did not put the cap back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I should get a life ?  LOL</li>
            <li> probly the best edger i ever had. I cut my own hair, and this is the best one. hands down. very happy</li>
            <li> Love them, they work great &amp; just what I expected.</li>
            <li> So powerful, l like it very much!!!!....</li>
            <li> i seen soooo many reviews that said this does not irritate skin. ohh boyyyy after using this trimmer my whole face was red and itching like crazy. im guessing its because im just not use to these trimmers yet. even after all that this trimmer cutt my hair better then i expected. good product.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head and we purchased this shaver because we had had good luck with Wahl products before.  Unfortunately, not this time.  The shaver worked well, we kept it in it&#x27;s original box in our bedroom.  Within 3 months, the blade area was full of rust and it was cutting my husband to ribbons.  Works well---for a short time.  This costs too much to be a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say a lot about this little trimmer, you can read all the other reviews about it. A+  get it, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I will order this prduct again meets my needs</li>
            <li> this product does come with the t wide blade and has a very powerful motor that cuts really good and</li>
            <li> i love the product i bought, it is working very well and it came according to time given. Looking forward to buy more products when i need them,  thanks</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for beards, etc. I&#x27;m sure it would work on heads as well, but... I don&#x27;t need it there.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> great trimmer.. i been in the game over 8 years now, and this product is good, does not get hot like the andis outliners which are great trimmers too but wahl came out with a great product which is this one, very light and easy to handle. so if your looking for quality go with any of the andis outliners or wahl detailers nothing else. remember quality is were is at from all my honesty Geo the master barber ⭐</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts so good, I&#x27;m simply speechless.  No more andis trimmers for me!!  A must have for all up and coming and professional barbers!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Small lightweight cuts very close and smooth. Have yet to experience a problem with overheating during continuous use. I definitely recommend this to other barbers</li>
            <li> The ad for the clippers boasted how great they were... they are not as good as a cheaper set I purchased from Wal-Mart some time ago.  They seem dull, very noisy when they are in operation and do not provide the advertised performance. I used them twice, and put them to the side.  I am not satisfied at ALL with them! I am a part time barber, and I was looking for something that would perform better than the equipment I currently own, that is when a friend recommended I consider Amazon as a source to shop for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Marco</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Can&#x27;t beat the price for the product for 40 bucks!!! Works like a boss!! Only complain was the shipping. I was greatful for the free shipping, but took 2 and half weeks to get to Jersey!!! I would have just got the standard shipping for the extra 5 bucks if I knew. All in all awesome product of an awesome price!!!</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I really like my Wahl 5* Detailer.  Trims very nicely, has plenty of power.  Also, the trimmer has a nice weight to it, gives the impression that it really is built to last.  I bought the Detailer specifically as a beard trimmer (I don&#x27;t like to shave) and to maintain my buzzed head between trips to the barber, which this trimmer is more than capable of handling.  ***** - very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> these are the best trimmers i ever had.there so smooth n just cut with such persicion.they dont heat up at all.   very sharp out the box didnt need to set it. i do designs in my hair no problem.everyone should get these trimmers you wont be dissipointed.just like the quote \\&quot;black\\&quot; barber shops.but  i have only had them for a week now.ill update if something happens to they if not buy these trimmers.oh im a white male with thick facial hair like said i put designs in it. if that helps anyone</li>
            <li> it came broken and chipped very unhappy</li>
            <li> It made a little sound and it stopped working i think.&lt;br /&gt;I live in europe.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl 5 star detailer&lt;br /&gt;Help me out</li>
            <li> Solidly built. Love the fact it&#x27;s not made in China. Love the 3 attachments; they&#x27;re all short, so seek elsewhere if you want to leave your hair longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly bought this item for the corded plug. Batteries are a toxic poisonous mess in our waste stream. Rechargeable batteries CAN potentially make some sense to me, but only if they have a long life &amp; you can eventually replace them. However, I&#x27;m not aware of a single rechargeable trimmer or haircutter on the market that allows you to open up the casing and replace the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience for my last 2 trimmers, both rechargeable Norelco&#x27;s. Work adequately for up to 2 years, then they begin to progressively have greater difficulty holding a charge. By around its 3rd birthday you&#x27;re having to leave it plugged into the wall all the time, otherwise the motor will drag. Eventually it barely operates even when plugged in. You can completely forget taking it with you anywhere, since once unplugged and in a suitcase for a few hours you have to plug it back in for 2 or more days to get the blades to BARELY move again. At that point you&#x27;re either resigning yourself to using a weak instrument that is no longer even portable (I stubbornly did this for the last couple of years), or you&#x27;re throwing the darn thing away, since the batteries cannot be removed/replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally had to give in and start shopping for a new trimmer when even a 10 second power outage would render my Norelco useless. I was grateful to find what I needed in this Wahl (corded, short trim lengths, good quality, good reviews, and USA made).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m expecting the Wahl 8081 to last a lifetime, given the light use that I need it for (short mustache &amp; goatee trimming twice/week), and the fact that I can travel with &amp; and bang-around my ANCIENT corded Remington trimmer (which lacks adjustable cutting lengths, but still works!)</li>
            <li> Having grown tired of the cordless trimmers that seemed to always grow weak from dying batteries, I went online to find a corded option that the local stores didn&#x27;t seem to have.  I only shave/trim right next to a wall outlet anyways, and wanted one that always ran at full strength so that it didn&#x27;t pull.  I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now, and am very happy with it.  Practically maintenance-free, with guards that are at the right length for what I want.</li>
            <li> Living overseas has a disadvantage of not being able to go to a barber who knows how to give an edge up. So, after doing a little research I heard these blades were the best ones to buy to give yourself a tape up and trimming facial hair. I received the clippers with scratch marks all over the chrome and hair inside the blades. If you&#x27;re going to pass off the product as &#x27;new&#x27; at least clean the damn thing.</li>
            <li> Very  very good .&lt;br /&gt;Be careful  is very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I loved, I will recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite for edging and trimming needs. Super light, super quiet. Very precise and sharp! They never ever overheat which is the best pro!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer after buying the Wahl hero trimmer. He hero trimmer had the best, cleanest cut I&#x27;ve seen on a trimmer in my 10 years of cutting hair.  But the hero trimmers didn&#x27;t feel like they were the best quality as far as the feel of the clipper.  These look like they were better made so I decided to purchase them.  If I had bought this trimmer first I would be in love with these because they feel like its a better quality clipper, but the cut is not as good as the hero.  The hero has a fast motor which seems to give it a cleaner cut on one touch.  You could get the same look with these but it takes more touches which could cause irritation.  I think these are more similar to the andis clippers I&#x27;ve had for almost 10 years.  So this is a very good trimmer but  I would recommend the hero over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this trimmer 4 Stars only because I just received it, and like how it Looks/Feels, and how well it worked on the first use. I&#x27;ll come back give another review after some more use.</li>
            <li> Amazing, quiet motor but not lacking any power! Cuts super clean lines I love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description thoroughly enough before buying. The trimmer is small. It is about 2/3s the length of a normal trimmer. I was worried that it might feel out of balance, especially with the cord, but doesn&#x27;t feel bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;It trimmed my hair fine. It definitely details! It can give almost too close of a shave without a guard. My neck was still a little tender the next morning, but it cleared up by lunch.</li>
            <li> the are the best Liners/Detailers to purchase on the market last very long and dependable  can easily replace blades from sallys !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received a used product. Clipper had scuffs on the outside. Definately had been rebuilt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second set. I fried the first ones in Sri Lanka. The only thing better is if they came with a personal barber!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after dealing with cheaper wahl (and other brands) products. I love this trimmer! (I have an outdoorsy beard during the winter and have it shorter during the winter) It cuts very close to the skin without irritation, tugging, or slowing down through my thick beard. This has broken previous trimmers. This trimmer is small, powerful and quiet. The only reason I gave 4-star review is that I wish it had a few more guides. Overall recommendation is yes! I use this product for my beard and love it.</li>
            <li> The wahl 5 star is one of the best trimmers, it gives a crispy clean line right out the box.</li>
            <li> The item is ok is not all that like they say. It cuts your skin to much. Other than that is good.</li>
            <li> cuts closer than my Andies but quieter and very easy to grip. Only had a few months lets see how it holds up to time</li>
            <li> It was fine nothing wrong with it at all good purchase overall. The quality of the machine is top notch as well.</li>
            <li> As others have stated this item came in a used/refurbished state. There were hairs left in between the blades but the grip looked like it had been polished. I am very disappointed as there is no mention whatsoever in the product description that this item is not new. I bought from amazon and not fulfillment through a vendor, so this should not have happened.</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement for my Andis clippers and these work much better than my Andis Clippers.  I have not even adjusted the blades yet. I use to line my head and beard.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!  I love it, works&lt;br /&gt; great</li>
            <li> Product was used but sold as new.  Hair was on the blade which was very disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair. Clean cuts and works as advertised. Great addition having all the guards available for many styles of cuts.</li>
            <li> I  had the Wahl professional  2000 trimmer clipper, which was loud and did a poor  job. This Wahl Detailer cuts Afro hair quick and smooth. Great for doing lines and trim work.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this added to your set of clipping tools. I even trim my grand kids hair and wife&#x27;s hair with it.  It just gives great results.</li>
            <li> Found mines with possibly other people&#x27;s hair on it when it arrived not HAPPY !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works well for trimming my beard. It is not a set of clippers, so I&#x27;m not using it to cut long hair. I use the shortest guard for my beard length. Very sharp, very well built and plenty of power compared to my old $18 Wal-Mart battery trimmer (very lame). Pay a little extra money for the right tool.</li>
            <li> product just as description explains it &amp;#34;its a must to keep oiled and clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little trimmer that is quiet, powerful and works well with no drama or issues.  No chargers or batteries to go bad, and all the power I could want.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these trimmers earlier this year, used them for a bit when I first got them but realized that the blade was a little off on one side so I stopped using them for a while, as soon as I readjusted them myself it was all in perfect working order. These trimmers are probably THE BEST I&#x27;ve used in my hairstyling career, I would definitely recommend it to all professionals. Definitely makes the detailing and finishing of a cut look sharp and clean!</li>
            <li> Truly professional quality. Never gets hotter than warm. You really get your money&#x27;s worth at this price.</li>
            <li> This product has lived up to its name. I like the fact that it&#x27;s small, light weight and easy to handle. The motor is great to it has a powerful kick but has a low hum. You wouldn&#x27;t even know its on. The best part about these clippers is I have been able to use them to do hair art which is great for business. The detils I can produce with these sharp clippers really make the designs I create pop even before I color the design. Overall I would definitely say these clippers are a good investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful. Quite more powerful than my T outliner. And I had to adjust the blades of it because it&#x27;s so sharp right out of the box. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on people with sensitive skin unless you seriously adjust the blades</li>
            <li> great item i recomend it</li>
            <li> Best for lineups I have used many trimer but never will compare to this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and is as if it was new. The machine comes with 3 adapter perfect for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Nice set of detailers</li>
            <li> terrific till i dropped it in the toilet.  don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber, but I have been cutting my hair &amp; others for over 15 years. I&#x27;ve owned a million Andis, of course the infamous t edger which were a beast until these hit the market. If you ever owned the gray Andis edger you know...1.) The get hot very fast. 2.) They don&#x27;t come with guards 3.) They only last a lil over a year with constant usage 4.) They motor slowly gets weaker over time. These detailers don&#x27;t have any of these flaws. The best edgers on the market period!!</li>
            <li> I have had Wahl clippers for years and they are the best! I wanted a smaller version to trim my beard so it was a no Brainer to go with the made in the USA brand that had already proven its self!</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best clippers Wahl has ever made ... doesn&#x27;t get hot due to rotary motor .... very powerful ... small and easy to use especially for kids .... excellent clipper</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t upkeep the blade, now I need a new one after 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;First month was VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> This thing is smaller than you&#x27;d expect but it cuts right though my full beard like a hot knife through butter! And it&#x27;s just small enough to where you can get some really good shaping in without any hassle. It&#x27;s light and easy to operate. Powerful, yet quiet enough. I&#x27;m gonna recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought a second one of these for my father. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and it still works like new. Like many others, I&#x27;ve suffered with finding a shaving solution that wouldn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin flare up. This trimmer gives a close shave, is just the right size, and is built with quality workmanship. No more rashes or razor bumps. Extra points for the fact that it actually looks stylish.</li>
            <li> 5★ Detailers are a great set of trimmers. I used them right out the box... just oiled the blades and started trimming. No zero-gap adjustment is needed but I did it anyway. The size makes it easy to maneuver around especially when doing designs... and the motor stays cool for a good period of time. True enough every barber will tell you the Andis T-Outliners are number one but since the Detailers have come the Andis hasnt seen much action. I reccommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I saw this on you tube that was promoted by a barber. I decided to try it and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s very sharp and enables you to do close line ups. I prefer this over andis clippers. If you&#x27;re used to a regular size shaver just know that this is a tad smaller but does that job superbly</li>
            <li> Ill keep it short and simple.  The description says the clippers are new.  The wahl clipper had hair on it.  The clipper blade was scratched up too.  Disgusted by the hair.  I did get a refund, but also had my time wasted.</li>
            <li> Description said, this product \\&quot;Includes free blade adjustment tool\\&quot;. This was not included in the package...very misleading. Looks like a good product...the teeth feels very sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on the hand; easy to hold, control, and maintain. Good for edging up or shaving and all that stuff. I messed up lining up my hair. NEVER EVER CUT YOUR OWN HAIR. ugh.. Anyways, a pretty good trimmer overall. :) 4/5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for over a year and I absolutely love it. This is by far the best beard and mustache trimmer I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> Received my clippers and they have worked very nice since I have owned them for the past month.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I had been stuck using inferior electric trimmers/razors for years.  When my last one stopped working I decided to try and find one of a higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you are like me and just want to find a barber shop quality trimmer for your beard - nothing more nothing less, this is a fine choice.  It had been so long since I had a decent shave at home I had forgotten what it was like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature of this trimmer is how easily it goes through even tough facial hair like mine.  It turned what used to be a hassle (an uncomfortable one at that) to a two to three minuet pain free job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product at a good price.  Also, it does come with oil, a brush, a blade protector and three trimming guides.</li>
            <li> Just wish I knew this was made for a salon rather than home use. I love how it works, but it&#x27;s got a longer cord than I would ever need. It&#x27;s made to hang in a salon with enough length to allow a haircutter to move around. I should have bought a home unit except I wanted one that would last a long time,</li>
            <li> Does everything it promised, ear hair, mustache hair, sideburns, nose hairs, easy to handle.I would highly recommend it to any hairy male</li>
            <li> This is one the best trimmers I have ever purchased.  They work great and get the job done. I would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these that I spent almost $60 on from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. These are the exact same pair.</li>
            <li> I get ingrown hairs when I shave too close.  I&#x27;ve always used &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; to shave.  The powerful motor and wide trimmer makes shaving quick and painless.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for shaving your face, this is the main purpose i purchased it for, shaving hair on my face and body, and trimming and lining the back of my neck and tapering all around....i dont like to use razor blades because of my skin type, and electric razors that take batteries or are rechargeable just fade over time and if you use one with low power it could pull at your hair and cause pain, i dont have to worry about any of that with this, just plug it in and it has full power consistently and shaves close enough to my liking gets rid of the hairs with no tug or Pull!</li>
            <li> I had a little rust on my unit, but barely noticeable and it doesn&#x27;t impede the great trimming that the unit provides. The big benefit with this razor is it&#x27;s constant high power due to the fact that it&#x27;s not battery powered. All the units seem to be moving towards battery power but I like the reliability and professional power of this unit.</li>
            <li> Performance-wise, this is probably trimmer on the market. The stock blade is sharper than any other blade I&#x27;ve used as is. However, this is NOT a beginner tool by any means. This blade took me several attempts on several different occasions to properly zero-gap, meaning to get it to a point where it won&#x27;t break the skin and won&#x27;t compromise performance. Even so, after all that frustration, it requires a very very light touch. I probably would not recommend dragging this blade along your skin, right-side up &amp; zero-gapped, as you will probably injure your client. I&#x27;m sure this will get a little better after the breaking in period. If you are a novice, I would recommend another trimmer, probably an Andis Outliner II since the blade is a lot more manageable while zero-gapped, while still giving you a sharp line. If you have several years of experience and a light touch, I think you should try this trimmer as this blade is a HITTER out the box. However, prepare to tinker with it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Great size trimmer, perfect detailer, but so far it has been pretty bad shaving my neck as it constantly snags and pulls my skin leaving little cuts. I oiled it even further and had the same result. Blade is in alignment so it&#x27;s not a matter of the under blade sticking out past the upper protection blade. I really wanna love this, but at the moment I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Human hair all over this thing. Evidently they sold me what somebody had used. It is a health hazard. Other signs of use include chips and finger prints.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. I usually buy Andis products. These don&#x27;t get hot like Andis trimmers, they stay cool the whole time you cut and cut great.</li>
            <li> The Clipper seems to work well even though I have only used it once.  Being smaller than I expected, is a plus.</li>
            <li> An excellent trimmer...a great improvement over the battery powered drugstore versions. It is quite sharp so be reasonable and don&#x27;t rush the task. The blade adjustment tool was not included with either the first (used) trimmer sent or the second (new) one sent as the replacement. There was no problem returning the used one or receiving the replacement (two days later...thanks to Amazon rushing the shipping at no additional charge...without my asking them for the rush). The manufacturer (not the seller) is sending the tool (7-10 days). The trimmer arrived with ~zero blade overlap (as close a trim as is possible); when the tool arrives it should allow for a properly set alternative adjustment. Wahl is sending the the tool at $N/C and was quite helpful. Again, a compact, powerful, and fine performing trimmer (even the cord and the switch are of better quality). I have tougher than average facial hair growth but this trimmer doesn&#x27;t even know that it is cutting. As always, Amazon support was first rate.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these trimmers after owning an older model of Wahl Detail Trimmers and I have to agree with all of the positive reviews that this particular model has received.  My older trimmers seemed noisy and bulky in comparison to these streamline clippers that are incredibly quiet and easy to maneuver.  I like to shave my head down to a stubble once every 2 weeks and these trimmers gave me the best, most even shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced!  They were perfect for doing a little manscaping as well.&lt;br /&gt;Wished I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to purchase an upgrade; it took half the time it used to take with my old trimmers for an even better result.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful, very sharp trimmer.  I no longer dread trimming down my engineer&#x27;s goatee.  When I used even some of the top rated Li-Ion powered trimmers, I developed a psychological complex from those times when they&#x27;d slow down and snag on my thick hair, resulting in a dreadful, painful experience.  I finally bought this Wahl 8081 after reading some reviews.  Tried it the first night and it was awesome.  After trimming down to a 1.5 length and noticing the smoothest, most consistent 1.5 I had EVER seen, I removed the guard from the trimmer and sharpened up my neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is sharp--don&#x27;t bear down or you&#x27;ll get razor burn.  However, if you use it with casual, gentle pressure, you can get a shave out of this that rivals that of a Mach 3 or Fusion Pro-Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find additional guards that fit this--however, I&#x27;ve noticed they must be out there, because not only does my local Great Clips barber use a guard that happens to fit, but the local Petsmart uses an off-brand set that fit this exact trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires some maintenance...but man up and get used to it.  Most things do.</li>
            <li> i wanted a commercial clipper and after alot of research i went with this. It is compact and extremely fast... i use it every now and then and it works just fine!! never had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas for our son, who wanted a more powerful trimmer than the rechargeable ones.&lt;br /&gt;He loves this trimmer. Well worth the money so far.  Amazon had the best price and I had free shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Remington beard trimmer.  I loved my Remington beard trimmer but the battery life was terrible.  I figured I&#x27;d get a trimmer with a cord, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about batteries dying on me mid-trim anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this trimmer only comes with three guides/combs, the longest of which cut my beard so close that I was left looking like a teenager.  I figured I&#x27;d be able to find some guides/combs that fit this trimmer, but I am having a very hard time finding longer guides (.5\\&quot;, 1\\&quot;, 1.5\\&quot;) that fit this trimmer (most guides are too large).</li>
            <li> when they say sharp they don&#x27;t mean the blade well yeah it is i use it for trimming and cutting my beard when it gets long. but they mean the points of the trimmer when detailing it scraps the sh#t out of your neck haha. so worth it cause it a clean cut works very well light, powerful, and quite.</li>
            <li> I bought the 5 star because it received great reviews and I liked the way it looks but truth be told my old wahl t-edger is a superior product out the box. I did not get as clean a line so much so that I had to use a razor blade to clean up the loose hairs. I had to keep taking the blades apart and re-adjusting  them to get cleaner lines and still didn&#x27;t get as good a cut as the t-edger. The good thing about the 5 star is it never got hot after prolonged use and it&#x27;s light and fits comfortable in your hands</li>
            <li> These trimmers work extremely well. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.  I&#x27;ve been an avid Andis clipper guy but lately the Andis product quality has been going down.</li>
            <li> De tondeuse was al opengemaakt omdat de vijzen al gedraaid en beschadigd zijn.&lt;br /&gt;De tondeuse heeft ook nooit niet gewerkt, is zomaar ontploft.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This product came used. It was sealed but when I opened it i found hair on the clipper. Not cool on all levels.</li>
            <li> Tried cutting hair with this Wahl detailer but the blade pulls the hair. It takes a lot of effort to give a really clean cut. Not sharp at all. Blade is adjusted to its sharpest point but when I cut hair with it its not sharp. Very disappointed with the Wahl detailer.</li>
            <li> Planning on returning.  Does not cut evenly</li>
            <li> Works very well. There&#x27;s not much else to say except that the cord is inconvenient, but oh well. The design is good, and works better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TRIMMER!! ITS PERFECT FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS! PLEASE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW WAHL DETAILES! CHECK ON YOUTUBE OR SOMETHING!! 2cents in</li>
            <li> My job requires me to stay well groomed, but because I mostly work with creatives, I don&#x27;t have to be perfectly clean shaven. So I moved away from manual razors years ago, and have never been totally happy with an electric razor until I found this thing. Trims beard perfectly, and shaves the neck allllmost as close as an old fashioned shave with no tugging/pulling. ***Brush the blades clean after each use and add a drop of oil to the blades while running - adds 25 seconds to the shaving routine, but keeps this thing sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> would just like to say that unlike others mine came brand new in its own box no hair clipping or finger prints. I use this to shave my head and my face if I have gone more than 4 days with out shaving my face. It works very well cuts all the hair evenly. I only have to make 1 or 2 passes to cut all my hair. And most importantly to me it really is whisper quiet. More than worth the money. Would recommend to any one looking for professional grade clippers for cheap.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after several other trimmers, and have personally recommended it to all my bearded friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every 3 days to trim my beard (using a size 1). Owned it for over a year now - no issues with alignment, sharpness, noise, etc. Works like I just got it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Since it arrived I have been using everyday. I use It to line up children and adults. Its very light so you dont get tired as fast as other trimmers. So far i have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used loved it. shaves very clean my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it&#x27;s the best one Iv&#x27;e ever used.</li>
            <li> Another liner to my wahl Arsenal. Great liner but hella sharp so be very gentle. It takes time to get use to it but you&#x27;ll be stoked after the job is done.</li>
            <li> Please clean used clippers before selling them!!! Very disappointed to open a box of clippers and find someone else&#x27;s hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have gone through countless trimmers for my husband.  He has very thick and coarse facial hair and has trouble finding one that will cut through it without pulling.  He absolutely loves this trimmer.  He has nothing bad to say about it at all, and he wishes we would have found it earlier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for the last 5 months i&#x27;m in champ&#x27;s barber school in Lancaster Pa to get a barber license and they are great! Keep them lined up and the cut is crisp. I like how they don&#x27;t have weight and I can move and shape up easily. I bought another one so I can rotate the use. I recommend these wahl trimmers to anyone. Thank you for reading</li>
            <li> My husband has been cutting hair for around 17 years now he has been looking for the perfect clippers so I decided to check out my fave online site and here he is!!! He loves it</li>
            <li> Quality trimmer. Works perfectly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lighter and more reliable than multiple Andis trimmers I have owned</li>
            <li> This machine works well so far. I had a andis tliner fo almost 14years but it time for a new one but they went up in price so I decided to try this machine and Im happy with the product.</li>
            <li> these clippers are horrible i bought them and the motor power is just hella low its good for designs and cutting the front hair line but it doesnt knock off all the hair it leaves alot of stubles in the person hair. ive been cutting for 4 years and ive started with the andis t-outliners and i wanted to see if anything could match it but nothing can. buy andis t-outliner dont waste your time on this i even got the wahl detailers sharpened and still didnt do the job the corners dont hit its just hard to use it. buy andis t-outliners not this</li>
            <li> I LOVED my remington rechargeable beard trimmer with the adjustable head.  Unfortunately, the batteries are terrible. My first lasted probably 2 years or so, and my last only made it about 6 months.  So, I decided to go with a corded trimmer and am I glad I did!  This thing is incredible.  Comes with 3 different guards.  Works great for my beard and my bushy eyebrows :)  I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> My wife said this is the best thing period compared to my old ones.  Cuts great has blades you can change.  She said why didn&#x27;t I buy this while I was in Nursing school where I had to keep groomed every clinical I had so that meant hair cuts every week.  Love it works great!</li>
            <li> I only bought this because the Andis trimmers heat up way too fast and break my power outlets. These aren&#x27;t even that sharp on the beard either. I&#x27;ll save these to clean up my neck or if i need to trim my neckline but other than that, not good for shapeups unless you want to push your hairline back.</li>
            <li> Already broken after about 1.5 months of professional use! Don&#x27;t buy from American Fragrance and Cosmetic Company.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my son. When we finally opened it, the protective guard was not on the trimmer, instead it was rattling around in the bottom of the box. The trimmer had dug into the plastic inside of the box and had all kinds of plastic bits in the teeth of the blade. There is a cut out in the plastic for the trimmer to sit in But wait... it gets worse! The blade was scratched up, the lettering on the trimmer that says &amp;#34;Detailer&amp;#34; was faded in spots, there were scratches on the body, AND someone else&#x27;s hair inside of it! Why not plug it in and see if it even works? When turned on the motor started strong, 10 seconds later it lost a good bit of power, then another 10 seconds go by and it regains power, then loses power, going back and forth. There must&#x27;ve been some kind of short or the motor was dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was bought as a present for someone else it wasn&#x27;t opened until after the return period was over. Luckily Amazon has top notch customer service and sent out a shipping label after hearing about this. It was purchased from a 3rd party seller! After doing some research I see this is very common! I hope they are penalized for selling used personal hygiene products as new!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item before, however after ordering from Jaurasee, fulfilled by Amazon, the item was noticeably different  in performance. I have a light hand and usually have no need to adjust trimmers or clippers, however this item caused Razor Burns with each use, I eventually got frustrated and opted to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the model I received was a dud or if this product has somehow changed overall, nonetheless, this experience has me shopping for an alternate trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good detailer but don&#x27;t last for long considering the price. I would get something else. Perhaps Andis. Mine started to bite I tried to adjust blades and all just look into something else if you want to use it for long term.</li>
            <li> I have some acne and shaving only makes it worse. Using the Wahl I can get pretty close to what shaving looks like and in some parts of my face it actually feels like a smooth shave without the acne afterwards. I don&#x27;t think people would be able to tell the difference between this and a shave, at the worst they&#x27;ll think you have a 5&#x27;o clock shadow which is still professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clippers are really sharp and you&#x27;ll need to adjust them. Even when they&#x27;re adjusted it takes a bit of practice to not get a bunch of cuts but it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end. I dropped it once and had to adjust it by loosening some screws and pushing against a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t get this for trimming since the 3 clipper guards are all really short, I&#x27;d say the biggest is 1/4 a penny</li>
            <li> I love these detailers. I like how light they are and the noise reduction that it has especially when linking up around the ear. You don&#x27;t want a loud t-liners all in your customers ear. Cuts sharp as well!!</li>
            <li> I use it to shave my head.  It has consistently given me a close even shave for two years now.  All the other trimmers that I had previously owned survived for maybe 1 year.  This one has outlasted them and if it dies I will more than likely purchase another one of the same.  I like the couple of attachments that come with it.  Good for keeping the facial hair trimmed and neat, also if I don&#x27;t want to take the hair on my head all the way down to the skin.  I do use it without the attachments too.  I love how close the shave is!  So far this is my favorite trimmer to date.  Great price too.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer! Cuts close without irritating the skin. Nice and powerful</li>
            <li> Very smooth for lining, NOT for shaving though. That&#x27;s why I also purchased the Hero. I got them both at the same time. These Detailers lines you up without pressure, very precise right out of the box. The Hero I had to zero gap with the tool it comes with. Recommendation!! Buy both. Detailer and Hero. The Detailers are too wide (T-Liners) to edge clean curves. The Hero excels with that but they are a lot sharper and require a little pressure unlike the Detailers. Both clippers have powerful motors. I RETIRED MY ANDIS, they don&#x27;t measure up anymore</li>
            <li> Very sharp and true.  Gives a close professional cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT a professional hair dresser,just started to hair my own hair recently. And I absolutely love this clipper. It&#x27;s small but yet is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best trimmer I have ever owned, and I have owned many! I use it with no attachments on my face  for the &amp;#34;stubble-look&amp;#34; and with one of the attachments for the &amp;#34;buzzed-look&amp;#34; on my head.  I doubt I could have found a better unit and I searched a very long time as i was tired of cheap, rechargeable trimmers. This is a smooth, quite, and HIGH QUALITY unit!</li>
            <li> this is a workhourse of a trimmer.  i&#x27;ve had it about a year and it is still performing flawlessly.  fits in the hand well.  long cord.</li>
            <li> Great investment of $40..Sharp..this is what I use for home...get it...u won&#x27;t Regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I like Wahl products but this item is too small to cut hair nicely, especially the fine hair of my 90 y/o father. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just what the Doctor ordered;&lt;br /&gt;Just what the Doctor needed;&lt;br /&gt;Just what the Doctor received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received quickly and in good packaged condition.&lt;br /&gt;Product was NEW and UNUSED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it reportedly does or doesn&#x27;t and whether it is liked or disliked comments&lt;br /&gt;did not effect my decision to purchase. When the booking agents call I need to&lt;br /&gt;haul. This trimmer provides me the ability to perform a quick and neat trim to&lt;br /&gt;correspond with the particular booking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i.e.: Mikey tried it, Mikey liked it.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that continues to make me a very satisfied customer. My old trimmer was a cheap battery powered one that lasted about four uses before the batteries died. The Wahl delivers a very nice cut that is easy to control. My only complaint is that the long cutting surface makes it a little challenging to trim my upper lip. I highly recommend this product to anyone, and will buy another one in the event that my current on wears out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head ever since I joined the US Army in 2005, I&#x27;ve gone through countless numbers of balding clippers and this one is by far the best. Close shave every time and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot 100 times to make sure the hair is all the same length, so close in fact you can use it to shave your face without any irritation. If your a bald guy like me get this shaver, the rotary motor is so much better than the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Style liner 2 are better</li>
            <li> The best t liners money can buy. that&#x27;s all I purchase is wahl</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to shave my face instead of using a straight razor. This works amazing and shaves so close. I think this is better than any face shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Works well for my dad..</li>
            <li> A quality trimmer at a good price. I&#x27;ve used it for several months now and get good results when cutting my own hair. I have no issues of overheating and it trims well around my ears.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they have to be set because they don&#x27;t come factory sharp enough but once you set it right, my friends they hit so so hard I mean that hair is getting sliced edge ups look clean, but you have to set them right if you can&#x27;t set them yourself and if you don&#x27;t know anyone can set them for you don&#x27;t buy them</li>
            <li> Amazing seller and product!!! fast shipping, no defects and amazing quality</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son after many different corded/cordless shavers did not do the job for him. I was so tired of investing in shavers that didn&#x27;t work. I have a wahl professional for my dogs and it worked great so I thought let me try this. Next time he stopped by he looked so handsome with a 5 o&#x27;clock trimmed shadow! First time in years I have seen his face. The other shavers would irritate his skin so bad he eventually quit shaving. FINALLY ONE THAT WORKS, WE ARE BOTH HAPPY, LOL</li>
            <li> You know how you discover something and you hate that you wished you could have found out about it a long time ago? These clippers are the best! Needed these forever! Just as other reviewers state they are sharp out the box... that&#x27;s NO LIE! I&#x27;m a black male and I purchased these mainly to shape and line up my beard. I wanted that professional sharp lineup and boy these delivered EXACTLY what I was looking for! I was pretty decent at lining up my beard before with a pair of Andis clippers and now since I have these I&#x27;m able to step up my game! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very handy, easy to use, weighs almost nothing. Easy on the hand, quiet as ever. Just haven&#x27;t been able to adjust the blades to give me that perfect cut</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good .. Best I got so far...</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. It is so good I would even recommend it to an employer or family member (you know how much is on the line there). I am an African-American and the shave I get from this product is exquisite. As it has sharp blades and it does not get hot in your hands. A must buy!</li>
            <li> I bought these trimmers September 2012. They were great until they died 7 months later. I love how close they cut hair and they are quiet. I used them once a week to trim my neck and head so I know they weren&#x27;t over worked. I kept them oiled and clean. Then one day after being in use for about 2 mins I heard a small \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound come from them and they worked nevermore. Thank God I had another set of clippers so I could finish the job.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are my main trimmers. I love how light they are. they dont heat up as quick as andis and they cut even smoother. but be careful when adjusting screws. you will crack the back panel</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son for a trimmer, says he uses them to even shave as they do such a great job.</li>
            <li> Newest version with T-Wide blade. Feel nice in the hand. Easily controlled, adjustable and sharp. You will have these in your kit forever.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  He has very sensitive skin and coarse hair so using a razor to shave his face was always a problem.  Now he is able to use this trimmer without any issues and it cuts so close to the skin you would never even know that he didn’t use a razor.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best dam liners out there period, Andis don&#x27;t have nothing on these</li>
            <li> Picked this up after I dropped my Wahl clippers on the hard tile.  My first reaction when I opened the box was &#x27;this thing is small!&#x27;.  It&#x27;s a lot smaller than your standard hair clippers- which i had primarily to trim my beard.  I had been looking at several models but chose this one because I wanted it for the same reason as my old clipper set, simply to trim my beard and line out the back of my hair line.  This one comes with three attachments, a small brush, and a small oil container.  As soon as i got it, turned it on and tried it out.  Sure enough, it does the job well.  No complaints.  Would i buy it again, YES.  would i recommend, YES.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the family barber.</li>
            <li> This was better than my Wahl Peanut. It has a strong motor, cuts easily, and has a wide blade which is great because i use it for my whole head. The peanut lasted about a year so i am hoping that this product will do better.</li>
            <li> I just received the clippers today and did not get to enjoy them because they had hair on them and looked used i have put in my return and a replacement if the new ones come in the same i will be returning for the full refund not happy at the moment.</li>
            <li> My favorite trimmers! Hits well and with the wide t blade it clean corners with ease. Great investment</li>
            <li> Forget the negative comments these clippers are the best i have ever purchased. Ive been cutting hair for 14 years and these are again the best. Came out of the box cutting close but not to close. Perfect cut love them..</li>
            <li> Came used and motor is messed up like its been dropped a couple of times. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Shave my head with it... No problems in 2 years I&#x27;ve owned it.  Beats Andis hands down!</li>
            <li> Excellent product was for a present and my nephew lives it</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband he was so happy. These clippers are super sharp and leave a nice crisp haircut. My husband loves to edge up with these cause they leave a crisp line as well.</li>
            <li> Good for trimming but is limited if you are cutting your entire beard. I like the compact design and the fact that it does a good job cutting a straight edge.</li>
            <li> They suck...don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Just got the Clippers today. Haven&#x27;t had a lineup in 2 months..... this clipper cuts beautifully. I swear, I feel like my barber is rendered useless  now (especially with their recent price hike). I had a pair of some Andis t outline II&#x27;s but they were alright, but you would need a barbers blade (and that thing is tough to use on yourself).</li>
            <li> I wanted to get this clipper to add to my trimmer collection, I have the Wahl hero and about 3 pairs of Andis They come pretty close to zero gaped out of the box, might need some adjusting to get a close crisp lining. The motor is not as strong as the Wahl hero, however the  problem with the Wahl hero is the design makes it difficult to line the front of your hair because the gold part in the front will hit your forehead before the actual blade. The Detailer does not have that, so it is pretty easy to line yourself up, but it is not as strong as other trimmers when it comes to motor speed. Overall within my collection I won&#x27;t call it my go-to clipper but it  is one that will get the job done... If I was looking for trimmers for the first time this would not be my first choice, but it will work.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loved is gift.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very well constructed, it feels natural in the hand and you don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting a nob to stop it from making that lowed buzzing sound trimmers usually make.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;I had to adjust the blade a little, but that is always expected on a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying (and eventually throwing away) rechargeable beard trimmers that don&#x27;t cut that well, and then die after 2 years. For about the same cost, I bought this one and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the cut is extremely good and smooth. I used the smallest attachment (I think it&#x27;s 1/16\\&quot;) and it&#x27;s perfect for a beard trim. Much much better than the cheapie Wahl I used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery running low. Full power, all the time. Long cord too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it to trim my sideburns a bit too--really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure if I need a shaver for travel, I&#x27;ll get a $10 cheapie that runs on AA batteries and call it a day. But for daily use, this is it.</li>
            <li> Love these! Very powerful and can cut my entire head with them.</li>
            <li> Love this detailed liners. And also, if you need a touch-up, these liners are it. It&#x27;s a 5-star series fro a reason. Great job Wahl.</li>
            <li> Really feel this was used or returned or something. Box was not secured and guard was not on blade.  Been doing hair for 19 years its easy to tell when things are not brand new.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good and the price was decent.  Louder than I thought it would be but oh well...still works good.</li>
            <li> I have owned several sets of clippers over the past 15 years and these are by far the best from a cut standpoint.  I ware a short beard and a bald head. These clippers are good for managing both my beard&#x27;s edge/line and with the guide that it comes with I can keep it cut low and close to my face. Again great for cutting bald too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional barber but you would think with the results from the Whal 8081 that I went to one.</li>
            <li> These are the best liners when it comes to clean lines. I really got my moneys worth. Im happy with them and this will def keep me out of the barbers chair a little while longer.</li>
            <li> Loud and the human color looks pretty bad, cuts pretty well, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I tried all the battery-powered trimmers. After buying this, I&#x27;ll never do so again. this is up to wahl standards. the rechargables are definitely not. I&#x27;ve been through five rechargables in the last four  years, all Wahl. This cuts closer, cleaner with less pull. this will go alongside the Wahl Hair clippers I&#x27;ve had for over 30 years. UPDATE - 2017/2/19: After using the earlier model for quite some time and getting it wet many, many times, it finally went &#x27;poof&#x27; and shorted out. It did so quite smoothly and that attests to the safety of this model. So I ordered a new one and I must say they have improved the model 8081 tremendously. I can now safely hold it against my skin from nearly any angle and it cuts without scratching. It still cuts close, though very slightly less close as compared to the earlier iteration of the  8081.</li>
            <li> perfect for what i need, zero gap it if you own one</li>
            <li> not as sharp as the andis t outliner. i was hopeing it would be. i zero gapped it but no luck.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my hair short as I am balding, but unfortunately I have to either go for the 1.0 guard comb or no guard comb because the 1/2 guard comb arrived damaged and unusable.  Unfortunately the ideal length for me would be somewhere in between, ie. the 1/2 guard comb, but alas like I said it is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have looked online to find a replacement 1/2 comb which I believe is 1/16th of an inch, but to no avail and so I am left extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I usually use trimmers to shave my face instead of using a razor and shaving cream. It&#x27;s awesome! I don&#x27;t have to pass it across my face too many times to remove the hair. The best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve bought in a while...</li>
            <li> I love it, my line-up is more define. First time, in my life I am satisfy with a professional trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I had a line-up in a barber shop. I will definitely encourage everybody to get this product, it is light weight, much better than  Andis professional trimmer. I guarantee you, you won&#x27;t regret your purchase, trust me! it is worth it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this set by far tops the competition. The cut razor sharp and the most important thing... THEY DON&#x27;T GET HOT! The rotary motor makes all the difference. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 different andis trimmers and this by far blows it out of the water. From the first time you power it on, no adjustment to the blade is needed unless you want an even sharper line that will sacrifice cutting the skin. Also it is very good for shaving your face and getting a nice close shave without irritation. Overall an amazing trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect tool for a good new look</li>
            <li> Careful of the power and sharpness</li>
            <li> Very sharp straight out the box. Loud by default. Adjustments May make it quieter. My go to for crispy line ups , &amp;&amp; balding. - barber student. Blows my andis styleliner 2s outta the water</li>
            <li> Nice trimmers small and unique doesn&#x27;t get hot. A must if your a Barber, Stylist, or just cutting your hair.</li>
            <li> Work well, just a little small for my hands. But a good product and I did not send them back. Strong smooth motor.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE!! FAST SHIPPING!! VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use.  Good shape up clippers but you have to be careful because they are very sharp.  If you have used Andi&#x27;s trimmers in the past, the Wahl will take some time getting use to.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer to replace my student-issued Wahl from hair school. This thing is nice! Very accurate. The T blade makes detail work around the ears much easier. An unexpected bonus: it looks great. As always, clean and oil before and after each use and it will treat you right for a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair.  My hair is thinner now than before.  The previous trimmer was a corded, Wahl Peanut.  My wife liked the size and ease with which the Peanut cut and trimmed my hair.  She was concerned that this Wahl Pro 8081 might be too bulky and heavy to handle.  To her suprise, this Wahl Pro 8081 was a good replacement for the Peanut.  I chose this Wahl Pro 8081 over another Peanut due to the poor reviews that I had read by people who had recently purchased ANOTHER Peanut.</li>
            <li> No complaints, this thing is every thing I expected. Seems to be built alot better then the lower end versions that I&#x27;ve bought and broken over the years. Worth the extra 20 bucks for a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I have been using the chi shrimp and wahl peanut for 4 years. Just switched to this and can&#x27;t believe how much closer and how much quieter this is!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Wahl detailer not knowing what to expect, whether it was going to be used or be damaged and it was neither of these things. I received a brand New item, no fingerprints, and these things cut like butter right out of the box. Excellent shipping, arrived early. Do not hesitate to do business with these guys ! I also got Lime Sec and that is a great complimentary sent for the summer months. Smelling it raw, it smells like cleaner. Let it air out a bit and u will understand. Overall A++++++++++++ service A++++++++++ shipping</li>
            <li> The Berret trimmer used to be my favorite. I spent the money on the Wahl Super trimmer thinking I would get the best and because I could have the hair tattoo attachment. Price does not always mean quality and my Super trimmer has been the worst purchase. This Detailer trimmer that I just bought is AWESOME!!!!!! So worth the money. It gives such a clean finish to hairlines and makes edging really easy. The only downfall persay is that it isn&#x27;t cordless but at least you don&#x27;t have to worry about a tool not keeping its charge. It&#x27;s easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> As a pro barbar these cut nice and close/ Excellent prof&#x3D;duct by Wahl. Still using in 9/2014</li>
            <li> Nice shape-up clippers.</li>
            <li> RUSTING BLADES HORRIBLE.  I bought this as an early Christmas gift to my husband since he always wanted one.  Imagine the horror and disappointing look on our faces when the item was opened to discover that the blade was rusting. I NEED A REPLACEMENT  with SHINNY BLADES not this.</li>
            <li> Not what expected, needs to be put on zero overlap</li>
            <li> These are very lightweight, not what I was used to and the blade knicked a client the first day, had to adjust they work fine now but I think I&#x27;ll buy trimmer like I used to have and keep these for back up.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed hairstylist, and in the past I have only used Andis trimmers. With the Andis trimmers it doesn&#x27;t get as close, you could always see the hair left over no matter how many times you go over it. First time use with these there so close cut! Leave no hair left over BEST TRIMMERS EVER! T liner is also amazing for trimming around the ear and when lining up the hairline it makes it a easier crisp line. I would recommend these trimmer to any hairstylist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your familiar with Oster clippers this blade gets the equivalent as low as a 00000 blade which is lowest you can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Small convenient Powerful clipper very impressive</li>
            <li> Does the job and gives me a clean line up with little to no razor bumps with proper care and technique. Still using it and have not had an issue yet. This will save you lots of money from going to the barber.</li>
            <li> Having had the trouble free experience of owning the previous version of this trimmer for approximately 7 years before it &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;, the decision to purchase this newer version was a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;One notable difference between the 2 is the absence of a blade adjustment tool from the box. The blade on this trimmer is wider than that of the previous 1, and comes zero gapped out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cutting is concerned.... Shaves closer and even more comfortably so than the previous trimmer and I can unreservedly recommend this fantastic trimmer. Don&#x27;t waste time, get yours today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months, very satisfied.  Cuts very close to scalp.  Not a shave but more like 1-2 days of stubble left behind.  It is lite and handles easily.  No cuts or nicks.  Use also for trimming beard.  Have already made up for cost by eliminating my barber.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Hello.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased from you sample machine:&lt;br /&gt;Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;And when I plugged it into electricity is simply not working and how hard I tried it did not respond.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the product made me ask Lhhilfo the new business due to failure.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This is best....I like the product and it works great than most of the machines I have used and I believe you will enjoy it...too</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good set of clippers to shave with. These are it. Shaves close without giving razor burn, and  ingrown hairs days later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American male in college and have been cutting  my hair and others&#x27; hair for years now, always used Andis or Oster trimmers. Used these Wahl trimmers right out of the box with no adjustment and have no doubt that I will continue to use these from here on out. Precision lines, very close cut, and come with 3 clip on guards for fading. Perfect product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased these clippers and they appeared used and they were chipped I over looked the fact that they looked used cleaned them and proceeded to give my self a lign up and to my dismay I cut myself or say scratched my skin now I have dark scars at hairline smdh .. What I did was go to my local beauty supply store and purchased replacement blades .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white guy using this mainly for trimming my beard. I was running into emergency situations where I had to shave but the batteries in my rechargeable trimmer would be dead. I needed a corded trimmer so it was between this and the Andis trimmer. The build quality on this one seemed a bit better so I purchased it. It&#x27;s small but very solid. It does vibrate a little bit. My main concern is it falling on the floor since there&#x27;s no grip or ridges, just smooth surface. It does a fairly good job trimming the beard. If you want it real close you might have to adjust the blade.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new trimmer for facial hair and tired of the problems with rechargeables units. The price was right and it works well. I would have preferred a narrower cutting head, the cord is unnecessarily heavy duty for the size of the motor and stiff and it came with a duplicate 1 1/2 comb instead of the full complement, otherwise nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> keeps me nice and trim!</li>
            <li> Best clippers!!! my girlfriend is a beautician and i was tired of her hurting my neck. with these its always smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I just received my trimmers yesterday. I was able to use them on a few people but I&#x27;m not too impressed.  Love the t-blade,  but when I was cleaning up my boyfriend&#x27;s neckline, the trimmers bit him. There were a few small hairs in the blades, but from my understanding you have to test the item before you ship it?</li>
            <li> Really good on line ups and shape ups!&lt;br /&gt;Has a quiet motor and it works better than my andis t-outliner</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE&lt;br /&gt;VERY CLOSE TO THE SKIN AMOST LIKE USING A RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;GIVES A VERY CLEAN HAIRCUT.&lt;br /&gt;ALTHOUGH MY MEN CLIENTS DONT LIKE HOW IT LEAVES THEIR NECKS RED AND SCRATCHED... THEY ARE VERY SHARP WHEN BRAND NEW... BUT I LOVE HOW THEY CUT!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he says it&#x27;s a good machine.  I will take his word for it!</li>
            <li> get them right the way dont think twice</li>
            <li> A guy wrote a review on this trimmer stating that after he uses this to buzz his head, his hair is as short as it would be the day after shaving it with a razor.  He was spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the size, small enough to fit in your hand, and large enough to fit in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, too.  Don&#x27;t forget to oil it when you are done.</li>
