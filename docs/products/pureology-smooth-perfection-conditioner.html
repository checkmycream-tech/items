            <li>Great product for over processed dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of fine, frizzy, wavy hair that blows-out pretty easily</li>
            <li>I have been using Pureology Super Smooth Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for over a year now</li>
            <li>, I have to admit that I absolutely LOVE these particular products from Pureology!</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference after just the first time using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to spend a lot on hair products, but this purchase was well worth it.</li>

            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is  worth  </li>
            <li>This product leaves it clean, soft, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and these are very large bottles</li>
            <li>But this product is by far the best - at least for a shampoo and conditioner - at taming my often unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Buying it on Amazon is SO much cheaper than buying it at the salon I go to!</li>
            <li>I love Pureology products, especially this one, but I received 2 bottles of Shampoo instead of one Shampoo and one Conditioner!!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner brand, scent and overall product line.</li>
            <li>you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo but only got one pump attachment</li>
            <li>Better price than I can find locally</li>
            <li>Pureology is an outstanding product especially if you have a sulfate allergy.  </li>
            <li>First used it when my long-time hairdresser recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference after using the super smooth formula ( i have been using the hydrating/moisturizing in the purple bottle in the past which i love)</li>
            <li>(I was, however, smart enough not to pay the salon price for them, so I looked to Amazon for a better deal,</li>
            <li>I started using Pureology after using pretty much every hair product there is.  </li>
            <li>bottles are quite large so</li>
            <li>My hairdresser who also happens to be my beautiful daughter, Ashley, recommended I use pureology as she colors my hair every other month and my hair was getting very dry.  </li>
            <li>I love the fantastic later of the shampoo which makes it easy to work into my thick hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much to see it is working, meaning it lathers up and really cleans your hair well.  </li>
            <li>My wife says it makes her way much healthier, smoother, shinier, softer and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>She wants something to help from damaging it</li>
            <li>Both the color and highlights stay as vibrant as they were when I walked out of the salon.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend all their products.</li>
            <li>Must daughter lives in Houston with the high high humidity.</li>
            <li>I have tried many professional brands including all the other Pureology lines.  </li>
            <li>but she has no idea how expensive and great these products are.</li>
            <li>it makes  your  hair feel  very  soft and  </li>
            <li>This product caused my scalp to itch after the first use and progressively worsened with subsequent uses.  </li>
            <li>If your going to spend your money getting your hair the right color and want to keep it that color for a long time then you must use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy product so it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but it does smooth my frizz a bit.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and you only need a little bit so</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>it dose seem to control the frizz and leaves your hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>my hair has never been so soft and silky</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the money spent</li>
            <li>It smells nice and though it is quite expensive, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Wish the smell was a little more pleasant/natural and less synthetic given the whole &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; concept, but I&#x27;m a devoted user of their products for years.  </li>
            <li>The bottle might have been 33% larger, but the bottle was feeling a little light.</li>
            <li>Pureology shampoo &amp; conditioner is like no other product I&#x27;ve tried for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>The price seems high but it also goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not aware how much damage that causes.  </li>

            <li> I have noticed a difference after using the super smooth formula ( i have been using the hydrating/moisturizing in the purple bottle in the past which i love)</li>
            <li> (I was, however, smart enough not to pay the salon price for them, so I looked to Amazon for a better deal,</li>
            <li> I started using Pureology after using pretty much every hair product there is.  </li>
            <li> bottles are quite large so</li>
            <li> My hairdresser who also happens to be my beautiful daughter, Ashley, recommended I use pureology as she colors my hair every other month and my hair was getting very dry.  </li>
            <li> I love the fantastic later of the shampoo which makes it easy to work into my thick hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much to see it is working, meaning it lathers up and really cleans your hair well.  </li>
            <li> My wife says it makes her way much healthier, smoother, shinier, softer and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> She wants something to help from damaging it</li>
            <li> Both the color and highlights stay as vibrant as they were when I walked out of the salon.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend all their products.</li>
            <li> Must daughter lives in Houston with the high high humidity.</li>
            <li> I have tried many professional brands including all the other Pureology lines.  </li>
            <li> but she has no idea how expensive and great these products are.</li>
            <li> it makes  your  hair feel  very  soft and  </li>
            <li> This product caused my scalp to itch after the first use and progressively worsened with subsequent uses.  </li>
            <li> If your going to spend your money getting your hair the right color and want to keep it that color for a long time then you must use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy product so it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but it does smooth my frizz a bit.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and you only need a little bit so</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> it dose seem to control the frizz and leaves your hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> my hair has never been so soft and silky</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the money spent</li>
            <li> It smells nice and though it is quite expensive, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Wish the smell was a little more pleasant/natural and less synthetic given the whole &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; concept, but I&#x27;m a devoted user of their products for years.  </li>
            <li> The bottle might have been 33% larger, but the bottle was feeling a little light.</li>
            <li> Pureology shampoo &amp; conditioner is like no other product I&#x27;ve tried for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> The price seems high but it also goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not aware how much damage that causes.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny for someone with thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use it every day, as I&#x27;m concerned repeated use might make my hair too flat, but I will definitely add it to my hair-care routine.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and only need a small dab; it lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li> I bought these liters for the first time in June of 2013 and didn&#x27;t have to replace them until late January 2014</li>
            <li> so it last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It goes such a long way.  </li>
            <li> Shipped pretty quickly, although it&#x27;s hard to judge delivery as things slow down once they hit the army post office, (I&#x27;m currently in Kuwait).  </li>
            <li> , it last a long time!</li>
            <li> expensive but worth if for sensitive scalps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, for crying out loud!)</li>
            <li> Your color will stay vibrant and will not wash out like it does with some other shampoos!!!</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair almost every day, and have really long hair).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to get it where I live</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s different than the other Pureology products, but if you have flyaway hair or frizzy hair, this line is for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the rave reviews however I am finding that is makes my hair seriously dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased smaller bottles of this shampoo and conditioner from my hairstylist previously.  </li>
            <li> It definitely makes my hair feel softer and a little smoother.</li>
            <li> I have very thick straight oily color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> then it has been in a long time!!!</li>
            <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
            <li> When i took the cap off, about 20% of the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> However a little goes a long way with</li>
            <li> little shampoo and conditioner goes a long way so</li>
            <li> and I only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> I will never use any other products to shampoo and condition my hair...</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and my hair is never greasy between washings.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser says it helps to not fade my color and/or brazilian blowout treatments, and I can tell the difference with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other brand of shampoo/conditioner since trying pureolgy.</li>
            <li> I wont switch to any other product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference than when using other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Hydrate but wanted to give my hair something a little different.  </li>
            <li> No thanks, lady.\\&quot;  Even though I was a total skeptic about such expensive shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the money but would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t turn it upside down</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin and straight hair (like cotton)</li>
            <li> It has an odd odor that the hydrate product does not have.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that I hardly have any dry, split ends, and it has been over 6 weeks since I have been to my salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe a little heavier.</li>
            <li> Received my package in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> so it is not easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that the shampoo/conditioner was the issue, but when I dyed my hair for the first while on this product, my scalp burned so badly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because I wanted it to work, but this will be going back.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave an undesireable residue to dull hair or make hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> but it can be hard to keep it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> Hardly need any.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick and hard to get out of the bottle esp the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> At the time, I thought \\&quot;Yeah, I realize you probably need to get rid of your overstocked, overpriced product so that you can make a profit off of suckers like me.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the pureology volume and when this came in I was skeptical it would make my hair oil.</li>
            <li> I have deducted 1 star due to the very expensive cost.</li>
            <li> (I mean, come on!</li>
            <li> Is it expensive?  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you try this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo &amp; conditioner! Buying it on Amazon is SO much cheaper than buying it at the salon I go to!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT! My hair is healthy, shiny and soft! I love it and I only have to use a small amount so it&#x27;s worth the money spent</li>
            <li> Love this pair.  Great price. Better than Ulta even with 20% coupon.</li>
            <li> Great product for over processed dry hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave an undesireable residue to dull hair or make hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology products, especially this one, but I received 2 bottles of Shampoo instead of one Shampoo and one Conditioner!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested that I use this line of products.  At the time, I thought \\&quot;Yeah, I realize you probably need to get rid of your overstocked, overpriced product so that you can make a profit off of suckers like me.  No thanks, lady.\\&quot;  Even though I was a total skeptic about such expensive shampoo and conditioner (I mean, come on! It&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, for crying out loud!), I have to admit that I absolutely LOVE these particular products from Pureology! (I was, however, smart enough not to pay the salon price for them, so I looked to Amazon for a better deal, instead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, these items smell AMAZING! (Like a freak, I CONSTANTLY smell my hair for DAYS after shampooing and conditioning!) They also leave my hair feeling and looking healthier than it EVER has. I have noticed that I hardly have any dry, split ends, and it has been over 6 weeks since I have been to my salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, these items are pricey. However, you get what you pay for. I will never use any other products to shampoo and condition my hair...even if it means fighting with my husband every time I need to order more!</li>
            <li> Great price and delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Pureology shampoo &amp; conditioner is like no other product I&#x27;ve tried for color treated hair.  Both the color and highlights stay as vibrant as they were when I walked out of the salon.  The price seems high but it also goes a long way.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo. works great</li>
            <li> Favorite  vegan choice!</li>
            <li> I have very thick straight oily color treated hair.  This product leaves it clean, soft, and smooth.  I have tried many professional brands including all the other Pureology lines.  I love the Pureology brand because it keeps my color treated hair fresh and won&#x27;t fade or damage it.  This one is by far the best for my hair type.  A good shampoo and conditioner makes all the difference!</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty quickly, although it&#x27;s hard to judge delivery as things slow down once they hit the army post office, (I&#x27;m currently in Kuwait).  This shampoo smells great and make my hair feel incredibly soft.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.  I have long hair and only need a small dab; it lathers up really well.  I&#x27;m still getting through the shampoo bottle I opened eight months ago.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this product is amazing! I wash my hair every other day and my hair is never greasy between washings. It smells great, too. Definitely worth every penny for someone with thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much to see it is working, meaning it lathers up and really cleans your hair well.  A little goes a long way with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner brand, scent and overall product line. It works great, leaves my hair super soft and super smooth. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I buy all my hair products on amazon! you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the price is better on amazon than at the salon.  My hair dresser says it helps to not fade my color and/or brazilian blowout treatments, and I can tell the difference with other shampoos.  I also have issues sometimes with shampoos making my back breakout, and I do not have that issue with this product.</li>
            <li> great product for those of us who are having to take care of our roots.! Wonderful scent. your hair is left silky and very&lt;br /&gt;manageable. Helps keep you hair color.!</li>
            <li> expensive but worth if for sensitive scalps</li>
            <li> Great purchase, love the product, and much cheaper than my local stores!</li>
            <li> Good product, fast ship.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner that my wife really enjoys and works a lot better then the supermarket bought products. My wife says it makes her way much healthier, smoother, shinier, softer and her hair color lasts longer when using it with this shampoo and conditioner. I love the smell! I have deducted 1 star due to the very expensive cost.</li>
            <li> Such a good deal! I haven&#x27;t used any other brand of shampoo/conditioner since trying pureolgy.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner ever!!! Highly recommend! Amazon prices beat every site &amp;&#x27;store I could find for my purchase. The absolute best!!!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo but only got one pump attachment and these are very large bottles so it is not easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> If your going to spend your money getting your hair the right color and want to keep it that color for a long time then you must use this shampoo. I used to go to the salon every month to color my hair and now I can skip a month or two because the color stays in longer with this shampoo. I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pureology for a while now and decided to give this one a try.  It smells nice and though it is quite expensive, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of product to get a good shampoo out of this.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the salon even when I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so soft.  I&#x27;m not able to get it where I live so I order the 33.8 liter size and it&#x27;ll last me a year.  Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I would definitely order this again and again.</li>
            <li> Wish these came w/ a pump though.  The product is thick and hard to get out of the bottle esp the conditioner.  Can&#x27;t turn it upside down b/c of the product design. However a little goes a long way with Pureology and the results are great.  Wish the smell was a little more pleasant/natural and less synthetic given the whole &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; concept, but I&#x27;m a devoted user of their products for years.  I love the fantastic later of the shampoo which makes it easy to work into my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so thick and healthy.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser who also happens to be my beautiful daughter, Ashley, recommended I use pureology as she colors my hair every other month and my hair was getting very dry.  I have tried almost all of the pureology products and I absolutely believe these are the best on the market.  My hair is improved, full of life and easy to style.  You will not be disappointed if you try this product.</li>
            <li> I started using Pureology after using pretty much every hair product there is.  I have a ton of fine, frizzy, wavy hair that blows-out pretty easily but it can be hard to keep it from frizzing.  But this product is by far the best - at least for a shampoo and conditioner - at taming my often unruly hair.  I started getting the brazilian blowout, too, and this product is great for maintaining that as well since it&#x27;s sulfate-free.  Is it expensive?  Hell yes.  But this will easily last me a year, so for the quality that you get, it&#x27;s actually a bargain.</li>
            <li> I sure do love pureology products, expecially the scent. Have been buying for years and will continue. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so spendy!</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend a lot on hair products, but this purchase was well worth it. My hairdresser talked me into trying it and I am glad she did. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for 33.8oz bottles and received 8.5 bottles.  Hoping I will receive the correct size after I return them!</li>
            <li> Good product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now and I absolutely love it. It was suggested to me by my hair stylist. It leave my hair feeling clean, smooth, and smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;A little shampoo and conditioner goes a long way so buying the liter bottle is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Love Pureology products. Better price than I can find locally</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for fine hair.  It only takes a dime size to lather so it last a long time.  It works great if you flat iron.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Pureology! It makes my hair feel and look healthy and smooth! It is also great to use if you color your hair. Your color will stay vibrant and will not wash out like it does with some other shampoos!!!</li>
            <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased smaller bottles of this shampoo and conditioner from my hairstylist previously.  I absolutely love it.  Skews my hair so shiny and healthy.  Smells great also.</li>
            <li> Great product from Purology!  I usually use the Hydrate but wanted to give my hair something a little different.  This is not a heavy product so it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but it does smooth my frizz a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, but was hesitant based on the price.  I started buying it locally in the smaller size.  Once I realized how great it worked for me, I moved to the liter.  Amazon offers a great price.  I bought these liters for the first time in June of 2013 and didn&#x27;t have to replace them until late January 2014 (I wash my hair almost every day, and have really long hair).  Worth the expense for sure.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin and straight hair (like cotton) I have been using Pureology Super Smooth Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for over a year now and I LOVE it!!!! I wont switch to any other product. It makes my hair feel so soft and healthy. It also smelle REALLY good. I even buy it for my mom so hair will get healthy too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the rave reviews however I am finding that is makes my hair seriously dry. I spoke to my hair stylist about it and she said a lot of the color preserving shampoos do so maybe I should expect it to, but for the price I wanted better.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from the hydrate product, and I think I will be switching back as soon as this is finished. It has an odd odor that the hydrate product does not have.  It reminds me of the smell of a perm you would get in a salon.</li>
            <li> She straightens her hair almost daily.  She has not embraced her wavy hair.  I don&#x27;t want her to damage it.  She&#x27;s not aware how much damage that causes.  She wants something to help from damaging it but she has no idea how expensive and great these products are.</li>
            <li> Pureology is an outstanding product especially if you have a sulfate allergy.  This product leaves your hair smooth and protects it from damage.  I color my hair and use this daily.  I highly recommend all their products.</li>
            <li> So glad I accidentally ordered this! I usually use the pureology volume and when this came in I was skeptical it would make my hair oil. Surprisingly it did not make my hair oily! I love the smell and you only need a little bit so, it last a long time! Big pureology fan!</li>
            <li> This product caused my scalp to itch after the first use and progressively worsened with subsequent uses.  I did not realize that the shampoo/conditioner was the issue, but when I dyed my hair for the first while on this product, my scalp burned so badly (this had never happened before in the years that I have been dying my hair).  That&#x27;s when I knew that the Pureology was probably causing an allergic reaction.  I immediately stopped using the product and my scalp feels so much better.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because I wanted it to work, but this will be going back.</li>
            <li> Using both the smooth shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner as I color my hair regularly and my color holds the best when using this.  It was recommended by my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bottles are quite large so I recommend having a smaller bottle to pour it into for use in the shower and keeping these bottles in a linen closet for refilling the smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for over a year and still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference after using the super smooth formula ( i have been using the hydrating/moisturizing in the purple bottle in the past which i love) it dose seem to control the frizz and leaves your hair silky and soft.  I love pureology products  and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Must daughter lives in Houston with the high high humidity. She loves the Pureology Pureologyshampoo and conditioner. It takes her hair and keeps it healthy!</li>
            <li> Smells Great... Works Great...My hair look Great... And my hair is softer then it has been in a long time!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worth the price. Makes hair shiny and soft. Comes in several varieties. Can be found in stores but online is best price.</li>
            <li> Bottle tops were open and product spilled inside of box.&lt;br /&gt;Very unprofessional</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the money but would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference than when using other shampoos. Maybe a little heavier. Did not care for the scent at all.</li>
            <li> Hardly need any.  It goes such a long way.  Leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth.  I would definitely recommmend it.</li>
            <li> Great products. Been using them for years. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Best price on Amazon</li>
            <li> Great price and great shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference after just the first time using this shampoo and conditioner. It definitely makes my hair feel softer and a little smoother. Not sure what&#x27;s in it that&#x27;s different than the other Pureology products, but if you have flyaway hair or frizzy hair, this line is for you. I probably won&#x27;t use it every day, as I&#x27;m concerned repeated use might make my hair too flat, but I will definitely add it to my hair-care routine.</li>
            <li> So I LOVE Pureology shampoo and conditioner. Love it. When I received this shipment, the bottle say &#x27;33% More!&#x27;  The bottle might have been 33% larger, but the bottle was feeling a little light. When i took the cap off, about 20% of the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> Received my package in just a few days.  Love my pureology products</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is really marvelous....my hair has never been so soft and silky</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use this Pureology product in tandum with the hairspray.  First used it when my long-time hairdresser recommended it.  Now used for 3 years.  Love all of this product line.</li>
            <li> Always great! I will order again.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product to me and I Love it. I get the bigger size bcz I feel I get more for what I pay, even if it is an expensive product.</li>
