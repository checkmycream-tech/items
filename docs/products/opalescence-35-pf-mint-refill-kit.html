            <li>GREAT prod!  </li>
            <li>so when I found it here I jumped on it and even after using the 22% for 4 months  one application of the 35% was amazing!!!!!  </li>

            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Good order!</li>
            <li>If you use all of the strengths wisely, you will have excellent results!!!</li>
            <li>I paid $75 for this at my dentist, so this is a great bargain by comparison.  </li>
            <li>This is great for those who dont want to leave a tray on all night...</li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>I have used the 35% for about a week and am seeing great results already.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the Aquafresh pre-filled molds and had great suggest.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I see plenty of reviews on  here talking about how great it is</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great, fast-acting teeth whitening solution, Opalescence is the product I recommend.</li>
            <li>They worked great over the weeks that I was doing my routine.   </li>
            <li>Just use as directed and you&#x27;ll see great results in no time at all.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This does work great.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are both in great shape (floss everyday)&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I agree with others - this is a great REFILL product.  </li>
            <li>This product works MAGIC if you get the custom tray!!</li>
            <li>I think its best to use the 15% solution, if that is safe.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with the result!</li>
            <li>expect great results with the 35 and better application!</li>
            <li>Fab I loved this product.</li>
            <li>This product is clearly superior with</li>
            <li>A good tip is to store the gel in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>get the good stuff</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but DO NOT USE without having a custom dental tray from a dentist.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal.</li>
            <li>it was THAT GOOD)</li>
            <li>I have used the whitening gel for over a year, and have loved it.  </li>
            <li>If you have your own teeth molds, this is a great product for a refresher.    </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Used this before from my dentist and loved the way it worked.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>Im very pleased with the opalescence PF35% Teeth Whitening.</li>
            <li>I had first heard about this wonderful product from one of my clients (a dentist&#x27;s wife) whose teeth were stunning!  </li>
            <li>But the product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Tried again with 1/2 syringe as it was OK but still burned a good deal.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have a custom-moulded tray (not an at-home heat moulded (boiled) system), this is an effective product if used in moderation and according to instructions (in that case I give it 3 stars).  </li>
            <li>I did not get that kind of effect here at all.</li>
            <li>my be handy in those day&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The product is very strong so you just have to make sure that your teeth guards are cut away from your gums because they will burn a bit!</li>
            <li>Works great, but I didn&#x27;t realize how powerful 35% is!  </li>
            <li>They cost $100 from mine, but they are well worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s very strong and will whiten your teeth in thirty minutes.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this is the best whitening gel on the market</li>
            <li>I have used the 35% Opalescence gel for over a year with great success.  </li>
            <li>But Opalescence has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product delivery time is also very quick!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to many of my friends and will carry on doing so</li>
            <li>It works great and really whitens your teeth...  </li>
            <li>Results do not occur overnight for most people.</li>
            <li>One tooth was 4 shades, most were 3, and the rest were 1 to 2.</li>
            <li>the 4 week period, the Dentist was highly pleased with the progress.</li>
            <li>I was pleased as well.</li>
            <li>The boilable trays work OK</li>
            <li>but you need to keep in water for 10-15 seconds for a better mold.  </li>
            <li>I have head the 15-20% work better and more uniformly.  </li>
            <li>Most at-home systems use a 10-15% concentration of Carbamide</li>
            <li>I used 22% from my dentist and wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad that you did.</li>
            <li>The viscosity of the solution keeps the stuff in the mouth trays (mine are custom-made) better.</li>
            <li>The dentist was satisfied with the whitening but ended up prescribing a mouthwash designed  to heal my gums (at $18 a pop that was an ouch.)  </li>
            <li>The 20% is better.</li>
            <li>I love Opalescence.  </li>
            <li>I just keep it for 2-3 hours at most, and works</li>
            <li>I always floss a couple times and brush a couple times before using, to make sure nothing is in the way.</li>
            <li>I did expect greater results with these, and got improved response but not what the expectation was.</li>
            <li>Granted there results might be better than mine</li>
            <li>I have used all of the different strengths and they all give excellent results.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and it works wonders without paying a lot of money to the dentist.</li>
            <li>the product is great and really works on whiting your teeth .</li>
            <li>Works just like the one you get at the dentist for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>Was so happy to find it on Amazon much cheaper than the dentist and works just as well.</li>
            <li>The 35% works much better than the 10% and faster.</li>
            <li>I was worried about gum sensitivity because lots of staining is on the bottoms and top of my teeth-</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The plus side, is it does work a lot better.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best way to whiten you teeth fast!!!</li>
            <li>seller was easy to work with, the bleach was too strong could bearly use it!</li>
            <li>I had been using the 22% and it worked great, but the 35% took my tooth whitening to a new level!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great whitening product, excluding those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Price wise much cheaper to purchase through you than your dentist</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good value</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to strong</li>
            <li>I went from the 20% to this, and this is borderline too strong.  </li>
            <li>Works very good, but the way that I used it, it&#x27;s not working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it all night long, and 35%</li>
            <li>I think that proper molds are important so that you have a good fit against your teeth, otherwise you&#x27;d be filling the gaps with product in order to get any kind of result (and probably burning your gums in the meantime).</li>
            <li>So, I was happy to find that Amazon carried a higher concentration of this product with a much lower time requirement for results.    </li>
            <li>The 35% concentration is considered extremely strong in comparison to the concentrations available.  </li>
            <li>Whiteness in gums goes away fairly quickly, don&#x27;t panic!</li>
            <li>It works though, A couple of things though is don&#x27;t put too much on,it will run over the top and burn your gums and turn your gums whiter than your teeth will ever be!</li>
            <li>You will be AMAZED with your new bright smile :)</li>
            <li>But the results are so fantastic, that it is to be seen to believe.</li>
            <li>I moved onto 15 and 20% as they became available.  </li>
            <li>but then I checked and every recent review this year has great reviews.</li>
            <li>A custom-moulded tray must fit the teeth precisely and must not allow the bleaching gel to leak from the tray.  </li>
            <li>These systems work well and are fairly cheap to use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it over a few weeks and results are just excellent.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions and your smile will be brighter than ever.</li>
            <li>then I filled the tray and put it on for 1/2 hr.  </li>
            <li>Works great and fast but is VERY strong so don&#x27;t wear it for too long</li>
            <li>My smile has been made over in a matter of weeks!</li>
            <li>First, I am pleased to report that while a couple of the reviewers mentioned a burning sensation from this product, I did not.      </li>
            <li>I follow the instructions precisely as many of the reviewers suggest, and have had no ill effects to my gums or my teeth.      </li>
            <li>I do have a fitted/custom tray and originally used this product to whiten all of my teeth before getting front tooth veneers.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited that they are stronger</li>
            <li>Was looking for something with a better price and higher quantity</li>
            <li>This stuff is powerful!  </li>
            <li>and I am familiar with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to Rembrandt 2 Hour Whitening, which is what I usually use, and have been very happy with.</li>
            <li>So if you can deal with the tingle, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a step in the right direction!</li>
            <li>There is simply no other product out there that will give your teeth better lifting or better results.  </li>
            <li>Opalescence several times with good results.  </li>
            <li>would have given a 5 star, but I felt somehow they need to get the gel to the gumline without burning, providing full tooth coverage.</li>
            <li>then I shift the tray gently side to side to get better cover and fill any gap&#x27;s it&#x27;s not covering.</li>
            <li>Love that 30 minutes is all it takes as my trays really aggravate my TMJ.  </li>
            <li>but to make sure it covered the whole tooth</li>
            <li>This is the best $17 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time! :)</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>I still have many treatments to go and am assuming itwill all even out over time (it is already better now than it was 1-2 days after I started last week).    </li>
            <li>all, you have to be patient and not expect quick results.</li>
            <li>Quick</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>agree that this is strong stuff, and it did burn and irritate my lower gums when I applied too much in the lower tray.</li>
            <li>Only have to wear for 30 minutes and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>I have always used Opalescence 15%, but there is a distinct acceleration in the efficacy of Opalescence 35%.</li>
            <li>In addition, I liked the idea of only wearing the trays for 30 minutes each day (as opposed to the hour for the 20% concentration).      </li>
            <li>35% will make your teeth more sensitive than 15%.</li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;ve decreased the time needed to have the product on the teeth which is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li>So it was well worth the wait</li>
            <li>Originally recommended by my dentist who made my trays, it works well and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I used new trays, tried with/ without light, tried using accelerator.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because I think the instructions should be more clear (i.e., how much gel is appropriate).  </li>
            <li>Likely an excellent product but definitely WAY too strong for the average user.  </li>
            <li>I was leery that this wouldn&#x27;t be the real product, but it is!</li>
            <li>THE OPALESCENCE GEL REFILL KIT WAS DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND MUCH BETTER PACKAGING WITH THE CORRECT % UNLIKE LAST VENDOR.</li>
            <li>BTW I love the short application</li>
            <li>The first application i used 1/4 of the tube and applied sparingly to avoid the gel getting on my gums.</li>
            <li>30 minutes after bushing and flossing is pretty</li>
            <li>Used 3/4 syringe the first time and needed to remove within minutes.</li>
            <li>I rinsed after the first time I used this product (which was, as I stated, just now</li>
            <li>-this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written-</li>
            <li>Thanks Opallescence and Aplussmile!</li>
            <li>The first set I used (from the dentist) had an effervescence going on - I could tell it was working.</li>
            <li>My dentist always advises me to only bleach the front 6 of my teeth, top and bottom, not all of the teeth.</li>
            <li>Be aware before using it of the amount you put into the bleaching fitting, especially with the 35%.</li>
            <li>And the  shipping was very,very fast!   </li>
            <li>This is the same whitening system that I bought from my dentist but paid much more for it than what I paid on Amazon and this is a stronger strength.</li>
            <li>Better price than my dentist who charges twice the price for a very similar product, I will order this again.</li>
            <li>I removed the tray when the burning was evident, wiped off the excess and resumed bleaching.</li>
            <li>First use, I had it on overnight and burned my gums.  </li>
            <li>if you do not have good mold or get the gel evenly placed, your teeth will whiten unevenly AND your gums will turn ghost-white.  </li>
            <li>excellent, it really made my teeth white in less than 2 days of usage!</li>
            <li>I used Opalescence 35 for the first time with professional trays created by my dentist, after using the 15% product originally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve try other brands and they make my teeth off white as opposed to the nice bright white that this product provides.</li>
            <li>I had ordered another (stronger) product from another company with great disappointment as while it lightened okay &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reviewed this product positively before.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works..and FAST!</li>
            <li>I actually think that a 20% bleaching solution is too strong to be used unsupervised.  </li>
            <li>Using a anti-sensitive toothpaste can decrease the sensitivity to a certain extend.</li>
            <li>But it certainly helped get my teeth whither, and if I knew how to attach my pics</li>
            <li>Stronger than the previously gel I used, but same brand issued by my dentist at a great savings.</li>
            <li>Now I got the 35% refill, which has a much shorter application time.</li>
            <li>but you MUST get custom trays from your dentist that fit properly.</li>
            <li>(2)  Using too much gel can cause your gums to burn.  </li>
            <li>This was too much.  </li>
            <li>so I am very leery about them.</li>
            <li>, research suggests that the 35% whitens as much as the 15%.</li>
            <li>Some teeth will whiten faster and others may not whiten much at all.</li>
            <li>Getting a lot of dental work done next week and want to whiten my smile as much as possible before getting some crowns. :)</li>
            <li>I used this to whiten my teeth fast in preparation for dental work.  </li>
            <li>As others noted, if you use too much, it burns your gums.</li>
            <li>And of course, brush and rinse very well after use.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of the gel to cover the teeth when putting the trays in place over the teeth.</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN....</li>
            <li>Works fast.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth are SO much whiter.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on your gums also.</li>
            <li>This is the same product available from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>After just one 30-minute session, my teeth were much whiter as compared to a lighter crown created 22 years ago.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works fast</li>
            <li>It keeps the gel&#x27;s whitening concentration from depleting and the syringes will be good for at least a year.</li>
            <li>Using a dental tray I had no problem....get the professional dental tray (from your dentist)!!!</li>
            <li>MAJOR drawback to this system is that it assumes that you have a custom-moulded bleaching tray, which is essential to using this product correctly and safely.  </li>
            <li>However, you should certainly see viable results and the effort is not hard.</li>
            <li>The whiteness from the burn is gone in an hour and really is not uncomfortable but considering there was enough gel to reach the gums, it is pretty wasteful to use that much.  </li>
            <li>Was worried from older reviews that they might not work</li>
            <li>One 30-minute session definitely lightened and brightened my teeth to a noticeable degree - way more than Crest White Strips ever did.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like a \\&quot;high powered\\&quot; version of the product, but it did work better than the previous.    </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>With Oplaescence 35% I saw distinct whitening improvement after only two uses.</li>
            <li>For me, it was worth the extra sensitivity to get faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A &#x27;thicker&#x27; solution such as Opalescence pretty much didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>I must get 4 or 5 complimets PER DAY on my white smile.  </li>
            <li>They worked okay, but it took a few weeks to see results.</li>
            <li>As a dentist, I know that the key to success in tooth whitening is to have a properly made custom-fitted tray, and the right concentration of bleaching gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now it is a race to whiten as much as possible</li>
            <li>Hours and hours of using the 15% overnight did not produce nearly the same results, and actually made my teeth more sensitive than the 35.</li>
            <li>In both cases there was rare sensitivity (after the fact) but it didn&#x27;t last long, and was quite rare.    </li>
            <li>It is a little harsh on the gums, but I have custom molded trays, so I just reduced the amount of gel and now everything is great.</li>
            <li>so I tried something new this time.</li>
            <li>Obviously, it is a stronger mixture of ingredients and if you use too much, it will burn your gums if you have too much in the tray.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have already developed the whiteness that I would have normally had after a week of using the weaker solutions.    </li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m liking the results!   </li>
            <li>Other products were notably thinned out or almost totally dissipated by the time I&#x27;d had the trays in for the recommended length of time for each.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>The next night I applied small drops to each of my front teeth and put my custom trays in, so much better!  </li>
            <li>used the 35% daily for the first 3 days and was amazed at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I noticed significant whitening after the third application and I wear the trays and gel for about 30 minutes once per day for about a week to get them really white and then follow up with a twice per week application when I notice them getting a bit stained again.</li>
            <li>and I found it works best if I use a finger and spread a tiny bit on each tooth carefully up to the gum line and then use a small amount of the gel in the trays because if you use too much, it will seep up into the gums and will burn them due to the strength of the gel.</li>
            <li>Maintains my color fine with an hour or so every few weeks.</li>
            <li>and I was naturally discouraged and felt it was a pain.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Beware, if you apply too much, it can bleach your gum to white too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had for years gotten the 15% product directly from the dentist who had made my molds.</li>
            <li>(I have always had sensitive teeth.)</li>
            <li>It had undergone tramua when I was young.</li>
            <li>The advantage with the custom-made tray system is that you can use a variety of different bleaching gel strengths, some of which are much stronger than the adherant strip</li>
            <li>and if you aren&#x27;t sensitive go for the 35 %.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because you only apply it to your teeth for 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li>I used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gonna be sensitive</li>
            <li>there hygienists if this is really the same thing they use</li>
            <li>but I definately do not have sensitive teeth and/or gums and this</li>
            <li>Considerably cheaper to buy it this way, than to buy via your dentist.</li>
            <li>WOW - does this work.  </li>
            <li>Made professional modes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did the parts near my gums manually</li>
            <li>I think anyone who bleaches their teeth will likely agree that the solution, the feel of the trays, and the occasional burning or stinging if there&#x27;s too much product around one area of the gumline will make you salivate more than usual.</li>
            <li>Reading the other reviews prior to ordering this product was very useful.  </li>
            <li>i had uneven whitening on my canines (at least I could see how effective the 30 minute treatment was!)</li>
            <li>This has eliminated the potential for burning and reduced the discomfort associated with the high concentration.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy such a high concentration again.  </li>
            <li>a tactic which usually cleaned out most of the residue from the other bleaching gels I&#x27;ve used, and found that there was still a decent layer on my teeth for me to brush off.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough in these 4 tubes to get my teeth &amp;#34;movie star white&amp;#34; if I could stand 8 treatments in a row, but this stuff is so strong that the tips of my front teeth become ultra sensitive to air and to anything cold, and my gums bleed quite a bit, so I am only able to use Opalescence once every 4 days (after my gums fully heal and the tooth sensitivity has worn off).</li>
            <li>I was hardly able to get two and half fills out of each tube and that is going very carefully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just finished my first bleaching session with this product and, in all honesty, I have used whitening products from aquafresh, crest, colgate (including the version from colgate that dentist offices sell for bleaching), and two other versions of 35% Carbamide Peroxide solution...</li>
            <li>much higher than other products used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I moved last year and my new dentist offers only Zoom which requires hours of bleaching time...</li>
            <li>I hope this works better for other folks as I wasted $500.</li>
            <li>The bleaching process may take a little longer but it is worth it to alleviate these issues.    </li>
            <li>this stuff from green dot sales did nothing--not the real thing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to order the product sold for sensitive gums, or a lower concentrated version next time.</li>
            <li>the subsequent sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Opulence comes out of tube gummy and solid like it may be old.</li>
            <li>I could barely brush my teeth for fear of hitting my gums.</li>
            <li>You just need to be careful to not use too much.  </li>
            <li>Have to be careful in how much you put in the trays.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, but the gum irritation was rather substantial--not enough to make me discontinue, but enough for me to say ouch for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, instead of applying the product to the trays and putting them in your mouth, apply the whitener directly to your teeth and put an un-moulded tray over so it doesn&#x27;t get on your upper lip.</li>
            <li>I used typical dentist distribution the first time I purchased Opalescence, and left the molds on all night while sleeping.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little more expensive, but I&#x27;m no longer even interested in trying anything else.</li>

            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Good order!</li>
            <li> If you use all of the strengths wisely, you will have excellent results!!!</li>
            <li> I paid $75 for this at my dentist, so this is a great bargain by comparison.  </li>
            <li> This is great for those who dont want to leave a tray on all night...</li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> I have used the 35% for about a week and am seeing great results already.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the Aquafresh pre-filled molds and had great suggest.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> I see plenty of reviews on  here talking about how great it is</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great, fast-acting teeth whitening solution, Opalescence is the product I recommend.</li>
            <li> They worked great over the weeks that I was doing my routine.   </li>
            <li> Just use as directed and you&#x27;ll see great results in no time at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> This does work great.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are both in great shape (floss everyday)&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I agree with others - this is a great REFILL product.  </li>
            <li> This product works MAGIC if you get the custom tray!!</li>
            <li> I think its best to use the 15% solution, if that is safe.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with the result!</li>
            <li> expect great results with the 35 and better application!</li>
            <li> Fab I loved this product.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly superior with</li>
            <li> A good tip is to store the gel in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> get the good stuff</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but DO NOT USE without having a custom dental tray from a dentist.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal.</li>
            <li> it was THAT GOOD)</li>
            <li> I have used the whitening gel for over a year, and have loved it.  </li>
            <li> If you have your own teeth molds, this is a great product for a refresher.    </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Used this before from my dentist and loved the way it worked.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li> Im very pleased with the opalescence PF35% Teeth Whitening.</li>
            <li> I had first heard about this wonderful product from one of my clients (a dentist&#x27;s wife) whose teeth were stunning!  </li>
            <li> But the product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Tried again with 1/2 syringe as it was OK but still burned a good deal.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have a custom-moulded tray (not an at-home heat moulded (boiled) system), this is an effective product if used in moderation and according to instructions (in that case I give it 3 stars).  </li>
            <li> I did not get that kind of effect here at all.</li>
            <li> my be handy in those day&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The product is very strong so you just have to make sure that your teeth guards are cut away from your gums because they will burn a bit!</li>
            <li> Works great, but I didn&#x27;t realize how powerful 35% is!  </li>
            <li> They cost $100 from mine, but they are well worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Very strong.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s very strong and will whiten your teeth in thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this is the best whitening gel on the market</li>
            <li> I have used the 35% Opalescence gel for over a year with great success.  </li>
            <li> But Opalescence has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product delivery time is also very quick!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to many of my friends and will carry on doing so</li>
            <li> It works great and really whitens your teeth...  </li>
            <li> Results do not occur overnight for most people.</li>
            <li> One tooth was 4 shades, most were 3, and the rest were 1 to 2.</li>
            <li> the 4 week period, the Dentist was highly pleased with the progress.</li>
            <li> I was pleased as well.</li>
            <li> The boilable trays work OK</li>
            <li> but you need to keep in water for 10-15 seconds for a better mold.  </li>
            <li> I have head the 15-20% work better and more uniformly.  </li>
            <li> Most at-home systems use a 10-15% concentration of Carbamide</li>
            <li> I used 22% from my dentist and wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad that you did.</li>
            <li> The viscosity of the solution keeps the stuff in the mouth trays (mine are custom-made) better.</li>
            <li> The dentist was satisfied with the whitening but ended up prescribing a mouthwash designed  to heal my gums (at $18 a pop that was an ouch.)  </li>
            <li> The 20% is better.</li>
            <li> I love Opalescence.  </li>
            <li> I just keep it for 2-3 hours at most, and works</li>
            <li> I always floss a couple times and brush a couple times before using, to make sure nothing is in the way.</li>
            <li> I did expect greater results with these, and got improved response but not what the expectation was.</li>
            <li> Granted there results might be better than mine</li>
            <li> I have used all of the different strengths and they all give excellent results.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and it works wonders without paying a lot of money to the dentist.</li>
            <li> the product is great and really works on whiting your teeth .</li>
            <li> Works just like the one you get at the dentist for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> Was so happy to find it on Amazon much cheaper than the dentist and works just as well.</li>
            <li> The 35% works much better than the 10% and faster.</li>
            <li> I was worried about gum sensitivity because lots of staining is on the bottoms and top of my teeth-</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The plus side, is it does work a lot better.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best way to whiten you teeth fast!!!</li>
            <li> seller was easy to work with, the bleach was too strong could bearly use it!</li>
            <li> I had been using the 22% and it worked great, but the 35% took my tooth whitening to a new level!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great whitening product, excluding those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Price wise much cheaper to purchase through you than your dentist</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good value</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to strong</li>
            <li> I went from the 20% to this, and this is borderline too strong.  </li>
            <li> Works very good, but the way that I used it, it&#x27;s not working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it all night long, and 35%</li>
            <li> I think that proper molds are important so that you have a good fit against your teeth, otherwise you&#x27;d be filling the gaps with product in order to get any kind of result (and probably burning your gums in the meantime).</li>
            <li> So, I was happy to find that Amazon carried a higher concentration of this product with a much lower time requirement for results.    </li>
            <li> The 35% concentration is considered extremely strong in comparison to the concentrations available.  </li>
            <li> Whiteness in gums goes away fairly quickly, don&#x27;t panic!</li>
            <li> It works though, A couple of things though is don&#x27;t put too much on,it will run over the top and burn your gums and turn your gums whiter than your teeth will ever be!</li>
            <li> You will be AMAZED with your new bright smile :)</li>
            <li> But the results are so fantastic, that it is to be seen to believe.</li>
            <li> I moved onto 15 and 20% as they became available.  </li>
            <li> but then I checked and every recent review this year has great reviews.</li>
            <li> A custom-moulded tray must fit the teeth precisely and must not allow the bleaching gel to leak from the tray.  </li>
            <li> These systems work well and are fairly cheap to use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it over a few weeks and results are just excellent.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the instructions and your smile will be brighter than ever.</li>
            <li> then I filled the tray and put it on for 1/2 hr.  </li>
            <li> Works great and fast but is VERY strong so don&#x27;t wear it for too long</li>
            <li> My smile has been made over in a matter of weeks!</li>
            <li> First, I am pleased to report that while a couple of the reviewers mentioned a burning sensation from this product, I did not.      </li>
            <li> I follow the instructions precisely as many of the reviewers suggest, and have had no ill effects to my gums or my teeth.      </li>
            <li> I do have a fitted/custom tray and originally used this product to whiten all of my teeth before getting front tooth veneers.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited that they are stronger</li>
            <li> Was looking for something with a better price and higher quantity</li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful!  </li>
            <li> and I am familiar with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to Rembrandt 2 Hour Whitening, which is what I usually use, and have been very happy with.</li>
            <li> So if you can deal with the tingle, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a step in the right direction!</li>
            <li> There is simply no other product out there that will give your teeth better lifting or better results.  </li>
            <li> Opalescence several times with good results.  </li>
            <li> would have given a 5 star, but I felt somehow they need to get the gel to the gumline without burning, providing full tooth coverage.</li>
            <li> then I shift the tray gently side to side to get better cover and fill any gap&#x27;s it&#x27;s not covering.</li>
            <li> Love that 30 minutes is all it takes as my trays really aggravate my TMJ.  </li>
            <li> but to make sure it covered the whole tooth</li>
            <li> This is the best $17 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time! :)</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> I still have many treatments to go and am assuming itwill all even out over time (it is already better now than it was 1-2 days after I started last week).    </li>
            <li> all, you have to be patient and not expect quick results.</li>
            <li> Quick</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> agree that this is strong stuff, and it did burn and irritate my lower gums when I applied too much in the lower tray.</li>
            <li> Only have to wear for 30 minutes and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> I have always used Opalescence 15%, but there is a distinct acceleration in the efficacy of Opalescence 35%.</li>
            <li> In addition, I liked the idea of only wearing the trays for 30 minutes each day (as opposed to the hour for the 20% concentration).      </li>
            <li> 35% will make your teeth more sensitive than 15%.</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;ve decreased the time needed to have the product on the teeth which is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li> So it was well worth the wait</li>
            <li> Originally recommended by my dentist who made my trays, it works well and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I used new trays, tried with/ without light, tried using accelerator.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because I think the instructions should be more clear (i.e., how much gel is appropriate).  </li>
            <li> Likely an excellent product but definitely WAY too strong for the average user.  </li>
            <li> I was leery that this wouldn&#x27;t be the real product, but it is!</li>
            <li> THE OPALESCENCE GEL REFILL KIT WAS DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND MUCH BETTER PACKAGING WITH THE CORRECT % UNLIKE LAST VENDOR.</li>
            <li> BTW I love the short application</li>
            <li> The first application i used 1/4 of the tube and applied sparingly to avoid the gel getting on my gums.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes after bushing and flossing is pretty</li>
            <li> Used 3/4 syringe the first time and needed to remove within minutes.</li>
            <li> I rinsed after the first time I used this product (which was, as I stated, just now</li>
            <li> -this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written-</li>
            <li> Thanks Opallescence and Aplussmile!</li>
            <li> The first set I used (from the dentist) had an effervescence going on - I could tell it was working.</li>
            <li> My dentist always advises me to only bleach the front 6 of my teeth, top and bottom, not all of the teeth.</li>
            <li> Be aware before using it of the amount you put into the bleaching fitting, especially with the 35%.</li>
            <li> And the  shipping was very,very fast!   </li>
            <li> This is the same whitening system that I bought from my dentist but paid much more for it than what I paid on Amazon and this is a stronger strength.</li>
            <li> Better price than my dentist who charges twice the price for a very similar product, I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I removed the tray when the burning was evident, wiped off the excess and resumed bleaching.</li>
            <li> First use, I had it on overnight and burned my gums.  </li>
            <li> if you do not have good mold or get the gel evenly placed, your teeth will whiten unevenly AND your gums will turn ghost-white.  </li>
            <li> excellent, it really made my teeth white in less than 2 days of usage!</li>
            <li> I used Opalescence 35 for the first time with professional trays created by my dentist, after using the 15% product originally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try other brands and they make my teeth off white as opposed to the nice bright white that this product provides.</li>
            <li> I had ordered another (stronger) product from another company with great disappointment as while it lightened okay &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product positively before.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works..and FAST!</li>
            <li> I actually think that a 20% bleaching solution is too strong to be used unsupervised.  </li>
            <li> Using a anti-sensitive toothpaste can decrease the sensitivity to a certain extend.</li>
            <li> But it certainly helped get my teeth whither, and if I knew how to attach my pics</li>
            <li> Stronger than the previously gel I used, but same brand issued by my dentist at a great savings.</li>
            <li> Now I got the 35% refill, which has a much shorter application time.</li>
            <li> but you MUST get custom trays from your dentist that fit properly.</li>
            <li> (2)  Using too much gel can cause your gums to burn.  </li>
            <li> This was too much.  </li>
            <li> so I am very leery about them.</li>
            <li> , research suggests that the 35% whitens as much as the 15%.</li>
            <li> Some teeth will whiten faster and others may not whiten much at all.</li>
            <li> Getting a lot of dental work done next week and want to whiten my smile as much as possible before getting some crowns. :)</li>
            <li> I used this to whiten my teeth fast in preparation for dental work.  </li>
            <li> As others noted, if you use too much, it burns your gums.</li>
            <li> And of course, brush and rinse very well after use.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of the gel to cover the teeth when putting the trays in place over the teeth.</li>
            <li> THANKS AGAIN....</li>
            <li> Works fast.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth are SO much whiter.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on your gums also.</li>
            <li> This is the same product available from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> After just one 30-minute session, my teeth were much whiter as compared to a lighter crown created 22 years ago.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works fast</li>
            <li> It keeps the gel&#x27;s whitening concentration from depleting and the syringes will be good for at least a year.</li>
            <li> Using a dental tray I had no problem....get the professional dental tray (from your dentist)!!!</li>
            <li> MAJOR drawback to this system is that it assumes that you have a custom-moulded bleaching tray, which is essential to using this product correctly and safely.  </li>
            <li> However, you should certainly see viable results and the effort is not hard.</li>
            <li> The whiteness from the burn is gone in an hour and really is not uncomfortable but considering there was enough gel to reach the gums, it is pretty wasteful to use that much.  </li>
            <li> Was worried from older reviews that they might not work</li>
            <li> One 30-minute session definitely lightened and brightened my teeth to a noticeable degree - way more than Crest White Strips ever did.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like a \\&quot;high powered\\&quot; version of the product, but it did work better than the previous.    </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> With Oplaescence 35% I saw distinct whitening improvement after only two uses.</li>
            <li> For me, it was worth the extra sensitivity to get faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A &#x27;thicker&#x27; solution such as Opalescence pretty much didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> I must get 4 or 5 complimets PER DAY on my white smile.  </li>
            <li> They worked okay, but it took a few weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I know that the key to success in tooth whitening is to have a properly made custom-fitted tray, and the right concentration of bleaching gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now it is a race to whiten as much as possible</li>
            <li> Hours and hours of using the 15% overnight did not produce nearly the same results, and actually made my teeth more sensitive than the 35.</li>
            <li> In both cases there was rare sensitivity (after the fact) but it didn&#x27;t last long, and was quite rare.    </li>
            <li> It is a little harsh on the gums, but I have custom molded trays, so I just reduced the amount of gel and now everything is great.</li>
            <li> so I tried something new this time.</li>
            <li> Obviously, it is a stronger mixture of ingredients and if you use too much, it will burn your gums if you have too much in the tray.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have already developed the whiteness that I would have normally had after a week of using the weaker solutions.    </li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m liking the results!   </li>
            <li> Other products were notably thinned out or almost totally dissipated by the time I&#x27;d had the trays in for the recommended length of time for each.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> The next night I applied small drops to each of my front teeth and put my custom trays in, so much better!  </li>
            <li> used the 35% daily for the first 3 days and was amazed at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I noticed significant whitening after the third application and I wear the trays and gel for about 30 minutes once per day for about a week to get them really white and then follow up with a twice per week application when I notice them getting a bit stained again.</li>
            <li> and I found it works best if I use a finger and spread a tiny bit on each tooth carefully up to the gum line and then use a small amount of the gel in the trays because if you use too much, it will seep up into the gums and will burn them due to the strength of the gel.</li>
            <li> Maintains my color fine with an hour or so every few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I was naturally discouraged and felt it was a pain.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware, if you apply too much, it can bleach your gum to white too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had for years gotten the 15% product directly from the dentist who had made my molds.</li>
            <li> (I have always had sensitive teeth.)</li>
            <li> It had undergone tramua when I was young.</li>
            <li> The advantage with the custom-made tray system is that you can use a variety of different bleaching gel strengths, some of which are much stronger than the adherant strip</li>
            <li> and if you aren&#x27;t sensitive go for the 35 %.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because you only apply it to your teeth for 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gonna be sensitive</li>
            <li> there hygienists if this is really the same thing they use</li>
            <li> but I definately do not have sensitive teeth and/or gums and this</li>
            <li> Considerably cheaper to buy it this way, than to buy via your dentist.</li>
            <li> WOW - does this work.  </li>
            <li> Made professional modes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did the parts near my gums manually</li>
            <li> I think anyone who bleaches their teeth will likely agree that the solution, the feel of the trays, and the occasional burning or stinging if there&#x27;s too much product around one area of the gumline will make you salivate more than usual.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews prior to ordering this product was very useful.  </li>
            <li> i had uneven whitening on my canines (at least I could see how effective the 30 minute treatment was!)</li>
            <li> This has eliminated the potential for burning and reduced the discomfort associated with the high concentration.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy such a high concentration again.  </li>
            <li> a tactic which usually cleaned out most of the residue from the other bleaching gels I&#x27;ve used, and found that there was still a decent layer on my teeth for me to brush off.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough in these 4 tubes to get my teeth &amp;#34;movie star white&amp;#34; if I could stand 8 treatments in a row, but this stuff is so strong that the tips of my front teeth become ultra sensitive to air and to anything cold, and my gums bleed quite a bit, so I am only able to use Opalescence once every 4 days (after my gums fully heal and the tooth sensitivity has worn off).</li>
            <li> I was hardly able to get two and half fills out of each tube and that is going very carefully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first bleaching session with this product and, in all honesty, I have used whitening products from aquafresh, crest, colgate (including the version from colgate that dentist offices sell for bleaching), and two other versions of 35% Carbamide Peroxide solution...</li>
            <li> much higher than other products used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I moved last year and my new dentist offers only Zoom which requires hours of bleaching time...</li>
            <li> I hope this works better for other folks as I wasted $500.</li>
            <li> The bleaching process may take a little longer but it is worth it to alleviate these issues.    </li>
            <li> this stuff from green dot sales did nothing--not the real thing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to order the product sold for sensitive gums, or a lower concentrated version next time.</li>
            <li> the subsequent sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Opulence comes out of tube gummy and solid like it may be old.</li>
            <li> I could barely brush my teeth for fear of hitting my gums.</li>
            <li> You just need to be careful to not use too much.  </li>
            <li> Have to be careful in how much you put in the trays.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, but the gum irritation was rather substantial--not enough to make me discontinue, but enough for me to say ouch for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, instead of applying the product to the trays and putting them in your mouth, apply the whitener directly to your teeth and put an un-moulded tray over so it doesn&#x27;t get on your upper lip.</li>
            <li> I used typical dentist distribution the first time I purchased Opalescence, and left the molds on all night while sleeping.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little more expensive, but I&#x27;m no longer even interested in trying anything else.</li>
            <li> My guess is it is hard to get right to the gum line without burning.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only needed to whiten every other month, but my teeth are not &amp;#34;movie-star&amp;#34; white.  </li>
            <li> I got sensitive teeth and gums, yet no whitening effect (I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now - every other day)</li>
            <li> Seemed older as it was a little dense and not free flowing like a new one should be</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t last long 1/2 an hour or so</li>
            <li> Will affect gums if left on too long.</li>
            <li> I have ordered previous kits on Amazon and saw results in one day which was unexpected, so I wasn&#x27;t quite expecting that from this product.</li>
            <li> With this concentration level though, as long as you&#x27;re not particularly sensitive, you are only supposed to wear them for 1/2 an hour.</li>
            <li> Bad value, nice taste.</li>
            <li> (1)  It will be pretty uncomfortable for someone with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> (3) I have had some uneven bleaching thus far.  </li>
            <li> There are questions about long term use of whitening products</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard for them to give you your moneys worth when you know that they are getting the gel for less than what I paid here?</li>
            <li> 30 seconds later little white burns burns on my gums.</li>
            <li> 20 minutes later, I applied half the tube...</li>
            <li> Seriously, ghost white and you will need to chill a bit to give your gums time to turn back to red.  </li>
            <li> like back in the dark ages!  </li>
            <li> Do not overapply or the gel will burn your gums and turn them white for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From what I researched and the Denist&#x27;s input, results widely vary.</li>
            <li> I got my whitener a few days back.</li>
            <li> , I saw about equal results with the 10%, but it took a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Read instructions carefully</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true it will burn your gums if you apply to much, I lasted 10 minutes and then had to rinse, sooo painful!  </li>
            <li> as I expected compared with other whiteners.</li>
            <li> : don&#x27;t use every day, this should be used every other day.</li>
            <li> I notice some discomfort in my back teeth after removing the trays but it is usually gone by an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> The product is the same as I purchased in the past from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I saw visible results within just a couple days use of other products from amazon so either</li>
            <li> Also try and place some (a little)of the whitener in the tray where your teeth meet each other or after you load the tray</li>
            <li> and  my other dentist I used before I moved.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> then my dentist had given me and the potency was way higher which I figured what can be wrong with that.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully other reviewers mentioned the amount of time to leave the bleach on since no instructions were included from the company that sent the product.  </li>
            <li> I assume this was due to the length of time</li>
            <li> I saw very minimal change in my teeth color</li>
            <li> With the 35%, its only half an hour!!</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with my purchase failed to indicate how much gel was to be used during each bleaching session.  </li>
            <li> to an hour, having a &#x27;thinner&#x27; solution that keeps seeping out of the trays (and thus the &#x27;gel/spit&#x27; ratio decreases, spit being the victor) cuts down on the effectiveness of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions from my previous uses with the 15% and 20% concentrations, using a half of a syringe per treatment.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight difference.</li>
            <li> and also I had slight bleeding along the gum line...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 15% solution for a year and bought the 35% solution thinking it would take less time to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> So the application will still be a little uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think dont do a thorough brushing or floss and use a little Vaseline on gums to prevent burning</li>
            <li> But it was always an ordeal and messy</li>
            <li> I have used the Opalescence whitening line for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have a few spots on my front teeth that are whiter than the rest of the tooth.  </li>
            <li> I finished my Invisalign treatment a few weeks ago and my orthodontist gave me 2 tubes of 35% Opalescence to try.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you will have issues with uneven application and gum burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the whitner within a few days of ordering.  </li>
            <li> worse is that it definitely will make your gums tender for a couple</li>
            <li> Right after a 30-minute treatment, I use a flouride treatment to dull the sensitivity to air and cold things, and that helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Yes the syringes are a little small</li>
            <li> : the burn hurts pretty bad, if you wipe off the gel as soon as it gets on your gums, the pain goes away</li>
            <li> The first couple times i used this it was almost too painful to wear.    </li>
            <li> I applied twice a day for at least half the time&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t apply enough and after 1, 30 minute treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why that was.</li>
            <li> I loke this product, but again, the 35% is WAY too strong for the average user and the white gums are both shocking to look at and painful in the process.</li>
            <li> and my teeth lightened up by at least 3 shades.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive than buying from my dentist....</li>
            <li> and the pain isn&#x27;t unbearable just a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased my whitening products through a dentist but hated to pay so much.  </li>
            <li> (Duh!)</li>
            <li> This product was weak and ineffective hence the reduced cost.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed about this purchase.</li>
            <li> A thin even line in the molds so that everything gets covered, but I don&#x27;t have stuff oozing out the edges.    </li>
            <li> I hate wearing the tray overnight and with the 35% I only have to wear it 30 minutes.   </li>
            <li> so I automatically assumed I did something wrong.</li>
            <li> and I did find an uncomfortable sensitivity in my teeth after use.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s because I forced myself, it was actually painful.  </li>
            <li> But please don&#x27;t be afraid to take the leap.</li>
            <li> 1- I got a bad batch, or</li>
            <li> I notice some people claim how painful it was for them</li>
            <li> However, without custom dental trays it can burn very badly.</li>
            <li> BUT...the amount in each tube is pathetic.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not s whitening as I expected compared with other whiteners.</li>
            <li> I was leery that this wouldn&#x27;t be the real product, but it is! I paid $75 for this at my dentist, so this is a great bargain by comparison.  I&#x27;ll definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> Fab I loved this product. it arrived quickly and works well. I have recommended this to many of my friends and will carry on doing so</li>
            <li> This is great for those who dont want to leave a tray on all night...it works great and I am very happy with it.  My smile has been made over in a matter of weeks! You will definitely see a difference with each use. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is clearly superior with it&#x27;s 35% peroxide as opposed to drug store products which run about 15%.    However, without custom dental trays it can burn very badly. The first couple times i used this it was almost too painful to wear.    But, it can work without the custom trays. Here&#x27;s my advice: don&#x27;t use every day, this should be used every other day. Secondly, instead of applying the product to the trays and putting them in your mouth, apply the whitener directly to your teeth and put an un-moulded tray over so it doesn&#x27;t get on your upper lip. this worked well for me, the bleach still gets on my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t leak and burn the hell out of my gums.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased my whitening products through a dentist but hated to pay so much.  This product is what I was getting from the dentist and seems to do the same job for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Works great and fast but is VERY strong so don&#x27;t wear it for too long</li>
            <li> I had custom trays made for my teeth several years ago and had used the 15% and 20% Opalescence several times with good results.  But it was always an ordeal and messy and I was naturally discouraged and felt it was a pain.    So yesterday during a visit to the dentist whenshe mentioned that Opalascence had a 35% option, I was tempted to buy it.  FOR $35.  I came home and found that I could get it online for $10 to $16.  But the product is amazing.  I just used it once for 30 minutes and the results are just out of this world.  I have already developed the whiteness that I would have normally had after a week of using the weaker solutions.    I know dentists are wretched thiefs and bandits and it would cost an arm and a leg for custom trays.  But the results are so fantastic, that it is to be seen to believe.</li>
            <li> seller was easy to work with, the bleach was too strong could bearly use it!</li>
            <li> just like what the dentist sells....but a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> fELT THE OPALESCENCE GEL REFILL KIT WAS DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND MUCH BETTER PACKAGING WITH THE CORRECT % UNLIKE LAST VENDOR.</li>
            <li> I have used the milder 15% concentration of Opalescence without a problem, but the 35% solution burned my gums within minutes of its use. I&#x27;ll need to order the product sold for sensitive gums, or a lower concentrated version next time.</li>
            <li> I used opalescence 10% with *custom made case* before. Now I got the 35% refill, which has a much shorter application time. The effect is very impressive. The downside is I have to tolerate the side effect.... the subsequent sensitive teeth. Using a anti-sensitive toothpaste can decrease the sensitivity to a certain extend. BTW I love the short application time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware, if you apply too much, it can bleach your gum to white too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product delivery time is also very quick!</li>
            <li> OK...it did not hurt my gums...BUT...the amount in each tube is pathetic.  I was hardly able to get two and half fills out of each tube and that is going very carefully. Bad value, nice taste.</li>
            <li> First, I am pleased to report that while a couple of the reviewers mentioned a burning sensation from this product, I did not.      I have always used Opalescence 15%, but there is a distinct acceleration in the efficacy of Opalescence 35%. I had for years gotten the 15% product directly from the dentist who had made my molds. So, I was happy to find that Amazon carried a higher concentration of this product with a much lower time requirement for results.    To think ~ I used to wear my mouth molds overnight! With this concentration level though, as long as you&#x27;re not particularly sensitive, you are only supposed to wear them for 1/2 an hour. That&#x27;s a step in the right direction! With Oplaescence 35% I saw distinct whitening improvement after only two uses.</li>
            <li> I had my custom trays made by my dentist &amp; was given the 15% Opelescence. It whitened and brightened my teeth after only 4 days but my teeth ached from the sensitivity for days on end! (I have always had sensitive teeth.) I couldn&#x27;t continue using the product. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this is the best whitening gel on the market but you MUST get custom trays from your dentist that fit properly. A good tip is to store the gel in the refrigerator. It keeps the gel&#x27;s whitening concentration from depleting and the syringes will be good for at least a year.</li>
            <li> I have used the Opalescence whitening line for a few months.  I used both 15% which I had to wear overnight and the 20% which is worn for an hour a day.  I started using the 35% concentration because I really did not like wearing my dental trays overnight -- they hindered my sleep quite a bit.  In addition, I liked the idea of only wearing the trays for 30 minutes each day (as opposed to the hour for the 20% concentration).      I have used the 35% for about a week and am seeing great results already.  I really like the product but would mention a few precautions to those looking to try it:    (1)  It will be pretty uncomfortable for someone with sensitive teeth.  I notice some discomfort in my back teeth after removing the trays but it is usually gone by an hour or so.  Sometimes the discomfort lasts longer but it is manageable.    (2)  Using too much gel can cause your gums to burn.  The instructions that came with my purchase failed to indicate how much gel was to be used during each bleaching session.  I followed the instructions from my previous uses with the 15% and 20% concentrations, using a half of a syringe per treatment.  This was too much.  Despite having custom trays (which is a MUST with this system), the excess gel burned my gums in some places turning them white.  The whiteness from the burn is gone in an hour and really is not uncomfortable but considering there was enough gel to reach the gums, it is pretty wasteful to use that much.  Consequently, I now attempt to get 2.5-3 treatments per syringe.  This has eliminated the potential for burning and reduced the discomfort associated with the high concentration.  The bleaching process may take a little longer but it is worth it to alleviate these issues.    (3) I have had some uneven bleaching thus far.  I have a few spots on my front teeth that are whiter than the rest of the tooth.  From afar, this is not noticable but close up, it is obvious.  I still have many treatments to go and am assuming itwill all even out over time (it is already better now than it was 1-2 days after I started last week).    (4)  Lastly, as I noted above, I would only recommend this treatment with custom molded trays.  As I noted above, I have had some unevenness in my whitening thus far and cannot help but believe that this issue would be compounded if I did not have custom trays (and would be much harder to correct).    All in all, I am very pleased after a week of using this product.  I gave it 4 stars only because I think the instructions should be more clear (i.e., how much gel is appropriate).  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great whitening product, excluding those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have the custom made trays from the dentist and ended up with white gums-I was trying to whiten my teeth!  The white gums went away but they were burned and are still sore. I just hope the damage isnt permanent.  I think its best to use the 15% solution, if that is safe. There are questions about long term use of whitening products so I am very leery about them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before after purchasing it from my dentist office, this time I purchased it online and it was not the same.  It burned my gums and my throat.  I would stick to buying it from a dental office.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT STUFF!!! I purchased 4 tubes about a year ago, and still have one tube left. It works great and really whitens your teeth...  I recommend!</li>
            <li> I finished my Invisalign treatment a few weeks ago and my orthodontist gave me 2 tubes of 35% Opalescence to try. I&#x27;ve been using my Viviera retainers as the molded retainers to hold the gel to my teeth. The first application i used 1/4 of the tube and applied sparingly to avoid the gel getting on my gums. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t apply enough and after 1, 30 minute treatment i had uneven whitening on my canines (at least I could see how effective the 30 minute treatment was!). 20 minutes later, I applied half the tube... 30 seconds later little white burns burns on my gums. That was user error... so far I&#x27;m liking the results!   *side note: the burn hurts pretty bad, if you wipe off the gel as soon as it gets on your gums, the pain goes away</li>
            <li> I have used the 35% Opalescence gel for over a year with great success.  I began teeth whitening thru my dentist about 3 years ago.  He created custom trays for me and I started with 10% concentration.  I moved onto 15 and 20% as they became available.  I am very happy with the 35% concentration which I use once per week and leave on for 20 to 30 minutes.  I follow the instructions precisely as many of the reviewers suggest, and have had no ill effects to my gums or my teeth.      I moved last year and my new dentist offers only Zoom which requires hours of bleaching time... like back in the dark ages!  This situation prompted me to go inline get the good stuff and so here I am.</li>
            <li> With products as this, it is best to precursor the review with some instruction and expectation setting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions:&lt;br /&gt;--This product is meant to be used as a refill to custom trays fitted by your dentist. Otherwise, you will have issues with uneven application and gum burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Application muust follow instructions that are provided. Do not overapply or the gel will burn your gums and turn them white for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expectations:&lt;br /&gt;--At the end of the day, research suggests that the 35% whitens as much as the 15%. The difference is twofold: The 35% needs to onlt stay on for 30 minutes, but the 15% needs to stay on an hour. Second, the 35% will get your teeth whiter faster. E.g., if it takes 12 weeks for the 15% to get to the desired whitening, it may take 8 weeks for the 35%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The 35% will make your teeth more sensitive than 15%. For me, it was worth the extra sensitivity to get faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It takes time! Results do not occur overnight for most people. Expect 12-16 weeks, applying once a day at night for 30 minutes. If it occurs faster, use the remaining gel to periodically keep them white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The gum line part of the tooth may still be yellowish. My guess is it is hard to get right to the gum line without burning. So the application will still be a little uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had noticable results after 4 weeks, from 2-4 shades. One tooth was 4 shades, most were 3, and the rest were 1 to 2. I am under Dentist care for the entire process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 4 week period, the Dentist was highly pleased with the progress. I was pleased as well. After 6 weeks, though, the progress seemed slower, and the lower teeth are still too yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, one issue remains: one upper front tooth would not whiten well. It had undergone tramua when I was young. So, the 2 upper front teeth will need veneers. Right now it is a race to whiten as much as possible toget the whitest shade of veneers possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method:&lt;br /&gt;-- I used 12) 15% gel for 6 weeks that the denstist provided&lt;br /&gt;-- I used (8)35% gel for 4 weeks that I bought from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;-- I applied twice a day for at least half the time&lt;br /&gt;-- I used between 1/3 to 1/2 of the syringe per application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, you have to be patient and not expect quick results. Some teeth will whiten faster and others may not whiten much at all. From what I researched and the Denist&#x27;s input, results widely vary. However, you should certainly see viable results and the effort is not hard. 30 minutes after bushing and flossing is pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with the low ratings for this product. Just because someone does not use the product properly, does not reflect on the product quality. Results based on non-custom trays are invalid in my opinion and should not reflect on the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given a 5 star, but I felt somehow they need to get the gel to the gumline without burning, providing full tooth coverage.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but DO NOT USE without having a custom dental tray from a dentist. The make-it-yourself kit that you can buy with this product does not work well enough. I burned my gums when I tried the mouth guards I bought with this kit. Using a dental tray I had no problem....get the professional dental tray (from your dentist)!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this product YEARS ago.  I do have a fitted/custom tray and originally used this product to whiten all of my teeth before getting front tooth veneers.  GREAT prod!  I do agree with the sensitivity factor and the gel will burn your gums.  Use sparingly and be paitent.  You will be AMAZED with your new bright smile :)</li>
            <li> I received the whitner within a few days of ordering.  The product is the same as I purchased in the past from my dentist. This is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I burned the living hell out of my gums with the 35%.  Do yourself a favor and go with 20%.</li>
            <li> Just got them today. Was worried from older reviews that they might not work but then I checked and every recent review this year has great reviews. They definitely work in a short time period! I wore it for about 60 mins. Lots of white spots on my teeth...I think those will go away but I&#x27;m excited that they are stronger (and I can tell they are) then the 20% I was using. Getting a lot of dental work done next week and want to whiten my smile as much as possible before getting some crowns. :)</li>
            <li> The boilable trays work OK but you need to keep in water for 10-15 seconds for a better mold.  Used 3/4 syringe the first time and needed to remove within minutes. Tried again with 1/2 syringe as it was OK but still burned a good deal.  Caution - if you do not have good mold or get the gel evenly placed, your teeth will whiten unevenly AND your gums will turn ghost-white.  Seriously, ghost white and you will need to chill a bit to give your gums time to turn back to red.  Likely an excellent product but definitely WAY too strong for the average user.  I have head the 15-20% work better and more uniformly.  I also tried the Aquafresh pre-filled molds and had great suggest.  I loke this product, but again, the 35% is WAY too strong for the average user and the white gums are both shocking to look at and painful in the process.</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I know that the key to success in tooth whitening is to have a properly made custom-fitted tray, and the right concentration of bleaching gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product markets a 35% Carbamide-Peroxide bleaching gel. The 35% concentration is considered extremely strong in comparison to the concentrations available.  Most at-home systems use a 10-15% concentration of Carbamide Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MAJOR drawback to this system is that it assumes that you have a custom-moulded bleaching tray, which is essential to using this product correctly and safely.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CUSTOM-MOULDED MOUTH TRAY, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  A custom-moulded tray must fit the teeth precisely and must not allow the bleaching gel to leak from the tray.  A properly moulded tray will have a reservior for the gel, and a contoured scalloped border that prevents the gel from coming into contact with the gum tissues.  (Sustained contact of the bleaching gel with gum tissues will result in a white chemical burn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product does not have a custom tray, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it therefore giving it an overall score of 2-stars.  However, if you have a custom-moulded tray (not an at-home heat moulded (boiled) system), this is an effective product if used in moderation and according to instructions (in that case I give it 3 stars).  I actually think that a 20% bleaching solution is too strong to be used unsupervised.  A 20% solution will likely cause tooth sensitivity and has the additional likelihood of causing chemical burns of the gums.  It must be used with caution and restraint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that Crest and others offer a tray-less system (no gel), as the gel is impregnated in the adhesive strip that is applied to the teeth.  These systems work well and are fairly cheap to use.  The advantage with the custom-made tray system is that you can use a variety of different bleaching gel strengths, some of which are much stronger than the adherant strip systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig (dentist)Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig (dentist)</li>
            <li> I used 22% from my dentist and wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with the results. My dentist didn&#x27;t even tell me that there was a stronger formula out there so when I found it here I jumped on it and even after using the 22% for 4 months  one application of the 35% was amazing!!!!!  My teeth are as white as what I thought they should have been after spending over 300$$ at my dentist office. Why is it so hard for them to give you your moneys worth when you know that they are getting the gel for less than what I paid here? Oh well, lesson learned, get your whitening gel here and if you aren&#x27;t sensitive go for the 35 %. You&#x27;ll be glad that you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product positively before.  Now they&#x27;ve decreased the time needed to have the product on the teeth which is really wonderful.  Originally recommended by my dentist who made my trays, it works well and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first bleaching session with this product and, in all honesty, I have used whitening products from aquafresh, crest, colgate (including the version from colgate that dentist offices sell for bleaching), and two other versions of 35% Carbamide Peroxide solution...But Opalescence has been the best so far. The viscosity of the solution keeps the stuff in the mouth trays (mine are custom-made) better. I think anyone who bleaches their teeth will likely agree that the solution, the feel of the trays, and the occasional burning or stinging if there&#x27;s too much product around one area of the gumline will make you salivate more than usual. (Duh!) Other products were notably thinned out or almost totally dissipated by the time I&#x27;d had the trays in for the recommended length of time for each. I would say there&#x27;s an element of truth to assuming that, unless you can stop making saliva for 30 min. to an hour, having a &#x27;thinner&#x27; solution that keeps seeping out of the trays (and thus the &#x27;gel/spit&#x27; ratio decreases, spit being the victor) cuts down on the effectiveness of the treatment. A &#x27;thicker&#x27; solution such as Opalescence pretty much didn&#x27;t budge. I rinsed after the first time I used this product (which was, as I stated, just now and I was so impressed I leapt online-this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written-it was THAT GOOD) a tactic which usually cleaned out most of the residue from the other bleaching gels I&#x27;ve used, and found that there was still a decent layer on my teeth for me to brush off. Yes the syringes are a little small and it&#x27;s a little more expensive, but I&#x27;m no longer even interested in trying anything else. Opalescence will be the only bleaching product I buy from here on out. If you&#x27;re on the fence about what brand to buy or whether you should bleach (though if you&#x27;ve never bleached before, perhaps try the lower percentage) I&#x27;d recommend this brand to anyone and it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I used this to whiten my teeth fast in preparation for dental work.  It worked but with a price.  I used the custom trays but still my gums were red and irritated.  The dentist was satisfied with the whitening but ended up prescribing a mouthwash designed  to heal my gums (at $18 a pop that was an ouch.)  The 20% is better.</li>
            <li> I love Opalescence.  I have used the whitening gel for over a year, and have loved it.  I had been using the 22% and it worked great, but the 35% took my tooth whitening to a new level!  WOW!  I must get 4 or 5 complimets PER DAY on my white smile.  Thanks Opallescence and Aplussmile!</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked great for me.  Perfect for my custom trays. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try it.</li>
            <li> Great product but don&#x27;t fall asleep with this product in your mouth or your teeth bill be tender for two days of hell.  However, this product is the easiest and neatest product (for their tubes) in regards to the gel.  Good order!</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of teeth whitening products. I really like this product because you only apply it to your teeth for 1/2 hour. Quick and I can see the results because of the 35 percent peroxide mix . . . much higher than other products used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I saw very minimal change in my teeth color and I purchased the strongest strength..I&#x27;m not sure why that was.</li>
            <li> I have used every tooth whitener product there is. This is by far the best way to whiten you teeth fast!!!</li>
            <li> It works well with the custom trays from my dentist and cost about 1/2 what he charges even with S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> Works very good, but the way that I used it, it&#x27;s not working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it all night long, and 35% it&#x27;s to strong ( I use to get 15%).&lt;br /&gt;My teeth became so sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just keep it for 2-3 hours at most, and works perfect.&lt;br /&gt; I am a coffee drinker, so I need to use whitening to help to get rid of those stains.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about 2 months ago and I feel like that was ample time before coming to a conclusion about it. After one day I saw no results at all. I have ordered previous kits on Amazon and saw results in one day which was unexpected, so I wasn&#x27;t quite expecting that from this product. After one week of use I still saw no results. A month later, still no results. I saw visible results within just a couple days use of other products from amazon so either 1- I got a bad batch, or 2- this just doesn&#x27;t work. I see plenty of reviews on  here talking about how great it is so I automatically assumed I did something wrong. I used new trays, tried with/ without light, tried using accelerator. Nothing seemed to work for me. Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed about this purchase. Was looking for something with a better price and higher quantity so I tried something new this time. Guess I&#x27;ll go back to the product I used to order on here.</li>
            <li> Opulence comes out of tube gummy and solid like it may be old.</li>
            <li> I got my whitener a few days back. I used it 3 times so far. There is a slight difference. It beats the no difference I got from the crest white strips premium. As others noted, if you use too much, it burns your gums. I had no tooth sensativity though.</li>
            <li> If you have your own teeth molds, this is a great product for a refresher.    I used typical dentist distribution the first time I purchased Opalescence, and left the molds on all night while sleeping. (Instructions said 8 hours.) They worked okay, but it took a few weeks to see results. I don&#x27;t know what the concentration was on those.    I put these on for four hours minimum, and in about 2 or 3 days I can see noticeable improvement. There were no adverse side effects.    That said, I&#x27;m not caking this stuff on either. I&#x27;m judicious in it&#x27;s use. A thin even line in the molds so that everything gets covered, but I don&#x27;t have stuff oozing out the edges.    In both cases there was rare sensitivity (after the fact) but it didn&#x27;t last long, and was quite rare.    I always floss a couple times and brush a couple times before using, to make sure nothing is in the way. And of course, brush and rinse very well after use.    I did expect greater results with these, and got improved response but not what the expectation was. The first set I used (from the dentist) had an effervescence going on - I could tell it was working. I did not get that kind of effect here at all. It didn&#x27;t feel like a \\&quot;high powered\\&quot; version of the product, but it did work better than the previous.    I think that proper molds are important so that you have a good fit against your teeth, otherwise you&#x27;d be filling the gaps with product in order to get any kind of result (and probably burning your gums in the meantime).</li>
            <li> Did not work!!! At all... Seemed like the product was expired and there&#x27;s no way to tell since there is no expiration date</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping for miracles considering I smoke and drink quite a bit of coffee.But it certainly helped get my teeth whither, and if I knew how to attach my pics (dummy) I would, to show so  you what to expect.But please don&#x27;t be afraid to take the leap.It works though, A couple of things though is don&#x27;t put too much on,it will run over the top and burn your gums and turn your gums whiter than your teeth will ever be! Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t last long 1/2 an hour or so and the pain isn&#x27;t unbearable just a little uncomfortable.Also try and place some (a little)of the whitener in the tray where your teeth meet each other or after you load the tray give it a minute then I shift the tray gently side to side to get better cover and fill any gap&#x27;s it&#x27;s not covering.The longest I left it on was about 45 minutes,better results than 1/2 an hour but when you go to brush your teeth it&#x27;s gonna be sensitive so a softer brush my be handy in those day&#x27;s.Before I ordered this stuff I asked my denist and there hygienists if this is really the same thing they use and  my other dentist I used before I moved.Not to mention googleing the he&#x27;ll out of it.And it is the same product,they were using  though at 20% and almost $300.00. Granted there results might be better than mine I can&#x27;t afford so I&#x27;ll never know, but this way I can touch up teeth any time I need.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great, fast-acting teeth whitening solution, Opalescence is the product I recommend. I have tried it over a few weeks and results are just excellent. Just make sure you follow the instructions and your smile will be brighter than ever. It&#x27;s my case.</li>
            <li> The product is very strong so you just have to make sure that your teeth guards are cut away from your gums because they will burn a bit! (so I found out)  Other than that, I kept the guard on for about 40 minutes and I am thrilled with the result! I will undoubtedly be purchasing this product again!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Very strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful!  It&#x27;s true it will burn your gums if you apply to much, I lasted 10 minutes and then had to rinse, sooo painful!  The next night I applied small drops to each of my front teeth and put my custom trays in, so much better!  Love that 30 minutes is all it takes as my trays really aggravate my TMJ.  Would order from them again.</li>
            <li> I had used the lesser strength of Opalescence from the dentist years ago and remembered how it gave your teeth a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like pearls.  I had ordered another (stronger) product from another company with great disappointment as while it lightened okay &#x3D; it just did not give my teeth the glow that this does.  I had first heard about this wonderful product from one of my clients (a dentist&#x27;s wife) whose teeth were stunning!  There is simply no other product out there that will give your teeth better lifting or better results.  Period.</li>
            <li> I did not see the noticeable lift I was looking for and I did find an uncomfortable sensitivity in my teeth after use.</li>
            <li> I began using this product with fitted imprints from my dentist. I have used all of the different strengths and they all give excellent results. My dentist always advises me to only bleach the front 6 of my teeth, top and bottom, not all of the teeth. Be aware before using it of the amount you put into the bleaching fitting, especially with the 35%. Obviously, it is a stronger mixture of ingredients and if you use too much, it will burn your gums if you have too much in the tray. It doesn&#x27;t take much of the gel to cover the teeth when putting the trays in place over the teeth. If you use all of the strengths wisely, you will have excellent results!!!</li>
            <li> Initially I was given the Opalescence 10% Teeth Whitening from my dentist along with custom molds that he made for me.  They worked great over the weeks that I was doing my routine.   Years later my teeth starting to fade back I decided that I should whiten again, I found this product which was the same brand and a lower cost then my dentist had given me and the potency was way higher which I figured what can be wrong with that.  Immediately I noticed that my gums along with my teeth were turning white and also I had slight bleeding along the gum line... but man my teeth were white so its a trade-up but I definately do not have sensitive teeth and/or gums and this happened to me.</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with the opalescence PF35% Teeth Whitening.Irecommend it to anyone who want white teeth. The product does what it says. And the  shipping was very,very fast!   THANKS AGAIN....</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews prior to ordering this product was very useful.  I have custom bleaching trays and was prepared for some gum irritation.  Thankfully other reviewers mentioned the amount of time to leave the bleach on since no instructions were included from the company that sent the product.  I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, but the gum irritation was rather substantial--not enough to make me discontinue, but enough for me to say ouch for a few minutes.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just the nature of my teeth, but it still seems to take a while to see results.  I used the opalescence [15% I think] before and after I had the Zoom treatment at the dentist [prepping for a couple of veneers].  I like the product and it does seem to whiten but I echo the others in that having custom bleaching trays is essential [and expect some burning/tooth sensitivity].</li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence before, but never 35%.  My gums were sooo tender after only 4 hours of use and never with the lesser concentrations.  I could barely brush my teeth for fear of hitting my gums. For 4 days after using!! It tore them up!!  (some had gotten on my gums when I initially put the trays in and I wiped it off but still........)</li>
            <li> You just need to be careful to not use too much.  Will affect gums if left on too long.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than buying from my dentist.... Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff my dentist sells to his customers.    Just use as directed and you&#x27;ll see great results in no time at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I used the 10% concentration from my dentist (who charged $60!!! rip off!), I saw about equal results with the 10%, but it took a few weeks.  And I had to wear the trays overnight.  With the 35%, its only half an hour!! Its a lot nicer.  Considering I have to wear orthodontic retainers at night.    DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE CUSTOM MADE TRAYS FROM YOUR DENTIST!!! They cost $100 from mine, but they are well worth it!!! Do not buy the do-it-yourself trays!!!   This product works MAGIC if you get the custom tray!!</li>
            <li> The girl likes it. I notice improvements. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Considerably cheaper to buy it this way, than to buy via your dentist. In England you can only buy this product from a dentist, anything else doesn&#x27;t contain the hydrogen peroxide. So it was well worth the wait and I am familiar with this product.</li>
            <li> Oh, MAN...this stuff really works..and FAST! One 30-minute session definitely lightened and brightened my teeth to a noticeable degree - way more than Crest White Strips ever did. There&#x27;s enough in these 4 tubes to get my teeth &amp;#34;movie star white&amp;#34; if I could stand 8 treatments in a row, but this stuff is so strong that the tips of my front teeth become ultra sensitive to air and to anything cold, and my gums bleed quite a bit, so I am only able to use Opalescence once every 4 days (after my gums fully heal and the tooth sensitivity has worn off). Right after a 30-minute treatment, I use a flouride treatment to dull the sensitivity to air and cold things, and that helps a lot. This is the best $17 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time! :)</li>
            <li> Works fast.  It is a little harsh on the gums, but I have custom molded trays, so I just reduced the amount of gel and now everything is great.</li>
            <li> This does work great. Have to be careful in how much you put in the trays.( burnt gums)&lt;br /&gt;Love the product.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive so I tried this and it was awesome.  I hate wearing the tray overnight and with the 35% I only have to wear it 30 minutes.   I notice some people claim how painful it was for them and they had it on for hours (?).   Directions say only 30 minutes for the 35%!  and only use 1/3 to 1/2 syringe at a time.  I follow the directions, had no pain and my teeth are SO much whiter.</li>
            <li> WOW - does this work.  DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT get it on your gums.  OUCH times 100 !!!</li>
            <li> My dentist took impressions and made custom trays.  I started out with 10% with no results and ending up using 35% for three months.  No change.  Then my dentist did an in-office whitening treatment (only charging for materials), still no results.  I hope this works better for other folks as I wasted $500.</li>
            <li> I tried this product once before and I still feel it has no whitening component!</li>
            <li> This product stung my gums, turned them completely white, and did not whiten my teeth at all.    I&#x27;m going to stick to Rembrandt 2 Hour Whitening, which is what I usually use, and have been very happy with.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s very strong and will whiten your teeth in thirty minutes. This is my second time purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and it works wonders without paying a lot of money to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and it really works...fast and does well...nice and white</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product for whitening your teeth&lt;br /&gt;for the best price out there. It is gentle on your gums also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one week now.&lt;br /&gt;I got it at my last dental visit.  My teeth and gums are both in great shape (floss everyday)&lt;br /&gt;but I wanted whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist gave me this product.  Made professional modes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I used the 35% daily for the first 3 days and was amazed at how well it worked.  I would say&lt;br /&gt;my teeth in those 3 days improved by 3 - 4 shades...&lt;br /&gt;But!&lt;br /&gt;The product does get on your gums (I would leave it in for 30 - 40 minutes as recommended).&lt;br /&gt;It may turn parts of your gums white (which my dentist did warn me about)... It goes away&lt;br /&gt;within one hour...&lt;br /&gt;But worse is that it definitely will make your gums tender for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use for 2 days and applied it again.&lt;br /&gt;I can say my teeth are now amazingly white after a total of 5 treatments...&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use it about every 1 - 2 weeks now...&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this a 5/5 if not for the pain you very likely will encounter on your gums&lt;br /&gt;(even if they are in great shape!)</li>
            <li> the product is great and really works on whiting your teeth . Price wise much cheaper to purchase through you than your dentist</li>
            <li> After mega $$$ crowns and dental work, my dentist whitened my non-crowned teeth using this product.  I have custom molded trays for this product, and my dental office wanted $35.00 a tube for refills.  Yikes!  This is the same product available from my dentist.  I agree with others - this is a great REFILL product.  It can burn if your trays cause it to leak to your gums.  I use it for one hour and it does not cause sensitivity for me.  So far, I have only needed to whiten every other month, but my teeth are not &amp;#34;movie-star&amp;#34; white.  I just use enough to match my crowns.</li>
            <li> this gel works best with custom made trays and the toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> Works! Just put it in your retainer for 30 min.</li>
            <li> Stronger than the previously gel I used, but same brand issued by my dentist at a great savings. Only have to wear for 30 minutes and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Works just like the one you get at the dentist for a lot more money.  I will order again when this runs out</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good value</li>
            <li> Used this before from my dentist and loved the way it worked.  Was so happy to find it on Amazon much cheaper than the dentist and works just as well.</li>
            <li> The 35% works much better than the 10% and faster. Great product! Would highly recommend. Whiteness in gums goes away fairly quickly, don&#x27;t panic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 15% solution for a year and bought the 35% solution thinking it would take less time to whiten my teeth.  I ccould keep the 15% solution in overnight.  I kept the 35% solution for 45 minutes and that&#x27;s because I forced myself, it was actually painful.  My gums and teeth hurt for several days and I haven&#x27;t used it since.  It even bleached my gums around my front teeth.  My gums cleared up in 2 days.  Everytime I hit my gum while brushing for the next 2 days it bled.  I would purchase again but only the 20% solution.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference after just one use.  I was worried about gum sensitivity because lots of staining is on the bottoms and top of my teeth- but to make sure it covered the whole tooth I did the parts near my gums manually then I filled the tray and put it on for 1/2 hr.  Wow!  No irritation at all and my teeth lightened up by at least 3 shades.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got sensitive teeth and gums, yet no whitening effect (I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now - every other day)</li>
            <li> This is not the same product I purchased from the dentist years ago. This product was weak and ineffective hence the reduced cost. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is the same whitening system that I bought from my dentist but paid much more for it than what I paid on Amazon and this is a stronger strength. I used this with the custom trays that the dentist made for me and I found it works best if I use a finger and spread a tiny bit on each tooth carefully up to the gum line and then use a small amount of the gel in the trays because if you use too much, it will seep up into the gums and will burn them due to the strength of the gel. I noticed significant whitening after the third application and I wear the trays and gel for about 30 minutes once per day for about a week to get them really white and then follow up with a twice per week application when I notice them getting a bit stained again.</li>
            <li> Better price than my dentist who charges twice the price for a very similar product, I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years</li>
            <li> only trust buying from your dentist! this stuff from green dot sales did nothing--not the real thing!!</li>
            <li> Prompt &amp; as advertised. Read instructions carefully</li>
            <li> Seemed older as it was a little dense and not free flowing like a new one should be&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I used Opalescence 35 for the first time with professional trays created by my dentist, after using the 15% product originally. After just one 30-minute session, my teeth were much whiter as compared to a lighter crown created 22 years ago.  Hours and hours of using the 15% overnight did not produce nearly the same results, and actually made my teeth more sensitive than the 35. I assume this was due to the length of time involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that this is strong stuff, and it did burn and irritate my lower gums when I applied too much in the lower tray. I removed the tray when the burning was evident, wiped off the excess and resumed bleaching. The white discoloration of the gumline went away in 10 mins, but the gums were sore for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect great results with the 35 and better application!</li>
            <li> excellent, it really made my teeth white in less than 2 days of usage! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve try other brands and they make my teeth off white as opposed to the nice bright white that this product provides.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference but def a couple shades lighter</li>
            <li> Works fast but I think dont do a thorough brushing or floss and use a little Vaseline on gums to prevent burning</li>
            <li> Works great, but I didn&#x27;t realize how powerful 35% is!  I won&#x27;t buy such a high concentration again.  First use, I had it on overnight and burned my gums.  Maintains my color fine with an hour or so every few weeks.</li>
            <li> So depending on how sensitive you are, be careful when you order any Opalescence kit.  I went from the 20% to this, and this is borderline too strong.  I felt it burning my gums a bit and only left it on for 30 minutes.  The plus side, is it does work a lot better.  So if you can deal with the tingle, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
