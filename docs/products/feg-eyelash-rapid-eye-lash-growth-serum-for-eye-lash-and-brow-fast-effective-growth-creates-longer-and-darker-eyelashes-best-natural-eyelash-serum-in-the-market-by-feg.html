            <li>i recommend it and the customer service was so awesome</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using another brand for ages that works like freaking magic, but the price went up to something like $40 a tube.</li>
            <li>But I did lose way, way more than I&#x27;m used to and I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>Trying to return this item cost 3 times more than the purchase price..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t thicken as much as I&#x27;d like, but it lengthens really nice.</li>
            <li>That is rare on amazon!</li>
            <li>This really work to grow!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work i have purchased this 3 times already</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My lashes don&#x27;t seem much longer but they are fuller.</li>
            <li>Look, I don&#x27;t remember the frequency of normal lash fallout, so that could very well be what was happening.</li>
            <li>im actually out right now</li>
            <li>so it reminds me i need to get more seriously get this</li>
            <li>Personally I think these mainly work by preventing lash fallout, so your lashes are thicker and have time to grow longer.</li>

            <li> Total waste.</li>

            <li> Used for 6 weeks, see no differents.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> They do grow a tad longer after using this product for a while. Not sure if I would reinvest but this product does work but it takes time to see results.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work i have purchased this 3 times already im actually out right now so it reminds me i need to get more seriously get this i recommend it and the customer service was so awesome the lady personally called me PERSONALLY.....I was like whoa , ya know ? That is rare on amazon! Thanks</li>
            <li> Works ok. My lashes don&#x27;t seem much longer but they are fuller. I&#x27;m allergic to Latisse and this product does not Bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> This item I only used twice it&#x27;s hurts my eyes when 8 apply in my eyes led. Unlike the Rapid last that&#x27;s why I bought 2 in rapid but FEG NOT GOOD ITEMS. This item not good hurts your eyes. Waste of my money</li>
            <li> Nope. I&#x27;ve been using another brand for ages that works like freaking magic, but the price went up to something like $40 a tube. Thought I&#x27;d try this as a cheaper alternative and it did nothing. Personally I think these mainly work by preventing lash fallout, so your lashes are thicker and have time to grow longer. And this stuff? Look, I don&#x27;t remember the frequency of normal lash fallout, so that could very well be what was happening. It&#x27;s not like they all fell out or anything. But I did lose way, way more than I&#x27;m used to and I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Plus, it was runny. Total waste.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eye lashes grew within 3 weeks. They were a bit longer and thicker. After several weeks, I continued to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a least month and have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this thing works</li>
            <li> This really work to grow!</li>
            <li> I got results after one month, can hardly wait until next month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religously twice a day. And i noticed big difference to my lashes. Became thicker and longer. I recommend this product. But i should have bought 5pcs, so i dont have to order every month.</li>
            <li> Works great. I noticed a difference in less then a week.</li>
            <li> i have only been using this for a couple weeks and my lashes are longer and darker already.</li>
            <li> The initial application has a burning effect.. Trying to return this item cost 3 times more than the purchase price..</li>
            <li> Only been using this a couple of weeks.... I think it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t thicken as much as I&#x27;d like, but it lengthens really nice.</li>
