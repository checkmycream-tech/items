            <li>This is very easy on your teeth and does an excellent cleaning job.  </li>
            <li>- I LOVE IS THING!!</li>
            <li>My favorite brush heads!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice brush to use .</li>
            <li>It is very handy</li>
            <li>Working very nicely.</li>
            <li>Its very nice replacement brush for 15 bucks</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush and these replacent heads are great!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, my teeth are in better shape since I started using this toothbrush one year ago.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite and it is the best at removing plaque and messaging my gums.</li>
            <li>Now, they are remarkably whiter / brighter</li>
            <li>They seem to do an effective job!  </li>
            <li>Comes with lil colored markers so you can share the brush and just remove the head with your own!</li>
            <li>These brushes were the best price and were delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap deal, very good quality and a wellworth business.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with her \\&quot;gift\\&quot;, and I am very pleased with the great deal.</li>
            <li>These brush head replacements are good quality and they fit perfectly with my brush at home.  </li>
            <li>Loved this brush head for cleaning coffee stains off teeth.  </li>
            <li>These work great while the cheaper kind feel like they are shredding your gums.</li>
            <li>However, Amazon&#x27;s price beat theirs, and the shipping was free - a great bargain!</li>
            <li>This saves time and money and, to me, this is a good thing in this economy.</li>
            <li>This type brush head is doing a good job.</li>
            <li>Another reliable &amp; good purchase through Amazon.com  </li>
            <li>They perform good, but are over priced for what you get.  </li>
            <li>The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand.</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  </li>
            <li>this is a good product</li>
            <li>I think the whitening cups do work, of course in combination with a good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Its lifespan is good, and it cleans the teeth as it promised.</li>
            <li>it is a good thing for health care.</li>
            <li>Received in good condition.</li>
            <li>This was a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>And these replacement brushes fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>but I think Oral-B is a good brand.</li>
            <li>After a lot of comparison shopping for this product I have found that Amazon when your order is sufficient for free shipping has the best prices.</li>
            <li>these are good</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly and arrived timely.</li>
            <li>My teeth look good.  </li>
            <li>Good price as well.</li>
            <li>The price was good.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in good time.</li>
            <li>Quality good.</li>
            <li>Good price for something I use every day.  </li>
            <li>This is a good cleaning head</li>
            <li>I have annual check-ups/cleanings with my dentist, and they always say how good a shape my teeth are in.  </li>
            <li>She says it does a good job of cleaning her teeth without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value price wise.</li>
            <li>Brush heads do a good job cleaning teeth and messaging gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are good replacement heads and are cheaper on Amazon than in Rite-Aid.</li>
            <li>Good brush head.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li>Good replacement heads</li>
            <li>The floss bush they have was too good...</li>
            <li>Good product to remove plaque on teeth.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads for Oral B are really good and provide me with the tools to keep my teeth and gums at maximum health.  </li>
            <li>Just received a good report from my dental hygienist during my scheduled cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>Good value for a good and needed product.</li>
            <li>Good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>as good as advertised...</li>
            <li>His hygienist remarked at how good my teeth and gums looked this time around.  </li>
            <li>The heads fit the Oral b sonic perfectly.</li>
            <li>However, there will be no results if you don&#x27;t keep a good oral higiene.</li>
            <li>but this is a good deal for 3 replacement heads.</li>
            <li>looks good and works good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The price is really good for these brush heads.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and excellent product at a fair price!</li>
            <li>This one works the best for me as I get that sleek clean feeling on my teeth after I use it.</li>
            <li>Cleans exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>

            <li>i&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>THE BEST BRUSH HEAD - ORAL B PROFESSIONAL PROWHITE REPLACEMENT BRUSH.</li>
            <li>the floss action brush the best.  </li>
            <li>This product works exactly as described and I enjoy how it feels on my teeth and does a great job cleaning them!</li>
            <li>They work just as good as the polishing brushes used by my dentist to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great price to keep teeth clean the easy way.</li>
            <li>I loved the head that came with the Clean Precision 1000 when I bought it.</li>
            <li>This one does a good job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and are much cheaper than purchasing in the store.  </li>
            <li>good price with nice quality, worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a remarkably good head for getting your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>It polishes nicely but isn&#x27;t the best for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>Both of my parents are dentists and bushing has always been something very important to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of the replacement heads yet, but they&#x27;re easy to install and store nicely in the toothbrush holder/charger.</li>
            <li>We use this for remove coffee stain, it work very good so far.</li>
            <li>It provides the best and most comfortable brushing action of all I have tried.</li>
            <li>and it is ok</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>SO MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li>I bought the Oral-B 5000 from Amazon and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>i love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but it is even better with these heads.</li>
            <li>Love these polishers for every day use...</li>
            <li>I love this  Oral-B replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about being cheap and buying a knock off replacement please don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>Love these brushheads.</li>
            <li>I was concerned because I didn&#x27;t know if they will fit my Vitality brush, but they did!</li>
            <li>My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  </li>
            <li>This package was such a great deal for a three pack - I bought two to stock up!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it again and am very happy to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But I do love how polished they feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>What I like most about my Oral B is that is</li>
            <li>The results speak for themselves and there&#x27;s a reason top dentists recommend electric toothbrushes....</li>
            <li>I love this brush head.</li>
            <li>after these are over :)</li>
            <li>, these were OK</li>
            <li>I love these round-head bristles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this Prowhite but boy am I happy with it.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth and gums better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li>Teeth have never felt better or cleaner except at dentist office.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are top quality.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am still satisfied with my purchase and would recommend them.</li>
            <li>These are their standard replacement brush heads and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>i have used this style for many years and have never been disapointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe they are okay to use once in awhile.</li>
            <li>I love these with the polishing centers as well.</li>
            <li>Gets in those deeper places and fantastic around the gum line!</li>
            <li>This is the one my wife uses most of the time.</li>
            <li>Assume they will have a respectable service life.</li>
            <li>This product fully met my expectations and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Heads are Great!  </li>
            <li>There are many different types of replacement brush heads, but these are the best.  </li>
            <li>The Prowhite replacement brush heads are fabulous!  </li>
            <li>have been using the Oral-B tooth brush (and its accessories) for years and have been able to keep</li>
            <li>Excellent product and they last!</li>
            <li>Love my Oral-B</li>
            <li>And works much better than whitening toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li>Been using them for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased too.</li>
            <li>and I would hope Oral-B is on top of this.  </li>
            <li>Nice, brighter looking teeth that feel fresh-from-the-dentist smooth.</li>
            <li>Regardless, they are good heads but not as good as the floss action.</li>
            <li>Yes, we will buy more whenever these wear out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I do not have any more to say on this review.</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job of cleaning off stains.</li>
            <li>I find that this one does a better job than the others.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve gone back to the Prowhite and am very happy.</li>
            <li>I always love these heads.</li>
            <li>Again, wasting my time by making me add more words.</li>
            <li>I plan on letting you know more after my dentist visit.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve found it does a good job and am happy with the performance.  </li>
            <li>and I love my Oral B tooth brush and these refills.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see if I like them better over the life of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I have had an oral b toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the ones I&#x27;d been buying.</li>
            <li>but I literally love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this electric toothbrush, and the prowhite I ordered by mistake, but glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Just as well, since this is a better price than the stores used to offer.</li>
            <li>love how it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>oem parts i cant believe you need so many words before you can submit review.i</li>
            <li>I saw them on Amazon when I purchased a gift and decided the price was better.</li>
            <li>Over and over for many years.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way these brushes polish &amp; whiten my teeth, just like the dentist.</li>
            <li>The price was better than in store also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results and so is my dentist and his staff</li>
            <li>It make them feel so smooth and clean!!</li>
            <li>can say that I like these brush heads better than the original one!</li>
            <li>They were a great fit and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>was a decent price and the product is great.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice and clean after using this brush head.</li>
            <li>Oral B toothbrushes provide a vey effective way to clean your teeth between dental check ups that reduces the amount of plaque build up that I used to experience and the effort it took the hygienist to remove it.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean after use.  </li>
            <li>make the teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>and Amazon has a great price on these compared to a normal retail store or supermarket.</li>
            <li>and I just love it and buying the replacement heads is just as easy as brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I always get asked how my teeth are so white, and I just tell people all it takes is a good brush/brush-head and good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>They get your teeth so clean!  </li>
            <li>These work well to clean my teeth!  </li>
            <li>These fit great, were easy to get on and off, and lasted a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I wish more came in a pack but other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li>These tips are great and really give you a clean feeling, but the rotating head can hit your teeth if you&#x27;re not careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and feel great against my gums, as well.  </li>
            <li>this was a christmas gift and my son love this i brought for my son with his electric toothbrush and they fit,</li>
            <li>So far great toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This brush works great with the Oral-B Professional system.</li>
            <li>CVS charges way too much so this is a fair alternative.</li>
            <li>The brushes do a nice job giving you that fresh from the dentist cleaning, although I prefer the cleaning power of the &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; brush that came packaged with my Smartseries 5000.</li>
            <li>good product and fast service.</li>
            <li>The head does a good job at cleaning your teeth, but I haven&#x27;t really seen my teeth get any whiter over time.</li>
            <li>very happy with the brush heads since they are original and not some sort of cheaper generic product that doesn&#x27;t even fit in the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love my electric toothbrush - it makes my teeth sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>You can concentrate on each tooth and is easy to sense problem areas.</li>
            <li>It so easy and convenient to use</li>
            <li>These are easy to insert</li>
            <li>They are most like what the dental hygienists use after they clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of clean teeth, and you will too if you get these brushes.</li>
            <li>However, I have come to prefer the Sonic toothbrushes as they seem to clean my teeth better than the oral-b brush.</li>
            <li>MY DENTIST STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>Keeps my toothbrush going strong.</li>
            <li>Still going strong after 6 months.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>Probably fine.</li>
            <li>They work just fine.</li>
            <li>The fine print in the Oral B package insert says DON&#x27;T buy generics, but of course they say that because they will lose money if you do.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Luckily, Amazon to the rescue, they&#x27;re here!  </li>
            <li>They clean extremely well and of course fit the device perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They fit fine and do their job.</li>
            <li>They fit just fine.</li>
            <li>I own a Oral-B Pro 5000 Smart Series (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O8ODHOA?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I really love the way this head helps me to achieve a higher level of dental cleaning and care!  </li>
            <li>I used this head with oral B Smart Guide Traction 5000, from the second time I saw the difference, it was excellent.</li>
            <li>SO in all fairness, I&#x27;d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it.</li>
            <li>They arrived on schedule and fit my electric toothbrush as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to spray water into the hole and pull out the brush head from the body of the electric toothbrush to keep it algae free for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>Genuine product, works well.</li>
            <li>The timer is great, 30 second intervals until the 2 Min mark.</li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>just as i said above it does a great job of polishing and cleaning your teeth...</li>
            <li>I order these every 3 months, so I get the 15% savings, save a trip to the store, free shipping, plus it is a reminder to change out the toothbrush heads every 3 months.</li>
            <li>I purposely bought the cheapest of all available.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as the Gumcare, and I have to move the brush around a bit more than the Dual-action, but the rubber-center is doing a better job at pushing more toothpaste to polish my teeth.</li>
            <li>After that, you should replace it to ensure the bristle remain nice and straight.</li>
            <li>Would be a great item if it was actually the item that was shipped.</li>
            <li>Genuine Stuff.  </li>
            <li>It can fit my Oral B pro 1000 series brush with no problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not over night for sure, but when you can avoid harmful chemicals, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The concern was if this brush fit my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>These are direct replacements for the originals and work just as good. &#x27;</li>
            <li>Great product, it really polishes your teeth really well.</li>
            <li>They are far superior to the Sonicare brushes we used to have.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different brands and they never came close to the bright cleaning power of Oral B, and now Amazon offers them at the best low price to be able to always have extra refill heads for a great way to keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>so I can not give a good rating as far as using these brushes</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good with Braun.</li>
            <li>To take care of your own teeth the right way, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Really works!!!  </li>
            <li>It is very useful for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful</li>
            <li>These particular ones are the ones I love most.  </li>
            <li>The 5000 is really a professional machine,  and has more power available than you could ask for; an adjustment feature allows the user to  step-down the intensity of the brushing to a more comfortable level, if desired.</li>
            <li>purchase original oral b products it pays in quality.</li>
            <li>These are just like the original&#x27;s that came with the Oral-b brush.  </li>
            <li>Works great, wasn&#x27;t sure brush head could really make a difference, but switched to the prowhite brush head and about six months later my son and daughter-in-law both asked me if I had bleached my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I got these brush heads (on sale) as a replacement for the original brush head that came with my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no had this with the original head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Original replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more one of these days!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this yet (still using the original Oral-B brush head), but my hubby is and he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>I bought these heads for the first time and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Just like original that came with my Oral-B.</li>
            <li>They have stayed clean without having the fuzzy buildup I get throughout the day.</li>
            <li>There are generic replacement brushes available for this toothbrush, but these are good quality</li>
            <li>but they just don&#x27;t seem to clean as well as these.</li>
            <li>These replacements make my teeth feel extremely clean every time.</li>
            <li>My teeth do feel smoothe and clean after brushing with this</li>
            <li>However, these brush heads do give you squeaky clean teeth, and I have</li>
            <li>Leave your teeth thoroughly clean and shiny&lt;</li>
            <li>It seems to clean and polish</li>
            <li>I sometimes dip the heads in peroxide or mouthwash for 5 minutes to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>But I tried to go cheap and what I got was good only for scrubbing metal.</li>
            <li>But hey, it works and my teeth are clean</li>
            <li>MY TEETH FEEL CLEAN</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush/head that I&#x27;d say I \\&quot;loved\\&quot; as it is more just a daily routine kind of thing we all do,</li>
            <li>andmy teeth are so clean and whiter.</li>
            <li>These brushes do a good job of keeping my teeth white, and they make my teeth feel smooth -</li>
            <li>That keeps the brushes clean and usable.</li>
            <li>clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>clean feeling after brushing&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts</li>
            <li>It keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this brush head.</li>
            <li>if Amazon shipped the right one!</li>
            <li>The bristles dont work good, they are flimsy and the middle part had no bristles at all.</li>
            <li>The claim that your teeth will be noticably whiter in 21 days is certainly true.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if it actually does but the concept is good.</li>
            <li>I will choose the Floss Action heads every time because they get into the crevices quite nicely and distribute the toothpaste rather evenly.</li>
            <li>good enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It works well and lasts for a good 3-4 month with daily use.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Heads are durable, effective, with a quality build.  </li>
            <li>TO MAKE THINGS EVEN BETTER ORAL B HAD A REBATE FOR $15.00 OFF, WHICH REALLY SWEETENED THE POT.</li>
            <li>but they appear to be good replacement heads when the current one wears out..</li>
            <li>(I recommend a good gritty toothpaste that has baking soda in it for those results).  </li>
            <li>These heads usually last a good while.</li>
            <li>This brush head works fine and probably works as well as the original, but the main flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; and the bottom bristles wear out faster than the top ones if you&#x27;re brushing your teeth at the right angle as a dentist would instruct.  </li>
            <li>and they work just fabulous with the Precision 5000 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean.</li>
            <li>The brush head is slightly larger than most regular items and really does an excellent job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They are good quality replacement heads, better quality, last longer, and cleans better than generic brands.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>the first one is working just fine.</li>
            <li>Provides a clean and fresh mouth when used 2 X per day.  </li>
            <li>Order arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>given that I ordered the toothbrush online and do not know where to buy it retail, this product arrived quickly and as ordered.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>They arrive quickly, also.</li>
            <li>These heads are a good investment and you will get several months&#x27; worth for each head, depending on how often you brush.  </li>
            <li>I need to replace brush heads more often than I do and having 3 on hands makes me more likely to do it.</li>
            <li>Using them make my teeth feel like I just left the dentist smooth and very clean!</li>
            <li>First I tried cheap after-market replacement heads</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the Pro White brush heads!</li>
            <li>I am using this brush type from last 6 months, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are far superior to the standard bristle head you can purchase for your Oral-B electric toothbrushes, and are better than the combination brushing and spinning heads as well.  </li>
            <li>Received Oral-B Power Dual Clean Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head,3 Count instead Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head, 3 Count; however paid for the &amp;#34;Prowhite&amp;#34; kit which more pricy.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re prone to weak enamel (I am not), it may not be the best brush for you, but if you have normal enamel/healthy teeth, these are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I like others much more, and could live without these</li>
            <li>our new OralB electric  tooth brushes Much better</li>
            <li>Glad to find these oral B heads for a reasonable price, thanks!</li>
            <li>I very much like the heads, as they leave my teeth with a dentist clean feeling after using them.</li>
            <li>This product is the exact replacement that the manufacturer calls for!  </li>
            <li>Removed stains from tea, coffee, and wine with the first use!  </li>
            <li>These whitening heads are very hard to find in store, but are excellent for the Oral-B brush system.</li>
            <li>I really like this product does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li>The package arrived really quick and it was in the original package, thanks for the speedy del.</li>
            <li>Really happy to find them on line, not available to find them in Mexico.</li>
            <li>Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>There is enough bristles to get a great cleaning and the rubber cup in the middle does fantastic cleaning, knocking out debris, and polishing too.</li>
            <li>I like the polishing feature but don&#x27;t think it really makes that huge of a difference compared to the head I was using before...</li>
            <li>But it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Nice idea but regular toothpaste just desolves as soon as you begin to brush.</li>
            <li>We love our Oral-B Professional Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>HAS BEEN A GOD SEND TO MY SMILE -</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and cheaper than I could find anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>(using the Oral B Professional 4000 toothbrush, love it too)</li>
            <li>Used it as a replacement brushes for the Oral B powerful tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Wll worth the expense......</li>
            <li>This replacment brush by Oral-B fits most Oral-B toothbrushes, works very well and is better with than the standard brush.</li>
            <li>This gets a check mark  and a smile  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sticking to the name brand because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the coinage.</li>
            <li>it was a very positive experience</li>
            <li>Original replacement brushes just as expected, at a good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>very much prefer Oral-B&#x27;s Floss Action heads because they are effective and comfortable, even when my teeth are feeling sensitive.</li>
            <li>My teeth actually do feel more clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed with it and it cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the original Oral-B brush heads.</li>
            <li>TO FIND THE RIGHT ONES.  </li>
            <li>It was the right size</li>
            <li>These ones were right</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s the point, right?</li>
            <li>Really makes my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>However, they will definitely clean your teeth very well</li>
            <li>really make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Unclear if it really brightens, but it does get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again since the whole family is hooked on how clean the oral b cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li>and there is no soreness just a very shiny clean.  </li>
            <li>They seem to clean my teeth very well</li>
            <li>He says the quality is just as good if not better than the original brushes that came with the oral b toothbrush we purchased.</li>
            <li>It cleans effectively and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>and you should keep a pack around just to have new brushes available when you need them.</li>
            <li>but because the floss action one does such a good job I just don&#x27;t need this.</li>
            <li>Alternate this tip with floss action tip, think both are good when used together.  </li>
            <li>It is far superior than any hand-held toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The whitening is a natural look, vs the bright spotlight white one sees in teeth that are bleached.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much better, flossing isn&#x27;t such a big deal since this brush head does a good deep clean every time at angles</li>
            <li>Description was exact and was able to use the replacements right away on my current Oral-B Pro toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The polishing brush is the most effective &amp; very long lasting</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of tea and don&#x27;t get much staining due to good brushing.</li>
            <li>and these heads have ellipse form, and for whatever reason I like the new feeling that these new heads provide better.</li>
            <li>These are good and my teeth did look a little whiter</li>
            <li>Great thing about the whitening head is that it really does seem to keep your teeth a little shinier!</li>
            <li>I had been getting these from Razors Direct as they are very fast and have free shipping.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little skeptical, but as time went on, I realized this brush was doing a superior job and leaving my teeth and gums in superb condition.  </li>
            <li>Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll get better at it, but currently it&#x27;s just another brush head in my dental regime arsenal!</li>
            <li>I have only been able to find on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I got these hoping that they would work better than the regular brush heads I got with my Oral-B electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be   the real \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner, brighter and more polished than just using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This really did the job!  </li>
            <li>I actually think I look better now than after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I find these heads a lot better than the regular ones.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting the generic ones from Target or BJ&#x27;s or another store.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought these at the same time that I bought the tooth brush as I wanted to make sure I could get replacements for the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Product did exactly what I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply.</li>
            <li>The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...</li>
            <li>That is why I&#x27;ll come back when I need more.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>To all those who require deep cleaning and have healthy teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brush heads for my Oral-B power toothbrush, but the Pro-White brush heads are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>I find this brush to work better than the larger heads.</li>
            <li>, teeth seem more white.</li>
            <li>It works well and appears to be pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>This is a hard-to-find product style that I am able to acquire on Amazon only.</li>
            <li>A lot better than the standard brush.</li>
            <li>I have been using Oral-B automatic toothbrush heads for many years and have found that you can&#x27;t get away with buying generic or third-party heads</li>
            <li>Buy directly from Amazon for genuine product.</li>
            <li>, I would say that the expense for real heads is definitely worth it compared to the budget store replacements both in terms or durability and quality.</li>
            <li>The descr I read first helped me make the decision on which one to buy.</li>
            <li>I made sure I had enough!!!</li>
            <li>These clean and whiten better than any other brush head I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It really brushes my teeth and gums  and does not affect the pinched nerve in my right arm.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>During my last dental check-up and cleaning last month the hygienist commented on what a good job I was doing with keeping the stains off my teeth (coffee, tea, etc.).  </li>
            <li>while brushing, i felt the dual action brush head worked better, but I did notice my teeth getting whiter by the week, which did not happen with the dual action brush head.</li>
            <li>I have been getting them far more frequently.</li>
            <li>I bought these and am thrilled that I can finally throw the old one away.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I was very surprised how quickly these arrived after ordering.</li>
            <li>At the time I bought my toothbrush, these heads were available at any major store like Meijer or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell on this web site which toothbrush is the \\&quot;original Oral B\\&quot;, but this seems to be it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell if the teeth are becoming very white.</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t know how much I can comment on replacement toothbrush heads</li>
            <li>Delivery pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Packaging that looks like \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;, Extended brissles on the tip, color coding for wear and a neat special center for better polishing (new).    </li>
            <li>These tend to be the most expensive heads available, but with better results and the much longer life, these are a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you&#x27;re teeth are magically gonna become whiter.</li>
            <li>It will work at high or low, but the rapid oscillation seemed to word better.</li>
            <li>I tried several other heads and they all worked ok but this Prowhite head did a better job than all of the others, for me anyway</li>
            <li>The fit exactly as if they were manufactured for this brush and similar size brushes.  </li>
            <li>Received very quickly and was a big hit for Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li>sturdy and strong  Get extra when you order you toothbrush</li>
            <li>Only time will tell, but in the meantime I am enjoying the features of the new unit.</li>
            <li>A BETTER RATING, ORDERED TWO OF THE SAME THING, GOT TWO SIFFERENT BRUSHES, WHERE I LIVE</li>
            <li>the short period that I have had it , it is working fine.</li>
            <li>Since I have a tendency to brush too hard, the fact that the Oral-B warns me when I&#x27;m doing that is good for me.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you&#x27;re more careful about cleaning the brush heads and not in a hurry, then it&#x27;s not so much a problem.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really need the polisher head.    </li>
            <li>Shame really.</li>
            <li>These really polish your teeth.  </li>
            <li>MY TEETH ARE VERY STRIPPED OF ENAMEL</li>
            <li>B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>White\\&quot; really takes off the coffee stain.</li>
            <li>but the one I have works very well.</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth are very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>Really like this Prowhite replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li>I charge it when the low battery light flashes</li>
            <li>but whatever I use one brush head for a year or so (I don&#x27;t really care about their suggestions)</li>
            <li>This one seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>A toothbrush needs to be practical for your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>these polishers really do work</li>
            <li>These brush heads really do what they claim.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery of the Oral B was swift and the product is very well made.</li>
            <li>It looks like Oral-B is discontinuing this brush head for some reason, so I&#x27;ll enjoy these while they last.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much damn money</li>
            <li>These heads really do help remove stains.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>was  elated to find these brushes at Amazon and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she was very impress with the performance of the head.</li>
            <li>Better than expected or imagined.  </li>
            <li>these polishers really do work</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY COMPARABLES, BUT THE ORAL B SEEMS TO REALLY DO THE TRICK.</li>
            <li>It cleans the teeth very well.</li>
            <li>removes the plaque very well goes really between teeth.</li>
            <li>Teeth have a really polished feel after use.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Ordered from Amazon because it was much cheaper than Wal Mart.</li>
            <li>These brush heads work very well.</li>
            <li>Teeth got whiter and felt much cleaner after just one use with these heads.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The package of three brush heads from Amazon which identified the correct heads I needed, was very helpful.</li>
            <li>much more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks Much.</li>
            <li>These really work.</li>
            <li>I really like this brushing system</li>
            <li>I use them in tandem with flosser heads which works really well.</li>
            <li>Head fits snugly on the brush handle and cleans teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending this much</li>
            <li>More than the regular soft oral b.</li>
            <li>They hold just the right amount of toothpaste in their little \\&quot;cup\\&quot; and are more gentle on my gums than the floss head brush.  </li>
            <li>Really prefer these brushes to original basic brushes that come with the Oral B.</li>
            <li>Definitely feel like they clean my mouth very well</li>
            <li>This item works well and amazon has these refills priced much more competitively than drugstores and other stores.</li>
            <li>Works okay just like other brush heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not function quite the same as the original.</li>
            <li>like it better than other brushes.</li>
            <li>It does the job better than any other product in the market.</li>
            <li>I know they have a generic brush, but, I like the original product with the floss type bristles.  </li>
            <li>It cleans better than the other ones.</li>
            <li>I want buy the other ones any more.  SW</li>
            <li>I originally thought that these Prowhite brush heads would not have enough bristles for a proper clean.</li>
            <li>encourages you to get into a routine; clean and floss at bed time and polish the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I feel that they provide a very deep clean.</li>
            <li>It does seem to work, and as I said they definitely feel clean.  </li>
            <li>The Pro White heads feel like I&#x27;m trying to scrape my teeth clean, not polish them.</li>
            <li>The way these heads move differs from the original heads because the original head is round</li>
            <li>It has a central rubber insert that seems to scrub the teeth clean.</li>
            <li>They seem to last a long time and do a nice job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>The original caused the motor to oscillate between high and low speeds.</li>
            <li>very easy to use much cheaper to buy a 3 pack than a single one love oral b products last longer than other elec toothbrushes had the toothbrush for almost 2 years</li>
            <li>If you use it properly and don&#x27;t get lazy, it is very effective.</li>
            <li>The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date.</li>
            <li>My whole family has noticed a improvement in the color and feel of their teeth &amp; gums.&lt;br /&gt;After my purchase of the Oral-B replacement heads &amp; toothbrush, I found generic replacement heads for the toothbrush for a better price, generic?</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Braun oral B professional tooth brush and it does exactly what is described.</li>
            <li>Like the Pro best, others available are either too big and clumsy or too small and ineffective.</li>
            <li>I think the rubbery-center really does work to lightly polish teeth, as every other brush head I tried just didn&#x27;t seem to break up as much plaque and debris.</li>
            <li>It was cheaper to buy a whole new Oral B electric tooth brush, which comes with 3 refill heads, then to buy just the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B electric toothbrush uses new brushes very infrequently, but there does come a time when you need to replace the head.</li>
            <li>Onlly wanted authenic replacement heads for my oral B.  Much less costly than buying them in most stores.</li>
            <li>However, this particular extension does wonders.</li>
            <li>Not too sure the inner polisher is a big plus, but we&#x27;ll see over a period of time.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are hard to find in retail stores; I was pleased to see them on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I needed replacement heads but couldn&#x27;t find this particular head and decided to look on the internet.</li>
            <li>both takes care of the cleaning and leaves your teeth white enough that the visit to the dentist no longer has to be an ordeal:-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so sold on this particular head that I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li>Way better than the generic version of this specific brushhead.</li>
            <li>I was formerly using the head that looks more rectangular/normal toothbrush(called the deep sweep), and switched to this one about 4 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Left my teeth extra smooth!</li>
            <li>but I love the Oral B electric toothbrush, it actually does help me keep my teeth sparkly white.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Oral B makes high quality items.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Oral B&#x27;s softer version...</li>
            <li>- High quality product&lt;</li>
            <li>highly recommend these if you smoke or drink things that might stain your teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Oral B&#x27;s softer version...</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice if they were less expensive but the price I paid was about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Product is solid and well built, so far hasn&#x27;t fallen apart as with the Oral-B Precision Clean heads.</li>
            <li>your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li>The strictly bristle models tend to wear out quicker and they pretty much all floss and brush the same.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t do with a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of rough for my fragile sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>You will want to smile big for the camera and show off your pearly whites.</li>
            <li>They definitely manage to polish a shine into your smile.</li>
            <li>I tend to rotate between this head and the normal bristle head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed that my teeth look cleaner, and that the staining I always had right before my next dental appointment was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best and only replacement brush I use, the rubber center actually polishes off any coffee staining  etc , my dentist who recommended them actually was surprised at how well they actually worked</li>
            <li>I only need to go through one of these every six months and the thing holds strong and lets you know when you need a new brush through the lightening of the blue on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the past few years and I cannot be more pleased at the way my teet look.  </li>
            <li>the little cup in the middle is nice.</li>
            <li>The oral-B tooth tooth brush refills arrived on time as listed by Amizon and since we are fimilar with this product&#x27;s use, they live up to expectations.</li>
            <li>The new toothbrush includes onr of these style heads.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>These were purchased as an adjunct to a new Oral-B 4000.  </li>
            <li>I have a Braun 3D and needed new heads for it.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of the center which is supposed to work like the tools the dentist uses to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I use the Floss Action head as my main tooth bush</li>
            <li>Average quality, not confident this brush is doing a great job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this.</li>
            <li>first time EVER that a toothbrush is gonna last me 3 months!</li>
            <li>My teeth actually lightened a whole shade once I started using this brush!</li>
            <li>My family has been using oral b for the past 12 years and we all have healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used other Oral-B heads for my toothbrush and love the one with the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; thing in the middle.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased it, it came with 1 of the floss-action heads and 1 of the pro white heads.  </li>
            <li>Combined with Crest White toothpaste, and whitening mouth wash, these heads really accelerate the process!  </li>
            <li>What can I say other than the replacements are exactly the same as the original brush head that I just bought.</li>
            <li>The floss action head is too rough on my gums and the dual clean head</li>
            <li>Further, although these are Pro White brush heads, I have not noticed any special whitening effects.</li>
            <li>JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE A HALF PRICE REBATE AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>The Pro White heads pretty much have this circular rubber piece in the middle</li>
            <li>They both serve a good purpose and I like switching between them (usually floss action in the morning and then pro white at night when I do regular flossing).  </li>
            <li>I like the rubbery circle in the middle that reminds me of the dentist&#x27;s polishing tool, but just by a little bit I feel that the precision heads perform better.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE THE CORRECT TOOTHBRUSHES I NEED TO BUY FOR REPALCEMENT - SO MANY &amp; HARD</li>
            <li>I still floss the same as before though, since the bristles don&#x27;t really reach that far between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist surprised.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet, I&#x27;m not quite convinced the polishing cup really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Dual Action or the Floss Action versions instead.</li>
            <li>I like to the feel after brushing my teeth with Oral-B Professional Prowhite.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]] &amp; AMAZON</li>
            <li>Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>As far as the advertised \\&quot;Pro</li>
            <li>I also ensured that I used the \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; brush setting that the toothbrush offers.</li>
            <li>but they kept falling off and were far too soft.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Floss Action is my replacement brush head of choice.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I have used this model brush for nearly four years, every day.  </li>
            <li>Generic brands do not hold up like the real ones.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t find out until my next exam but my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 toothbrush in January and it was a purchase I don&#x27;t regret.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 3</li>
            <li>Spend the extra to get the real deal.</li>
            <li>- I think it is called the floss action head.</li>
            <li>Same as description thanks</li>
            <li>Feels like I just walked out of the dentist office after having my teeth professionally cleaning.</li>
            <li>they nearly always have it.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels like I had a professional teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I started using the Oral B Pro electric toothbrush a couple of months ago and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth have become just using the regular brush that comes with the unit.  </li>
            <li>I thought they were completely discontinued</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought three models of brush heads for my Floss Action 5000.</li>
            <li>(sensitive, prowhite, floss action)</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>However, this Prowhite brush head is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like the rubber piece in the middle.</li>
            <li>I have used about 4 different brush heads for this tooth brush and really like this one.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads seem to drip more than the generic ones making them messy.</li>
            <li>I guess they could have given a few extra color rings for the bases, in case you had more people using the toothbrush?</li>
            <li>This is a nice idea for a brush but poorly executed.</li>
            <li>The new brush works well, but I doubt very much that it will last for another ten years; it feels somewhat flimsey.  </li>
            <li>First time they didn&#x27;t last very long but this set is very durable.</li>
            <li>But since it doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as other regular brush heads, I only use it only once a day for polishing purposes and not so much for cleaning (for that I recommend OralB FlossAction heads.</li>
            <li>Oral B has apparently been busy coming out with this new product.</li>
            <li>I have crooked teeth on the bottom and this is the only one that gets those teeth clean with regular brushing.</li>
            <li>ok, it&#x27;s more expensive than brushing your teeth with a conventional toothbrush, however, it&#x27;s a case of</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes I have tried from the drug store were a very tight fit and didn&#x27;t work properly.l</li>
            <li>On top of that, it is a little bit bigger than the stock brush head, which I personally like.</li>
            <li>The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure.</li>
            <li>or they are pushing these ineffective products just to show more choices, but it feels like the head is bigger than what I am used to and the bristles are too hard to get in between my teeth and do the cleaning.</li>
            <li>Of course your teeth are your life, it is like using a new tooth brush and the digital read out tell you when you have to replace the brush.</li>
            <li>I still have one new unused one left.  </li>
            <li>Came in the same package as my new Oral B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cross action, floss, and this one so far and prefer this one.</li>
            <li>Although it may be too early to evaluate, I notice a big improvement over the old products about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>The heads can feel much more firm than other heads without the cup</li>
            <li>These heads fit my Oral B Pro toothbrush and last as long as any of the other replacement heads I&#x27;ve bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are expensive, but a clean mouth is worth it.</li>
            <li>These do a horrid job of getting in between the teeth, save yourself the trouble and buy the basic precision clean and skip out on these heads, makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, I like these polisher tips.  </li>
            <li>It will be so much cheaper because the plastic head itself doesn&#x27;t not get damage, and they can last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to really review it.</li>
            <li>have since gone back to using the regular heads and am once again much happier with the color of my teeth, and they even got rid of some stains from smoking that the Pro White brush heads couldn&#x27;t handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The yellow cap in the middle really seems to get your teeth feeling smoother than with just regular brush heads.  </li>
            <li>So far I have no tarter build up and the hard to clean places are no longer hard to clean</li>
            <li>I prefer these to the Floss Action (the one with the paddles) and the regular replacement heads.</li>
            <li>People with sensitive gums should definitely stay away.</li>
            <li>I tried to purchace them at my local drug store and  the cost three times the amount that Amazon offers them for.</li>
            <li>I rotate sometimes between the floss action and the  Oral B Pro white.</li>
            <li>I thought I will get used to them, but even after couple of months I find myself brushing with the regular old manual toothbrush afterwards.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Bruch Head 3 count and recieved a different oral b brush head.</li>
            <li>They work quite well for an occasional use; however, both of the family members using the Oral-B prefer the Floss Action Heads.  </li>
            <li>A necessity with the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep brush.</li>
            <li>and I regularly clean/disinfect my old head because I didn&#x27;t want to give it up.  </li>
            <li>Recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Pro Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Waiting for the professional brush, which has all the bristles in the middle as well.</li>
            <li>So far have only found them on amazon.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical about this polisher heads for Oral B Toothbrushes when I got it together with the Triumph.</li>
            <li>Why I waited  so long to by a 5000, is still a mystery; and I use it in conjunction with my new Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these refills instead of the ones the brush came with because they were much cheaper than the other options.</li>
            <li>I find this product to work very well and lasts longer than other types of heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With only one use I noticed a marked increase in how well my back teeth were cleaned.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;polishing heads&#x27; are much different as they have silicone or rubber center which really does polish the teeth while removing plaque and flossing as well.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the floss action brush heads but decided to try something different.</li>
            <li>Not a good fit.</li>
            <li>For me,this particular brush is much too hard on the gums.</li>
            <li>For me,this particular brush is much too hard on the gums.</li>
            <li>I think I have an older toothbrush, so it is harder to find the replacement brush heads, especially prowhite type.  </li>
            <li>I will freely admit, they do a good job of shining up the front your teeth, but a horrible job of actually getting where they need to for actual cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I not feel they provided any extra whitening compared to the time I had spent using the regular brush head, but the plastic circle in the middle would break really quickly and given that there are fewer bristles on the head, my teeth were harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist asked me if I was drinking less tea as my teeth were so much whiter.</li>
            <li>This brush is so hard you are lucky to have teeth left.</li>
            <li>But this new oval shape really helps me get into the small places in my mouth, AND it holds enough toothpaste to do my whole mouth, which was tricky with the former round brush.</li>

            <li> - I LOVE IS THING!!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush heads!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush to use .</li>
            <li> It is very handy</li>
            <li> Working very nicely.</li>
            <li> Its very nice replacement brush for 15 bucks</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and these replacent heads are great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my teeth are in better shape since I started using this toothbrush one year ago.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite and it is the best at removing plaque and messaging my gums.</li>
            <li> Now, they are remarkably whiter / brighter</li>
            <li> They seem to do an effective job!  </li>
            <li> Comes with lil colored markers so you can share the brush and just remove the head with your own!</li>
            <li> These brushes were the best price and were delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap deal, very good quality and a wellworth business.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with her \\&quot;gift\\&quot;, and I am very pleased with the great deal.</li>
            <li> These brush head replacements are good quality and they fit perfectly with my brush at home.  </li>
            <li> Loved this brush head for cleaning coffee stains off teeth.  </li>
            <li> These work great while the cheaper kind feel like they are shredding your gums.</li>
            <li> However, Amazon&#x27;s price beat theirs, and the shipping was free - a great bargain!</li>
            <li> This saves time and money and, to me, this is a good thing in this economy.</li>
            <li> This type brush head is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> Another reliable &amp; good purchase through Amazon.com  </li>
            <li> They perform good, but are over priced for what you get.  </li>
            <li> The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand.</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  </li>
            <li> this is a good product</li>
            <li> I think the whitening cups do work, of course in combination with a good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Its lifespan is good, and it cleans the teeth as it promised.</li>
            <li> it is a good thing for health care.</li>
            <li> Received in good condition.</li>
            <li> This was a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> And these replacement brushes fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> but I think Oral-B is a good brand.</li>
            <li> After a lot of comparison shopping for this product I have found that Amazon when your order is sufficient for free shipping has the best prices.</li>
            <li> these are good</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and arrived timely.</li>
            <li> My teeth look good.  </li>
            <li> Good price as well.</li>
            <li> The price was good.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> Quality good.</li>
            <li> Good price for something I use every day.  </li>
            <li> This is a good cleaning head</li>
            <li> I have annual check-ups/cleanings with my dentist, and they always say how good a shape my teeth are in.  </li>
            <li> She says it does a good job of cleaning her teeth without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value price wise.</li>
            <li> Brush heads do a good job cleaning teeth and messaging gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are good replacement heads and are cheaper on Amazon than in Rite-Aid.</li>
            <li> Good brush head.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li> Good replacement heads</li>
            <li> The floss bush they have was too good...</li>
            <li> Good product to remove plaque on teeth.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads for Oral B are really good and provide me with the tools to keep my teeth and gums at maximum health.  </li>
            <li> Just received a good report from my dental hygienist during my scheduled cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> Good value for a good and needed product.</li>
            <li> Good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> as good as advertised...</li>
            <li> His hygienist remarked at how good my teeth and gums looked this time around.  </li>
            <li> The heads fit the Oral b sonic perfectly.</li>
            <li> However, there will be no results if you don&#x27;t keep a good oral higiene.</li>
            <li> but this is a good deal for 3 replacement heads.</li>
            <li> looks good and works good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The price is really good for these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and excellent product at a fair price!</li>
            <li> This one works the best for me as I get that sleek clean feeling on my teeth after I use it.</li>
            <li> Cleans exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the brush heads I ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li> These replacement brush heads for the Oral-B Triumph and others do a great job cleaning your teeth and giving your teeth that smooth, just-been-to-the-dentist feeling.  </li>
            <li> began using the Prowhites from the Dual-action and Gumcare lines at a friend&#x27;s suggestion and amazingly they do whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great products and really fit on my Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing results, my husband has used whiteners and toothpastes and its always spotty</li>

            <li> It would probably be nice to have it</li>
            <li> Works very well, feels great on my teeth!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush was one of my best buys last year, This prowhite brush heads work great, but i think i&#x27;m gonna move to the flossing ones  </li>
            <li> They also brush the gums nicely.</li>

            <li> THE BEST BRUSH HEAD - ORAL B PROFESSIONAL PROWHITE REPLACEMENT BRUSH.</li>
            <li> the floss action brush the best.  </li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described and I enjoy how it feels on my teeth and does a great job cleaning them!</li>
            <li> They work just as good as the polishing brushes used by my dentist to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great price to keep teeth clean the easy way.</li>
            <li> I loved the head that came with the Clean Precision 1000 when I bought it.</li>
            <li> This one does a good job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and are much cheaper than purchasing in the store.  </li>
            <li> good price with nice quality, worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a remarkably good head for getting your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> It polishes nicely but isn&#x27;t the best for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Both of my parents are dentists and bushing has always been something very important to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the replacement heads yet, but they&#x27;re easy to install and store nicely in the toothbrush holder/charger.</li>
            <li> We use this for remove coffee stain, it work very good so far.</li>
            <li> It provides the best and most comfortable brushing action of all I have tried.</li>
            <li> and it is ok</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> SO MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral-B 5000 from Amazon and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> i love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but it is even better with these heads.</li>
            <li> Love these polishers for every day use...</li>
            <li> I love this  Oral-B replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about being cheap and buying a knock off replacement please don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Love these brushheads.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because I didn&#x27;t know if they will fit my Vitality brush, but they did!</li>
            <li> My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  </li>
            <li> This package was such a great deal for a three pack - I bought two to stock up!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy it again and am very happy to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> But I do love how polished they feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> What I like most about my Oral B is that is</li>
            <li> The results speak for themselves and there&#x27;s a reason top dentists recommend electric toothbrushes....</li>
            <li> I love this brush head.</li>
            <li> after these are over :)</li>
            <li> , these were OK</li>
            <li> I love these round-head bristles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this Prowhite but boy am I happy with it.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth and gums better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li> Teeth have never felt better or cleaner except at dentist office.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are top quality.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am still satisfied with my purchase and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are their standard replacement brush heads and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> i have used this style for many years and have never been disapointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe they are okay to use once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I love these with the polishing centers as well.</li>
            <li> Gets in those deeper places and fantastic around the gum line!</li>
            <li> This is the one my wife uses most of the time.</li>
            <li> Assume they will have a respectable service life.</li>
            <li> This product fully met my expectations and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Heads are Great!  </li>
            <li> There are many different types of replacement brush heads, but these are the best.  </li>
            <li> The Prowhite replacement brush heads are fabulous!  </li>
            <li> have been using the Oral-B tooth brush (and its accessories) for years and have been able to keep</li>
            <li> Excellent product and they last!</li>
            <li> Love my Oral-B</li>
            <li> And works much better than whitening toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li> Been using them for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased too.</li>
            <li> and I would hope Oral-B is on top of this.  </li>
            <li> Nice, brighter looking teeth that feel fresh-from-the-dentist smooth.</li>
            <li> Regardless, they are good heads but not as good as the floss action.</li>
            <li> Yes, we will buy more whenever these wear out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I do not have any more to say on this review.</li>
            <li> I think it does a better job of cleaning off stains.</li>
            <li> I find that this one does a better job than the others.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve gone back to the Prowhite and am very happy.</li>
            <li> I always love these heads.</li>
            <li> Again, wasting my time by making me add more words.</li>
            <li> I plan on letting you know more after my dentist visit.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve found it does a good job and am happy with the performance.  </li>
            <li> and I love my Oral B tooth brush and these refills.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see if I like them better over the life of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had an oral b toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the ones I&#x27;d been buying.</li>
            <li> but I literally love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush, and the prowhite I ordered by mistake, but glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Just as well, since this is a better price than the stores used to offer.</li>
            <li> love how it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> oem parts i cant believe you need so many words before you can submit review.i</li>
            <li> I saw them on Amazon when I purchased a gift and decided the price was better.</li>
            <li> Over and over for many years.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way these brushes polish &amp; whiten my teeth, just like the dentist.</li>
            <li> The price was better than in store also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results and so is my dentist and his staff</li>
            <li> It make them feel so smooth and clean!!</li>
            <li> can say that I like these brush heads better than the original one!</li>
            <li> They were a great fit and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> was a decent price and the product is great.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice and clean after using this brush head.</li>
            <li> Oral B toothbrushes provide a vey effective way to clean your teeth between dental check ups that reduces the amount of plaque build up that I used to experience and the effort it took the hygienist to remove it.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean after use.  </li>
            <li> make the teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li> and Amazon has a great price on these compared to a normal retail store or supermarket.</li>
            <li> and I just love it and buying the replacement heads is just as easy as brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I always get asked how my teeth are so white, and I just tell people all it takes is a good brush/brush-head and good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> They get your teeth so clean!  </li>
            <li> These work well to clean my teeth!  </li>
            <li> These fit great, were easy to get on and off, and lasted a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I wish more came in a pack but other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li> These tips are great and really give you a clean feeling, but the rotating head can hit your teeth if you&#x27;re not careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and feel great against my gums, as well.  </li>
            <li> this was a christmas gift and my son love this i brought for my son with his electric toothbrush and they fit,</li>
            <li> So far great toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This brush works great with the Oral-B Professional system.</li>
            <li> CVS charges way too much so this is a fair alternative.</li>
            <li> The brushes do a nice job giving you that fresh from the dentist cleaning, although I prefer the cleaning power of the &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; brush that came packaged with my Smartseries 5000.</li>
            <li> good product and fast service.</li>
            <li> The head does a good job at cleaning your teeth, but I haven&#x27;t really seen my teeth get any whiter over time.</li>
            <li> very happy with the brush heads since they are original and not some sort of cheaper generic product that doesn&#x27;t even fit in the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush - it makes my teeth sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> You can concentrate on each tooth and is easy to sense problem areas.</li>
            <li> It so easy and convenient to use</li>
            <li> These are easy to insert</li>
            <li> They are most like what the dental hygienists use after they clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of clean teeth, and you will too if you get these brushes.</li>
            <li> However, I have come to prefer the Sonic toothbrushes as they seem to clean my teeth better than the oral-b brush.</li>
            <li> MY DENTIST STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Keeps my toothbrush going strong.</li>
            <li> Still going strong after 6 months.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> Probably fine.</li>
            <li> They work just fine.</li>
            <li> The fine print in the Oral B package insert says DON&#x27;T buy generics, but of course they say that because they will lose money if you do.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Luckily, Amazon to the rescue, they&#x27;re here!  </li>
            <li> They clean extremely well and of course fit the device perfectly.  </li>
            <li> They fit fine and do their job.</li>
            <li> They fit just fine.</li>
            <li> I own a Oral-B Pro 5000 Smart Series (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O8ODHOA?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I really love the way this head helps me to achieve a higher level of dental cleaning and care!  </li>
            <li> I used this head with oral B Smart Guide Traction 5000, from the second time I saw the difference, it was excellent.</li>
            <li> SO in all fairness, I&#x27;d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it.</li>
            <li> They arrived on schedule and fit my electric toothbrush as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to spray water into the hole and pull out the brush head from the body of the electric toothbrush to keep it algae free for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Genuine product, works well.</li>
            <li> The timer is great, 30 second intervals until the 2 Min mark.</li>
            <li> My teeth are smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> just as i said above it does a great job of polishing and cleaning your teeth...</li>
            <li> I order these every 3 months, so I get the 15% savings, save a trip to the store, free shipping, plus it is a reminder to change out the toothbrush heads every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I purposely bought the cheapest of all available.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as the Gumcare, and I have to move the brush around a bit more than the Dual-action, but the rubber-center is doing a better job at pushing more toothpaste to polish my teeth.</li>
            <li> After that, you should replace it to ensure the bristle remain nice and straight.</li>
            <li> Would be a great item if it was actually the item that was shipped.</li>
            <li> Genuine Stuff.  </li>
            <li> It can fit my Oral B pro 1000 series brush with no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over night for sure, but when you can avoid harmful chemicals, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The concern was if this brush fit my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> These are direct replacements for the originals and work just as good. &#x27;</li>
            <li> Great product, it really polishes your teeth really well.</li>
            <li> They are far superior to the Sonicare brushes we used to have.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different brands and they never came close to the bright cleaning power of Oral B, and now Amazon offers them at the best low price to be able to always have extra refill heads for a great way to keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> so I can not give a good rating as far as using these brushes</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good with Braun.</li>
            <li> To take care of your own teeth the right way, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Really works!!!  </li>
            <li> It is very useful for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful</li>
            <li> These particular ones are the ones I love most.  </li>
            <li> The 5000 is really a professional machine,  and has more power available than you could ask for; an adjustment feature allows the user to  step-down the intensity of the brushing to a more comfortable level, if desired.</li>
            <li> purchase original oral b products it pays in quality.</li>
            <li> These are just like the original&#x27;s that came with the Oral-b brush.  </li>
            <li> Works great, wasn&#x27;t sure brush head could really make a difference, but switched to the prowhite brush head and about six months later my son and daughter-in-law both asked me if I had bleached my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I got these brush heads (on sale) as a replacement for the original brush head that came with my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no had this with the original head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Original replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more one of these days!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet (still using the original Oral-B brush head), but my hubby is and he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought these heads for the first time and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Just like original that came with my Oral-B.</li>
            <li> They have stayed clean without having the fuzzy buildup I get throughout the day.</li>
            <li> There are generic replacement brushes available for this toothbrush, but these are good quality</li>
            <li> but they just don&#x27;t seem to clean as well as these.</li>
            <li> These replacements make my teeth feel extremely clean every time.</li>
            <li> My teeth do feel smoothe and clean after brushing with this</li>
            <li> However, these brush heads do give you squeaky clean teeth, and I have</li>
            <li> Leave your teeth thoroughly clean and shiny&lt;</li>
            <li> It seems to clean and polish</li>
            <li> I sometimes dip the heads in peroxide or mouthwash for 5 minutes to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> But I tried to go cheap and what I got was good only for scrubbing metal.</li>
            <li> But hey, it works and my teeth are clean</li>
            <li> MY TEETH FEEL CLEAN</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush/head that I&#x27;d say I \\&quot;loved\\&quot; as it is more just a daily routine kind of thing we all do,</li>
            <li> andmy teeth are so clean and whiter.</li>
            <li> These brushes do a good job of keeping my teeth white, and they make my teeth feel smooth -</li>
            <li> That keeps the brushes clean and usable.</li>
            <li> clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> clean feeling after brushing&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts</li>
            <li> It keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this brush head.</li>
            <li> if Amazon shipped the right one!</li>
            <li> The bristles dont work good, they are flimsy and the middle part had no bristles at all.</li>
            <li> The claim that your teeth will be noticably whiter in 21 days is certainly true.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if it actually does but the concept is good.</li>
            <li> I will choose the Floss Action heads every time because they get into the crevices quite nicely and distribute the toothpaste rather evenly.</li>
            <li> good enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It works well and lasts for a good 3-4 month with daily use.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Heads are durable, effective, with a quality build.  </li>
            <li> TO MAKE THINGS EVEN BETTER ORAL B HAD A REBATE FOR $15.00 OFF, WHICH REALLY SWEETENED THE POT.</li>
            <li> but they appear to be good replacement heads when the current one wears out..</li>
            <li> (I recommend a good gritty toothpaste that has baking soda in it for those results).  </li>
            <li> These heads usually last a good while.</li>
            <li> This brush head works fine and probably works as well as the original, but the main flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; and the bottom bristles wear out faster than the top ones if you&#x27;re brushing your teeth at the right angle as a dentist would instruct.  </li>
            <li> and they work just fabulous with the Precision 5000 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean.</li>
            <li> The brush head is slightly larger than most regular items and really does an excellent job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> They are good quality replacement heads, better quality, last longer, and cleans better than generic brands.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> the first one is working just fine.</li>
            <li> Provides a clean and fresh mouth when used 2 X per day.  </li>
            <li> Order arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> given that I ordered the toothbrush online and do not know where to buy it retail, this product arrived quickly and as ordered.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> They arrive quickly, also.</li>
            <li> These heads are a good investment and you will get several months&#x27; worth for each head, depending on how often you brush.  </li>
            <li> I need to replace brush heads more often than I do and having 3 on hands makes me more likely to do it.</li>
            <li> Using them make my teeth feel like I just left the dentist smooth and very clean!</li>
            <li> First I tried cheap after-market replacement heads</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the Pro White brush heads!</li>
            <li> I am using this brush type from last 6 months, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are far superior to the standard bristle head you can purchase for your Oral-B electric toothbrushes, and are better than the combination brushing and spinning heads as well.  </li>
            <li> Received Oral-B Power Dual Clean Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head,3 Count instead Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head, 3 Count; however paid for the &amp;#34;Prowhite&amp;#34; kit which more pricy.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re prone to weak enamel (I am not), it may not be the best brush for you, but if you have normal enamel/healthy teeth, these are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I like others much more, and could live without these</li>
            <li> our new OralB electric  tooth brushes Much better</li>
            <li> Glad to find these oral B heads for a reasonable price, thanks!</li>
            <li> I very much like the heads, as they leave my teeth with a dentist clean feeling after using them.</li>
            <li> This product is the exact replacement that the manufacturer calls for!  </li>
            <li> Removed stains from tea, coffee, and wine with the first use!  </li>
            <li> These whitening heads are very hard to find in store, but are excellent for the Oral-B brush system.</li>
            <li> I really like this product does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li> The package arrived really quick and it was in the original package, thanks for the speedy del.</li>
            <li> Really happy to find them on line, not available to find them in Mexico.</li>
            <li> Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> There is enough bristles to get a great cleaning and the rubber cup in the middle does fantastic cleaning, knocking out debris, and polishing too.</li>
            <li> I like the polishing feature but don&#x27;t think it really makes that huge of a difference compared to the head I was using before...</li>
            <li> But it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Nice idea but regular toothpaste just desolves as soon as you begin to brush.</li>
            <li> We love our Oral-B Professional Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> HAS BEEN A GOD SEND TO MY SMILE -</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and cheaper than I could find anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> (using the Oral B Professional 4000 toothbrush, love it too)</li>
            <li> Used it as a replacement brushes for the Oral B powerful tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Wll worth the expense......</li>
            <li> This replacment brush by Oral-B fits most Oral-B toothbrushes, works very well and is better with than the standard brush.</li>
            <li> This gets a check mark  and a smile  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sticking to the name brand because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the coinage.</li>
            <li> it was a very positive experience</li>
            <li> Original replacement brushes just as expected, at a good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> very much prefer Oral-B&#x27;s Floss Action heads because they are effective and comfortable, even when my teeth are feeling sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually do feel more clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed with it and it cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the original Oral-B brush heads.</li>
            <li> TO FIND THE RIGHT ONES.  </li>
            <li> It was the right size</li>
            <li> These ones were right</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s the point, right?</li>
            <li> Really makes my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> However, they will definitely clean your teeth very well</li>
            <li> really make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Unclear if it really brightens, but it does get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again since the whole family is hooked on how clean the oral b cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li> and there is no soreness just a very shiny clean.  </li>
            <li> They seem to clean my teeth very well</li>
            <li> He says the quality is just as good if not better than the original brushes that came with the oral b toothbrush we purchased.</li>
            <li> It cleans effectively and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and you should keep a pack around just to have new brushes available when you need them.</li>
            <li> but because the floss action one does such a good job I just don&#x27;t need this.</li>
            <li> Alternate this tip with floss action tip, think both are good when used together.  </li>
            <li> It is far superior than any hand-held toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The whitening is a natural look, vs the bright spotlight white one sees in teeth that are bleached.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get much better, flossing isn&#x27;t such a big deal since this brush head does a good deep clean every time at angles</li>
            <li> Description was exact and was able to use the replacements right away on my current Oral-B Pro toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The polishing brush is the most effective &amp; very long lasting</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of tea and don&#x27;t get much staining due to good brushing.</li>
            <li> and these heads have ellipse form, and for whatever reason I like the new feeling that these new heads provide better.</li>
            <li> These are good and my teeth did look a little whiter</li>
            <li> Great thing about the whitening head is that it really does seem to keep your teeth a little shinier!</li>
            <li> I had been getting these from Razors Direct as they are very fast and have free shipping.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical, but as time went on, I realized this brush was doing a superior job and leaving my teeth and gums in superb condition.  </li>
            <li> Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll get better at it, but currently it&#x27;s just another brush head in my dental regime arsenal!</li>
            <li> I have only been able to find on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I got these hoping that they would work better than the regular brush heads I got with my Oral-B electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be   the real \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner, brighter and more polished than just using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This really did the job!  </li>
            <li> I actually think I look better now than after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I find these heads a lot better than the regular ones.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting the generic ones from Target or BJ&#x27;s or another store.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought these at the same time that I bought the tooth brush as I wanted to make sure I could get replacements for the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Product did exactly what I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply.</li>
            <li> The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...</li>
            <li> That is why I&#x27;ll come back when I need more.</li>
            <li> I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> To all those who require deep cleaning and have healthy teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brush heads for my Oral-B power toothbrush, but the Pro-White brush heads are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> I find this brush to work better than the larger heads.</li>
            <li> , teeth seem more white.</li>
            <li> It works well and appears to be pretty durable.  </li>
            <li> This is a hard-to-find product style that I am able to acquire on Amazon only.</li>
            <li> A lot better than the standard brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B automatic toothbrush heads for many years and have found that you can&#x27;t get away with buying generic or third-party heads</li>
            <li> Buy directly from Amazon for genuine product.</li>
            <li> , I would say that the expense for real heads is definitely worth it compared to the budget store replacements both in terms or durability and quality.</li>
            <li> The descr I read first helped me make the decision on which one to buy.</li>
            <li> I made sure I had enough!!!</li>
            <li> These clean and whiten better than any other brush head I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It really brushes my teeth and gums  and does not affect the pinched nerve in my right arm.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> During my last dental check-up and cleaning last month the hygienist commented on what a good job I was doing with keeping the stains off my teeth (coffee, tea, etc.).  </li>
            <li> while brushing, i felt the dual action brush head worked better, but I did notice my teeth getting whiter by the week, which did not happen with the dual action brush head.</li>
            <li> I have been getting them far more frequently.</li>
            <li> I bought these and am thrilled that I can finally throw the old one away.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I was very surprised how quickly these arrived after ordering.</li>
            <li> At the time I bought my toothbrush, these heads were available at any major store like Meijer or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell on this web site which toothbrush is the \\&quot;original Oral B\\&quot;, but this seems to be it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell if the teeth are becoming very white.</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t know how much I can comment on replacement toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> Delivery pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> Packaging that looks like \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;, Extended brissles on the tip, color coding for wear and a neat special center for better polishing (new).    </li>
            <li> These tend to be the most expensive heads available, but with better results and the much longer life, these are a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li> I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you&#x27;re teeth are magically gonna become whiter.</li>
            <li> It will work at high or low, but the rapid oscillation seemed to word better.</li>
            <li> I tried several other heads and they all worked ok but this Prowhite head did a better job than all of the others, for me anyway</li>
            <li> The fit exactly as if they were manufactured for this brush and similar size brushes.  </li>
            <li> Received very quickly and was a big hit for Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> sturdy and strong  Get extra when you order you toothbrush</li>
            <li> Only time will tell, but in the meantime I am enjoying the features of the new unit.</li>
            <li> A BETTER RATING, ORDERED TWO OF THE SAME THING, GOT TWO SIFFERENT BRUSHES, WHERE I LIVE</li>
            <li> the short period that I have had it , it is working fine.</li>
            <li> Since I have a tendency to brush too hard, the fact that the Oral-B warns me when I&#x27;m doing that is good for me.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you&#x27;re more careful about cleaning the brush heads and not in a hurry, then it&#x27;s not so much a problem.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really need the polisher head.    </li>
            <li> Shame really.</li>
            <li> These really polish your teeth.  </li>
            <li> MY TEETH ARE VERY STRIPPED OF ENAMEL</li>
            <li> B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> White\\&quot; really takes off the coffee stain.</li>
            <li> but the one I have works very well.</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth are very shiny.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> Really like this Prowhite replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li> I charge it when the low battery light flashes</li>
            <li> but whatever I use one brush head for a year or so (I don&#x27;t really care about their suggestions)</li>
            <li> This one seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush needs to be practical for your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> these polishers really do work</li>
            <li> These brush heads really do what they claim.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery of the Oral B was swift and the product is very well made.</li>
            <li> It looks like Oral-B is discontinuing this brush head for some reason, so I&#x27;ll enjoy these while they last.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much damn money</li>
            <li> These heads really do help remove stains.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> was  elated to find these brushes at Amazon and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she was very impress with the performance of the head.</li>
            <li> Better than expected or imagined.  </li>
            <li> these polishers really do work</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY COMPARABLES, BUT THE ORAL B SEEMS TO REALLY DO THE TRICK.</li>
            <li> It cleans the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> removes the plaque very well goes really between teeth.</li>
            <li> Teeth have a really polished feel after use.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Ordered from Amazon because it was much cheaper than Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work very well.</li>
            <li> Teeth got whiter and felt much cleaner after just one use with these heads.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The package of three brush heads from Amazon which identified the correct heads I needed, was very helpful.</li>
            <li> much more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks Much.</li>
            <li> These really work.</li>
            <li> I really like this brushing system</li>
            <li> I use them in tandem with flosser heads which works really well.</li>
            <li> Head fits snugly on the brush handle and cleans teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending this much</li>
            <li> More than the regular soft oral b.</li>
            <li> They hold just the right amount of toothpaste in their little \\&quot;cup\\&quot; and are more gentle on my gums than the floss head brush.  </li>
            <li> Really prefer these brushes to original basic brushes that come with the Oral B.</li>
            <li> Definitely feel like they clean my mouth very well</li>
            <li> This item works well and amazon has these refills priced much more competitively than drugstores and other stores.</li>
            <li> Works okay just like other brush heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not function quite the same as the original.</li>
            <li> like it better than other brushes.</li>
            <li> It does the job better than any other product in the market.</li>
            <li> I know they have a generic brush, but, I like the original product with the floss type bristles.  </li>
            <li> It cleans better than the other ones.</li>
            <li> I want buy the other ones any more.  SW</li>
            <li> I originally thought that these Prowhite brush heads would not have enough bristles for a proper clean.</li>
            <li> encourages you to get into a routine; clean and floss at bed time and polish the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I feel that they provide a very deep clean.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work, and as I said they definitely feel clean.  </li>
            <li> The Pro White heads feel like I&#x27;m trying to scrape my teeth clean, not polish them.</li>
            <li> The way these heads move differs from the original heads because the original head is round</li>
            <li> It has a central rubber insert that seems to scrub the teeth clean.</li>
            <li> They seem to last a long time and do a nice job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> The original caused the motor to oscillate between high and low speeds.</li>
            <li> very easy to use much cheaper to buy a 3 pack than a single one love oral b products last longer than other elec toothbrushes had the toothbrush for almost 2 years</li>
            <li> If you use it properly and don&#x27;t get lazy, it is very effective.</li>
            <li> The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date.</li>
            <li> My whole family has noticed a improvement in the color and feel of their teeth &amp; gums.&lt;br /&gt;After my purchase of the Oral-B replacement heads &amp; toothbrush, I found generic replacement heads for the toothbrush for a better price, generic?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Braun oral B professional tooth brush and it does exactly what is described.</li>
            <li> Like the Pro best, others available are either too big and clumsy or too small and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I think the rubbery-center really does work to lightly polish teeth, as every other brush head I tried just didn&#x27;t seem to break up as much plaque and debris.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper to buy a whole new Oral B electric tooth brush, which comes with 3 refill heads, then to buy just the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric toothbrush uses new brushes very infrequently, but there does come a time when you need to replace the head.</li>
            <li> Onlly wanted authenic replacement heads for my oral B.  Much less costly than buying them in most stores.</li>
            <li> However, this particular extension does wonders.</li>
            <li> Not too sure the inner polisher is a big plus, but we&#x27;ll see over a period of time.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are hard to find in retail stores; I was pleased to see them on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I needed replacement heads but couldn&#x27;t find this particular head and decided to look on the internet.</li>
            <li> both takes care of the cleaning and leaves your teeth white enough that the visit to the dentist no longer has to be an ordeal:-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sold on this particular head that I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Way better than the generic version of this specific brushhead.</li>
            <li> I was formerly using the head that looks more rectangular/normal toothbrush(called the deep sweep), and switched to this one about 4 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Left my teeth extra smooth!</li>
            <li> but I love the Oral B electric toothbrush, it actually does help me keep my teeth sparkly white.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Oral B makes high quality items.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Oral B&#x27;s softer version...</li>
            <li> - High quality product&lt;</li>
            <li> highly recommend these if you smoke or drink things that might stain your teeth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Oral B&#x27;s softer version...</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice if they were less expensive but the price I paid was about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Product is solid and well built, so far hasn&#x27;t fallen apart as with the Oral-B Precision Clean heads.</li>
            <li> your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li> The strictly bristle models tend to wear out quicker and they pretty much all floss and brush the same.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t do with a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of rough for my fragile sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> You will want to smile big for the camera and show off your pearly whites.</li>
            <li> They definitely manage to polish a shine into your smile.</li>
            <li> I tend to rotate between this head and the normal bristle head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed that my teeth look cleaner, and that the staining I always had right before my next dental appointment was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Best and only replacement brush I use, the rubber center actually polishes off any coffee staining  etc , my dentist who recommended them actually was surprised at how well they actually worked</li>
            <li> I only need to go through one of these every six months and the thing holds strong and lets you know when you need a new brush through the lightening of the blue on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past few years and I cannot be more pleased at the way my teet look.  </li>
            <li> the little cup in the middle is nice.</li>
            <li> The oral-B tooth tooth brush refills arrived on time as listed by Amizon and since we are fimilar with this product&#x27;s use, they live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush includes onr of these style heads.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> These were purchased as an adjunct to a new Oral-B 4000.  </li>
            <li> I have a Braun 3D and needed new heads for it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the center which is supposed to work like the tools the dentist uses to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I use the Floss Action head as my main tooth bush</li>
            <li> Average quality, not confident this brush is doing a great job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this.</li>
            <li> first time EVER that a toothbrush is gonna last me 3 months!</li>
            <li> My teeth actually lightened a whole shade once I started using this brush!</li>
            <li> My family has been using oral b for the past 12 years and we all have healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used other Oral-B heads for my toothbrush and love the one with the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; thing in the middle.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased it, it came with 1 of the floss-action heads and 1 of the pro white heads.  </li>
            <li> Combined with Crest White toothpaste, and whitening mouth wash, these heads really accelerate the process!  </li>
            <li> What can I say other than the replacements are exactly the same as the original brush head that I just bought.</li>
            <li> The floss action head is too rough on my gums and the dual clean head</li>
            <li> Further, although these are Pro White brush heads, I have not noticed any special whitening effects.</li>
            <li> JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE A HALF PRICE REBATE AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> The Pro White heads pretty much have this circular rubber piece in the middle</li>
            <li> They both serve a good purpose and I like switching between them (usually floss action in the morning and then pro white at night when I do regular flossing).  </li>
            <li> I like the rubbery circle in the middle that reminds me of the dentist&#x27;s polishing tool, but just by a little bit I feel that the precision heads perform better.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE CORRECT TOOTHBRUSHES I NEED TO BUY FOR REPALCEMENT - SO MANY &amp; HARD</li>
            <li> I still floss the same as before though, since the bristles don&#x27;t really reach that far between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist surprised.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet, I&#x27;m not quite convinced the polishing cup really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Dual Action or the Floss Action versions instead.</li>
            <li> I like to the feel after brushing my teeth with Oral-B Professional Prowhite.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]] &amp; AMAZON</li>
            <li> Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> As far as the advertised \\&quot;Pro</li>
            <li> I also ensured that I used the \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; brush setting that the toothbrush offers.</li>
            <li> but they kept falling off and were far too soft.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Floss Action is my replacement brush head of choice.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I have used this model brush for nearly four years, every day.  </li>
            <li> Generic brands do not hold up like the real ones.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t find out until my next exam but my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 toothbrush in January and it was a purchase I don&#x27;t regret.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 3</li>
            <li> Spend the extra to get the real deal.</li>
            <li> - I think it is called the floss action head.</li>
            <li> Same as description thanks</li>
            <li> Feels like I just walked out of the dentist office after having my teeth professionally cleaning.</li>
            <li> they nearly always have it.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels like I had a professional teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I started using the Oral B Pro electric toothbrush a couple of months ago and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth have become just using the regular brush that comes with the unit.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were completely discontinued</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three models of brush heads for my Floss Action 5000.</li>
            <li> (sensitive, prowhite, floss action)</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> However, this Prowhite brush head is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like the rubber piece in the middle.</li>
            <li> I have used about 4 different brush heads for this tooth brush and really like this one.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to drip more than the generic ones making them messy.</li>
            <li> I guess they could have given a few extra color rings for the bases, in case you had more people using the toothbrush?</li>
            <li> This is a nice idea for a brush but poorly executed.</li>
            <li> The new brush works well, but I doubt very much that it will last for another ten years; it feels somewhat flimsey.  </li>
            <li> First time they didn&#x27;t last very long but this set is very durable.</li>
            <li> But since it doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as other regular brush heads, I only use it only once a day for polishing purposes and not so much for cleaning (for that I recommend OralB FlossAction heads.</li>
            <li> Oral B has apparently been busy coming out with this new product.</li>
            <li> I have crooked teeth on the bottom and this is the only one that gets those teeth clean with regular brushing.</li>
            <li> ok, it&#x27;s more expensive than brushing your teeth with a conventional toothbrush, however, it&#x27;s a case of</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes I have tried from the drug store were a very tight fit and didn&#x27;t work properly.l</li>
            <li> On top of that, it is a little bit bigger than the stock brush head, which I personally like.</li>
            <li> The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure.</li>
            <li> or they are pushing these ineffective products just to show more choices, but it feels like the head is bigger than what I am used to and the bristles are too hard to get in between my teeth and do the cleaning.</li>
            <li> Of course your teeth are your life, it is like using a new tooth brush and the digital read out tell you when you have to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> I still have one new unused one left.  </li>
            <li> Came in the same package as my new Oral B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cross action, floss, and this one so far and prefer this one.</li>
            <li> Although it may be too early to evaluate, I notice a big improvement over the old products about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> The heads can feel much more firm than other heads without the cup</li>
            <li> These heads fit my Oral B Pro toothbrush and last as long as any of the other replacement heads I&#x27;ve bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but a clean mouth is worth it.</li>
            <li> These do a horrid job of getting in between the teeth, save yourself the trouble and buy the basic precision clean and skip out on these heads, makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, I like these polisher tips.  </li>
            <li> It will be so much cheaper because the plastic head itself doesn&#x27;t not get damage, and they can last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to really review it.</li>
            <li> have since gone back to using the regular heads and am once again much happier with the color of my teeth, and they even got rid of some stains from smoking that the Pro White brush heads couldn&#x27;t handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The yellow cap in the middle really seems to get your teeth feeling smoother than with just regular brush heads.  </li>
            <li> So far I have no tarter build up and the hard to clean places are no longer hard to clean</li>
            <li> I prefer these to the Floss Action (the one with the paddles) and the regular replacement heads.</li>
            <li> People with sensitive gums should definitely stay away.</li>
            <li> I tried to purchace them at my local drug store and  the cost three times the amount that Amazon offers them for.</li>
            <li> I rotate sometimes between the floss action and the  Oral B Pro white.</li>
            <li> I thought I will get used to them, but even after couple of months I find myself brushing with the regular old manual toothbrush afterwards.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Bruch Head 3 count and recieved a different oral b brush head.</li>
            <li> They work quite well for an occasional use; however, both of the family members using the Oral-B prefer the Floss Action Heads.  </li>
            <li> A necessity with the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep brush.</li>
            <li> and I regularly clean/disinfect my old head because I didn&#x27;t want to give it up.  </li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Pro Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Waiting for the professional brush, which has all the bristles in the middle as well.</li>
            <li> So far have only found them on amazon.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this polisher heads for Oral B Toothbrushes when I got it together with the Triumph.</li>
            <li> Why I waited  so long to by a 5000, is still a mystery; and I use it in conjunction with my new Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these refills instead of the ones the brush came with because they were much cheaper than the other options.</li>
            <li> I find this product to work very well and lasts longer than other types of heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With only one use I noticed a marked increase in how well my back teeth were cleaned.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;polishing heads&#x27; are much different as they have silicone or rubber center which really does polish the teeth while removing plaque and flossing as well.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the floss action brush heads but decided to try something different.</li>
            <li> Not a good fit.</li>
            <li> For me,this particular brush is much too hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> For me,this particular brush is much too hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> I think I have an older toothbrush, so it is harder to find the replacement brush heads, especially prowhite type.  </li>
            <li> I will freely admit, they do a good job of shining up the front your teeth, but a horrible job of actually getting where they need to for actual cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I not feel they provided any extra whitening compared to the time I had spent using the regular brush head, but the plastic circle in the middle would break really quickly and given that there are fewer bristles on the head, my teeth were harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist asked me if I was drinking less tea as my teeth were so much whiter.</li>
            <li> This brush is so hard you are lucky to have teeth left.</li>
            <li> But this new oval shape really helps me get into the small places in my mouth, AND it holds enough toothpaste to do my whole mouth, which was tricky with the former round brush.</li>
            <li> I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.</li>
            <li> These are not too soft like the regulars and not too stiff like the Floss Action.</li>
            <li> In the case of this particular product, I also noticed that the bristles were not very strong since a few broke in half the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about whitening like those strips--natural whitening by getting rid of the coffee and other stains to show the natural look.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B brushes for years, but this was the first time for this version (with the little &amp;#34;polishing cup&amp;#34; in the center).  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes the toothpaste seems to fall off the brush while I first start brushing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the standard brush heads though.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t order a big gulp of coffee every morning like I do, you&#x27;ll think it last really long.</li>
            <li> I have tried the generic brands of toothbrush heads, but they don&#x27;t last nearly as long.  </li>
            <li> I saw this new brush head, with the little polisher in the middle,  and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I found it a little disturbing at first because it seems to judder against the teeth, but it gets them sparkly clean (whiter?</li>
            <li> Not sure how much whitening it does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed OB heads don&#x27;t last long for whitening</li>
            <li> I tried this brush head and it removed a piece of plaque on a back tooth that was bothering me for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure the small yellow whitening cup actually works, but the brush head dird make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> At age 57, I much prefer the natural look as it is believable; the bleached look is so obviously fake that I can only feel sorry for those that do this to their teeth.</li>
            <li> The yellow silicon cup in the center is designed to hold toothpaste just like dentists use a similar tool to hold a granular paste to polish your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, unfortunately sent the Floss Action instead of the Pro-White!</li>
            <li> Not only am I able to get the product, but it is less expensive than the comparable one found at retailers.</li>
            <li> The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade.</li>
            <li> When I use other brush heads , i notice my teeth still gets yellow over time, however this toothbrush head keeps my teeth white.</li>
            <li> , I found them to be VERY hard on my gums (even though I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth/</li>
            <li> The first few days my gums were a little sore, but now they&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li> my second refill and would not go back to conventional heads now</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy from Amazon because it&#x27;s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this does polish your teath almost like the dentist, as long as used with tooth paste that is somewhat grainy</li>
            <li> Coincidentally that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These match the ones that came with our Oral-B toothbrush and the only ones I could find with the rubber center.</li>
            <li> but sometimes I think its just a tiny bit rough on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> No thanks, Pro White!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s twice as long as the store-brand heads and three times three times the non-brand heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will literally hammer your teeth if you don&#x27;t open WIDE when inserting and removing the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the heads are somewhat expensive, but it is much more preferrable than wasting money on generic heads from China!</li>
            <li> These last between 2 and 3 months for me (not sure if that is good or bad),</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple other types of brushes, but continue to come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a cavity (or anything other than regular cleaning) in 12 years.</li>
            <li> and it is a bit larger than some other styles.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little larger and seems to get gums and teeth at the same time.</li>
            <li> finally used up the other 3 heads that I bought and have started using these.</li>
            <li> Other times they wear out after only a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I need to spend extra time with those teeth with any other brush.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I have 3 differnt replacement heads, however I use the whitening placement head every single morning.</li>
            <li> but it was far too small.</li>
            <li> They seem to wear down after only a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After less than 1 week, the staining had improved by around 70%, and my teeth seem to be overall whiter.</li>
            <li> Last of all, it&#x27;s less effort to let the appliance do the work than to brush your teeth manually.</li>
            <li> they also did not last even half the time the  Percision ones do.</li>
            <li> I prefer the traditional, small circular head with the entire brushhead covered in bristles.</li>
            <li> not too hard, not too soft!</li>
            <li> But they are definitely whiter than when using conventional tooth brush or other brush heads</li>
            <li> The fakes are also getting very hard to spot, because none of the \\&quot;real vs fake\\</li>
            <li> Wish the heads would last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \\&quot;whitens\\&quot; teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the oval shaped head with the little polishing head in the middle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much different it feels from the others, but my teeth are definitely a little whiter.</li>
            <li> Reaches way back to those hard to reach back molars.</li>
            <li> The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision.</li>
            <li> The brush performs as expected.</li>
            <li> like the center Rubber bumper that also massages as you</li>
            <li> Came as expected from supplier.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works as expected.</li>
            <li> AND I NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH THEM...</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.</li>
            <li> The center of the head is just like the dentist uses to polish my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you want a simple way to improve the appearance of the teeth, just use them everyday and never look back.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome results.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> plus this product is not available at these retail stores such Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, or Target.</li>
            <li> I like the polishing head in the center, it reminds me of the one at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I really do not understand why oral-b dont just replace the brushes on the head.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to use too harsh of pressure, just let the rubber yellow part and motion/weight of the brush do the work for you.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> The rubber cup in the center provides an out of the dentist office</li>
            <li> The only downside is there&#x27;s a little hole in the brush arm that water can get into, which drains down to the handle and can sometimes coat the handle with greenish gunk (toothpaste) when standing upright to dry.  </li>
            <li> Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  </li>
            <li> I usually brush 3 times daily and now could probably make it twice a day with these heads.</li>
            <li> (I think due to eating blueberries).</li>
            <li> Heads are small so reach easily in back of mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other Oral-B brush heads</li>
            <li> my teeth have never felt cleaner, and i have tried other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brand names, but am sold on Braun products for my dental care.</li>
            <li> that any other one we ever had.</li>
            <li> Seem to keep my teeth cleaner and whiter than any other heads.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use my teeth whitening strips in months (as a daily coffee and wine drinker, they&#x27;re usually needed about once a month as a touch up....).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;an extremely orthodontic problem under control .</li>
            <li> We have used Oral B for six years and would not use any other type of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other knock offs I see.  </li>
            <li> I expected to receive what is in the photo and did not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their other brushes.  </li>
            <li> ...the other brush heads I have used for my Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes by oral-b</li>
            <li> She has a small mouth, and this brush head  gets her back teeth without discomfort....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be anxious to see what my dentist says at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> This center also extends the life of the bristles by protecting the pressure/ breaking down during agressive brushing.  </li>
            <li> I bought direct, not through a 3rd party seller, and I received what appears to be a fake product both for this head, and for other heads as well.</li>
            <li> but this one lasts a little while longer before you think it&#x27;s not really doing it for you anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought several packs, as they are really hard to find.</li>
            <li> If you use a whitening toothpaste and brush your teeth on a regular basis (at least two times a day), these brush heads will do its work of whitening and polishing your teeth.</li>
            <li> It keeps plaque down.</li>
            <li> When I compared this item&#x27;s price to the CVS one the price was almost 40% less.</li>
            <li> less cavities since my daughter started using this, cheaper on the wallet</li>
            <li> This can get expensive, but paying for dental work is even more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical of this product, so I took before and after pictures of my teeth to see what realistic results I had achieved.  </li>
            <li> but it feels hard on my teeth even when I am brushing softly so as not to trigger the pressure alert on my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have tried the generic heads and they are not nearly as good as these.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little pricey</li>
            <li> I use subscribe-and-save which saves me a little bit of money.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the one with little plastic paddles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this head has compared to other heads that is supposed to enhance the whitening.</li>
            <li> These are a little harsh on my gum line...</li>
            <li> So nine months worth isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a few weeks for the two of us to use.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, twice a day.</li>
            <li> Save a few bucks and buy the originals.</li>
            <li> I got an email telling me they are on the way after having gotten a package just a few weeks ago (around three weeks).</li>
            <li> helps polish  and whiten teeth with  everyday</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker, and my teeth get stained with brown coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these replacement heads do not fit.</li>
            <li> I recommend them if you have trouble with plaque build up</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought a three pack of these Prowhite and don&#x27;t know what to do with them and don&#x27;t know if ordering other ones will give any different results.</li>
            <li> Stick to the plain brush heads.</li>
            <li> My teeth are just plain cleaner and whiter with this brush head.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to go back to a regular toothbrush now</li>
            <li> In the past few years, they&#x27;ve been elusive.  </li>
            <li> I found that the hard plastic cup in the center was hard on my gums.  </li>
            <li> These \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; brush heads offer nothing above the standard, other than switching the default mode to the annoying polishing mode.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Over the past 10 years, we have used all of the styles offered.</li>
            <li> I do think they make a small yet noticeable difference on my teeth</li>
            <li> I only wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are 3 and not 4 brushes in a package...</li>
            <li> In the past this brush head would make my toothbrush change modes automatically.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say on that.</li>
            <li> The brush head is not what I was used to -- small, circular, like a dentist&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> After utilizing this product for about four months, I went off to my dentist for the usual semi-annual routine.  </li>
            <li> : They are too expensive especially since it needs replacing every three months.</li>
            <li> I save a small amount by signing up for automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were always a bit dull and a faint yellow.  </li>
            <li> it up to cover it and looks horrible..too bad for a brand new purchase</li>
            <li> I have had these for years, but find them hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Just hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> I find these relatively hard to find in the stores and drugstores.</li>
            <li> Get these, or at least try them.</li>
            <li> you save at least $8.00 from retail stores.</li>
            <li> it is too late to return the item.  </li>
            <li> VERY ANNOYING light to tell me</li>
            <li> at least 4-6 months (if you want to keep it that</li>
            <li> subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo.</li>
            <li> IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE TO RETURN AMAZONS MISTAKES, AND THEY MAKE QUITE A VIT LATELY</li>
            <li> This product is no good if I can give it 0stars</li>
            <li> Shocked by how white they made my teeth!</li>
            <li> The knock off parts fail after a few days or weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brushing too hard!</li>
            <li> Sucks!</li>
            <li> These are very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find replacement heads for this unit since its been around for a while</li>
            <li> poor quality.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they might not fit</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a dramatic difference overnight</li>
            <li> So hard you can use these to scrub your pots and dirty dishes.</li>
            <li> &quot; pictures given on the product page for the \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; had were helpful in spotting the fake in my case.</li>
            <li> I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals.</li>
            <li> sadly I believe they have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> Awfully expensive.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for the electric toothbrushes are a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Oral-B electric toothbrush for about 5 years, and was unable to order replacement brush heads from the Oral-B website.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to find them elsewhere.</li>
            <li> These were very difficult to find until I tried Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I did not know how bad I was brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes also come with color coded bands to distinguish his and her brushes if you share a brush base.  </li>
            <li> Both my wife and I hated them --</li>
            <li> I hate when manufacturers treat buyers like idiots! !</li>
            <li> Retards plaque growth and teeth feel cleaner longer between dental visits.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase because what I received is not what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand that everything has to be idiot proof these days!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great brush head. Does a great job. Reaches way back to those hard to reach back molars. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple other types of brushes, but continue to come back to this one.  It provides the best and most comfortable brushing action of all I have tried.</li>
            <li> Of course your teeth are your life, it is like using a new tooth brush and the digital read out tell you when you have to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> I use these and the oral b once a day (my gums included and tongue and roof of mouth).  My dentist surprised.  Each person is different results.</li>
            <li> Cleans exceptionally well.  Attached it to my ancient electric toothbrush and saw an almost instant improvement.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much whitening it does.  But it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my Oral B brush. I guess it is buyer beware. I did order the correct replacement product on a subsequaint order?</li>
            <li> The brush performs as expected. I cannot tell if the teeth are becoming very white. But they are definitely whiter than when using conventional tooth brush or other brush heads</li>
            <li> These are very good Brush Heads.&lt;br /&gt;I like the center Rubber bumper that also massages as you brush.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing my electronic toothbrush, people have noticed how white my teeth are. This is my second time ordering from this seller and I am definitely a faithful consumer!</li>
            <li> I have had these for years, but find them hard to find in stores.  Order arrived quickly.  No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Came as expected from supplier. Really prefer these brushes to original basic brushes that come with the Oral B.</li>
            <li> Everyone buying this already has the brush and probably knows how great it is. However, this particular extension does wonders. With this head, my brush automatically goes into polish mode and my teeth are noticeably cleaner and I swear whiter. Definitely worth the money and Amazon has a great price on these compared to a normal retail store or supermarket.</li>
            <li> These are direct replacements for the originals and work just as good. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works as expected. Wish the heads would last a little bit longer. For our family the heads seems to last only about two months before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I ordered these refills instead of the ones the brush came with because they were much cheaper than the other options. I think they work well but I have not noticed any difference in the color of my teeth, even using a whitening toothpaste. I read some reviews before purchasing and some reviewers made it seem as though these brush heads improved the color drastically... I think my teeth are just stubborn.</li>
            <li> These arrived yesterday and I immediately used them. With only one use I noticed a marked increase in how well my back teeth were cleaned.  They have stayed clean without having the fuzzy buildup I get throughout the day. I usually brush 3 times daily and now could probably make it twice a day with these heads. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product is the exact replacement that the manufacturer calls for!  The only difference is that I bought it on Amazon.com for almost 1/2 price!!  Great Job.  I will shop here again and often.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]  I bought this brush head for the polishing cup feature. While I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet, I&#x27;m not quite convinced the polishing cup really makes a difference. I had hoped that using it with a polishing paste would have the same effect as the dental hygienist&#x27;s polishing cup, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to. The paste just scatters on the tooth rather than being concentrated where I have placed the cup. Maybe I&#x27;ll get better at it, but currently it&#x27;s just another brush head in my dental regime arsenal!</li>
            <li> Great product, it really polishes your teeth really well. Just hard to find in the stores. I have only been able to find on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works or not. I use the Floss Action head as my main tooth bush and I don&#x27;t really need the polisher head.    I used it a couple times since I got it and it is ok but because the floss action one does such a good job I just don&#x27;t need this.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I could not find these at any of my local stores so I had to order online. Works very well and makes my teeth very happy.</li>
            <li> The yellow silicon cup in the center is designed to hold toothpaste just like dentists use a similar tool to hold a granular paste to polish your teeth. Nice idea but regular toothpaste just desolves as soon as you begin to brush. I recommend the Dual Action or the Floss Action versions instead.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, unfortunately sent the Floss Action instead of the Pro-White! Since I can use them, I elected to keep them. Shame really.</li>
            <li> These really polish your teeth.  Love them.</li>
            <li> Thank You!!!  Everything was great....exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> so this does polish your teath almost like the dentist, as long as used with tooth paste that is somewhat grainy</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the brush heads I ordered from Amazon.  They arrived on schedule and fit my electric toothbrush as advertised.  The replacement brushes I have tried from the drug store were a very tight fit and didn&#x27;t work properly.l</li>
            <li> fits well with my oral b toothbrush. had to get a replacement as algae was growing in the mechanical part. Just remember to spray water into the hole and pull out the brush head from the body of the electric toothbrush to keep it algae free for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> We love our Oral-B Professional Toothbrushes. They are far superior to the Sonicare brushes we used to have.  These brushes were the best price and were delivered very quickly.  Thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> I got these hoping that they would work better than the regular brush heads I got with my Oral-B electric tooth brush.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  Not only did I not feel they provided any extra whitening compared to the time I had spent using the regular brush head, but the plastic circle in the middle would break really quickly and given that there are fewer bristles on the head, my teeth were harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since gone back to using the regular heads and am once again much happier with the color of my teeth, and they even got rid of some stains from smoking that the Pro White brush heads couldn&#x27;t handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the regular heads...</li>
            <li> Loved this brush head for cleaning coffee stains off teeth.  I could tell a difference between these and the standard brush head.  They don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the standard brush heads though.</li>
            <li> Genuine product, works well.</li>
            <li> These whitening heads are very hard to find in store, but are excellent for the Oral-B brush system.</li>
            <li> I like to the feel after brushing my teeth with Oral-B Professional Prowhite. You cannot get that from regular brushes.</li>
            <li> The oral-B tooth tooth brush refills arrived on time as listed by Amizon and since we are fimilar with this product&#x27;s use, they live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> Buy these and not the generic ones. These work great while the cheaper kind feel like they are shredding your gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my Mother. It shipped quickly and works great. She is very pleased with her \\&quot;gift\\&quot;, and I am very pleased with the great deal.</li>
            <li> MY DENTIST STRONGLY RECOMMENDED I GET ONE OF THESE [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]] &amp; AMAZON JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE A HALF PRICE REBATE AVAILABLE WHEN I FOUND THIS ONE!!  NOW I SEE THESE ARE THE CORRECT TOOTHBRUSHES I NEED TO BUY FOR REPALCEMENT - SO MANY &amp; HARD TO FIND THE RIGHT ONES.  MY TEETH ARE VERY STRIPPED OF ENAMEL AND I NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH THEM...ANY HOW USING THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH [[ASIN:B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] WHICH I ALSO GOT HERE FOR A GREAT PRICE HAS BEEN A GOD SEND TO MY SMILE - SO MANY COMPLIMENTS I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT - I LOVE IS THING!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell on this web site which toothbrush is the \\&quot;original Oral B\\&quot;, but this seems to be it.  Packaging that looks like \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;, Extended brissles on the tip, color coding for wear and a neat special center for better polishing (new).    This seems to be   the real \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this brush head. The yellow part does not seem to have any advantageous use.  I&#x27;ll stick to the one with just the bristles.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a stocking stuffer for my hubby. He was elated to receive them this Christmas. He says the quality is just as good if not better than the original brushes that came with the oral b toothbrush we purchased. This item works well and amazon has these refills priced much more competitively than drugstores and other stores. We signed up for subscribe and save and this item is now a staple for my husband!! I will never buy these elsewhere again!!</li>
            <li> Over the past 10 years, we have used all of the styles offered. The strictly bristle models tend to wear out quicker and they pretty much all floss and brush the same.  The &#x27;polishing heads&#x27; are much different as they have silicone or rubber center which really does polish the teeth while removing plaque and flossing as well. This center also extends the life of the bristles by protecting the pressure/ breaking down during agressive brushing.  I smoke cigars, and after 2 weeks, the plaque is gone.  Feels like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist...squeek and all.    These tend to be the most expensive heads available, but with better results and the much longer life, these are a no-brainer.  Get these, or at least try them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these hoping that they&#x27;d help remove some blue stains on my teeth (I think due to eating blueberries). After less than 1 week, the staining had improved by around 70%, and my teeth seem to be overall whiter. Very impressed! These clean and whiten better than any other brush head I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This brush is so hard you are lucky to have teeth left. I brought the 3 ct. tried one, now I am stuck with 2 that I   can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads for the Oral-B Triumph and others do a great job cleaning your teeth and giving your teeth that smooth, just-been-to-the-dentist feeling.  The yellow cap in the middle really seems to get your teeth feeling smoother than with just regular brush heads.  Definitely worth the money and cheaper than I could find anywhere else.  I had been getting these from Razors Direct as they are very fast and have free shipping.  However, Amazon&#x27;s price beat theirs, and the shipping was free - a great bargain!</li>
            <li> There are generic replacement brushes available for this toothbrush, but these are good quality and I know what I am getting.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral-B 5000 from Amazon and it is fantastic! It really brushes my teeth and gums  and does not affect the pinched nerve in my right arm. The unit comes with a coupon for 3   replacement heads, which I will purchase locally. The 5000 is really a professional machine,  and has more power available than you could ask for; an adjustment feature allows the user to  step-down the intensity of the brushing to a more comfortable level, if desired. Why I waited  so long to by a 5000, is still a mystery; and I use it in conjunction with my new Water Flosser.  The combination of these two dental wonders is a must have for any household; it will pay off in  reduced dental bills, in a short time.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth well. Feels like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the OB brush heads. The \\&quot;Oral B, Pro White\\&quot; really takes off the coffee stain. It&#x27;s the rubber pad in the middle that does it. I&#x27;ve noticed OB heads don&#x27;t last long for whitening but this one lasts a little while longer before you think it&#x27;s not really doing it for you anymore. If you don&#x27;t order a big gulp of coffee every morning like I do, you&#x27;ll think it last really long. Best whitener I have ever found.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best investments we should have made years ago.  My teeth feel cleaner, brighter and more polished than just using a regular toothbrush.  My only complaint is that sometimes the toothpaste seems to fall off the brush while I first start brushing.</li>
            <li> i love this toothbrush.  The replacement heads are hard to find in the store.  So excited when i found them online for a great price.</li>
            <li> After using these - I don&#x27;t wanna go back to anything else I used before - I am using OralB since I am 12 I love it but it is even better with these heads.</li>
            <li> I saw this new brush head, with the little polisher in the middle,  and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I&#x27;m not disappointed with it and it cleans my teeth very well. I tried using the brush head that had softer bristles but I could see it wasn&#x27;t doing the job and I needed to change. Haven&#x27;t had a cavity (or anything other than regular cleaning) in 12 years. Coincidentally that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush. After I had been using it a year the Dental Hygienist remarked, \\&quot;I have to hunt to find things to do in your mouth\\&quot;...so I started getting my teeth cleaned once every 2 years. This saves time and money and, to me, this is a good thing in this economy. This type brush head is doing a good job. Not too sure the inner polisher is a big plus, but we&#x27;ll see over a period of time.</li>
            <li> Love these polishers for every day use...you want whitening...use these.  Does a great job cleaning and it does help to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; teeth.  I&#x27;m not talking about whitening like those strips--natural whitening by getting rid of the coffee and other stains to show the natural look.</li>
            <li> given that I ordered the toothbrush online and do not know where to buy it retail, this product arrived quickly and as ordered.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this  Oral-B replacement brush head.  It&#x27;s similar to the one used in the dentist office.  Really makes my teeth feel clean.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with the Braun Oral-B 5000 I purchased. I have not had to use these yet but the one I have works very well. A must purchase at the same time you get the Braun.</li>
            <li> Another reliable &amp; good purchase through Amazon.com  These tooth brush heads are the perfect replacement heads for the Braun Ultra Plaque Remover.  They are very easy to install.  They work like a charm.  my experience is that these heads  each last for about 4 months of daily use.  They work just as good as the polishing brushes used by my dentist to clean my teeth.  i&#x27;m very satisfied.  Thank you again Amazon.com  i find you to be reliable business people with great integrity.  Blessings, Grace &amp; Peace to you all.  michaelofJESUS</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this polisher heads for Oral B Toothbrushes when I got it together with the Triumph. To put it simply: it works! It actually makes your teeth shine (I guess the results might also depend on the type of tooth paste you use. In my case I use Colgate Total). But since it doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as other regular brush heads, I only use it only once a day for polishing purposes and not so much for cleaning (for that I recommend OralB FlossAction heads.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are hard to find in retail stores; I was pleased to see them on Amazon!  They perform good, but are over priced for what you get.  I will likely stick with the after market brush heads.</li>
            <li> Original replacement brushes just as expected, at a good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This really did the job!  Removed stains from tea, coffee, and wine with the first use!  I&#x27;ve found that the over the counter whiteners I&#x27;ve used do not hold a candle to this polishing head when it comes to removing stains.  Also, my teeth are very shiny.  I actually think I look better now than after a trip to the dentist. I used these with the Oral B Vitality Precision toothbrush.  I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t know how much I can comment on replacement toothbrush heads but these are excellent. They are brand name Oral B replacements. If you&#x27;re thinking about being cheap and buying a knock off replacement please don&#x27;t! Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real thing. Your Oral B toothbrush was meant to be used with Oral B heads. The performance will not be as good with a knock off brand. As far as the advertised \\&quot;Pro White\\&quot;, I cannot attest to that. I seem to highly doubt that just by using a different head that you&#x27;re teeth are magically gonna become whiter. However, they will definitely clean your teeth very well and if you use it with the Waterpik flosser your oral health will improve dramatically!</li>
            <li> The polishing brush is the most effective &amp; very long lasting</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get much better, flossing isn&#x27;t such a big deal since this brush head does a good deep clean every time at angles you can&#x27;t do with a normal tooth brush. I&#x27;m going to try the Double head next.</li>
            <li> Love these brushheads. These match the ones that came with our Oral-B toothbrush and the only ones I could find with the rubber center.</li>
            <li> I find these heads a lot better than the regular ones. My teeth feel a lot cleaner and shinier. I find that in combination with the Listerine whitening pre-brush it does wonders.  They will not make your teeth hollywood white, but you&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and these replacent heads are great!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning.  So far I have no tarter build up and the hard to clean places are no longer hard to clean</li>
            <li> I was concerned because I didn&#x27;t know if they will fit my Vitality brush, but they did! They come with three bands for id and they are great tools too. Really happy to find them on line, not available to find them in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical of this product, so I took before and after pictures of my teeth to see what realistic results I had achieved.  I gave it a fair 30 days to see how good it would do.  I brush twice a day, on and off with Seonsodyne Whitenting and Sensodyne Pronamel. I also ensured that I used the \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; brush setting that the toothbrush offers. Between the two photos, I noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, but not very much.  My teeth--particularly the bottom ones--are rather yellowed (but healthy) to begin with.  So I&#x27;d say to prospective buyers of this product, that it is a good quality item with a design that I believe is geared toward removing surface stains and polishing tooth enamel.  It would probably be nice to have it your teeth are already somewhat white and not yellowed very much, but don&#x27;t expect too much.  It might be somewhat of a gimmick that it \\&quot;whitens\\&quot; teeth, but if you look at what the item is called--Pro White, it is designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth and make them a little whiter.  SO in all fairness, I&#x27;d say that it works as it should without huge results that people may expect of it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting the generic ones from Target or BJ&#x27;s or another store.  These brush heads seem to drip more than the generic ones making them messy.</li>
            <li> Really like this Prowhite replacement brush head.  Teeth feel very clean after use.  Will continue using Oral B from now on.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my teeth are in better shape since I started using this toothbrush one year ago. I needed replacement heads but couldn&#x27;t find this particular head and decided to look on the internet. Great time in receiving them and this is a  great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  The brush head is slightly larger than most regular items and really does an excellent job cleaning my teeth.  The bristles are soft and feel great against my gums, as well.  This package was such a great deal for a three pack - I bought two to stock up!  I will definitely buy it again and am very happy to have found it on Amazon.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is no good if I can give it 0stars I would. The bristles dont work good, they are flimsy and the middle part had no bristles at all. We threw it away after 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> This polisher is a must have if you have the Oral B Triumph.</li>
            <li> Bought this product about a month ago and it has worked well. I charge it when the low battery light flashes and it last about a week to 10 days between chargings. I would recommed this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for an electirc toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of rough for my fragile sensitive teeth. But I do love how polished they feel afterwards. More than the regular soft oral b.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use my Oral B my teeth feel like I just had a profession cleaning at the dentist.  The claim that your teeth will be noticably whiter in 21 days is certainly true.  What I like most about my Oral B is that is encourages you to get into a routine; clean and floss at bed time and polish the next morning.  I only wish I had bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> Awesome product....ok, it&#x27;s more expensive than brushing your teeth with a conventional toothbrush, however, it&#x27;s a case of you get what you pay for.  The results speak for themselves and there&#x27;s a reason top dentists recommend electric toothbrushes....I was sceptical until I bought one but the Prowhite replacement head both takes care of the cleaning and leaves your teeth white enough that the visit to the dentist no longer has to be an ordeal:-)  Last of all, it&#x27;s less effort to let the appliance do the work than to brush your teeth manually.</li>
            <li> I bought these at the same time that I bought the tooth brush as I wanted to make sure I could get replacements for the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Product did exactly what I wanted it to do.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect size, durable. Like the Pro best, others available are either too big and clumsy or too small and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Works very well, feels great on my teeth! Use with a coarse toothpaste (Crest whitening) for maximum whitening effect. I always get asked how my teeth are so white, and I just tell people all it takes is a good brush/brush-head and good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> purchase original oral b products it pays in quality. this is a good product</li>
            <li> I love this brush head. It is my favorite and it is the best at removing plaque and messaging my gums. If it whitens my teeth, that is just added bonus.</li>
            <li> Works okay just like other brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth cleaning depends on how you hold (Angle and moment) the electronic brush.</li>
            <li> It was the right size</li>
            <li> Not much to say here. They&#x27;re a little pricey but whatever I use one brush head for a year or so (I don&#x27;t really care about their suggestions) works well and doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I bought direct, not through a 3rd party seller, and I received what appears to be a fake product both for this head, and for other heads as well. The fakes are also getting very hard to spot, because none of the \\&quot;real vs fake\\&quot; pictures given on the product page for the \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; had were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subtle difference is in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy from Amazon because it&#x27;s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off may be similar in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought several different brush heads from Amazon this Christmas, and all appear to be fakes. In the case of this particular product, I also noticed that the bristles were not very strong since a few broke in half the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Have used oral b toothbrushes for years and keep ordering replacement head. Heads are small so reach easily in back of mouth.</li>
            <li> I prefer these to the Floss Action (the one with the paddles) and the regular replacement heads. These are not too soft like the regulars and not too stiff like the Floss Action.</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush includes onr of these style heads. This one seems to work very well. The others do too but this claims to have an advantage for polishing teeth. I have no idea if it actually does but the concept is good.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for cleaning teeth. Every brushing is like a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush was one of my best buys last year, This prowhite brush heads work great, but i think i&#x27;m gonna move to the flossing ones  after these are over :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been 2 months and they work just as advertised, first time EVER that a toothbrush is gonna last me 3 months!</li>
            <li> I like this style of brushes.  I cannot find the in retail stores</li>
            <li> Got it for my girlfriend and I. The battery lasts a few weeks for the two of us to use. The timer is great, 30 second intervals until the 2 Min mark.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with these brush heads.  They are great for keeping stains at bay between trips to the dentist for cleanings.  My teeth are smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This one works the best for me as I get that sleek clean feeling on my teeth after I use it. I&#x27;ve tried cross action, floss, and this one so far and prefer this one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice idea for a brush but poorly executed. The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m conflicted about these toothbrush heads.  I do think they make a small yet noticeable difference on my teeth , I found them to be VERY hard on my gums (even though I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth/gums).&lt;br /&gt;I will use these occasionally (until the 3-pack I bought is used up), but these are not my regular toothbrush heads.  I like others much more, and could live without these no problem.&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, these were OK but I will not repurchase.  A toothbrush needs to be practical for your whole mouth.  People with sensitive gums should definitely stay away.</li>
            <li> These are a little harsh on my gum line...</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was everything I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love these round-head bristles. I feel that they provide a very deep clean. You know when to change the head by the color indicator. They are expensive, but a clean mouth is worth it. I use subscribe-and-save which saves me a little bit of money.</li>
            <li> I like the rubbery circle in the middle that reminds me of the dentist&#x27;s polishing tool, but just by a little bit I feel that the precision heads perform better. I&#x27;ll probably buy those instead when it&#x27;s time for a replacement.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfreind so that he would not go out and use chimicals to whiten his teeth. these polishers really do work but it takes alot of time. if you have the patients, then i reccomend these.</li>
            <li> Great price to keep teeth clean the easy way.</li>
            <li> Works just like in the dentist office! The center of the head is just like the dentist uses to polish my teeth.</li>
            <li> First I tried cheap after-market replacement heads but they kept falling off and were far too soft. Then I tried one of those tiny Oral-B heads but it was far too small. I didn&#x27;t expect much from this Prowhite but boy am I happy with it. It cleans my teeth and gums better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before. I&#x27;m so sold on this particular head that I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually lightened a whole shade once I started using this brush!</li>
            <li> I purchased the toothbrush along with 3 pk replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;They all work perfectly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The floss head is great.&lt;br /&gt; My whole family has noticed a improvement in the color and feel of their teeth &amp; gums.&lt;br /&gt;After my purchase of the Oral-B replacement heads &amp; toothbrush, I found generic replacement heads for the toothbrush for a better price, generic? do not know the difference yet, I may try them when the time comes to replace, the ones that came with the toothbrush work great and have worked longer that a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel great! Look whiter!&lt;br /&gt;hj.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say everything ordered from Amazon-Prime arrives within 2/3 business days.&lt;br /&gt;Great service.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is a must have to go with your electric Oral B toothbrush. I have 3 differnt replacement heads, however I use the whitening placement head every single morning. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> These brush&#x27;s are incredible. Teeth have never felt better or cleaner except at dentist office. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Have to change monthly, but great results from this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other Oral-B brush heads but they just don&#x27;t seem to clean as well as these. I think the rubbery-center really does work to lightly polish teeth, as every other brush head I tried just didn&#x27;t seem to break up as much plaque and debris.</li>
            <li> very happy with the brush heads since they are original and not some sort of cheaper generic product that doesn&#x27;t even fit in the toothbrush</li>
            <li> These are just like the original&#x27;s that came with the Oral-b brush.  They seem to last a long time and do a nice job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Both of my parents are dentists and bushing has always been something very important to me. To me Oral B has the best product out there.  my teeth have never felt cleaner, and i have tried other brands.  I think the whitening cups do work, of course in combination with a good toothpaste.  These replacements make my teeth feel extremely clean every time.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are top quality.  I cant always find them locally so I tried Amazon.  I got what I needed and beat the local price.  That is why I&#x27;ll come back when I need more.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I use it daily and am very happy with the results.  My teeth actually do feel more clean.</li>
            <li> Very cheap deal, very good quality and a wellworth business. Its lifespan is good, and it cleans the teeth as it promised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it a lot, just sometimes. I have two brushes. Even if I didn&#x27;t I would change the head to do regular cleaning. I guess I would do what another said, once a day.</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; brush heads offer nothing above the standard, other than switching the default mode to the annoying polishing mode.  Stick to the plain brush heads.</li>
            <li> These were replacement heads for the Oral B vitality toothbrush. My teeth do feel smoothe and clean after brushing with this but sometimes I think its just a tiny bit rough on the teeth.  I feel like I have to get a regular brush head to switch on and off with every couple days.  It does seem to work, and as I said they definitely feel clean.  Maybe I just have sensitive teeth. I am still satisfied with my purchase and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> it is a good thing for health care. I always use it every week. It is very useful for me.</li>
            <li> really make my teeth feel clean. sadly I believe they have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> My family has been using oral b for the past 12 years and we all have healthy teeth. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found a solution to my coffee drinking and stain removal dilemma. I have used other brand names, but am sold on Braun products for my dental care. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Standard Oral-B product.  Oral B makes high quality items.  These are their standard replacement brush heads and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> The Pro White heads pretty much have this circular rubber piece in the middle (I assume trying to imitate the polish brush used by the dental hygienist) but it feels hard on my teeth even when I am brushing softly so as not to trigger the pressure alert on my electric toothbrush. The Pro White heads feel like I&#x27;m trying to scrape my teeth clean, not polish them. When engaged, the Pro White heads fling off all the toothpaste quite rapidly, which leads to needing to replenish the toothpaste after brushing each quarter of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much prefer Oral-B&#x27;s Floss Action heads because they are effective and comfortable, even when my teeth are feeling sensitive. I will choose the Floss Action heads every time because they get into the crevices quite nicely and distribute the toothpaste rather evenly. They also brush the gums nicely. No thanks, Pro White! Floss Action is my replacement brush head of choice.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful toothbrushes.  My husband and I both use them.  They get your teeth so clean!  you will never go back to a regular toothbrush again.  Amazon had a great price on these replacement heads too!  I would definitely order these again!</li>
            <li> Works great, wasn&#x27;t sure brush head could really make a difference, but switched to the prowhite brush head and about six months later my son and daughter-in-law both asked me if I had bleached my teeth.  Had not changed anything else, still used Aquafresh toothpaste, had only switched brush head.  (using the Oral B Professional 4000 toothbrush, love it too)</li>
            <li> Keeps my toothbrush going strong.</li>
            <li> just as i said above it does a great job of polishing and cleaning your teeth...i have used this style for many years and have never been disapointed.</li>
            <li> Received in good condition.</li>
            <li> I order these every 3 months, so I get the 15% savings, save a trip to the store, free shipping, plus it is a reminder to change out the toothbrush heads every 3 months.</li>
            <li> The package of 3 Oral B refill heads is a great value through Amazon. I tried to purchace them at my local drug store and  the cost three times the amount that Amazon offers them for. It was cheaper to buy a whole new Oral B electric tooth brush, which comes with 3 refill heads, then to buy just the replacement heads.  These are also great for cleaning your teeth. I have tried a lot of different brands and they never came close to the bright cleaning power of Oral B, and now Amazon offers them at the best low price to be able to always have extra refill heads for a great way to keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> We are, my wife and I, very happy wth our new OralB electric  tooth brushes Much better that any other one we ever had. Advance technology. Marco Y Mercedes. [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph 9400 Toothbrush  ]]</li>
            <li> My teeth suffer from regularly being exposed to coffee DAILY&lt;br /&gt;They were always a bit dull and a faint yellow.  Now, they are remarkably whiter / brighter&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I have used this model brush for nearly four years, every day.  It doesn&#x27;t make a dramatic difference overnight&lt;br /&gt;However, if you want a simple way to improve the appearance of the teeth, just use them everyday and never look back.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome results.</li>
            <li> These brush heads really do what they claim.  This was a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Some of the replacements have to be pressed onto the head of the electric brush. Not a good fit.</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush - it makes my teeth sparkling clean. And these replacement brushes fit and work perfectly. I like the blue wear indicator bristles, letting me know when to change the brush.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use these for daily brushing and they just do not work well for that.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they are okay to use once in awhile.</li>
            <li> These are very hard to find in stores.  Amazon is great for finding things you cannot find in stores.  You also cannot beat their prices.  These polish your teeth really nice.</li>
            <li> good enough to get the job done. I purposely bought the cheapest of all available. Charger takes for ever though.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes as they seem to make my teeth whiter and feel cleaner. I only wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the real thing. Generic brands do not hold up like the real ones. I love these with the polishing centers as well.</li>
            <li> i do not like these at all. they also did not last even half the time the  Percision ones do. i will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> When I use other brush heads , i notice my teeth still gets yellow over time, however this toothbrush head keeps my teeth white. It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned electric Oral-B toothbrushes for over 15 years now and tried all heads that they offer.  These particular ones are the ones I love most.  Simply great heads.  Seem to keep my teeth cleaner and whiter than any other heads.  Made in Germany.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift so I can not give a good rating as far as using these brushes but I think Oral-B is a good brand.</li>
            <li> I like the design for cleaning in the transition between the teeth and it is a bit larger than some other styles.</li>
            <li> These brush head replacements are good quality and they fit perfectly with my brush at home.  I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> this was a christmas gift and my son love this i brought for my son with his electric toothbrush and they fit,</li>
            <li> I got these brush heads (on sale) as a replacement for the original brush head that came with my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I like these brush heads better than the original one! The way these heads move differs from the original heads because the original head is round and these heads have ellipse form, and for whatever reason I like the new feeling that these new heads provide better. Further, although these are Pro White brush heads, I have not noticed any special whitening effects. However, these brush heads do give you squeaky clean teeth, and I have no had this with the original head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the Pro White brush heads!</li>
            <li> Best head on the market. Gets in those deeper places and fantastic around the gum line! This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning power!  I was very impressed with the whitening which was as described.  I would definitely purchase these brush heads again.</li>
            <li> For me,this particular brush is much too hard on the gums. I highly recommend Oral B&#x27;s softer version... I give that one 5 stars.</li>
            <li> - High quality product&lt;br /&gt;- Leave your teeth thoroughly clean and shiny&lt;br /&gt;- To all those who require deep cleaning and have healthy teeth</li>
            <li> This is the one my wife uses most of the time. It seems to clean and polish very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are 3 and not 4 brushes in a package... but they are just like what we were using.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush to use . Has a timer on the handheld device so you brush for 2 minutes. Both my wife and I have a unit, therefore we need the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> While you should change brush  heads every three months, these official replacement brush heads will last almost six. That&#x27;s twice as long as the store-brand heads and three times three times the non-brand heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using the Prowhites from the Dual-action and Gumcare lines at a friend&#x27;s suggestion and amazingly they do whiten my teeth. The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as the Gumcare, and I have to move the brush around a bit more than the Dual-action, but the rubber-center is doing a better job at pushing more toothpaste to polish my teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads and found them to be totally satisfactory.    I will order again from Amazon.    Clayton Bartlett</li>
            <li> Good price point! Quick shipping. Works well! I haven&#x27;t had to use my teeth whitening strips in months (as a daily coffee and wine drinker, they&#x27;re usually needed about once a month as a touch up....). My sons teeth also seem brighter, which is a plus too!</li>
            <li> I love the product!  After a lot of comparison shopping for this product I have found that Amazon when your order is sufficient for free shipping has the best prices.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. I was already a fan when I ordered them. Both tooth brush holder and tooth brushes work for me.</li>
            <li> It does not function quite the same as the original. The original caused the motor to oscillate between high and low speeds. This does not. It will work at high or low, but the rapid oscillation seemed to word better.</li>
            <li> I recommend these brush heads. They fit fine and do their job. Assume they will have a respectable service life.</li>
            <li> This product fully met my expectations and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> these are good but I still need to floss and irrigate. CVS charges way too much so this is a fair alternative.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and arrived timely.</li>
            <li> I used this head with oral B Smart Guide Traction 5000, from the second time I saw the difference, it was excellent.</li>
            <li> In the past this brush head would make my toothbrush change modes automatically. This version did not do that so I returned them.</li>
            <li> Ordered these replacement brushes for my Oral-B Smartseries 5000 electronic toothbrush.  The fit exactly as if they were manufactured for this brush and similar size brushes.  Replacement brushes also come with color coded bands to distinguish his and her brushes if you share a brush base.  The brushes do a nice job giving you that fresh from the dentist cleaning, although I prefer the cleaning power of the &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; brush that came packaged with my Smartseries 5000.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this head for a while and no problems.  My teeth look good.  My mouth feels fresh and clean.  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist advised me to get an electric toothbrush that ,if used daily, would reduce the amount of placque and tartar. Won&#x27;t find out until my next exam but my teeth feel much cleaner. Delivery of the Oral B was swift and the product is very well made.</li>
            <li> Stores in my area for some reason do not stock the whitening brush head for the Oral B electric toothbrush.  I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  When we(hubby and I) use these brush heads it makes the teeth feel like we&#x27;ve visited the hygenist !!</li>
            <li> Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Heads are Great!  These were very difficult to find until I tried Amazon.  There are many different types of replacement brush heads, but these are the best.  After using my teeth feel like I just left the dentist office.  Good price as well.</li>
            <li> I do not like the oval shaped head with the little polishing head in the middle. I prefer the traditional, small circular head with the entire brushhead covered in bristles. I will not be ordering these replacement heads again. My advice to braun...if it ain&#x27;t broke, do not try to fix it.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;cleaners&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Expensive but better than the knock offs.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These brushes will make you feel like you just had your teeth cleaned. I change head every 4-6 months after each cleaning. I sometimes dip the heads in peroxide or mouthwash for 5 minutes to keep it clean. I rotate sometimes between the floss action and the  Oral B Pro white. I have perfect teeth. I get compliments on my teeth all the time. I got my gosh, looks like a string of pearl in your mouth. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> They do the job, digging out the nastiness between tooth and gum.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 toothbrush in January and it was a purchase I don&#x27;t regret.  The Prowhite replacement brush heads are fabulous!  My teeth never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> These work well to clean my teeth!  The only downside is there&#x27;s a little hole in the brush arm that water can get into, which drains down to the handle and can sometimes coat the handle with greenish gunk (toothpaste) when standing upright to dry.  Otherwise, if you&#x27;re more careful about cleaning the brush heads and not in a hurry, then it&#x27;s not so much a problem.  They seem to do an effective job!  A bit noisy, though... but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I wish more came in a pack but other than that, they are great! They make such a difference on making my teeth whiter with every brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brush heads for my Oral-B power toothbrush, but the Pro-White brush heads are my favorite.  They hold just the right amount of toothpaste in their little \\&quot;cup\\&quot; and are more gentle on my gums than the floss head brush.  They&#x27;re supposed to mimic the whitening head on the tool the dentist uses when cleaning your teeth.  I like the shape and feel of the brush, which is why I use it.  I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 3 Count&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Oral-B tooth brush (and its accessories) for years and have been able to keep&lt;br /&gt;an extremely orthodontic problem under control .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been impressed with anything Oral-B.  And this is the best cordless toothbrush yet not to mention the variety of brush heads you can get.  My dentist told me he was thoroughly impressed with how well these brushes did on my teeth.  I&#x27;m sold!!!</li>
            <li> Really works!!!  I use to use the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush heads, but switched to these about 7 months ago.  During my last dental check-up and cleaning last month the hygienist commented on what a good job I was doing with keeping the stains off my teeth (coffee, tea, etc.).  I&#x27;ve even noticed that my teeth look cleaner, and that the staining I always had right before my next dental appointment was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these if you smoke or drink things that might stain your teeth.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush heads!!</li>
            <li> Great company, great product!</li>
            <li> Probably fine. I haven&#x27;t needed them yet.</li>
            <li> Prefer this over the floss</li>
            <li> you save at least $8.00 from retail stores. plus this product is not available at these retail stores such Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, or Target. I looked them all and they don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> Product is solid and well built, so far hasn&#x27;t fallen apart as with the Oral-B Precision Clean heads. Still going strong after 6 months. Unclear if it really brightens, but it does get my teeth clean. Wish the heads were priced lower.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, easy to replace .</li>
            <li> Excellent product and they last!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great products and really fit on my Electric toothbrush. I&#x27;m satisfied this products because it&#x27;s amazing i will recommend this products to my friends,.</li>
            <li> Excellent service i recommended to anyone ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji</li>
            <li> not too hard, not too soft! noticeable diff after one use! love Oral B products! thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li> My last dentist&#x27;s appointment showed an improvement in my gums and teeth.  If you use it properly and don&#x27;t get lazy, it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Way better than the generic version of this specific brushhead. Spend the extra to get the real deal. IN THIS CASE IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement brushes.  Love my Oral-B</li>
            <li> We have used Oral B for six years and would not use any other type of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It looks like Oral-B is discontinuing this brush head for some reason, so I&#x27;ll enjoy these while they last.  I have to say that I was very surprised how quickly these arrived after ordering.</li>
            <li> I think I have an older toothbrush, so it is harder to find the replacement brush heads, especially prowhite type.  Great to find it online.</li>
            <li> Works as well as 7-day whitening strips, but you can accomplish the whitening while you brush. And works much better than whitening toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li> It works well and lasts for a good 3-4 month with daily use. After that, you should replace it to ensure the bristle remain nice and straight.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for decades because I think they are the best.  Aren&#x27;t your teeth worth the best?</li>
            <li> I tried several other heads and they all worked ok but this Prowhite head did a better job than all of the others, for me anyway</li>
            <li> These ones were right I just wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much damn money</li>
            <li> Although it may be too early to evaluate, I notice a big improvement over the old products about 10 years ago. The proper power strength, water proof feature and its durability.</li>
            <li> I love these!  I drink tea daily and red wine quite often, so I end up with a lot of stains on my teeth.  These heads really do help remove stains.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Used it as a replacement brushes for the Oral B powerful tooth brush. works well!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I ordered these brushes. First time they didn&#x27;t last very long but this set is very durable.</li>
            <li> Glad to find these oral B heads for a reasonable price, thanks!</li>
            <li> Would be a great item if it was actually the item that was shipped. I got floss heads instead of these with the polishing cup in my last delivery and now I had time to check against the blown up photo detail online it is too late to return the item.  Great item if Amazon shipped the right one!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know it is just me or they are pushing these ineffective products just to show more choices, but it feels like the head is bigger than what I am used to and the bristles are too hard to get in between my teeth and do the cleaning. I loved the head that came with the Clean Precision 1000 when I bought it. When I got these Prowhite I thought I will get used to them, but even after couple of months I find myself brushing with the regular old manual toothbrush afterwards. When I am in hurry, I am just going with the manual. Totally ruined the interest. Unfortunately I bought a three pack of these Prowhite and don&#x27;t know what to do with them and don&#x27;t know if ordering other ones will give any different results. Sucks!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.</li>
            <li> Original replacement heads.</li>
            <li> So hard you can use these to scrub your pots and dirty dishes.</li>
            <li> was  elated to find these brushes at Amazon and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> These brushes definitely help remove the stain from your teeth. I use this head every morning (regular head at night). My dental hygienist asked me if I was drinking less tea as my teeth were so much whiter. I still drink the same amount of tea .&lt;br /&gt;Give the brush time to work, it&#x27;s not going to remove stains overnight</li>
            <li> Been using them for many years.</li>
            <li> Received Oral-B Power Dual Clean Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head,3 Count instead Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head, 3 Count; however paid for the &amp;#34;Prowhite&amp;#34; kit which more pricy.  I wasn&#x27;t notified of the product replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use &amp;#34;Dual Clean&amp;#34; head and didn&#x27;t plan to buy them.</li>
            <li> Brush heads work well, so says my dental hygienist.I&#x27;m pleased too. The price was good. The product arrived in good time. All in all it was a very positive experience</li>
            <li> This brush head is the perfect size for me. The floss action head is too rough on my gums and the dual clean head is too big. This one does a good job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and excellent product at a fair price!</li>
            <li> Delivery on time. Have used Oral-B for years. The Brush works perfectly! Stock for coming 9 months.</li>
            <li> Always a great product.</li>
            <li> Quality good. Price great!</li>
            <li> while brushing, i felt the dual action brush head worked better, but I did notice my teeth getting whiter by the week, which did not happen with the dual action brush head.</li>
            <li> Great product. Every member of a family uses this replacement brushes. The dentist said that he can see noticeable results and that teeth seem cleaner than with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I find this brush to work better than the larger heads. You can concentrate on each tooth and is easy to sense problem areas.</li>
            <li> Very good bargain compared to buying in a store.  I do not care to write a longer review because you want more words!</li>
            <li> I needed this color coded multi-pack. It works great.</li>
            <li> performs as stated. will use again</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, twice a day. In the morning I do the regular brushing with regular head and at night I use the prowhite. I can&#x27;t live without it It so easy and convenient to use and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> the Pro-White head is great.  It does a wonderful job cleaning.  I use it in the morning and the floss-action at night.</li>
            <li> Alternate this tip with floss action tip, think both are good when used together.  Have been using for sometime now, teeth seem more white.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly with my oral b pro toothbrush. The bristles are great for cleaning teeth and getting tartar out in between teeth. I would recommend this too family and friends.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little larger and seems to get gums and teeth at the same time. It is wonderful for brightening...using it now for 3 weeks and I love it!</li>
            <li> Description was exact and was able to use the replacements right away on my current Oral-B Pro toothbrush. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other knock offs I see.  All this BPA stuff scares me and I would hope Oral-B is on top of this.  For this reason, I stick with the manufacturer&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m at the dentist! My teeth feel very clean and they feel great running my tongue alone them. Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> need to replace every 6 weeks</li>
            <li> was a decent price and the product is great. i know there are cheaper but dont get fooled these are the best.</li>
            <li> necessary auxillary for toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Awfully expensive. But I tried to go cheap and what I got was good only for scrubbing metal. These are a relief.</li>
            <li> Good price for something I use every day.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more one of these days! d</li>
            <li> This is a good cleaning head but I prefer the one with little plastic paddles - I think it is called the floss action head. Just my preference.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a toothbrush.  It works well and appears to be pretty durable.  Just a little bit small.</li>
            <li> Same as description thanks</li>
            <li> I originally thought that these Prowhite brush heads would not have enough bristles for a proper clean. I was wrong. There is enough bristles to get a great cleaning and the rubber cup in the middle does fantastic cleaning, knocking out debris, and polishing too. Using in conjunction with a whitening rinse, I&#x27;ve been quite impress with the overall results I have gotten. Nice, brighter looking teeth that feel fresh-from-the-dentist smooth. These will be the brush heads I will use from now on. The price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the floss action brush heads but decided to try something different. These are good and my teeth did look a little whiter but maybe its in my head. Regardless, they are good heads but not as good as the floss action.</li>
            <li> Great price and perfect product. Love oral B!</li>
            <li> This is very easy on your teeth and does an excellent cleaning job.  The Oral-B brushes and system are superb.  I have annual check-ups/cleanings with my dentist, and they always say how good a shape my teeth are in.  I use this brush head and the flossing head every morning and evening.  I highly recommend it.  It is far superior than any hand-held toothbrush.</li>
            <li> THE BEST BRUSH HEAD - ORAL B PROFESSIONAL PROWHITE REPLACEMENT BRUSH. RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A GREAT ORAL B CLEANING</li>
            <li> I ordered the Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Bruch Head 3 count and recieved a different oral b brush head. I did not notice it til i had opened the package. I expected to receive what is in the photo and did not! Very unhappy with this purchase because what I received is not what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she was very impress with the performance of the head. She says it does a good job of cleaning her teeth without a lot of effort. Yes, we will buy more whenever these wear out.</li>
            <li> It has bristles that rub on your mouth teeth when you hit a button. All by themselves!! I&#x27;m pleased. My mouth teeth haven&#x27;t fallen out yet!</li>
            <li> I like the polishing head in the center, it reminds me of the one at the dentist&#x27;s office. However, my wife says these are too big for her mouth. I have a big mouth so I don&#x27;t mind :D</li>
            <li> They are good quality replacement heads, better quality, last longer, and cleans better than generic brands.  The heads change color when they need changing no falling apart!  I will be buying again since the whole family is hooked on how clean the oral b cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Heads are durable, effective, with a quality build.  It&#x27;s a good value price wise.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and was a big hit for Christmas gifts.  Will probably order again sometime.  Product is priced to sell</li>
            <li> This brush head works fine and probably works as well as the original, but the main flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; and the bottom bristles wear out faster than the top ones if you&#x27;re brushing your teeth at the right angle as a dentist would instruct.  Save a few bucks and buy the originals.</li>
            <li> The three brush heads arrived on time and works in my electric toothbrush.  I do not have any more to say on this review.</li>
            <li> I feel like ive gone to the dentist everytime I brush. I get this sensation in my mouth that makes me feel like chuck norris in his prime.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service.</li>
            <li> Brush heads do a good job cleaning teeth and messaging gums. Replacement heads for the electric toothbrushes are a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> These were purchased as an adjunct to a new Oral-B 4000.  They work quite well for an occasional use; however, both of the family members using the Oral-B prefer the Floss Action Heads.  These all work great with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These heads fit my Oral B Pro toothbrush and last as long as any of the other replacement heads I&#x27;ve bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good replacement heads and are cheaper on Amazon than in Rite-Aid.</li>
            <li> Good brush head. Not sure the small yellow whitening cup actually works, but the brush head dird make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I bought el cheapo replacements earlier. Both my wife and I hated them -- poor quality. The new Oral-B Pro are perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used other Oral-B heads for my toothbrush and love the one with the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; thing in the middle. I think it does a better job of cleaning off stains.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet (still using the original Oral-B brush head), but my hubby is and he likes it a lot. Great quality and it&#x27;s a good value.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing results, my husband has used whiteners and toothpastes and its always spotty hes been using this for 2 weeks with baking soda and peroxide and omg the most amazing results!</li>
            <li> like it better than other brushes. the little cup in the middle is nice.</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their other brushes.  I find that this one does a better job than the others.  The floss bush they have was too good...the dentist said it was too aggressive for me.  So I&#x27;ve gone back to the Prowhite and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Terrific toothbrush heads for my electric Oral-B. This is a hard-to-find product style that I am able to acquire on Amazon only. Not only am I able to get the product, but it is less expensive than the comparable one found at retailers.</li>
            <li> The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date. The packaging was good, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> ...the other brush heads I have used for my Oral-B toothbrush. But hey, it works and my teeth are clean so that&#x27;s the point, right?</li>
            <li> As they are identical to the heads they are replacing, that is what I would want in a replacement brush head. Not much more to say on that. I guess they could have given a few extra color rings for the bases, in case you had more people using the toothbrush?</li>
            <li> I was formerly using the head that looks more rectangular/normal toothbrush(called the deep sweep), and switched to this one about 4 weeks ago.  The first few days my gums were a little sore, but now they&#x27;ve gotten used to it and there is no soreness just a very shiny clean.  I still floss the same as before though, since the bristles don&#x27;t really reach that far between my teeth.  I like the polishing feature but don&#x27;t think it really makes that huge of a difference compared to the head I was using before... I also worry it is not getting in the crevices of the biting surfaces of my molars (the occlusal side),  I have the Oral-B Deep Sweep 5000 Electric Toothbrush and I brush for 2 minutes in the morning and 3 minutes before bed btw.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that my teeth are any whiter than when using a regular brush head.</li>
            <li> Until I had this tooth brush and heads I did not know how bad I was brushing my teeth. It does the job better than any other product in the market. Although, I will still recommend to floss.</li>
            <li> Genuine Stuff.  Fits perfectly.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I know they have a generic brush, but, I like the original product with the floss type bristles.  A lot better than the standard brush.</li>
            <li> So far great toothbrushes. They seem to clean my teeth very well and I would recommend these brushes to anyone who has an Oral B brand toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I always love these heads. They fit perfectly and are much cheaper than purchasing in the store.  They arrive quickly, also.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I would buy them again and recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this about 100 years ago. Better than expected or imagined.  Wll worth the expense......Get it now ans save money at the Dentist office</li>
            <li> These refills are gret.  I&#x27;ve used the Oral B toothbruh for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Again, wasting my time by making me add more words.</li>
            <li> It cleans effectively and lasts a long time. To take care of your own teeth the right way, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I am using this brush type from last 6 months, I am very satisfied. It can fit my Oral B pro 1000 series brush with no problems.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfreind so that he would not go out and use chimicals to whiten his teeth. these polishers really do work but it takes alot of time. if you have the patients, then i reccomend these. good!</li>
            <li> BEFORE MY PURCHASE I DID ALL THE RESEARCH COMPARING THE TWO DIFFERENT ELECTRIC BRUSHES. BASED ON ALL THE TOHER REIEWS I SELECTED ORAL B. SINCE THIS IS MY 1ST ELECTRIC TOOTH BUSH I DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY COMPARABLES, BUT THE ORAL B SEEMS TO REALLY DO THE TRICK. MY TEETH FEEL CLEAN AND I DON&#x27;T SCRUB WITH THE ORAL B BECAUSE IT HAS A FEATURE TO ALERT YOU IF YOU DO. THAT ALONE IS GREAT FOR ME, MY HYGIENIST WILL LOVE ME AT MY NEXT CLEANING. TO MAKE THINGS EVEN BETTER ORAL B HAD A REBATE FOR $15.00 OFF, WHICH REALLY SWEETENED THE POT.</li>
            <li> good price with nice quality, worth it!&lt;br /&gt;will order it agian in next deal, recommended and keep in my wish list!</li>
            <li> Great to have as it comes in 3 and they work just fabulous with the Precision 5000 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my Oral B Pro which I used for almost ten years.  The new brush works well, but I doubt very much that it will last for another ten years; it feels somewhat flimsey.  Only time will tell, but in the meantime I am enjoying the features of the new unit.</li>
            <li> It cleans the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the original Oral-B brush heads. They were a great fit and were exactly what I wanted. My teeth now look whiter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric toothbrush uses new brushes very infrequently, but there does come a time when you need to replace the head. These are easy to insert and you should keep a pack around just to have new brushes available when you need them.</li>
            <li> Good product to remove plaque on teeth.  I tried this brush head and it removed a piece of plaque on a back tooth that was bothering me for a long time.  My teeth feel nice and clean after using this brush head.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome - best I have ever had!  I like the floss action brush the best.  Feels like I just walked out of the dentist office after having my teeth professionally cleaning.</li>
            <li> You can not use this item with the pacemaker restrictions and to learn the restrictions you must open the box to read the instruction which then will not allow you return it since the box has been opened.</li>
            <li> These are the best heads for polishing. They are most like what the dental hygienists use after they clean your teeth. I find these relatively hard to find in the stores and drugstores. But, as we all have come to know...if you can&#x27;t find something in the stores, check on Amazon...they nearly always have it.</li>
            <li> Only brush head I buy for my Oral-B brush. I think I see whiter teeth too. It is a must have.</li>
            <li> Oral B has apparently been busy coming out with this new product. The brush head is not what I was used to -- small, circular, like a dentist&#x27;s brush. But this new oval shape really helps me get into the small places in my mouth, AND it holds enough toothpaste to do my whole mouth, which was tricky with the former round brush. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> finally used up the other 3 heads that I bought and have started using these. the first one is working just fine.</li>
            <li> This item did and excellent job of removing coffee stains, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth feel wonderful afterword.  The timer with the smiling face helps.</li>
            <li> removes the plaque very well goes really between teeth.I have been using this head for quite a while now and it does the job efficiently</li>
            <li> This is my best buy this year.  I have used other brushes by oral-b and this is one out performing others.  I plan on letting you know more after my dentist visit.</li>
            <li> good product and fast service.</li>
            <li> Great deal that you can&#x27;t get in the stores. I love the feeling of clean teeth, and you will too if you get these brushes. You will want to smile big for the camera and show off your pearly whites. Go Oral-B. Saving rotten breath since the beginning of toothbrush time.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Teeth have a really polished feel after use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand that everything has to be idiot proof these days! VERY ANNOYING light to tell me I&#x27;m brushing too hard! Really? I had to &amp;#34;mcguiver&amp;#34; it up to cover it and looks horrible..too bad for a brand new purchase but I sure don&#x27;t need that VERY bright light in my face first thing in the a.m.!!! Geez..I hate when manufacturers treat buyers like idiots! ! I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a cya practice these days when people sue for everything! Shame!</li>
            <li> Good price, easy delivery.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for Oral B are really good and provide me with the tools to keep my teeth and gums at maximum health.  Just received a good report from my dental hygienist during my scheduled cleaning.  Yeah! I just wish they lasted longer than they do.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B automatic toothbrush heads for many years and have found that you can&#x27;t get away with buying generic or third-party heads (brissles come apart, just doesn&#x27;t last).  These heads are a good investment and you will get several months&#x27; worth for each head, depending on how often you brush.  Overall, I&#x27;ve found it does a good job and am happy with the performance.  Only complaint is that the heads are somewhat expensive, but it is much more preferrable than wasting money on generic heads from China!</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads some months ago. The order was for one three head package every three months. I have been getting them far more frequently. I want this stopped and yet they keep sending them. I got an email telling me they are on the way after having gotten a package just a few weeks ago (around three weeks). I contacted Amazon who told me that the order wasn&#x27;t even on record with them. Whoever the seller is I am stopped these charges to our card and there will be charges made if you continue to abuse the use of said card.</li>
            <li> I get these on subscribe and save so I never run out and I replace them when I should. It is very handy and I love my Oral B tooth brush and these refills.</li>
            <li> We have used these before andhave been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;ve</li>
            <li> Have not used them yet but they appear to be good replacement heads when the current one wears out..</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see if I like them better over the life of the brushes. They may last longer than the regular brushes. We shall see.</li>
            <li> A necessity with the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep brush. They interchange styles for the brush you want.  Very good cleaning tool.</li>
            <li> Average quality, not confident this brush is doing a great job on my teeth.  Next time I will try the larger replacement brush shaped like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> very easy to use much cheaper to buy a 3 pack than a single one love oral b products last longer than other elec toothbrushes had the toothbrush for almost 2 years</li>
            <li> I have a Braun 3D and needed new heads for it. I tried this product because of the center which is supposed to work like the tools the dentist uses to clean my teeth. I don&#x27;t know if it truly works as well, but my teeth feel great after every brush, even my gums feel refreshed. I will defiantly be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I have had an oral b toothbrush for many years.  My dentist is so happy.  I bought these heads for the first time and I love them.  My mouth feels like I had a professional teeth cleaning.  Love that Oral B!</li>
            <li> I find this product to work very well and lasts longer than other types of heads.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if they were less expensive but the price I paid was about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Ordered from Amazon because it was much cheaper than Wal Mart. These brush heads work very well. Much better than the ones I&#x27;d been buying. Teeth got whiter and felt much cleaner after just one use with these heads. Will be ordering them from now on.</li>
            <li> great product, easy transaction, would shop this seller again.  these toothbrush heads are the best.  make the teeth feel very clean.  it&#x27;s impossible to go back to a regular toothbrush now but i&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> This replacment brush by Oral-B fits most Oral-B toothbrushes, works very well and is better with than the standard brush.</li>
            <li> It was a great replacement for my old brush head, and I would say great value for your buck. Stop reading this review and buy it now...</li>
            <li> Happy Camper says this is just the best way to brush teeth - period. Follow the instructions and your teeth will feel just like the best cleaning you get at the dentist. I am 62 and just started using Oral-b 5000 and I really like it. Should have started using this 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> Onlly wanted authenic replacement heads for my oral B.  Much less costly than buying them in most stores. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I really do not understand why oral-b dont just replace the brushes on the head. It will be so much cheaper because the plastic head itself doesn&#x27;t not get damage, and they can last a long time.</li>
            <li> Comes with lil colored markers so you can share the brush and just remove the head with your own! Good buy</li>
            <li> What can you say about a toothbrush? They fit just fine. They work just fine. The price is acceptable. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I started using the Oral B Pro electric toothbrush a couple of months ago and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth have become just using the regular brush that comes with the unit.  The whitening brushes kick this up another notch, I alternate them with the regular brush.  The whitening is a natural look, vs the bright spotlight white one sees in teeth that are bleached.  At age 57, I much prefer the natural look as it is believable; the bleached look is so obviously fake that I can only feel sorry for those that do this to their teeth.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral-B Triumph brush that I&#x27;ve had a couple of years.  When I first purchased it, it came with 1 of the floss-action heads and 1 of the pro white heads.  They both serve a good purpose and I like switching between them (usually floss action in the morning and then pro white at night when I do regular flossing).  At the time I bought my toothbrush, these heads were available at any major store like Meijer or Wal-Mart.  In the past few years, they&#x27;ve been elusive.  I thought they were completely discontinued and I regularly clean/disinfect my old head because I didn&#x27;t want to give it up.  Luckily, Amazon to the rescue, they&#x27;re here!  I bought these and am thrilled that I can finally throw the old one away.  While, I wouldn&#x27;t use these for every brushing, like I said, the 1x per day routine is perfect.  They leave my mouth feeling like the polishing you get at the dentist (I recommend a good gritty toothpaste that has baking soda in it for those results).  You don&#x27;t want to use too harsh of pressure, just let the rubber yellow part and motion/weight of the brush do the work for you.  If you&#x27;re prone to weak enamel (I am not), it may not be the best brush for you, but if you have normal enamel/healthy teeth, these are fantastic!  For me, they are a necessity for my daily routine and I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush/head that I&#x27;d say I \\&quot;loved\\&quot; as it is more just a daily routine kind of thing we all do, but I literally love these brush heads.  I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon had them for purchase.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this when I realized I it was cheaper here than at a store, which is why I hadn&#x27;t replaced my TB head in over a year.  Good value for a good and needed product.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described and I enjoy how it feels on my teeth and does a great job cleaning them!</li>
            <li> These are like the polishing tool the dentist uses.  They make you feel like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist every time you use them.  I use them with a whitening toothpaste and no longer have any coffee or tea stains.</li>
            <li> These are a great value for replacement heads.  I have tried the generic heads and they are not nearly as good as these.  I am always looking for a bargain, but not if I have to sacrifice quality.</li>
            <li> When I compared this item&#x27;s price to the CVS one the price was almost 40% less. The brush was the same and there is no tax. Besides you don&#x27;t have to go to those stores they treat you like a beggar.</li>
            <li> Definitely feel like they clean my mouth very well, I like the addition of the yellow plastic whitening head on the brush. Feels like a dentist&#x27;s cleaning tool.</li>
            <li> Working very nicely.I still have one new unused one left.  They definitely manage to polish a shine into your smile.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Oral-B electric toothbrush for about 5 years, and was unable to order replacement brush heads from the Oral-B website.  The package of three brush heads from Amazon which identified the correct heads I needed, was very helpful.</li>
            <li> Gotta have them....they work just like the dentist&#x27;s brush when cleaning teeth.  sturdy and strong  Get extra when you order you toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush, and the prowhite I ordered by mistake, but glad I did.  It brightens and polishes your teeth pearly white!! It make them feel so smooth and clean!!</li>
            <li> Oral B toothbrushes provide a vey effective way to clean your teeth between dental check ups that reduces the amount of plaque build up that I used to experience and the effort it took the hygienist to remove it. This replacement head has contributed to the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This is awsome. Been using this 2 weeks andmy teeth are so clean and whiter. reccomend to anyone. Great gift idea too</li>
            <li> These brushes do a good job of keeping my teeth white, and they make my teeth feel smooth - like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three models of brush heads for my Floss Action 5000. (sensitive, prowhite, floss action) And i like this ones much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be sure that you bought good toothpaste for whiten. It&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li> Great, use it for many years</li>
            <li> I was given a set of these when I got my braces taken off and WOW. Shocked by how white they made my teeth! It&#x27;s not over night for sure, but when you can avoid harmful chemicals, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Came in the same package as my new Oral B electric toothbrush.  The fine print in the Oral B package insert says DON&#x27;T buy generics, but of course they say that because they will lose money if you do.  These brushes have plastic cups in them to help polish your teeth with whitening toothpaste.  NOT for use by kids with braces.  Great product; I saw results from coffee stains on the very first use!  (with a leading brand whitening toothpaste).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these at local stores anymore. Just as well, since this is a better price than the stores used to offer. My teeth are just plain cleaner and whiter with this brush head. Must be the rubber thingy in the middle.</li>
            <li> I need to replace brush heads more often than I do and having 3 on hands makes me more likely to do it. Good electric toothbrush but I had to get used to the larger and rounder brush heads. I had used SonicCare before and had problems with the brushes breaking. So far so good with Braun.</li>
            <li> These heads usually last a good while. I had some last a year. Other times they wear out after only a couple of months. Beware of counterfeit products. Buy directly from Amazon for genuine product. The knock off parts fail after a few days or weeks. They seem to be Oral-B rejects.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat your price.  Delivery pretty fast.  I will be ordering soon.  Always want the best price so I will be shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend</li>
            <li> Bought these as extras for my Oral-B tooth brush.  They clean extremely well and of course fit the device perfectly.  Buying a 3-pack saves you money.</li>
            <li> Received item in timely manner, and has proformed as advertised without any problems... The wife has used this brush before and she was Happy with it and it&#x27;s preforrmance..She has a small mouth, and this brush head  gets her back teeth without discomfort....</li>
            <li> This gets a check mark  and a smile  helps polish  and whiten teeth with  everyday use luv it.</li>
            <li> Good product but I find that I need to replace the head every month whereas the recommended period (from the Manufacturer) is every 3 months</li>
            <li> I really like this product does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li> Everything you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> These fit and clean teeth excellent . It keeps plaque down.</li>
            <li> as good as advertised...</li>
            <li> If you want teeth the look polished, then this is the producr for you.  I&#x27;ve used it for the past few years and I cannot be more pleased at the way my teet look.  I get complements all the time about how great my teeth look!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush for about six years now, and have used several different toothbrush heads with it. However, this Prowhite brush head is my least favorite.  I found that the hard plastic cup in the center was hard on my gums.  Maybe it was just me, but we didn&#x27;t get along and I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush works great with the Oral-B Professional system. I switch back and forth from the floss head. I can tell a difference in my teeth since using the system/brush heads..</li>
            <li> love how it cleans my teeth. also the way my teeth are whiter since I have started using this brush.</li>
            <li> oem parts i cant believe you need so many words before you can submit review.i have this thing 2 years now</li>
            <li> This is a remarkably good head for getting your teeth really clean. It has a central rubber insert that seems to scrub the teeth clean. I found it a little disturbing at first because it seems to judder against the teeth, but it gets them sparkly clean (whiter? maybe, probably not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my second refill and would not go back to conventional heads now so I suppose that is an affirmation of their quality, I would say that the expense for real heads is definitely worth it compared to the budget store replacements both in terms or durability and quality.</li>
            <li> Best and only replacement brush I use, the rubber center actually polishes off any coffee staining  etc , my dentist who recommended them actually was surprised at how well they actually worked</li>
            <li> When using the Oral B electric toothbrush I recommend that one has on hand, the replacement brushes.  That keeps the brushes clean and usable.</li>
            <li> For me,this particular brush is much too hard on the gums. I highly recommend Oral B&#x27;s softer version... I give that one 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oral-b for over a year now and I just love it and buying the replacement heads is just as easy as brushing your teeth. The package arrived really quick and it was in the original package, thanks for the speedy del.</li>
            <li> less cavities since my daughter started using this, cheaper on the wallet</li>
            <li> Pharmacies have started locking up all these type of brushing devices or I can&#x60;t seem to remove them from the rack they have constructed with any degree of ease! I saw them on Amazon when I purchased a gift and decided the price was better. Also, I didn&#x60;t have to deal with solving the puzzle of trying to purchase them from my local pharmacy!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had recently purchased an electric brush and like to keep my teeth as white as possible. The head does a good job at cleaning your teeth, but I haven&#x27;t really seen my teeth get any whiter over time. I&#x27;m not sure what this head has compared to other heads that is supposed to enhance the whitening.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Second time to order and will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B brushes for years, but this was the first time for this version (with the little &amp;#34;polishing cup&amp;#34; in the center).  At first I was a little skeptical, but as time went on, I realized this brush was doing a superior job and leaving my teeth and gums in superb condition.  After utilizing this product for about four months, I went off to my dentist for the usual semi-annual routine.  His hygienist remarked at how good my teeth and gums looked this time around.  (Life is good!).  Buy &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> The concern was if this brush fit my toothbrush.  It does and works well.  My wife loves it.  Does a great job of cleaning her teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Much.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look good!  Recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Pro Electric Toothbrush.  It&#x27;s very powerful and I&#x27;ll be anxious to see what my dentist says at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> They brush.  They wear out.  They get replaced.  Over and over for many years.</li>
            <li> Its very nice replacement brush for 15 bucks</li>
            <li> Works as expected. No problems.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they might not fit BUT they did fit1 I got a great deal and they work great! The descr I read first helped me make the decision on which one to buy.</li>
            <li> These really work. I&#x27;ve been using the regular toothbrush heads for years but decided to give these a try. My teeth feel so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush replacement.  It cleans better than the other ones. I have crooked teeth on the bottom and this is the only one that gets those teeth clean with regular brushing. I need to spend extra time with those teeth with any other brush.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They are too expensive especially since it needs replacing every three months. I save a small amount by signing up for automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> Just like original that came with my Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Love these! Using them make my teeth feel like I just left the dentist smooth and very clean!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are far superior to the standard bristle head you can purchase for your Oral-B electric toothbrushes, and are better than the combination brushing and spinning heads as well.  The rubber cup in the center provides an out of the dentist office clean feeling.  The heads can feel much more firm than other heads without the cup but I prefer that.</li>
            <li> Does a great job polishing teath, gives you a dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement heads for my current Oral-B, so these were just what I needed. I really love the way this head helps me to achieve a higher level of dental cleaning and care!  I made sure I had enough!!!</li>
            <li> These tips are great and really give you a clean feeling, but the rotating head can hit your teeth if you&#x27;re not careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great clean feeling after brushing&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts at least 4-6 months (if you want to keep it that long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The rotating brush head is larger than the stock brush and oval shaped.  Will literally hammer your teeth if you don&#x27;t open WIDE when inserting and removing the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I like these polisher tips.  However, for someone with a smaller mouth, they could be too big to use.  Still, recommended!</li>
            <li> Left my teeth extra smooth!</li>
            <li> The heads fit the Oral b sonic perfectly. Very hard to find replacement heads for this unit since its been around for a while</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B brush a lot, I ordered these and I really don&#x27;t like the rubber piece in the middle. Waiting for the professional brush, which has all the bristles in the middle as well.</li>
            <li> I will freely admit, they do a good job of shining up the front your teeth, but a horrible job of actually getting where they need to for actual cleaning.  These do a horrid job of getting in between the teeth, save yourself the trouble and buy the basic precision clean and skip out on these heads, makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the replacement heads yet, but they&#x27;re easy to install and store nicely in the toothbrush holder/charger.</li>
            <li> Combined with Crest White toothpaste, and whitening mouth wash, these heads really accelerate the process!  I am on my second purchase now, and will probably keep up with them.</li>
            <li> Buying them on Amazon saves you about $10 vs. buying them in a retail store. Great thing about the whitening head is that it really does seem to keep your teeth a little shinier! On top of that, it is a little bit bigger than the stock brush head, which I personally like.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker, and my teeth get stained with brown coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this brush and some Baking Soda weekly the stains are kept in check.</li>
            <li> I am meticulous about changing the toothbrush head every 3 months.  This can get expensive, but paying for dental work is even more expensive.  I have tried the generic brands of toothbrush heads, but they don&#x27;t last nearly as long.  They seem to wear down after only a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m sticking to the name brand because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you use a whitening toothpaste and brush your teeth on a regular basis (at least two times a day), these brush heads will do its work of whitening and polishing your teeth. However, there will be no results if you don&#x27;t keep a good oral higiene.</li>
            <li> I own a Oral-B Pro 5000 Smart Series (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O8ODHOA?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00)&lt;br /&gt;and these replacement heads do not fit.</li>
            <li> I really like this brushing system and I have several of the different syle brush heads.  They work well and this one does do some polishing and I alternate it with the regular brush.</li>
            <li> I very much like the heads, as they leave my teeth with a dentist clean feeling after using them. I use them in tandem with flosser heads which works really well. I bought several packs, as they are really hard to find. So far have only found them on amazon. I recommend them if you have trouble with plaque build up like I do.</li>
            <li> I order 2 sets, got 2 sets. We use this for remove coffee stain, it work very good so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for years. Love it. Initally and investment, but this is a good deal for 3 replacement heads. And thats all you need to purchase after. You replace them every 90 days. So nine months worth isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Love these! Have been using them for years.  Provides a clean and fresh mouth when used 2 X per day.  Retards plaque growth and teeth feel cleaner longer between dental visits.</li>
            <li> looks good and works good.</li>
            <li> I love the way these brushes polish &amp; whiten my teeth, just like the dentist. I&#x27;m unable to find them elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these Oral-B Brushes for years. When I tried one of these brush heads, I could feel a cleaner set of teeth. I want buy the other ones any more.  SW</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Braun oral B professional tooth brush and it does exactly what is described. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> A BETTER RATING, ORDERED TWO OF THE SAME THING, GOT TWO SIFFERENT BRUSHES, WHERE I LIVE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE TO RETURN AMAZONS MISTAKES, AND THEY MAKE QUITE A VIT LATELY</li>
            <li> These fit great, were easy to get on and off, and lasted a reasonable amount of time. The price was better than in store also.</li>
            <li> What can I say other than the replacements are exactly the same as the original brush head that I just bought.</li>
            <li> cleans like the dentist visit</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this style toothbrush since it&#x27;s recommendation by our dentist. Wouldn&#x27;t use any other. Head fits snugly on the brush handle and cleans teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li> I tried some &amp;#34;compatible ones&amp;#34;, but they are inferior. I don&#x27;t like spending this much but I want my toothbrush to work the best it can.</li>
            <li> These last between 2 and 3 months for me (not sure if that is good or bad), but I love the Oral B electric toothbrush, it actually does help me keep my teeth sparkly white. I see the benefits when I travel and only use a standard toothbrush and my teeth do not look as good, I should travel with the electric brush, it is that good!</li>
            <li> Works well &amp; leaves my mouth feeling cleaner. Since I have a tendency to brush too hard, the fact that the Oral-B warns me when I&#x27;m doing that is good for me.</li>
            <li> I only need to go through one of these every six months and the thing holds strong and lets you know when you need a new brush through the lightening of the blue on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The circular pattern also makes it easier to get below the gums.  YES!</li>
            <li> I n the short period that I have had it , it is working fine. I have not had it long enough to really review it.</li>
            <li> Good product. It keeps my teeth clean. However, I have come to prefer the Sonic toothbrushes as they seem to clean my teeth better than the oral-b brush.</li>
            <li> Like the results, just have to not use it that often.. I tend to rotate between this head and the normal bristle head.</li>
            <li> Great product but do not use as your primary head. It polishes nicely but isn&#x27;t the best for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this power brush my teeth are whiter and no tooth problems.  Been using it for some time know. Keep my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Oral B makes a very good product.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results and so is my dentist and his staff</li>
            <li> The price is really good for these brush heads. These are Oral-B made and not seconds. Well worth the coinage.</li>
            <li> I have used about 4 different brush heads for this tooth brush and really like this one.  I don&#x27;t know how much different it feels from the others, but my teeth are definitely a little whiter.</li>
            <li> I use this toothbrush 2x a day and have gotten great results- quick dentist visits. I drink a lot of tea and don&#x27;t get much staining due to good brushing.</li>
