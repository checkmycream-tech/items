            <li>Yes, Dune , I love it, simply love it.</li>
            <li>love to see the return of the lotion and bath products, as well.  </li>
            <li>but I love it</li>

            <li>I just love the fragrance and all the compliments I recive while wearing it.  </li>

            <li>I tried it on, my bf did not like it, he said it was a bit strong.</li>

            <li>Delivery was quick, and I was a gifting hero!</li>
            <li>Quick, Quick, Quick love it!</li>
            <li>The shipping was prompt to recieve this fantastic fragrance which was sealed in a certified box.  </li>
            <li>Wish the lotion was still available.  </li>

            <li>brand new as promised, love it!</li>
            <li>My all time favorite, very fast service from amazon.  </li>
            <li>It was funny that we would both comment on a soap and both really love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty, inviting, and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Maybe not the most original of scents, but certainly an extremely accomplished one, with rich Oriental, and softer powdery, seductive tones.</li>
            <li>It was a great value for such a large bottle!</li>
            <li>(it has become my regular every day &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent) and continue to receive lots of compliments from people asking what I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Glad I found online at a reasonable price; item arrived ontime.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel feminine and sexy and is very distinctive.</li>
            <li>Last year, my husband and I bought a liquid hand soap which which we both really loved the smell of.</li>
            <li>my signature scent, lovely through and through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipped fast and well</li>
            <li>Got it quickly.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this one for the sophisticated ultra feminine woman!</li>
            <li>My Mom has been using this since it was first introduced!</li>
            <li>Lite fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to locate them thus far.</li>
            <li>Something just does not smell right.</li>
            <li>Just what I expected..this is getting hard to find so was happy to find it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this fragrance!</li>
            <li>I have worn Dune for many years and can no longer find it locally.  </li>
            <li>, what are you wearing?&amp;#34;  I am a bit of a perfume maniac, and have tried most well-known perfumes, but always come back to the dependable, versatile DUNE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It never fails to draw compliments.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought that the fragrance of the perfume and bottle design containing it should be personal is why I love this fragrance still have not received it</li>
            <li>Most especially the lotion!  </li>
            <li>Many compliments when I wear it and it lasts a long time without reapplying (which I don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>Dune has been a long time favorite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I use this Dune Spray everyday and have done so for many years, since my first discovery of this fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you have a beautiful scent that will follow you without overwhelming the room or annoying people with allergies.  </li>
            <li>DUNE is an older scent that deserves a new marketing campaign!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Dune is an older Eau De Toilette and kind of hard to find.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume (and mine), and it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and subtle without an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>Very soft scent and compliments all the time.  </li>
            <li>In order for the smell to last long she would have to spray an huge amount of this product onto her body.</li>
            <li>Her favorite and hard to find</li>
            <li>So I think this perfume suits  for mature lady.</li>
            <li>Lately , I  have not been able to find in stores.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large and I just use 2 to 3 sprays a day, so it is lasting much longer than expected.</li>
            <li>A favorite with a family member, DUNE is not easily available locally at the only department store around and there is no selection.  </li>
            <li>My favorite (hard to find)fragrance!</li>
            <li>I had worn Obsession for several years before finding Dune and it is the only scent that I like as much.</li>
            <li>i do always go to amazon first, and i did buy before dune and other perfume&#x27;s too - no problems whatsoever</li>
            <li>The scent is full-bodied, slightly sensual, and smooth.</li>
            <li>The few times I have been lucky enough to find it, it was only the 1&lt;br /&gt;.7 oz.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is highly competitive with other websites like Scentiments or perfumania.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t need much of it, just a little here</li>

            <li> The few times I have been lucky enough to find it, it was only the 1&lt;br /&gt;.7 oz.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is highly competitive with other websites like Scentiments or perfumania.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t need much of it, just a little here</li>
            <li> Another little everlasting classic perfume from Christian Dior.</li>
            <li> Dune, from the House of Christian Dior, is never out-of-fashion, it&#x27;s subtle yet powerful fragrance always garners comments like &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> The Dune that I purchased for wife as a gift does not have a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this fragrance and it is hard to find sometimes.</li>
            <li> but recently i&#x27;ve bought dune &amp; euphoria and these are not real!!</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;s wears this not first time, the other person for whom i bought euphoria, also said that fragrance on the skin is different what she had before  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s price has nearly doubled over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> I used to wear the body lotion that lasted forever, but it&#x27;s not available anymore.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, my wife is totally committed to it.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I have been using for 20 years and it has become increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> The price for Dune is expensive and sometimes hard to find.  </li>
            <li> and extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> My wife has a nose for scents, and this Dune is not like the expensive variety which is offered by your sellers.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve heard about it but wasn&#x27;t believer - looks like from the time amazon use other reseller they sell fake items (1-2 days for process)  shame on you amazon!!!</li>

            <li> Smells wonderful.  Get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I&#x27;ve worn it for years (it has become my regular every day &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent) and continue to receive lots of compliments from people asking what I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so good. It&#x27;s nice and subtle without an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance</li>
            <li> This line has been discontinued to my wife&#x27;s dismay.  So I was delighted to find some &amp;#34;new old stock&amp;#34; still available.</li>
            <li> what can i say...i get loads of compliments on it (from both men and women)...what more could you ask from a fragrance!</li>
            <li> My favorite (hard to find)fragrance! Lite fresh scent. Always compliments, especially from men. Great price too...</li>
            <li> Glad I found online at a reasonable price; item arrived ontime.</li>
            <li> Love Dune.  Good price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume since I was a teenager. It was delivered on time and price was ok. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Dune! I absolutely adore this fragrance! I have been using it since its introduction in 1991 and it continues to be my favorite fragrance. I receive compliments on my smell every time I wear it! It makes me feel feminine and sexy and is very distinctive. I definitely recommend this one for the sophisticated ultra feminine woman!</li>
            <li> Wife likes it.  Wife happy, me happy!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  I get a lot of compliments?</li>
            <li> My Mom has been using this since it was first introduced! I hope they never stop making Dune!</li>
            <li> i do always go to amazon first, and i did buy before dune and other perfume&#x27;s too - no problems whatsoever but recently i&#x27;ve bought dune &amp; euphoria and these are not real!! my mom use this for years so she&#x27;s wears this not first time, the other person for whom i bought euphoria, also said that fragrance on the skin is different what she had before  i&#x27;ve heard about it but wasn&#x27;t believer - looks like from the time amazon use other reseller they sell fake items (1-2 days for process)  shame on you amazon!!!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t find an alternative for this excellent perfume. As time passes by, like the wine, it gets better. After so many years of wearing it, still receive compliment about it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was prompt to recieve this fantastic fragrance which was sealed in a certified box.  It is the real deal for a great price.  Very fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent and you were almost as cheap as Paris but not as fun!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, I wore it some years ago, but had been unable to find it in any store. I would recommend this fragrance to friends and family or any one who complimented me on it.  I am sure they would love it too!</li>
            <li> Another little everlasting classic perfume from Christian Dior. What can i say? Maybe not the most original of scents, but certainly an extremely accomplished one, with rich Oriental, and softer powdery, seductive tones.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I have been using for 20 years and it has become increasingly hard to find. I am so thankful that Amazon.com has EVERYTHING. I had worn Obsession for several years before finding Dune and it is the only scent that I like as much. The product came in excellent condition and was about the same price I had been paying in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Dear Sir or Madam,    Received product and love the fragrance. Will definitely order again.    Thank you,  Coleen H. Thompson</li>
            <li> A favorite with a family member, DUNE is not easily available locally at the only department store around and there is no selection.  Amazon was the place to go.  DUNE is an older scent that deserves a new marketing campaign!</li>
            <li> great love your product</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, so I love it. It made her happy, so I am happy. This is hard to find locally. Glad I can find it online for my wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent exclusively for 20 years. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> quality product, well packaged for shipping! brand new as promised, love it!</li>
            <li> Love is in the air!!!</li>
            <li> I have worn Dune for many years and can no longer find it locally.  I always get compliments when wearing this product.</li>
            <li> I love Dune.  Beautiful scent without being overpowering.  Many compliments when I wear it and it lasts a long time without reapplying (which I don&#x27;t) - one spray a day works for me.  I would highly recommend it.  The price for Dune is expensive and sometimes hard to find.  Amazon&#x27;s price is highly competitive with other websites like Scentiments or perfumania.</li>
            <li> My wife adores this product and the price on Amazon is in the range of department stores. I did hear that one can get it cheaper at places without the box. I wonder if that means it might not be legitimate.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected..this is getting hard to find so was happy to find it. Delivery was quick, and I was a gifting hero!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  I love it!  Got it quickly. It was a great value for such a large bottle!</li>
            <li> Dune, from the House of Christian Dior, is never out-of-fashion, it&#x27;s subtle yet powerful fragrance always garners comments like &amp;#34;I love your perfume, what are you wearing?&amp;#34;  I am a bit of a perfume maniac, and have tried most well-known perfumes, but always come back to the dependable, versatile DUNE.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this fragrance and it is hard to find sometimes. It has been a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite since it came out years ago.</li>
            <li> The Dune that I purchased for wife as a gift does not have a long lasting smell. In order for the smell to last long she would have to spray an huge amount of this product onto her body. In my book.....that leads me to believe that something is fishy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s price has nearly doubled over the past few years.  Sadly, my wife is totally committed to it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;ve worn Dune for 20 yrs and there&#x27;s nothing out there that can beat it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved it, which was good because it was what she asked for.</li>
            <li> My  wife loves this perfume.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I cannot give a review, since it was a gift.My daughter told that she just loved it.</li>
            <li> Dune has been a long time favorite.  Wish the lotion was still available.  I get more compliments on this than anythng else I wear.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I wear. Once you find that one scent that is perfect for you, why bother with anything else!</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my mom&#x27;s friends. They like it and had ordered another one themselves.&lt;br /&gt;It looks good for me though.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite! Made her very happy!</li>
            <li> Quick, Quick, Quick love it!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and perfume well priced.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. The scent is full-bodied, slightly sensual, and smooth. It&#x27;s beautiful. I used it years and years ago in my 20&#x27;s and when I ran out, was living abroad so couldn&#x27;t find it. Last year, my husband and I bought a liquid hand soap which which we both really loved the smell of. It was funny that we would both comment on a soap and both really love it. It reminded me of something, and then I realized it reminded me of the perfume I used to wear. I figured, if my husband loved the smell of that soap, he&#x27;d definitely love the perfume, as would I. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores so found it here on Amazon and was pleased to find I love the smell even more now than I did then. The bottle is large and I just use 2 to 3 sprays a day, so it is lasting much longer than expected. I definitely plan to buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have used Dune for the last 25 years and still love it!!!  Its the only fragrance I use anymore.</li>
            <li> Dune is an older Eau De Toilette and kind of hard to find. The few times I have been lucky enough to find it, it was only the 1&lt;br /&gt;.7 oz. and extremely expensive. Loved that I received it so quickly but not too happy with UPS for leaving by the road.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume a lot. It lifts up my spirits every time I wear it. And I don&#x27;t need much of it, just a little here and there is enough</li>
            <li> Gift for my Mom and she Loved It</li>
            <li> Yes, Dune , I love it, simply love it.</li>
            <li> arrived as promised will use again</li>
            <li> Received as described in good condition</li>
            <li> My all time favorite, very fast service from amazon.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I use this Dune Spray everyday and have done so for many years, since my first discovery of this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It never fails to draw compliments.  I hope it is never taken from the Dior roster.  I would be lost without it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see the return of the lotion and bath products, as well.  Have not been able to locate them thus far.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume (and mine), and it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find.  I hope they continue to produce it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that the fragrance of the perfume and bottle design containing it should be personal is why I love this fragrance still have not received it but I love it</li>
            <li> my signature scent, lovely through and through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipped fast and well</li>
            <li> Excellent. Ítem solicitado según lo descrito. Muy rápido todo, excelente servicio y atención. Muchas gracias a todos mil felicitaciones. Agradecido</li>
            <li> Her favorite and hard to find</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s favorite perfume, I bought it for her. I tried it on, my bf did not like it, he said it was a bit strong. I personal use Kenzo perfume. So I think this perfume suits  for mature lady.</li>
            <li> I just love the fragrance and all the compliments I recive while wearing it.  It&#x27;s a must wear accessory every time I go out.  I always buy two bottles at a time so I will never run out.  I would recomend it to every women.</li>
            <li> My wife has a nose for scents, and this Dune is not like the expensive variety which is offered by your sellers.  Something just does not smell right.</li>
            <li> Not quite the scent I remember and loved.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years. Lately , I  have not been able to find in stores. So Happy I found on Amazon. The smell is pretty, inviting, and enjoyable. Whenever I wear this perfume I  get complimented always as to how good I smell.  This is the only perfume that does not give me headaches. It&#x27;s wonderful. You will smell delicious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Dune for about 15 years.  One spray and you have a beautiful scent that will follow you without overwhelming the room or annoying people with allergies.  It is a very sensuous perfume that will make your partner want to cuddle just because you smell so nice.  Beautiful bottle worthy of displaying.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite scent.  I would buy buckets of it if i could only find it.  Most especially the lotion!  Where can i buy the lotion? ?????</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful service from &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Kuchera</li>
            <li> Was able to find the item I wanted and the delivery was right&lt;br /&gt;on time. I was very happy with the service.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for several years and still get compliments on it. I Love It !!</li>
            <li> Very soft scent and compliments all the time.  Men ask what I&#x27;m wearing, so they can buy it for their wives and women always comment what a lovely scent.  I used to wear the body lotion that lasted forever, but it&#x27;s not available anymore.  Amazon is always the best price.</li>
            <li> EStoy muy contenta con el producto, llegó en buenas condiciones y lo recomiendo abiertamente, muchas gracias, lo estoy disfrutando, lo califico como EXCELENTE.</li>
