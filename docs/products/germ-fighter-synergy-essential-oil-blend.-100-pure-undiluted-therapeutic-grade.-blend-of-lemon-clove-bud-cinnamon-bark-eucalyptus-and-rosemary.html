            <li>and I am so glad to have discovered this company since it was recommended by a wonderful FB feed that I follow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because I already know that Plant Therapy makes the best and much more affordable oils on the market.  </li>
            <li>This is a potent, aromatic blend of oils that has a wonderful scent and</li>
            <li>I successfully got rid of two skin tags.  </li>
            <li>if you cannot make your own mix, this is for you!</li>
            <li>Who knows if it works for sure, but the scent is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>It works just as good as thieves and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>Our family swears by Germ Fighter and we love the results we see by diffusing it or blending it with a carrier oil to create homemade remedies for when any of us aren&#x27;t feeling the best.</li>
            <li>The Germ Fighter (Thieves Oil Blend) smells wonderful and has many health benefits.</li>
            <li>but it sure smells wonderful</li>
            <li>Just one or two drops in my diffuser pad works for most of the day, great quality oil!</li>
            <li>I LOVED THE SCENT, VERY WARM AND WELCOMING.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>This does not quite smell like Thieves blend, but it is still a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>With that said, I did find this oil to have a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li>It is pleasant smelling and works well.</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance that just feels like it’s doing something good for me.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one, it&#x27;s the perfect fall scent which makes it&#x27;s germ fighting ability even better!</li>
            <li>The scent is warm, refreshing, and perfect for winter.</li>
            <li>Smells good but haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li>Since I have never tried any oils before, I have nothing to compare this too, but it smells good and seems to help with my stuffy nose when its being used in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>and really a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Good buy.  </li>
            <li>Not as good at the Thieves I was trying to replace.  </li>
            <li>Always happy with plant therapy, this one is always effective.</li>
            <li>And it smells good too.</li>
            <li>Just wish i knew from someone if these oils i ordered are a good quality oil.  </li>

            <li>Like health in a good bottle...</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s good for vaporizers...</li>
            <li>Just as good as any Thieves Oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a carrier oil and put it on, it smells really good too.</li>
            <li>Loved talking to the company rep.</li>
            <li>This product appears to be every bit as good as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; at a fraction of the cost.  </li>

            <li>It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>and it worked amazingly</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, almost like gingerbread cookies.</li>
            <li>However, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This blend smells amazing, and based on my symptoms, it seems to be helping with mold spores / toxins / bacteria /</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>Our house smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and they are all amazing, this one is my go   </li>
            <li>Use it to make my own hand sanitizer without chemicals or alcohol.  </li>
            <li>i liked the oil.</li>
            <li>It is good for many things.</li>
            <li>Just being honest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even made my own using those five ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Kind of Holiday/festive smelling, but I will try it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent and priced very well.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and cleaning alternative.</li>
            <li>Also nice in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>do you have on, it sure smells good.</li>
            <li>I make my own household cleaner with vinegar, orange peels and dish soap.  </li>
            <li>The bottle says it has proven 99% effective in killing airborne bacteria in studies.</li>
            <li>YL mouthwash... make your own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to diffuse to kill germs in the house</li>
            <li>She LOVED it and plans to purchase more.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, and I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Yes it is their own version of thieves oil.  </li>
            <li>Everyone loved the &amp;#34; smell&amp;#34; as they came in and I didn&#x27;t get the cold/ flu that many had this year.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as Thieves, and it stings when applied on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is deodorizing and it may be an effective germicide.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a combination I&#x27;d look for on my own</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t feel this has helped shorten any sicknesses.  </li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I was going to make my own Thieves formula when I came across this bottle</li>
            <li>I use this to make my own foam soap.  </li>
            <li>but it sure does feel good on it and warms the muscles up after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I have used all and find all are effective.</li>
            <li>I have made my own version of Thieves Oil</li>
            <li>I like the scent, warm and cinnamony.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, warding off colds and viruses?........smells nice</li>
            <li>This is a nice oil blend.</li>
            <li>Kind of clove-ish.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be as effective as Four Thieves but cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>It was nice to not have to take any medicine to mitigate our cold/flu symptoms.</li>
            <li>I would have liked instructions sent with product.</li>
            <li>use it in my humitifier nice job would recommend it for any oil lover</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a warm oil for skin).</li>
            <li>I tried it out in my diffuser and Germ fighter has a Christmas-spice kind of scent.</li>
            <li>I mix it with distilled water for mopping and again it makes the house smell nice.</li>
            <li>I think it has more cinnamon,  but it still good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice, but it doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li>Excellent service and the essential oil is very nice.  </li>
            <li>even when highly diluted retains it wonderful, warm, spicy aroma.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and even my kids like to smell it when I use it to clean around our house or diffuse it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to be able to find a product that works like Thieves, but not the price.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor to it and we enjoy using it as a disinfectant.  </li>
            <li>I put a couple of drops on the top of the furnace filter and the whole house smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Something in this oil is very strong and is an irritant to skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li>Very strong cinnamon smell which kills germs,</li>
            <li>Was also looking for an alternative to soy-thrilled to find healthy products! :)</li>

            <li>Great product worth the money.</li>
            <li>Compared to Thieves Oil by Young Living which is way overpriced this stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>The cinnamon seemed to be the most noticable smell, which was nice.</li>
            <li>I make my own laundry soap because I have so many allergies to products</li>
            <li>So far I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Its safe, non toxic and effective.</li>
            <li>and way more cost effective.</li>
            <li>Would recommend Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s Thieve&#x27;s oil over this oil - it just has a more pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a lot more bottles from Plant Therapy, as I have been happy with their products, and the prices are excellent compared to other providers.  </li>
            <li>The scent is SO strong!</li>
            <li>always great product and fast shipment, very happy, highly recommend seller</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance that is not overpowering even if the effects are powerful.</li>

            <li>A good substitute for the original</li>
            <li>I love very pleasant (strong) smell and HOT sensations on my feet.</li>

            <li>It truly does keep my family healthy.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my deodorant blend and it is more efficient than any store bought deodorant I have found.  </li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>I make up spray bottles with purified water and this oil and spray in bathrooms, surfaces, kitchen - everywhere and love it.</li>
            <li>We are glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful smell and my cut wound finally healed after putting this oil on.</li>
            <li>Yet to try...but love their products.</li>
            <li>Glad to have this one in-case-of flu.</li>

            <li>Love the price and the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a more affordable option to YL Thieves.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly for aromatherapy in a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than any of the theieves</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought about 5 different theives blenda on amazon and this one, in my opinion, smells the best and lasts the longest.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the quality of this oil</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I have more money.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with all of the Plant Therapy oils I have received.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment great product</li>
            <li>I am amazingly healthy for someone in my mid-60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>After 1 day, they were better.  </li>
            <li>I do like its scent better, but the cost has made me search for an alternative.  </li>
            <li>I love my water</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>If you have children, there is a child safe blend by this company called Germ Destroyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you will find many just by using google.</li>
            <li>and I would gargle and drink some more diluted in water.</li>
            <li>and here&#x27;s more words to make up the required number</li>
            <li>and I am in love.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure if in the mouth, eyes, etc.</li>
            <li>I diffuse it in my classroom and the kids love the smell, and I love the germ fighting benefits.  </li>
            <li>but I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>I prefer it to be more of a cinnamon-dominant odor</li>
            <li>I love this version of the &amp;#34;four theives&amp;#34; blend.</li>
            <li>I have since shared it with my friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I love this as an alternative to thieves.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have lost count as to how many times we have ordered it both through Amazon and PlantTherapy.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it, and will be purchasing it going forward instead of</li>
            <li>They supply great quality essential oils and at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>You have to love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>More affordable than YL oils..</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil because my husband has nasal polyps and on many days he can&#x27;t breathe at all through his nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks guys for a great product that&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Ordered 2 more, 1 for when we run out, (which shouldn&#x27;t be for awhile since the bottle has about 900 drops) and one for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the better if it kills bacteria.</li>
            <li>It reads &amp;#34;Now 20% more free&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;1 fl oz.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and after reading reviews by several that have been working with oils for over 20 years, I decided to try it..  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT...and</li>
            <li>I love the blend.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>so I can inhale its lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me that something so powerful and effective can be so pleasingly aromatic.  </li>
            <li>I really love this oil...</li>
            <li>The cinnamon and cloves seem most prominent.</li>
            <li>II need to order more, it will be a staple in my cleaning cabinet</li>
            <li>I love diffusing this oil.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep me healthy</li>
            <li>I use this in our homemade toothpaste and we love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this and diffusing it and am pleased.</li>
            <li>mostly use it as a room spray, mixing about a drop of Germ Fighter with each ounce of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also love the pre-diluted roll-on version of this blend.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I&#x27;m buying more-</li>
            <li>and again as I learn more about this therapy.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>This wonderful blend kill germs and most critical for me MOLD!  </li>
            <li>Is it pregnancy safe?</li>
            <li>This tested better for me than Thieves.</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would have more of a cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>This is better than Thieves, better than On Guard.</li>
            <li>I figure this will be part of our health regimen including exercise, healthy diet, judicious washing of our hands, prayer, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to the very toxic toothpastes we find at the stores.</li>
            <li>I love germ fighter.</li>
            <li>I use it every day for so many things...</li>
            <li>I love plant therapy products.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and have ordered it many times since.</li>
            <li>More than that can cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to anyone with a home diffuser</li>
            <li>I love the price and the scent and the germ fighting properties.</li>
            <li>But it sure worked that way for me.</li>
            <li>I love this oil combo.  </li>
            <li>it makes a room smell lovely.  </li>
            <li>This essential oil blend is wonderful...</li>
            <li>and I love to sprinkle it throughout the house.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Check out plant therapy&#x27;s website for more info.</li>
            <li>I noticed I was able to breathe better.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I diffuse it often but my favorite way to use it is to put two drops in my coffee then add my coconut  creamer.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>But, I asked the Great Physician for healing as well.and we are very thankful.</li>
            <li>I had to order more so</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this and use it for many things like room sprays, mouth rinses, on tooth brush and homemade hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Then she saw that I was feeling much better</li>
            <li>will buy more</li>
            <li>Smells good, price is right, and it works.</li>
            <li>Havent used thieves oil before, just mixed my own, but this makes my house smell good along with knowing its killing germs!</li>
            <li>It tast great and my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>So far, it has a good smell, but we will see once my kids start school if they catch everything that goes around!</li>
            <li>This is pretty good, for the price I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>The particular blend smelled great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is very similar to thieves and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t paid full price for the brand-name variety of this oil, but I&#x27;m loving this blend.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working, and I&#x27;m excited to have a solution that isn&#x27;t a lethal chemical!  </li>
            <li>The label states it&#x27;s 99.9% effective against bacteria, which is a bold statement, but I am a believer.  </li>
            <li>Some people may like it better, since it is not quite as strong a scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, spicy and warm with the main top notes being cloves and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>the cinnamon is strong in this product and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent: I like the scent, it is a strong scent though, but christmasy, which most people like, I can&#x27;t imagine someone finding this scent to be offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells ok, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Excellent blend and just as hoped and better than expected.</li>
            <li>I am thankful that Amazon has this wonderful germ fighting oil available at such a bargain price.  </li>
            <li>This oil is as great as the thieves from a young living, but at a friction of a cost!</li>
            <li>great for a spattering on throw pillows, bottom of sheet, on a piece of paper towel near your computer, etc.!</li>
            <li>Began using this as soon as we received it in our childrens diffuser (along with calm the child which we also love!)</li>
            <li>He rinsed again with warm water and was able to eat right after with no pain.</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to the wonderful world of essential oils and had been looking for a good thieves oil.  </li>
            <li>Easy drug free way to keep family safe and healthy with no side effects.</li>
            <li>Good product make the room fresh and clean</li>
            <li>This is very good essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working great so far.</li>
            <li>Ideally, you should do this several times a day.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it and remember you get 20% more for FREE....</li>
            <li>I really rubbed it in good.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good packaging.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li>4 stars because it isn&#x27;t quite as good as Thieves IMO, but very close.  </li>
            <li>I was very leery of using oils for colds or anything but to make things smell good.  </li>
            <li>Smelled great, diffused nicely and long</li>
            <li>I find this blend has a less overwhelming amount of clove, meaning it&#x27;s just the perfect mix of blends( in my opinion)</li>
            <li>I swear I felt better more quickly than I would have without it.</li>
            <li>I can smell the cinnamon primarily over any other oil, and when you add this to a steamer inhaler to breathe into your lungs, it is the most delicious smelling and &amp;#34;tasting&amp;#34; steam - worked wonders to help break up phlegm in my chest.</li>
            <li>My husband and 9 year old son love it too!!</li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;does the trick&amp;#34; and gets us back to feeling good again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful, but use extreme caution if you use it on children under age 12 as it has eucalyptus which is not recommended unless you dilute with a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li>An excellent value in both quality and cost as compared to other leading brands.</li>
            <li>Super strong!  </li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of Christmastime, which is never a bad thing!</li>
            <li>My house feels clean, and it&#x27;s safe for my kids and pets.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a safe way to clean your home, this is it.</li>
            <li>love the aromatherapy value and its ability to clean the air of bacteria/mold spores.</li>
            <li>I bought the glass roll containers to dilute in a carrier oil and to apply easy.  </li>
            <li>Smells good too, but not as effective for personal use as Thieves.  </li>
            <li>If I use it in my home diffuser it is too strong on the cinnamon</li>
            <li>but some may find it a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>While the smell of this oil is strong, a dab here</li>
            <li>strong, but that is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>However since I&#x27;m still in a strong allergy reaction from another brand oil, I will probably don&#x27;t apply them in any skin touch or massage for now, and just use them in cleaning to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li>WOW this stuff is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to kill bacteria in the air, the laundry, in general home cleaning, etc.  </li>
            <li>Hands Down, best thing out there.</li>
            <li>But for what it is, and the price, it is fine.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and liking it just fine.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine for me.</li>
            <li>I woke up in the morning feeling fine.</li>
            <li>so I started with 1% to see how I handled it, and I stayed at 2% and find this works just fine.</li>
            <li>Works for me just fine.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with the quality of the oil, the larger size, and the amazing price.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quick turn around of this delivery.  </li>
            <li>Even more so gargling with this added to saltwater showed my sore throat to quickly fade.</li>
            <li>Our absolute FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>Finding a replacement for thieves oil has become a challenge for some reason and finding the right mixture is very important.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it smells nice and was able to temporarily clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the health of my family since using it.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the benefits from it.</li>
            <li>Even the labels on this brand are cheap looking and leave you wondering about the company.</li>
            <li>He slept soundly, and was fever free to go to school.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy diffusing it.</li>
            <li>Winter isn&#x27;t over, but I have been sickness free.</li>
            <li>We made a fabulous smelling hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin -</li>
            <li>Also as I&#x27;ve seen others state, this is light on clove, which I intend to supplement for a stronger scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful blend, and much more affordable than the Young Living essential oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is so much I could say about this Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>While we were watching television, he began to sound increasingly congested.  </li>
            <li>I have used this essential oils for about a year and have noticed great improvement in my respiratory health.  </li>
            <li>You can smell all of the ingredients and it does get warm if you put too much on.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon is so cheap, so abrasive that it burns like fire, I cannot put it on my skin, and any Thieves or Thieves-like blend</li>
            <li>PLANT THERAPY MAKES GREAT ESSENTIAL OILS</li>
            <li>but it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>anytime I wanted a wonderful smell that also killed germs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it on a cotton ball in my car and enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>now skin is smooth and</li>
            <li>This works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Great essential oil for my diffuser.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it overall though.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and killing germs at the same time!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>and now my whole room smells like a spicy kind of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Great quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I think I will enjoy this.</li>
            <li>The smell and the use are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Useful for most everything.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and this version is a much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>She thinks it has healing powers and that&#x27;s good enough for me :-)</li>
            <li>Loved it so far.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff and it really assists in keeping you healthy and well.  </li>
            <li>The oils are great, considering the price, and the germ fighter smells better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Just a good as Thieves by Young Living.</li>
            <li>They have requested more and I have ordered a second bottle since it seems to work and smells good too.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>:) 100% good quality essential oils</li>
            <li>so far so good....</li>
            <li>So far, so good - no colds or flu.</li>
            <li>However,  have grown to have a healthy respect for essential oils and Plant Therapy is as good a product as any I have used.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a cinnamon smell , which I really like (it reminds me of the original flavor of Dentyne Gum-my favorite).</li>
            <li>I have purchased other germ fighter blends that just didn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li>I will still use this blend to clean with and maybe diffuse when someone in the family has an upper respiratory illness, but I loved being able to diffuse Thieves</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a very effective essential oil immunity blend!!</li>
            <li>And it makes your home smell fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li>I would live to be able for teachers to have a discount or be able to receive free trials.</li>
            <li>The first night my daughter slept much more comfortably than she had in days despite being on steroids to keep her breathing easier.</li>
            <li>In the winter I use this product to creat a home made sugar scub with&lt;br /&gt;raw sugar, sweet almond oil, and a few drops of germ fighter for a wonderful scent.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and a family member I gifted a bottle to was also very pleased--she is very knowledgable about essential oils and their myriad applications.</li>
            <li>, I place a couple of droplets of this oil into a burning candle and it is diffused throughout my home for a fresh, clean smell!</li>
            <li>and this is a great option for less $ to keep my daughter and myself healthy..</li>
            <li>Has stopped mouth pain &amp; prevented infection, I use it every night before bed, put some on a q-tip &amp; rub it on my teeth &amp; gums, I&#x27;ve had no infection or pain for mths &amp; finally have dental insurance but will continue to use this, amazing!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with this decision.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>love this oil, and am glad it seems to be performing as well as the &amp;#34;other brand.&amp;#34; Already have ordered and started using 3 more bottles ... different diffusers, as an inhaler, etc.</li>
            <li>Product is awesome, arrived ahead of schedule and is in heavy use in our household!</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know about you, but my kids usually take a day or 2 to recover from a tummy bug, so I was really impressed.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on reviews and was excited at the idea that it might shorten the duration of the colds my family gets.</li>
            <li>While I love supporting &amp;#34;mommy</li>
            <li>This one is significantly lower in price.</li>
            <li>Makes a significant difference in our allergy suffering.</li>
            <li>SO worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I can testify to its germ fighting powers, but it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use the higher priced &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t tell a difference. :)</li>
            <li>So far we have been very healthy this season.</li>
            <li>Are we paying more for higher quality or multilevel marketing?</li>
            <li>Germ Fighter has a pretty strong cinnamon smell, while Immune-Aid is more sweet and mild.</li>
            <li>It smells clean.  </li>
            <li>I love this blend and the price is much better than young livings thieves.</li>
            <li>A week later: Now after using the oil diluted in a bottle as a room spray, and in my vinegar water to clean floors and surfaces, and also diffusing it to add a pleasant scent as well as kill germs...</li>
            <li>I add to the humidifier and so far the family is healthy (in addition to healthy nutrition).</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is rather trivial, I would of liked an eye dropper top, would make life a bit easier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean smell and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li>I mix with vinager to clean.</li>
            <li>Glad to say we stayed healthy through the peak so far.  </li>
            <li>I have also used it to clean with.</li>
            <li>I clean with this oil...</li>
            <li>I will never use anything else to clean my home again.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant; I mixed it with grapeseed oil to rub on my feet.</li>
            <li>I love this product and such a great price for a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a wonderful alternative to other wicked high priced oils available.  </li>
            <li>I originally got this to make hand sanitizer, and absolutely fell in love with this oil.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and has all the ingredients as other that cost much more.</li>
            <li>The quality &amp; price are just right!  </li>
            <li>helps sore throat right away!</li>
            <li>They also have great customer service, I emailed them several times with questions about the use of eo&#x27;s and they were very fast to respond.</li>
            <li>I use this instead of thieves, the quality is the same in my opinion and for this great price I can use it liberally and give it away as gifts as well;)</li>
            <li>We dilute it in sweet almond oil and put it on the bottom of our feet when a bug is going around.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t it Aristotle who said that &amp;#34;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about germ fighter</li>
            <li>the next morning she&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found this company, thanks to a review I read on the web site.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is everything it was purported to be, I just have not decided I really buy into this oil idea.</li>
            <li>This oil was extremely potent and intense.</li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>I felt very relaxed and the scents were lovely.</li>
            <li>Smells better and works very well.</li>
            <li>It smells much better than straight out of the bottle; maybe it took my nose awhile to get use to the scent.  </li>
            <li>We love the scent, it fills the whole house.</li>
            <li>When we start to get a sore throat, we mix a couple drops with some sweet almond oil and massage it on our necks.</li>
            <li>Good size bottle that will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>I view most of this stuff as snake oil anyway but OnGuard really did take that I&#x27;m-getting-sick-tickle-in-the-throat away for 3-4 hours</li>
            <li>, I will definitely update after I&#x27;ve given it some good use over a period of time.</li>
            <li>Fast, free shipping!</li>
            <li>I absolute LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>We put 8-15 drops in a gallon cool mist humidifier and the scent is distributed all day.</li>
            <li>So far this has helped my family from catching any additional flu bugs.</li>
            <li>Having alergy and sensitivty reactions to eviromental substances, this synergy blend has fast become a favorite.</li>
            <li>but after you get used to it, it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really liked this oil, it smells good and has done a great job of keeping me from getting sick.  </li>
            <li>Great price, however, it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as other essential oil brands.</li>
            <li>i add some oil drops (quantity is personal preference) to the water and have a very nice aroma around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. when i first got this blend</li>
            <li>This large bottle, for a great price, will probably last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have been happy with other Plant Therapy products, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying some other oils from plant therapy and like all of them, respir-aid is great, it helped with my cough a lot.</li>
            <li>The oils seem strong enough and pure and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>The house smells clean and fresh and I hope this keeps some of the fall and winter illnesses at bay.</li>
            <li>My favorite affordable version of the famous &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; essential oil.</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as Young Living without the high price tag!  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>and it does help them to get over it so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Received the oil quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am glad I bought it and would buy again if I can find it at a better price.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, it&#x27;s the same as thieves essential oil.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and item was just as described.  </li>
            <li>While this is not an equivalent to thieves, it is an adequate substitute for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Works just as good as Young Living Thieves but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but I needed something comparable to Thieves rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a good sub for Thieves - NOT great but good.  </li>
            <li>excellent price and in using immediately on a facial clogged pore, twice daily, healing resulted within week.</li>
            <li>I previously had a compromised immune system, and GF was very good at nipping bugs in the bud when I first started feeling funky.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and it works as well as high priced brand name oils.</li>
            <li>At the very first sign apply it to the soles of your feet.  </li>
            <li>Helps fight colds and other illnesses naturally, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm and for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Young livings oil has more of a clove scent but this oil so far has been just as effective as thieves brand.</li>
            <li>It is certainly worth trying, and the people at Plant Therapy are quick to reply when contacted.</li>
            <li>We are diffusing it in my house almost daily throughout the winter in hopes of staving off too many illnesses!</li>
            <li>I only have three, but, still, I love it!</li>
            <li>I actually now love it!  </li>
            <li>The smell is so wonderful that my entire family loves this and is willing to use it daily.</li>
            <li>I think Plant Therapy will be a good back up/cost effective option to my Young Living collection which I am very partial to because of their amazing reputation.  </li>
            <li>eg if it touches the outside hand (palm and soles of feet seem ok) and its v strong if ingested - burns the mouth.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived quickly and is much, much, much more affordable than Young Living&#x27;s Thieves blend.</li>
            <li>High quality, lovely spicy smell of cinnamon and cloves, fast and friendly service.</li>
            <li>Company is fantastic, ships fast and protected well.</li>
            <li>This is their version of &amp;#34;thieves oil&amp;#34; which is an amazing essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li>and it still took about 10 minutes for the burning to calm</li>
            <li>It smelled great, and I also put a few drops on our hands at bed time to fight germs while we slept.</li>
            <li>I have also made my own 4 Thieves oil &amp; it is much more expensive to make your own, however, I prefer to use organic oils.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this better than the Young Living Thieves oil.</li>
            <li>Keep my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth have no buildup on them.</li>
            <li>For the price tag totally worth the try.</li>
            <li>Great product and seems to work just as well as Young Living essential oils!</li>
            <li>Many compare this to Thieves by Young Living.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend making your own, as this has a carrier oil and is not &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; essential oils, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and for about 1/10 the cost of making it yourself.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have both taken it in a capsule to fend off oncoming colds with success.  </li>
            <li>They arrive on time, well wrapped and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use to for any sickness yet, but it smells very similar to another popular blend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting most of my oils from Rocky Mountain oils and Young living.</li>
            <li>We have been diffusing the germ fighter  in our house and it doesn&#x27;t only smell good, it really works.  </li>
            <li>I also try to use natural cleaning products in the home most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to be just as potent as Young Living&#x27;s oil,</li>
            <li>I have seen others recommend this oil applied to the lips, but I can not recommend that because the clove and cinnamon bark may irritate as they are powerful</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy all through amazon, some were purchased from the sellers website, so I may not show up as a verified reviewer on some, but I am only reviewing products I own and have tried.kill bacteria and harmful germs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy all through amazon, some were purchased from the sellers website, so I may not show up as a verified reviewer on some, but I am only reviewing products I own and have tried.</li>
            <li>We rarely get colds.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to make my own blend of the same!</li>
            <li>My kids and I had colds recently and really liked using this.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something that worked as good or at least almost as good as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; from Young Living.</li>
            <li>I have been using this (mixed with water :1 drop of oil per oz of water:) as a cleaner for my kitchen and bathroom and not only does it smell good, it kills germs too.</li>
            <li>Smells more spicy than the other brand, which is fine!</li>
            <li>Not as strong and slightly different smell as Thieves but seems to still be pretty potent.</li>
            <li>Its really strong so only used a small amt and it worked great when i had a lung infection!</li>
            <li>Love this product and great service in delivery and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Have reordered this item and several other items.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and extremely reasonably priced especially compared to Young Essential Oil &amp;#34;Thieves.&amp;#34; The fragrance is not quite as strong as Young&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s wonderful all the same and I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>i did not know how much to add to my kettle, my first portion happened to be too much, but i still liked it since it was clearing up my breathing airways very well.</li>
            <li>and it works right away.  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>just the right amount for us.  </li>
            <li>her nose started to breath well right away and the mist calmed her cough.</li>
            <li>right now this is a five star product for two reasons:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very strong to rub under your nose - especially for kids!  </li>
            <li>This is a very strong anti-bacterial plant oil that I also use for sinusitis and overall immune boost from bacterial infections.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my first bottle of Essential Oils from Plant Therapy and I will be ordering more products</li>
            <li>Smells great, not sure about</li>
            <li>The company stands behind their products and wants to make sure your happy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting to learn about essential oils, after I used clove oil with great success for pain after wisdom tooth extraction.</li>
            <li>I use it for everything...a drop on my toothbrush with my regular toothpaste makes my mouth feel fresh for hours, in my car diffuser for a great smelling commute, massage my feet with it and a carrier oil to boost my immune system, and simply just rub it in my skin (again with a carrier oil)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this when it came, that instead of testing it on myself first like would have been the smarter option, I put it straight onto the bottom of my 18 month olds feet.  </li>
            <li>The Young Life oil smells much richer and of greater quality.</li>
            <li>I had been looking into essential oils and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy the multi level marketing brands, I knew there had to be a great quality product without the extra &amp;#34;baggage&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another great essential oil synergy from this company~ one I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>This is about half the cost and is just as good of a product.</li>
            <li>Do not spend the extra money on the Young living brand, this is just as good.</li>
            <li>Putting a few drops in an aromatherapy device leaves the room also pleasantly aromatic.</li>
            <li>My son had a bit of a stuffy nose for a couple of days, but other than that, very healthy.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets with this purchase and most definitely will be returning repeatedly to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li>and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This seems to be very much like Thieves oil blend.</li>
            <li>100% pure is rare and it has the smell</li>
            <li>We make a disinfectant spray for cleaning my house and even keep little ones in the cars to keep the steering wheel and handles cleaner, plus it helps the car to smell good.</li>
            <li>it smells so good in the house when I put it in my little crockpot with water.</li>
            <li>Absolutely good quality, I know nothing about this particular brand, but I use Thieves SO much during flu season, to diffuse, or to make my own cleaning product (small amount of vinegar, add mostly water, and few drops of &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34; depending on how powerful you want.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant aroma and only a few drops needed in my oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I have mixed this blend myself and it is one of my favorite blends, but this companies blend smelled off.</li>
            <li>great--doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like thieves, and isn&#x27;t as concentrated or something</li>
            <li>It smells exactly how you would expect cinnamon, clove, and eucalyptus to smell.</li>
            <li>This one holds a high rating in quality too!!</li>
            <li>I love this essential oil.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The balance of the oils is more than comfortably different, too.</li>
            <li>love this oil, and am glad it seems to be performing as well as the &amp;#34;other brand.&amp;#34; Already have ordered and started using 3 more bottles ... different diffusers, as an inhaler, etc.musty after a few days without the window being opened)!</li>
            <li>Shrinking fast!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an exact duplication of YL&#x27;s proprietary blend, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever ordered and used an oil like this.  </li>
            <li>Germ Fighter is my favorite Plant Therapy essential oil...</li>
            <li>and that really worked!</li>
            <li>Water will just spread the burn around, while the oil-free make-up remover seemed to break up the oil and remove it pretty well.</li>
            <li>Literally had me in tears it was so hot.</li>
            <li>When I determined that this product was very similar, yet much more affordable, I tried it.</li>
            <li>My youngest (13 months) was the first to benefit from this blend-</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what they say it does.</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to my friends and anyone interested in essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I love this essential oil synergy from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I diffuse this and put a couple drops in hot water to breathe in the steam with a towel over my head.</li>
            <li>Have purchased a couple of times and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>first thing I used the oil on was a plantar&#x27;s wart on my daughter&#x27;s foot that freezing wasn&#x27;t working for.</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours it was better and within 48 it was definitely on the way to being cured.</li>
            <li>so I can see how well it really works!</li>
            <li>&#x27;Cause, gosh darnit, I wanted that stinkin&#x27; illness to go away fast!  </li>
            <li>Exactly like the Doterra OnGuard that costs a fortune.</li>
            <li>I use it as a substitute for the higher priced Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in this larger size.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I use thieves oil</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast delivery to!</li>
            <li>We love this essential oil blend.</li>
            <li>Also use this before open houses as people love the smell of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>only way more affordable.</li>
            <li>Used it  and felt  better after one day along with Breathe easier oil  for a recent bout with sinus infection / bronchitis.</li>
            <li>There are many different formulations for this type of blend.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>We first thought she broke it</li>
            <li>I think it really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this also helped me get over the flu last month!</li>
            <li>My all time favorite essential oil!</li>
            <li>I really love this product and will purchase in the future!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love the smell.</li>
            <li>This was my first winter of using the germ fighter oil</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>However, the first time I purchased it, it seemed &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It seemed like she would get better at times in the day, but then it came back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li>I love this essential oil with</li>
            <li>Essential oils have substance, depth and, many have color.</li>
            <li>I might find more use on this product later.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this product for the first time a couple weeks ago and have used it in my humidifyer.  </li>
            <li>Love the larger quantity.</li>
            <li>Love this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the exact measurements.</li>
            <li>I mix the ingredients, try it, and add whatever I think is necessary to taste better.</li>
            <li>Thanks Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and we love it.</li>
            <li>I diffuse this daily and absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different EO oil companies.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to replace the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot</li>
            <li>I first used this product when I received it in a set of oils.  </li>
            <li>The first time my wife came home and smelled the house she told me to never use it again.</li>
            <li>A few drops in a salt &amp; soda mix for brushing teeth does a good job of cleaning and freshening breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(so much that I bought a second one) and has been going strong for almost 2 years now!</li>
            <li>Best use I have found so far is that by putting a few drops in the rarely used guest bathroom toilet it stays fresh even when it goes weeks without flushing.  </li>
            <li>One is to experiment but be careful as it is powerful stuff!!!  </li>
            <li>You will pay double for popular brands, but I have found this to be just as high quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>recommend for anyone interested in natural cleaning products who enjoys this combination of smells, to wear, clean with, or make skin products with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry eyes and get eye infections very easily.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is 100% Pure, Undiluted and Therapeutic Grade essential oil blend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like comparing a tomato and a tomato one taste amazing and the other ehh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this brand many times and I use it religiously for pretty much everything from cleaning my floors to ingesting it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty fair dupe for more expensive oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a few drops in my natural salt deodorant spray with great results.</li>
            <li>I still buy Thieves, but this acts as a good low cost supplement for some of the less important uses of Thieves (cleaning, air freshening, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jaden</li>
            <li>A spray of it on the hands and rubbing them together is a great way to kill germs too, and more convenient and less messy than gel hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>This is the closest thing to the real deal I have found – I love the bigger bottle and lower price!</li>
            <li>I have bought a similar product from my local Health Food Store which I loved.</li>
            <li>I go through so much of it that next time, I&#x27;m ordering the 3-oz. size. :)</li>
            <li>What makes me glad is that the company is responsible enough to send email for purchase feedback, leaving their contacts in case</li>
            <li>I used to buy another, much more expensive oil, but if have found Plant Therapy has just as good of product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li>This is a pretty large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY GOOD OIL BLEND TO HAVE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN SO MANY OF US GET SICK</li>
            <li>First night I put in on my chest, slept better than I have for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the same &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; as more highly priced blends.  </li>
            <li>Good advertisement, but only half the effectiveness of the original 4 Thieves oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar but much sharper - more cinnamon and peppermint, less of the warm clove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got pretty much everyone in my family using it now as well.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and as effective as the 50.00 bottles sold by other retailers.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it helps health wise, but it can&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>And the extra they charge goes towards providing incentives for the people who sell their oils, which is fine, but not something I&#x27;m willing to pay for.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is a particular brand that starts with a Y that has better quality oils.</li>
            <li>It is just as good, if not better, than the more highly priced synergy oils of the same blend.</li>
            <li>I quickly apply the Germ Fighter to their chest or near</li>
            <li>In addition to making hand sanitizer with it I&#x27;ve added it to some homemade salves and  use a few drops to wipe down my countertops and mop my floors and it makes the house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>In the bathroom itself, I&#x27;ve now got some of this oil in a large coffee mug, with water, sitting on one of those &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; hot-plates designed to keep your coffee/tea/cocoa warmed (or to melt candles to avoid adding burned wick to your air)</li>
            <li>It certainly seemed to kill the germs/viruses that were affecting the children here anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like pure cinnamon.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why we got the LARGE bottle.</li>
            <li>The oil is pure and does not gum it up.</li>
            <li>Will certainly continue buying this as my stash runs out.</li>
            <li>Most recently, I bought a new ultrasound diffuser (Signstek, reviewed separately on Amazon) which holds 500 ml of water at a time, to use close to my bed overnight.</li>
            <li>but mainly - USE Germ Fighter!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an oil that had been recommended to me very highly.</li>
            <li>The smell also goes away really fast, which makes me think it&#x27;s not as pure.</li>
            <li>; recently and this knocked it right out, super fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and when I did, it began to heal much faster than it had been.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s have been much healthier</li>
            <li>Received it fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Quality product, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I recommend this oil blend to anyone who wants to prevent the sickies in their house.</li>
            <li>I much prefer it to YL.</li>
            <li>the products arrived in a very timely fashion, and I will order again.</li>
            <li>They are basically are giving you the same amount you pay from YL for 5ml for about $28+ for Free.  </li>
            <li>her recovery has been much faster then myself or the doctors even guessed.</li>
            <li>Although we both caught colds, the duration was much shorter than if we hadn&#x27;t used this oil.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really has reduced the number of viruses we get each year.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much</li>
            <li>I think he really does help with my sinus&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome asset during cold and flu season.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>he was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the price tag on it, I really didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for something that I didn&#x27;t know whether or not it would work for me.</li>
            <li>I really needed something to help ease their coughing at night.</li>
            <li>It is very healing.  </li>
            <li>My whole family is using this throughout the flu season and we&#x27;ve been well.</li>
            <li>I washed his feet really well</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This blend seems to be much heavier on the eucalyptus, and Thieves has a dominant note of cloves.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic essential oil for cleaning or to use when I am not feeling well.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my whole family.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but in a diffuser and cleaning products I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommeded!</li>
            <li>Theives Oil (what this oil really is)</li>
            <li>and I really think it helped to lessen the duration of the virus.</li>
            <li>It is very offensive.</li>
            <li>I really like cinnamon and this one delivers.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than thieves oil.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve got until you have the real thing.</li>
            <li>has a very week immune system.</li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>I find Plant Therapy Germ fighter to be a very satisfactory alternative.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Its very comparable to the MLM brand</li>
            <li>It works very well for a fraction of the price of leading brands.  </li>
            <li>Always fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really taste anything but the cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil to dilute and use on my skin --- even very diluted it burned.  </li>
            <li>Really like this blend.</li>
            <li>Not knowing much about aromatherapy or ratios</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, which is Plant Therapy&#x27;s version of (Four) Thieves.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>-Just be careful not to get on hands or skin, as it is so potent &amp; will burn.</li>
            <li>I diluted it a bit and rubbed it on my swollen lymph nodes when it felt like my whole neck was sore.</li>
            <li>the price is REASONABLE..</li>
            <li>My primary purpose was to buy for sauna times when i am at the gym and such...</li>
            <li>The cinnamon really stands out, but it&#x27;s not at all overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent the money, might as well :-)</li>
            <li>I have COPD and this really opens up my lungs.  </li>
            <li>well after using it for a couple months I can really tell a difference in my allergy and sinus issues.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.  </li>
            <li>add to water in a spray bottle and my whole house smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery service.  </li>
            <li>This has nice fragrance, although it seems to be heavy on the clove side.  </li>
            <li>: Young Living also is more specific about the oils than Plant Therapy because they list the botanical names, while Plant Therapy does not.</li>
            <li>--I have to use a bit more, but it&#x27;s still SO MUCH CHEAPER than young living, which I simply can&#x27;t afford.</li>
            <li>and I actually bought it to help my 6 yr old son more than anything.</li>
            <li>and I actually bought it to help my 6 yr old son more than anything.</li>
            <li>Would not hesitate to purchase other items certainly as well for sure.</li>
            <li>I would say its an amazing doup for much less!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great price, but it&#x27;s not exactly the same as Young Living Oils Thieves mix.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Within minutes, his right nostril was almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li>This oil blend was much thinner than the other product I have used, but for the price, I was satisfied with its effectiveness in the atomizer I use.</li>
            <li>Yet compared side by side with my prior unopened bottle, the two bottles are the exact same size, and my prior bottle is actually filled more than the &amp;#34;20% more&amp;#34; bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was using Thieves oil which I also love, however due to how pricey it is, I had to be frugal with it.</li>
            <li>I have not tried other brands because most are out of my price range.</li>
            <li>I first ordered this in early January 2014 when illness was viral (pun intended!)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it is any better than any other snake oil products.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re just getting into essential oils and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have been nothing but pleased with this oil and intend to purchase again as willas other oils from plant therapy.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to find this product that I have let all my essential oil using friends</li>
            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Apply to skin and many other uses come out of it.  </li>
            <li>She had been on antibiotics for 2 days at the time, but it would have been interesting to see the effects without any other measures.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing right?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, and I have also ordered other oils from Plant Therapy which are also good, especially the \\&quot;Pain Aid\\&quot; which helps muscle pain, and it works well.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to check the water level frequently, until you know how long it takes to</li>
            <li>Just be sure to check the water level frequently, until you know how long it takes to</li>
            <li>I have two large dogs that often smell less than lovely</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil (unless you really don&#x27;t like cinnamon).</li>
            <li>The smell was more intense and I could use less product b/c of this.</li>
            <li>I was going to rate this 3 stars because of the reaction but the bottle came with 6 more ml than I payed for (20% more free it says) which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li>I prefer Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil, but you get a nice big bottle of what Plant Therapy calls &amp;#34;Germ Fighter,&amp;#34; which contains basically the same ingredients of thieves oil.</li>
            <li>These are hot oils and should NEVER be applied directly to any skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure how effective yet</li>
            <li>and if you are sensitive you might not like it at first</li>
            <li>The last one was because every sinus cavity was full of gunk.</li>
            <li>Exactly like Young Living Thieves oil.  </li>
            <li>but they have been short &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li>Really like the taste and scent of this better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I love that I&#x27;m not having to keep putting medicine down their throats!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly used this and the Thieves oil for cleaning, which works fine for that, but I am going to spend the extra money on Young Life for now on.</li>
            <li>The second time I ordered it, it seemed like either it was an older batch or had lost some potency as it didn&#x27;t smell as strong or have the same effect as the first bottle I had.</li>
            <li>Because this is made of pure essential oils, you do need to be careful as it is very strong.</li>
            <li>My research indicated that this particular blend of essential oil has been proven to kill bacteria and mold, whether in the air or on surfaces, and I decided it was worth a try (and much healthier than almost all</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this oil at half the price of Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li>Love this EO Blend - just like Thieves but less $$.</li>
            <li>This one in particular was not a hit with us at all.</li>
            <li>I use this germ fighter oil with the classic ultrasonic aromatherapy diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I could smell some of the main ingredients in this oil blend</li>
            <li>I used this particular one in my humidifier and it helped with congestion.  </li>
            <li>Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them.</li>
            <li>But my main concern is it burns the skin</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my feet with a carrier oil, both day and night.  </li>
            <li>I have tried most other essential oil brands over these last 16 years, and Plant Therapy is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Our grandson had a really high fever over the weekend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you use it on a car diffuser, I highly recommend you start with ONE drop</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a lot to lose or high expectations when I got this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay high prices for this mixture.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this blend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely harsher than young livings thieves, but for the price and my uses which are only external, I feel like it&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
            <li>It is a little over the top on the high notes and the cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>because his skin was &amp;#34;on fire&amp;#34; from the oil :)  I chuckled just a little</li>
            <li>- AND to the upper left in red at a 45 degree slant says: &amp;#34;Now 20% more FREE!&amp;#34; --- Bravo!</li>
            <li>Just because one likes it does not mean you will and so on.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to move it to another room due to the strong smell.  </li>
            <li>The oils hardly have any smell, at first I thought they must have been distilled, and distilled and distilled some more.</li>
            <li>The product is also packaged in a very well designed bottle which seals tightly and will dispense drops easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this for Lyme disease, and it&#x27;s really too early to tell.</li>
            <li>VERY comparable to Young&#x27;s EO ...</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then Young Living.</li>
            <li>Much better than and MUCH MORE than just an acceptable substitute for the expensive Young Living Thieves oil.  </li>
            <li>You can also put a few drops in your favorite cleaner, hand soap, or dish soap.</li>
            <li>Im not sure if it really helps keep you healthy</li>
            <li>just put a few or more drops in spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as awesome as thieves, but it works really well to get over a cold!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this blend which I use in this Flu season as (a) bedroom diffuser, (b) rubbing few drops on my feet, (c) using it under my armpits, (d)</li>
            <li>Has the same ingredients as Thieves Oil, at a much reduced cost, and higher quantity.</li>
            <li>I gave some to a friend, she and her kids love the scent of the carpet freshener (baking soda with a few drops of this oil blended in).  </li>
            <li>Found the aroma to be a bit harsh, but it&#x27;s okay in disinfectant sprays/laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li>The following day I added 2 drops of Ravensara oil to the mix- and wow- complete clearance in the right nostril and 75% in the left (he has a huge polyp</li>
            <li>I do not know if it will prevent the winter germs from making me sick, wash hands, apply my moisture oil and you are doing the best you can.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses it as a roll on diluted when he&#x27;s sick and it works great on him too!</li>
            <li>so well - and her immune system definitely needs help right now</li>
            <li>My friend had a sinus infection and she mixed a couple drops with some coconut oil and applied to her feet and her stuffy head was relieved right away.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil, although I have only used it a couple of times, I have been using a brand that cost 3 times as much, recently had a tickle in my throat, runny nose, cough, so I used my new oil on the soles of my feet after diluting with sweet almond oil to 2%.</li>
            <li>use it in combination with Plant Therapy&#x27;s Immune-Aid too and will soon try out my new diffuser with Germ Fighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am hoping it will help purify the air by using it with my new diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still finding new uses.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>When I diffuse other oils, I usually just smell them in one large room (even peppermint, which is very strong!).</li>
            <li>Mixing a few drops with other natural cleaning substances, lemon juice and water, vinegar and water, baking soda, etc gives them an added uplifting, pleasant and vibrant fragrance and added cleaning ability.</li>
            <li>The clean, subtle smell last many hours.  </li>
            <li>I also like to use a drop on a wet rag to clean counters and tables.  </li>
            <li>I was very optimistic; however for me it accomplished none of the above.</li>
            <li>have been using the other formula, and now this, to help in my master bedroom and bath which recently had a mold problem: when my house was built, someone installed the bath light fixture by screwing one side to the wall THROUGH the PVC line carrying hot water.</li>
            <li>I had mixed opinions when I first got it</li>
            <li>I think their oils are better than any other essential oil around.  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase with Synergy...and my first purchase of their Germ Fighter blend.  </li>
            <li>This  was my first order from Plant Therapy, but it won&#x27;t me my last.  </li>
            <li>Germ Fighter Synergy definitely has become part of my overall healing (one of many parts), and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Now they have a smaller bottle and higher price.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with any essential oils</li>
            <li>We had two bottles different sizes, potency/smell is consistent  </li>
            <li>and this product had identical ingredients, and smelled exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I am an essential oil newbie and this was my first purchase, in addition to a diffuser (Zaq).</li>
            <li>it does smell SLIGHTLY different, but it&#x27;s pretty close.  </li>
            <li>Scent is a little strong, but I just started with EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The blend is quite potent, and the price and quantity make this a bargain compared to Young Living&#x27;s Thieves or other similar makes.</li>
            <li>I made my own in the past and this smells just the same.</li>
            <li>This is just like Theives OIl that Young&#x27;s Living Oils sells only plant therapy is not an MLM and is MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li>I did considerable research when I first got into essential oils, and view Plant Therapy favorably as a result.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for thieves essential oil to make toothpaste, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the higher price that doTerra and Young Living charge.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils and was looking for something reasonably priced and not part of a multi-level marketing company.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely DO NOT recommend this particular item for consumption or topical use with out significant dilution.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reading the reviews, I agree that this is a less expensive and most effective alternative to the thieves oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be okay for other applications as long as you want everything within 50 feet to smell like tart cinnamon.</li>
            <li>100% pure essential oils</li>
            <li>I did muscle testing with it and seems to be a little light on clove, so I just add a drop of clove oil when I mix it with water and drink it.  </li>
            <li>I will save my money and buy the Young Living brand which uses only pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is pure and the same stuff as &amp;#34;Thieves.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more diluted, and the mix is a little different.</li>
            <li>highly recommend dilution starting with a low dilution because of the hot oils in it.</li>
            <li>It will clear your sinuses if you take a sniff.  </li>
            <li>I will put it in my wash water to clean the fridge, stove, countertops,showers to prevent any leftover germs from the previous folks.  </li>
            <li>The oil is clear and not pungent.</li>
            <li>I added some Evian water and a drop of carrier oil to Germ Fighter to make a spray, which I used around the house to clear the air during my husband&#x27;s flu.</li>
            <li>We did use it around our nose to help with congestion but it had a pretty good sting to it that made it unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to clear my throat and try to cough up mucus.  </li>
            <li>Today, we have all clear from our physician.</li>
            <li>Ordered this after reading a review on the Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of this and Young Life&#x27;s &#x27;Thieves&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>(wow)</li>
            <li>It is described as a knock off for Young Living&#x27;s Thieves and it missed the mark.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>We really like this essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li>It really is comparable to the thieves essential oil and at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>winter thus far</li>
            <li>She was very upset and distressed about going to her counter clerk job, being seen by public.</li>
            <li>- I mix it with almond oil and apply to the side of nostrils and sinus (also using it on skin tags - wow 2 days..</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend the money for the real deal.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for young kids!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>personally I think even the smell is too intense...</li>
            <li>My 4 year old began complaining one morning of a headache and stomach ache.  </li>
            <li>I applied more to his feet around noon, when he complained again, which was just before he vomited.  </li>
            <li>I will repeat the process today and again tonight as well, which I think will clear it up completely.</li>
            <li>soon.**UPDATE 3/11/15: I have since learned by contacting Plant Therapy that you should NOT USE this product on children UNDER 10 YRS OLD (by diffusing or diluted with a carrier oil).</li>
            <li>There is no information or warnings about that on the product or on the websites, which I believe there should be one if this is the case.**you should NOT USE this product on children UNDER 10 YRS OLD (by diffusing or diluted with a carrier oil).</li>
            <li>She said it really helped her with breathing especially at night as they have both dogs and cats in house!!!!</li>
            <li>I put this with water into my electric scent burner at home and in a busy dental office.</li>
            <li>I have both this oil and young living thieves oil and feel they both work well.</li>
            <li>I tried buying this product hoping it would be like the Young Living brand.  </li>
            <li>like the doterra or young living oils.  </li>
            <li>This Germ Fighter oil seemed to have the same ingredients and was comparable to the Thieves oil at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>So far, 4 flights, no colds.  </li>
            <li>I had been hearing about the brand this formula compares to (it starts with a T and is what you might call a band of robbers) for years on a parenting message board I frequent.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the oil comes out a bit fast.</li>
            <li>sensitive, little-people feet.  </li>
            <li>A bit sweeter...not quite as spicy as Young Living Thieves.  </li>
            <li>My brother has used it directly on his feet and says that it has helped clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li>The product did not TOUCH my skin, it was on a disk NEAR my skin.</li>
            <li>Beware if you will use this product near the skin, to inhale, etc.</li>
            <li>It smells just like thieves from Young Living Oil.....</li>
            <li>We have used the Young Living blend of Thieves for a couple years and this works just as well and is way cheaper.</li>
            <li>We have used Young Living products for years.  </li>
            <li>well to young living thieves oil.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the YL brand but can&#x27;t bring myself to drop that much for a 10ml bottle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as my young living thieves.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I was looking for an immune booster for my 1 year old daughter who kept getting colds all winter.</li>
            <li>It will burn if you get it on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I still prefer Thieves by Young Living.</li>
            <li>chemical/anti bacterial cleaners- since its natural germ fighter.</li>
            <li>I seem to have a sensitive immune system since chemo and decided to try Germ Fighter oil to help with allergies and colds.  </li>
            <li>Young Living Thieves and</li>
            <li>I do not use it for all the things I would use the other essential oil, but I do put it on my vacuume cleaner&#x27;s air filter and my light bulbs</li>
            <li>free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot).</li>
            <li>free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot).</li>
            <li>Having used Thieves Oil in the past, I was a little hesitant to change products, but this is just as good, if not a little cheaper than thieves oil.</li>
            <li>I used it every other day during this winter and the house smell fresh</li>
            <li>We purchased this as a replacement for the more expensive Thieves brand, influenced mostly by the previous reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li>Use a few drops or so in a spray bottle &amp; add some distilled water to clean.</li>
            <li>I love to use germ fighter in our small diffuser in different areas around our home.  </li>
            <li>I did try it on myself after that, and it was not bad, just a little tingle.  </li>
            <li>I have no doubt that this oil is effective because my husband is military and around new Marines non stop as he is an instructor, and with that amount of people he brought home pretty much every cold and flu</li>
            <li>I just received the Germ Fighter the other day and right away I used it in our diffuser at home.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Germ Fighter for topical use (used in dilute form to disinfect a wound and a swollen gum) and to freshen/</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely be buying from Plant Therapy again and if they keep their standards/quality high</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality product that I&#x27;ll definitely buy again and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get some thieves oil from young living, but didn&#x27;t want to spend quite so much as I was just starting to dabble with essential</li>
            <li>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t sell Young Living and generally refuse to buy from pyramid schemes in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also use in plugin diffuser with a few drops of orange essential oil for lovely scent like Constant Comment tea.</li>
            <li>I did lots of research on this one because I normally buy a different brand but</li>
            <li>, it is crossed out in red and right above it in red says 1.21 fl oz.</li>
            <li>Just judging from the taste, this seems like it is lesser quality and tastes as if it is almost purely some sort of lesser grade cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my 2 1/2 year old and 5 1/2 year old and their back was covered with hives.  </li>
            <li>Plant Therapy Germ Fighter is a very close comp to YL Thieves and I will not spend the extra $$ for YL in the future.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals but it is super harsh and basically all cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I just started using this little magic in a bottle, and for the first time - in a long time - I sense a little relief.</li>
            <li>I also used it on a dog bite on my hand that was hard to bandage, and the infection did seem to clear up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>As a single mom I really have to watch what I spend</li>
            <li>I know the ingredients are listed differently than on the young living thieves bottle which means the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; is different, but these are still all pure 100% essential oils.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, this really is an excellent sub for the much more expensive version that&#x27;s so expensive because it can only be purchased through a MLM scheme.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops of this oil in a sink full of warm water while washing my expensive cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li>As strong in smell &amp; effectiveness as other more expensive essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li>The price seems a little high and has exactly the same ingredients and smell as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34;, so if you can find Thieves cheaper elsewhere, buy it.</li>
            <li>between this Germ Fighter blend and eucalyptus oil for when my older daughter gets a stuffy nose and RC (by Young Living) for when my younger daughter has a cough, our sickies have only lasted briefly.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say for sure that this oil is less potent/ effective as other companies, but I can say it has left me skeptical.</li>
            <li>I use this in a room diffuser, also in a general purpose cleaning spray.  </li>
            <li>Not sorry we lied, sorry we have cheap junk</li>
            <li>This essential oil blend is completely clear, and does not smell like the oils that are contained within.</li>
            <li>Smelled the same as Young Living Thieves although I tried to put it on my toothpaste and it tasted chemical (which I don&#x27;t get from YL).  </li>
            <li>I also purchase Young Living Thieves and if I compare the two the Germ Fighter oil is thinner consistency and has a different smell.  </li>
            <li>I order both Immune-Aid and Germ Fighter to use as a natural approach to turn against potential flu.</li>
            <li>were nearly gone by the next day.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare to young living because I never used it, but I will definite continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li>If the price difference were only 5 dollars I would probably purchase from young living</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that I can order direct and not through a multi-level marketing scheme which only serves to bump up the prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of the much lower price, I was somewhat skeptical about the quality of this product, but we use thieves for so many different things that I figured we should try it.</li>
            <li>It does have a slightly different aroma than Young Living or DoTERRA.</li>
            <li>I have used essential oils for years throu young living.</li>
            <li>This products smells, an tastes just like the young living theves essential oils</li>
            <li>I bought this Germ Fighter long into the sinus infection battle, mixed it with a carrier oil and used it on my sinuses, behind my ears and at the back of my head and neck and received good benefit.</li>
            <li>We were in the middle of flu season, so I started using a few drops in a crock pot full of water since I didn&#x27;t have a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting to just know the story behind it.</li>
            <li>Used this on my 7 yr old son when he came down with a high fever and virus, all symptoms vanished in about 12 hrs!</li>
            <li>My massage therapist uses another brand, but I had been using a few of the other Plant Therapy essential oils (lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint) and was 100% satisfied with them, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>i use it when i&#x27;m getting sick, by putting some in a carrier oil and rubbing in my chest, etc, it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to rub on your chest.in a lotion if you think you&#x27;re getting sick</li>
            <li>I was trying to save money by not going with the more expensive essential oils and I highly regret it.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other &#x27;Thieves Oil&#x27; to compare it too (they cost way too much to even try), so I cannot help with that.</li>
            <li>The scent is very comparable to the other brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some serious sinus problems lasting months in spite of many alternative products being used and traditional medical treatment.  </li>
            <li>This is the same blend as Thieves, by Young Living, but at a fraction of the price (30ml of Thieves will likely cost you over $80!).</li>
            <li>Kind of nostalgic actually, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it from the oils blended.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help clear the air in our home after so many have been so ill this spring.</li>
            <li>I would have a cup of black tea first thing in the morning with three drops of this essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li>not exactly the same as Thieves Oil, but much cheaper</li>
            <li>I purchased this as it had the same ingredients as the more expensive Young Living Thieves&#x27; oil.  </li>
            <li>I am going to keep using this at night in our diffuser to see how it works in the long run since my son - who is 6 yrs old - seems to pick up all of the germs and sickness that he comes across at school.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops into hot water to help relieve sinus pain</li>
            <li>I use a few drops in my floor vents daily to keep the house safe and germ free during cold and flu season as we have an immune suppressed member of the family on chemo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with the other brands that are a similar blend, but when I diffused this oil, I could smell it in my whole upper level of my house.  </li>
            <li>We are buying a new house that had cats and has been closed up for 6 months.  </li>
            <li>It smells strongly of cinnamon which can be irritating</li>
            <li>I believe that it will probably work well to naturally fight germs and viruses, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t smell just like Thieves, which is half of the reason I love that blend!</li>
            <li>Thieves Oil (I&#x27;ve always been annoyed at how over-priced that oil blend is, and now I can purchase at a reasonable price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Plant Therapy Essential Oils ;)</li>
            <li>They smell absolutely identical and my friend is so envious that I paid so much less for what appears to be the same thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, we had a mold problem, and this stuff is obviously not as high quality as the Thieves we bought from Young Living for the problem.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a little less of a cinnamon scent than the original.</li>
            <li>(But I also try to eat right - no processed sugar and very little other sugars, no wheat/gluten, lots of whole, unprocessed foods, etc.)</li>
            <li>Not too bad and good value.</li>

            <li> Our family swears by Germ Fighter and we love the results we see by diffusing it or blending it with a carrier oil to create homemade remedies for when any of us aren&#x27;t feeling the best.</li>
            <li> The Germ Fighter (Thieves Oil Blend) smells wonderful and has many health benefits.</li>

            <li> The scent is warm, refreshing, and perfect for winter.</li>
            <li> Smells good but haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> Since I have never tried any oils before, I have nothing to compare this too, but it smells good and seems to help with my stuffy nose when its being used in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> and really a good bang for your buck.</li>

            <li> i liked the oil.</li>
            <li> It is good for many things.</li>
            <li> Just being honest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even made my own using those five ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Kind of Holiday/festive smelling, but I will try it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent and priced very well.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and cleaning alternative.</li>
            <li> Also nice in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> do you have on, it sure smells good.</li>
            <li> I make my own household cleaner with vinegar, orange peels and dish soap.  </li>
            <li> The bottle says it has proven 99% effective in killing airborne bacteria in studies.</li>
            <li> YL mouthwash... make your own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to diffuse to kill germs in the house</li>
            <li> She LOVED it and plans to purchase more.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice, and I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Yes it is their own version of thieves oil.  </li>
            <li> Everyone loved the &amp;#34; smell&amp;#34; as they came in and I didn&#x27;t get the cold/ flu that many had this year.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as Thieves, and it stings when applied on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is deodorizing and it may be an effective germicide.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a combination I&#x27;d look for on my own</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t feel this has helped shorten any sicknesses.  </li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> I was going to make my own Thieves formula when I came across this bottle</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own foam soap.  </li>
            <li> but it sure does feel good on it and warms the muscles up after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I have used all and find all are effective.</li>
            <li> I have made my own version of Thieves Oil</li>
            <li> I like the scent, warm and cinnamony.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, warding off colds and viruses?........smells nice</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil blend.</li>
            <li> Kind of clove-ish.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be as effective as Four Thieves but cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> It was nice to not have to take any medicine to mitigate our cold/flu symptoms.</li>
            <li> I would have liked instructions sent with product.</li>
            <li> use it in my humitifier nice job would recommend it for any oil lover</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a warm oil for skin).</li>
            <li> I tried it out in my diffuser and Germ fighter has a Christmas-spice kind of scent.</li>
            <li> I mix it with distilled water for mopping and again it makes the house smell nice.</li>
            <li> I think it has more cinnamon,  but it still good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice, but it doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li> Excellent service and the essential oil is very nice.  </li>
            <li> even when highly diluted retains it wonderful, warm, spicy aroma.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and even my kids like to smell it when I use it to clean around our house or diffuse it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to be able to find a product that works like Thieves, but not the price.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant odor to it and we enjoy using it as a disinfectant.  </li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops on the top of the furnace filter and the whole house smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Something in this oil is very strong and is an irritant to skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li> Very strong cinnamon smell which kills germs,</li>
            <li> Was also looking for an alternative to soy-thrilled to find healthy products! :)</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product so far!</li>
            <li> and I practice aromatherapy, love it, absolutely love germ fighter and all its attributes!</li>
            <li> Wonderful essential oil, I have used this to clean up a moldy smell and folks walk in now and ask what smells so good!</li>

            <li> This is my new favorite product!!!  </li>
            <li> I am super super happy!</li>
            <li> Thought it was worth a try, and this oil had great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Great product worth the money.</li>
            <li> Compared to Thieves Oil by Young Living which is way overpriced this stuff is great!  </li>
            <li> The cinnamon seemed to be the most noticable smell, which was nice.</li>
            <li> I make my own laundry soap because I have so many allergies to products</li>
            <li> So far I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Its safe, non toxic and effective.</li>
            <li> and way more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Would recommend Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s Thieve&#x27;s oil over this oil - it just has a more pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a lot more bottles from Plant Therapy, as I have been happy with their products, and the prices are excellent compared to other providers.  </li>
            <li> The scent is SO strong!</li>
            <li> always great product and fast shipment, very happy, highly recommend seller</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance that is not overpowering even if the effects are powerful.</li>
            <li> add it to my deodorant for a good smell and on the bottom of my feet each day when I go to work (at an elementary school) to ward off illness!</li>
            <li> A good substitute for the original</li>
            <li> I love very pleasant (strong) smell and HOT sensations on my feet.</li>
            <li> I experienced immediate results just after the first use.</li>

            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the top ingredient to be cloves, rather than lemon.</li>

            <li> Love this for everything...</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>

            <li> also love the pre-diluted roll-on version of this blend.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;m buying more-</li>
            <li> and again as I learn more about this therapy.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> This wonderful blend kill germs and most critical for me MOLD!  </li>
            <li> Is it pregnancy safe?</li>
            <li> This tested better for me than Thieves.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would have more of a cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> This is better than Thieves, better than On Guard.</li>
            <li> I figure this will be part of our health regimen including exercise, healthy diet, judicious washing of our hands, prayer, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the very toxic toothpastes we find at the stores.</li>
            <li> I love germ fighter.</li>
            <li> I use it every day for so many things...</li>
            <li> I love plant therapy products.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and have ordered it many times since.</li>
            <li> More than that can cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to anyone with a home diffuser</li>
            <li> I love the price and the scent and the germ fighting properties.</li>
            <li> But it sure worked that way for me.</li>
            <li> I love this oil combo.  </li>
            <li> it makes a room smell lovely.  </li>
            <li> This essential oil blend is wonderful...</li>
            <li> and I love to sprinkle it throughout the house.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> Check out plant therapy&#x27;s website for more info.</li>
            <li> I noticed I was able to breathe better.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I diffuse it often but my favorite way to use it is to put two drops in my coffee then add my coconut  creamer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> But, I asked the Great Physician for healing as well.and we are very thankful.</li>
            <li> I had to order more so</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and use it for many things like room sprays, mouth rinses, on tooth brush and homemade hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Then she saw that I was feeling much better</li>
            <li> will buy more</li>
            <li> Smells good, price is right, and it works.</li>
            <li> Havent used thieves oil before, just mixed my own, but this makes my house smell good along with knowing its killing germs!</li>
            <li> It tast great and my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> So far, it has a good smell, but we will see once my kids start school if they catch everything that goes around!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good, for the price I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> The particular blend smelled great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is very similar to thieves and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t paid full price for the brand-name variety of this oil, but I&#x27;m loving this blend.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working, and I&#x27;m excited to have a solution that isn&#x27;t a lethal chemical!  </li>
            <li> The label states it&#x27;s 99.9% effective against bacteria, which is a bold statement, but I am a believer.  </li>
            <li> Some people may like it better, since it is not quite as strong a scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, spicy and warm with the main top notes being cloves and cinnamon.</li>
            <li> the cinnamon is strong in this product and I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: I like the scent, it is a strong scent though, but christmasy, which most people like, I can&#x27;t imagine someone finding this scent to be offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells ok, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent blend and just as hoped and better than expected.</li>
            <li> I am thankful that Amazon has this wonderful germ fighting oil available at such a bargain price.  </li>
            <li> This oil is as great as the thieves from a young living, but at a friction of a cost!</li>
            <li> great for a spattering on throw pillows, bottom of sheet, on a piece of paper towel near your computer, etc.!</li>
            <li> Began using this as soon as we received it in our childrens diffuser (along with calm the child which we also love!)</li>
            <li> He rinsed again with warm water and was able to eat right after with no pain.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to the wonderful world of essential oils and had been looking for a good thieves oil.  </li>
            <li> Easy drug free way to keep family safe and healthy with no side effects.</li>
            <li> Good product make the room fresh and clean</li>
            <li> This is very good essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working great so far.</li>
            <li> Ideally, you should do this several times a day.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it and remember you get 20% more for FREE....</li>
            <li> I really rubbed it in good.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good packaging.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t quite as good as Thieves IMO, but very close.  </li>
            <li> I was very leery of using oils for colds or anything but to make things smell good.  </li>
            <li> Smelled great, diffused nicely and long</li>
            <li> I find this blend has a less overwhelming amount of clove, meaning it&#x27;s just the perfect mix of blends( in my opinion)</li>
            <li> I swear I felt better more quickly than I would have without it.</li>
            <li> I can smell the cinnamon primarily over any other oil, and when you add this to a steamer inhaler to breathe into your lungs, it is the most delicious smelling and &amp;#34;tasting&amp;#34; steam - worked wonders to help break up phlegm in my chest.</li>
            <li> My husband and 9 year old son love it too!!</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;does the trick&amp;#34; and gets us back to feeling good again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful, but use extreme caution if you use it on children under age 12 as it has eucalyptus which is not recommended unless you dilute with a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> An excellent value in both quality and cost as compared to other leading brands.</li>
            <li> Super strong!  </li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of Christmastime, which is never a bad thing!</li>
            <li> My house feels clean, and it&#x27;s safe for my kids and pets.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a safe way to clean your home, this is it.</li>
            <li> love the aromatherapy value and its ability to clean the air of bacteria/mold spores.</li>
            <li> I bought the glass roll containers to dilute in a carrier oil and to apply easy.  </li>
            <li> Smells good too, but not as effective for personal use as Thieves.  </li>
            <li> If I use it in my home diffuser it is too strong on the cinnamon</li>
            <li> but some may find it a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> While the smell of this oil is strong, a dab here</li>
            <li> strong, but that is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> However since I&#x27;m still in a strong allergy reaction from another brand oil, I will probably don&#x27;t apply them in any skin touch or massage for now, and just use them in cleaning to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> WOW this stuff is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to kill bacteria in the air, the laundry, in general home cleaning, etc.  </li>
            <li> Hands Down, best thing out there.</li>
            <li> But for what it is, and the price, it is fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and liking it just fine.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work fine for me.</li>
            <li> I woke up in the morning feeling fine.</li>
            <li> so I started with 1% to see how I handled it, and I stayed at 2% and find this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Works for me just fine.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with the quality of the oil, the larger size, and the amazing price.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quick turn around of this delivery.  </li>
            <li> Even more so gargling with this added to saltwater showed my sore throat to quickly fade.</li>
            <li> Our absolute FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> Finding a replacement for thieves oil has become a challenge for some reason and finding the right mixture is very important.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because it smells nice and was able to temporarily clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the health of my family since using it.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the benefits from it.</li>
            <li> Even the labels on this brand are cheap looking and leave you wondering about the company.</li>
            <li> He slept soundly, and was fever free to go to school.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy diffusing it.</li>
            <li> Winter isn&#x27;t over, but I have been sickness free.</li>
            <li> We made a fabulous smelling hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin -</li>
            <li> Also as I&#x27;ve seen others state, this is light on clove, which I intend to supplement for a stronger scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful blend, and much more affordable than the Young Living essential oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is so much I could say about this Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> While we were watching television, he began to sound increasingly congested.  </li>
            <li> I have used this essential oils for about a year and have noticed great improvement in my respiratory health.  </li>
            <li> You can smell all of the ingredients and it does get warm if you put too much on.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon is so cheap, so abrasive that it burns like fire, I cannot put it on my skin, and any Thieves or Thieves-like blend</li>
            <li> PLANT THERAPY MAKES GREAT ESSENTIAL OILS</li>
            <li> but it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> anytime I wanted a wonderful smell that also killed germs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it on a cotton ball in my car and enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> now skin is smooth and</li>
            <li> This works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Great essential oil for my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it overall though.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and killing germs at the same time!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> and now my whole room smells like a spicy kind of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Great quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I think I will enjoy this.</li>
            <li> The smell and the use are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Useful for most everything.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and this version is a much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> She thinks it has healing powers and that&#x27;s good enough for me :-)</li>
            <li> Loved it so far.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it really assists in keeping you healthy and well.  </li>
            <li> The oils are great, considering the price, and the germ fighter smells better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Just a good as Thieves by Young Living.</li>
            <li> They have requested more and I have ordered a second bottle since it seems to work and smells good too.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> :) 100% good quality essential oils</li>
            <li> so far so good....</li>
            <li> So far, so good - no colds or flu.</li>
            <li> However,  have grown to have a healthy respect for essential oils and Plant Therapy is as good a product as any I have used.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a cinnamon smell , which I really like (it reminds me of the original flavor of Dentyne Gum-my favorite).</li>
            <li> I have purchased other germ fighter blends that just didn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li> I will still use this blend to clean with and maybe diffuse when someone in the family has an upper respiratory illness, but I loved being able to diffuse Thieves</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a very effective essential oil immunity blend!!</li>
            <li> And it makes your home smell fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li> I would live to be able for teachers to have a discount or be able to receive free trials.</li>
            <li> The first night my daughter slept much more comfortably than she had in days despite being on steroids to keep her breathing easier.</li>
            <li> In the winter I use this product to creat a home made sugar scub with&lt;br /&gt;raw sugar, sweet almond oil, and a few drops of germ fighter for a wonderful scent.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and a family member I gifted a bottle to was also very pleased--she is very knowledgable about essential oils and their myriad applications.</li>
            <li> , I place a couple of droplets of this oil into a burning candle and it is diffused throughout my home for a fresh, clean smell!</li>
            <li> and this is a great option for less $ to keep my daughter and myself healthy..</li>
            <li> Has stopped mouth pain &amp; prevented infection, I use it every night before bed, put some on a q-tip &amp; rub it on my teeth &amp; gums, I&#x27;ve had no infection or pain for mths &amp; finally have dental insurance but will continue to use this, amazing!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with this decision.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> love this oil, and am glad it seems to be performing as well as the &amp;#34;other brand.&amp;#34; Already have ordered and started using 3 more bottles ... different diffusers, as an inhaler, etc.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome, arrived ahead of schedule and is in heavy use in our household!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know about you, but my kids usually take a day or 2 to recover from a tummy bug, so I was really impressed.  </li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on reviews and was excited at the idea that it might shorten the duration of the colds my family gets.</li>
            <li> While I love supporting &amp;#34;mommy</li>
            <li> This one is significantly lower in price.</li>
            <li> Makes a significant difference in our allergy suffering.</li>
            <li> SO worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can testify to its germ fighting powers, but it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use the higher priced &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t tell a difference. :)</li>
            <li> So far we have been very healthy this season.</li>
            <li> Are we paying more for higher quality or multilevel marketing?</li>
            <li> Germ Fighter has a pretty strong cinnamon smell, while Immune-Aid is more sweet and mild.</li>
            <li> It smells clean.  </li>
            <li> I love this blend and the price is much better than young livings thieves.</li>
            <li> A week later: Now after using the oil diluted in a bottle as a room spray, and in my vinegar water to clean floors and surfaces, and also diffusing it to add a pleasant scent as well as kill germs...</li>
            <li> I add to the humidifier and so far the family is healthy (in addition to healthy nutrition).</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is rather trivial, I would of liked an eye dropper top, would make life a bit easier.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clean smell and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> I mix with vinager to clean.</li>
            <li> Glad to say we stayed healthy through the peak so far.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it to clean with.</li>
            <li> I clean with this oil...</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else to clean my home again.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant; I mixed it with grapeseed oil to rub on my feet.</li>
            <li> I love this product and such a great price for a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a wonderful alternative to other wicked high priced oils available.  </li>
            <li> I originally got this to make hand sanitizer, and absolutely fell in love with this oil.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and has all the ingredients as other that cost much more.</li>
            <li> The quality &amp; price are just right!  </li>
            <li> helps sore throat right away!</li>
            <li> They also have great customer service, I emailed them several times with questions about the use of eo&#x27;s and they were very fast to respond.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of thieves, the quality is the same in my opinion and for this great price I can use it liberally and give it away as gifts as well;)</li>
            <li> We dilute it in sweet almond oil and put it on the bottom of our feet when a bug is going around.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t it Aristotle who said that &amp;#34;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about germ fighter</li>
            <li> the next morning she&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found this company, thanks to a review I read on the web site.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is everything it was purported to be, I just have not decided I really buy into this oil idea.</li>
            <li> This oil was extremely potent and intense.</li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> I felt very relaxed and the scents were lovely.</li>
            <li> Smells better and works very well.</li>
            <li> It smells much better than straight out of the bottle; maybe it took my nose awhile to get use to the scent.  </li>
            <li> We love the scent, it fills the whole house.</li>
            <li> When we start to get a sore throat, we mix a couple drops with some sweet almond oil and massage it on our necks.</li>
            <li> Good size bottle that will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I view most of this stuff as snake oil anyway but OnGuard really did take that I&#x27;m-getting-sick-tickle-in-the-throat away for 3-4 hours</li>
            <li> , I will definitely update after I&#x27;ve given it some good use over a period of time.</li>
            <li> Fast, free shipping!</li>
            <li> I absolute LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> We put 8-15 drops in a gallon cool mist humidifier and the scent is distributed all day.</li>
            <li> So far this has helped my family from catching any additional flu bugs.</li>
            <li> Having alergy and sensitivty reactions to eviromental substances, this synergy blend has fast become a favorite.</li>
            <li> but after you get used to it, it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked this oil, it smells good and has done a great job of keeping me from getting sick.  </li>
            <li> Great price, however, it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as other essential oil brands.</li>
            <li> i add some oil drops (quantity is personal preference) to the water and have a very nice aroma around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. when i first got this blend</li>
            <li> This large bottle, for a great price, will probably last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been happy with other Plant Therapy products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying some other oils from plant therapy and like all of them, respir-aid is great, it helped with my cough a lot.</li>
            <li> The oils seem strong enough and pure and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> The house smells clean and fresh and I hope this keeps some of the fall and winter illnesses at bay.</li>
            <li> My favorite affordable version of the famous &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; essential oil.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as Young Living without the high price tag!  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> and it does help them to get over it so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Received the oil quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am glad I bought it and would buy again if I can find it at a better price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it&#x27;s the same as thieves essential oil.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and item was just as described.  </li>
            <li> While this is not an equivalent to thieves, it is an adequate substitute for my purpose.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Works just as good as Young Living Thieves but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but I needed something comparable to Thieves rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good sub for Thieves - NOT great but good.  </li>
            <li> excellent price and in using immediately on a facial clogged pore, twice daily, healing resulted within week.</li>
            <li> I previously had a compromised immune system, and GF was very good at nipping bugs in the bud when I first started feeling funky.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent and it works as well as high priced brand name oils.</li>
            <li> At the very first sign apply it to the soles of your feet.  </li>
            <li> Helps fight colds and other illnesses naturally, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm and for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Young livings oil has more of a clove scent but this oil so far has been just as effective as thieves brand.</li>
            <li> It is certainly worth trying, and the people at Plant Therapy are quick to reply when contacted.</li>
            <li> We are diffusing it in my house almost daily throughout the winter in hopes of staving off too many illnesses!</li>
            <li> I only have three, but, still, I love it!</li>
            <li> I actually now love it!  </li>
            <li> The smell is so wonderful that my entire family loves this and is willing to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I think Plant Therapy will be a good back up/cost effective option to my Young Living collection which I am very partial to because of their amazing reputation.  </li>
            <li> eg if it touches the outside hand (palm and soles of feet seem ok) and its v strong if ingested - burns the mouth.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived quickly and is much, much, much more affordable than Young Living&#x27;s Thieves blend.</li>
            <li> High quality, lovely spicy smell of cinnamon and cloves, fast and friendly service.</li>
            <li> Company is fantastic, ships fast and protected well.</li>
            <li> This is their version of &amp;#34;thieves oil&amp;#34; which is an amazing essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li> and it still took about 10 minutes for the burning to calm</li>
            <li> It smelled great, and I also put a few drops on our hands at bed time to fight germs while we slept.</li>
            <li> I have also made my own 4 Thieves oil &amp; it is much more expensive to make your own, however, I prefer to use organic oils.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this better than the Young Living Thieves oil.</li>
            <li> Keep my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth have no buildup on them.</li>
            <li> For the price tag totally worth the try.</li>
            <li> Great product and seems to work just as well as Young Living essential oils!</li>
            <li> Many compare this to Thieves by Young Living.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend making your own, as this has a carrier oil and is not &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; essential oils, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and for about 1/10 the cost of making it yourself.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both taken it in a capsule to fend off oncoming colds with success.  </li>
            <li> They arrive on time, well wrapped and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use to for any sickness yet, but it smells very similar to another popular blend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting most of my oils from Rocky Mountain oils and Young living.</li>
            <li> We have been diffusing the germ fighter  in our house and it doesn&#x27;t only smell good, it really works.  </li>
            <li> I also try to use natural cleaning products in the home most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to be just as potent as Young Living&#x27;s oil,</li>
            <li> I have seen others recommend this oil applied to the lips, but I can not recommend that because the clove and cinnamon bark may irritate as they are powerful</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy all through amazon, some were purchased from the sellers website, so I may not show up as a verified reviewer on some, but I am only reviewing products I own and have tried.kill bacteria and harmful germs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy all through amazon, some were purchased from the sellers website, so I may not show up as a verified reviewer on some, but I am only reviewing products I own and have tried.</li>
            <li> We rarely get colds.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to make my own blend of the same!</li>
            <li> My kids and I had colds recently and really liked using this.</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that worked as good or at least almost as good as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; from Young Living.</li>
            <li> I have been using this (mixed with water :1 drop of oil per oz of water:) as a cleaner for my kitchen and bathroom and not only does it smell good, it kills germs too.</li>
            <li> Smells more spicy than the other brand, which is fine!</li>
            <li> Not as strong and slightly different smell as Thieves but seems to still be pretty potent.</li>
            <li> Its really strong so only used a small amt and it worked great when i had a lung infection!</li>
            <li> Love this product and great service in delivery and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Have reordered this item and several other items.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and extremely reasonably priced especially compared to Young Essential Oil &amp;#34;Thieves.&amp;#34; The fragrance is not quite as strong as Young&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s wonderful all the same and I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> i did not know how much to add to my kettle, my first portion happened to be too much, but i still liked it since it was clearing up my breathing airways very well.</li>
            <li> and it works right away.  </li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> just the right amount for us.  </li>
            <li> her nose started to breath well right away and the mist calmed her cough.</li>
            <li> right now this is a five star product for two reasons:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also very strong to rub under your nose - especially for kids!  </li>
            <li> This is a very strong anti-bacterial plant oil that I also use for sinusitis and overall immune boost from bacterial infections.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with my first bottle of Essential Oils from Plant Therapy and I will be ordering more products</li>
            <li> Smells great, not sure about</li>
            <li> The company stands behind their products and wants to make sure your happy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to learn about essential oils, after I used clove oil with great success for pain after wisdom tooth extraction.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything...a drop on my toothbrush with my regular toothpaste makes my mouth feel fresh for hours, in my car diffuser for a great smelling commute, massage my feet with it and a carrier oil to boost my immune system, and simply just rub it in my skin (again with a carrier oil)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this when it came, that instead of testing it on myself first like would have been the smarter option, I put it straight onto the bottom of my 18 month olds feet.  </li>
            <li> The Young Life oil smells much richer and of greater quality.</li>
            <li> I had been looking into essential oils and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy the multi level marketing brands, I knew there had to be a great quality product without the extra &amp;#34;baggage&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another great essential oil synergy from this company~ one I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This is about half the cost and is just as good of a product.</li>
            <li> Do not spend the extra money on the Young living brand, this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Putting a few drops in an aromatherapy device leaves the room also pleasantly aromatic.</li>
            <li> My son had a bit of a stuffy nose for a couple of days, but other than that, very healthy.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets with this purchase and most definitely will be returning repeatedly to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li> and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This seems to be very much like Thieves oil blend.</li>
            <li> 100% pure is rare and it has the smell</li>
            <li> We make a disinfectant spray for cleaning my house and even keep little ones in the cars to keep the steering wheel and handles cleaner, plus it helps the car to smell good.</li>
            <li> it smells so good in the house when I put it in my little crockpot with water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely good quality, I know nothing about this particular brand, but I use Thieves SO much during flu season, to diffuse, or to make my own cleaning product (small amount of vinegar, add mostly water, and few drops of &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34; depending on how powerful you want.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant aroma and only a few drops needed in my oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed this blend myself and it is one of my favorite blends, but this companies blend smelled off.</li>
            <li> great--doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like thieves, and isn&#x27;t as concentrated or something</li>
            <li> It smells exactly how you would expect cinnamon, clove, and eucalyptus to smell.</li>
            <li> This one holds a high rating in quality too!!</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The balance of the oils is more than comfortably different, too.</li>
            <li> love this oil, and am glad it seems to be performing as well as the &amp;#34;other brand.&amp;#34; Already have ordered and started using 3 more bottles ... different diffusers, as an inhaler, etc.musty after a few days without the window being opened)!</li>
            <li> Shrinking fast!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an exact duplication of YL&#x27;s proprietary blend, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever ordered and used an oil like this.  </li>
            <li> Germ Fighter is my favorite Plant Therapy essential oil...</li>
            <li> and that really worked!</li>
            <li> Water will just spread the burn around, while the oil-free make-up remover seemed to break up the oil and remove it pretty well.</li>
            <li> Literally had me in tears it was so hot.</li>
            <li> When I determined that this product was very similar, yet much more affordable, I tried it.</li>
            <li> My youngest (13 months) was the first to benefit from this blend-</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what they say it does.</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it to my friends and anyone interested in essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I love this essential oil synergy from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I diffuse this and put a couple drops in hot water to breathe in the steam with a towel over my head.</li>
            <li> Have purchased a couple of times and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> first thing I used the oil on was a plantar&#x27;s wart on my daughter&#x27;s foot that freezing wasn&#x27;t working for.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours it was better and within 48 it was definitely on the way to being cured.</li>
            <li> so I can see how well it really works!</li>
            <li> &#x27;Cause, gosh darnit, I wanted that stinkin&#x27; illness to go away fast!  </li>
            <li> Exactly like the Doterra OnGuard that costs a fortune.</li>
            <li> I use it as a substitute for the higher priced Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in this larger size.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I use thieves oil</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast delivery to!</li>
            <li> We love this essential oil blend.</li>
            <li> Also use this before open houses as people love the smell of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> only way more affordable.</li>
            <li> Used it  and felt  better after one day along with Breathe easier oil  for a recent bout with sinus infection / bronchitis.</li>
            <li> There are many different formulations for this type of blend.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> We first thought she broke it</li>
            <li> I think it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this also helped me get over the flu last month!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite essential oil!</li>
            <li> I really love this product and will purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love the smell.</li>
            <li> This was my first winter of using the germ fighter oil</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> However, the first time I purchased it, it seemed &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It seemed like she would get better at times in the day, but then it came back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil with</li>
            <li> Essential oils have substance, depth and, many have color.</li>
            <li> I might find more use on this product later.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product for the first time a couple weeks ago and have used it in my humidifyer.  </li>
            <li> Love the larger quantity.</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the exact measurements.</li>
            <li> I mix the ingredients, try it, and add whatever I think is necessary to taste better.</li>
            <li> Thanks Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and we love it.</li>
            <li> I diffuse this daily and absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different EO oil companies.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to replace the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot</li>
            <li> I first used this product when I received it in a set of oils.  </li>
            <li> The first time my wife came home and smelled the house she told me to never use it again.</li>
            <li> A few drops in a salt &amp; soda mix for brushing teeth does a good job of cleaning and freshening breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (so much that I bought a second one) and has been going strong for almost 2 years now!</li>
            <li> Best use I have found so far is that by putting a few drops in the rarely used guest bathroom toilet it stays fresh even when it goes weeks without flushing.  </li>
            <li> One is to experiment but be careful as it is powerful stuff!!!  </li>
            <li> You will pay double for popular brands, but I have found this to be just as high quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> recommend for anyone interested in natural cleaning products who enjoys this combination of smells, to wear, clean with, or make skin products with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes and get eye infections very easily.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is 100% Pure, Undiluted and Therapeutic Grade essential oil blend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like comparing a tomato and a tomato one taste amazing and the other ehh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brand many times and I use it religiously for pretty much everything from cleaning my floors to ingesting it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty fair dupe for more expensive oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a few drops in my natural salt deodorant spray with great results.</li>
            <li> I still buy Thieves, but this acts as a good low cost supplement for some of the less important uses of Thieves (cleaning, air freshening, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jaden</li>
            <li> A spray of it on the hands and rubbing them together is a great way to kill germs too, and more convenient and less messy than gel hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li> This is the closest thing to the real deal I have found – I love the bigger bottle and lower price!</li>
            <li> I have bought a similar product from my local Health Food Store which I loved.</li>
            <li> I go through so much of it that next time, I&#x27;m ordering the 3-oz. size. :)</li>
            <li> What makes me glad is that the company is responsible enough to send email for purchase feedback, leaving their contacts in case</li>
            <li> I used to buy another, much more expensive oil, but if have found Plant Therapy has just as good of product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li> This is a pretty large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD OIL BLEND TO HAVE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN SO MANY OF US GET SICK</li>
            <li> First night I put in on my chest, slept better than I have for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the same &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; as more highly priced blends.  </li>
            <li> Good advertisement, but only half the effectiveness of the original 4 Thieves oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar but much sharper - more cinnamon and peppermint, less of the warm clove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty much everyone in my family using it now as well.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and as effective as the 50.00 bottles sold by other retailers.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it helps health wise, but it can&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> And the extra they charge goes towards providing incentives for the people who sell their oils, which is fine, but not something I&#x27;m willing to pay for.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is a particular brand that starts with a Y that has better quality oils.</li>
            <li> It is just as good, if not better, than the more highly priced synergy oils of the same blend.</li>
            <li> I quickly apply the Germ Fighter to their chest or near</li>
            <li> In addition to making hand sanitizer with it I&#x27;ve added it to some homemade salves and  use a few drops to wipe down my countertops and mop my floors and it makes the house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> In the bathroom itself, I&#x27;ve now got some of this oil in a large coffee mug, with water, sitting on one of those &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; hot-plates designed to keep your coffee/tea/cocoa warmed (or to melt candles to avoid adding burned wick to your air)</li>
            <li> It certainly seemed to kill the germs/viruses that were affecting the children here anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like pure cinnamon.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why we got the LARGE bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil is pure and does not gum it up.</li>
            <li> Will certainly continue buying this as my stash runs out.</li>
            <li> Most recently, I bought a new ultrasound diffuser (Signstek, reviewed separately on Amazon) which holds 500 ml of water at a time, to use close to my bed overnight.</li>
            <li> but mainly - USE Germ Fighter!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an oil that had been recommended to me very highly.</li>
            <li> The smell also goes away really fast, which makes me think it&#x27;s not as pure.</li>
            <li> ; recently and this knocked it right out, super fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and when I did, it began to heal much faster than it had been.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s have been much healthier</li>
            <li> Received it fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Quality product, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I recommend this oil blend to anyone who wants to prevent the sickies in their house.</li>
            <li> I much prefer it to YL.</li>
            <li> the products arrived in a very timely fashion, and I will order again.</li>
            <li> They are basically are giving you the same amount you pay from YL for 5ml for about $28+ for Free.  </li>
            <li> her recovery has been much faster then myself or the doctors even guessed.</li>
            <li> Although we both caught colds, the duration was much shorter than if we hadn&#x27;t used this oil.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really has reduced the number of viruses we get each year.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much</li>
            <li> I think he really does help with my sinus&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome asset during cold and flu season.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> he was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the price tag on it, I really didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for something that I didn&#x27;t know whether or not it would work for me.</li>
            <li> I really needed something to help ease their coughing at night.</li>
            <li> It is very healing.  </li>
            <li> My whole family is using this throughout the flu season and we&#x27;ve been well.</li>
            <li> I washed his feet really well</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This blend seems to be much heavier on the eucalyptus, and Thieves has a dominant note of cloves.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic essential oil for cleaning or to use when I am not feeling well.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my whole family.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but in a diffuser and cleaning products I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommeded!</li>
            <li> Theives Oil (what this oil really is)</li>
            <li> and I really think it helped to lessen the duration of the virus.</li>
            <li> It is very offensive.</li>
            <li> I really like cinnamon and this one delivers.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than thieves oil.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve got until you have the real thing.</li>
            <li> has a very week immune system.</li>
            <li> and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I find Plant Therapy Germ fighter to be a very satisfactory alternative.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Its very comparable to the MLM brand</li>
            <li> It works very well for a fraction of the price of leading brands.  </li>
            <li> Always fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really taste anything but the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to dilute and use on my skin --- even very diluted it burned.  </li>
            <li> Really like this blend.</li>
            <li> Not knowing much about aromatherapy or ratios</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, which is Plant Therapy&#x27;s version of (Four) Thieves.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> -Just be careful not to get on hands or skin, as it is so potent &amp; will burn.</li>
            <li> I diluted it a bit and rubbed it on my swollen lymph nodes when it felt like my whole neck was sore.</li>
            <li> the price is REASONABLE..</li>
            <li> My primary purpose was to buy for sauna times when i am at the gym and such...</li>
            <li> The cinnamon really stands out, but it&#x27;s not at all overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the money, might as well :-)</li>
            <li> I have COPD and this really opens up my lungs.  </li>
            <li> well after using it for a couple months I can really tell a difference in my allergy and sinus issues.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.  </li>
            <li> add to water in a spray bottle and my whole house smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery service.  </li>
            <li> This has nice fragrance, although it seems to be heavy on the clove side.  </li>
            <li> : Young Living also is more specific about the oils than Plant Therapy because they list the botanical names, while Plant Therapy does not.</li>
            <li> --I have to use a bit more, but it&#x27;s still SO MUCH CHEAPER than young living, which I simply can&#x27;t afford.</li>
            <li> and I actually bought it to help my 6 yr old son more than anything.</li>
            <li> and I actually bought it to help my 6 yr old son more than anything.</li>
            <li> Would not hesitate to purchase other items certainly as well for sure.</li>
            <li> I would say its an amazing doup for much less!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great price, but it&#x27;s not exactly the same as Young Living Oils Thieves mix.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Within minutes, his right nostril was almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li> This oil blend was much thinner than the other product I have used, but for the price, I was satisfied with its effectiveness in the atomizer I use.</li>
            <li> Yet compared side by side with my prior unopened bottle, the two bottles are the exact same size, and my prior bottle is actually filled more than the &amp;#34;20% more&amp;#34; bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was using Thieves oil which I also love, however due to how pricey it is, I had to be frugal with it.</li>
            <li> I have not tried other brands because most are out of my price range.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this in early January 2014 when illness was viral (pun intended!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is any better than any other snake oil products.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re just getting into essential oils and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have been nothing but pleased with this oil and intend to purchase again as willas other oils from plant therapy.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to find this product that I have let all my essential oil using friends</li>
            <li> It smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Apply to skin and many other uses come out of it.  </li>
            <li> She had been on antibiotics for 2 days at the time, but it would have been interesting to see the effects without any other measures.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing right?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, and I have also ordered other oils from Plant Therapy which are also good, especially the \\&quot;Pain Aid\\&quot; which helps muscle pain, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to check the water level frequently, until you know how long it takes to</li>
            <li> Just be sure to check the water level frequently, until you know how long it takes to</li>
            <li> I have two large dogs that often smell less than lovely</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil (unless you really don&#x27;t like cinnamon).</li>
            <li> The smell was more intense and I could use less product b/c of this.</li>
            <li> I was going to rate this 3 stars because of the reaction but the bottle came with 6 more ml than I payed for (20% more free it says) which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I prefer Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil, but you get a nice big bottle of what Plant Therapy calls &amp;#34;Germ Fighter,&amp;#34; which contains basically the same ingredients of thieves oil.</li>
            <li> These are hot oils and should NEVER be applied directly to any skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective yet</li>
            <li> and if you are sensitive you might not like it at first</li>
            <li> The last one was because every sinus cavity was full of gunk.</li>
            <li> Exactly like Young Living Thieves oil.  </li>
            <li> but they have been short &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li> Really like the taste and scent of this better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love that I&#x27;m not having to keep putting medicine down their throats!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly used this and the Thieves oil for cleaning, which works fine for that, but I am going to spend the extra money on Young Life for now on.</li>
            <li> The second time I ordered it, it seemed like either it was an older batch or had lost some potency as it didn&#x27;t smell as strong or have the same effect as the first bottle I had.</li>
            <li> Because this is made of pure essential oils, you do need to be careful as it is very strong.</li>
            <li> My research indicated that this particular blend of essential oil has been proven to kill bacteria and mold, whether in the air or on surfaces, and I decided it was worth a try (and much healthier than almost all</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this oil at half the price of Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li> Love this EO Blend - just like Thieves but less $$.</li>
            <li> This one in particular was not a hit with us at all.</li>
            <li> I use this germ fighter oil with the classic ultrasonic aromatherapy diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I could smell some of the main ingredients in this oil blend</li>
            <li> I used this particular one in my humidifier and it helped with congestion.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them.</li>
            <li> But my main concern is it burns the skin</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my feet with a carrier oil, both day and night.  </li>
            <li> I have tried most other essential oil brands over these last 16 years, and Plant Therapy is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Our grandson had a really high fever over the weekend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you use it on a car diffuser, I highly recommend you start with ONE drop</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot to lose or high expectations when I got this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay high prices for this mixture.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this blend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely harsher than young livings thieves, but for the price and my uses which are only external, I feel like it&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
            <li> It is a little over the top on the high notes and the cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> because his skin was &amp;#34;on fire&amp;#34; from the oil :)  I chuckled just a little</li>
            <li> - AND to the upper left in red at a 45 degree slant says: &amp;#34;Now 20% more FREE!&amp;#34; --- Bravo!</li>
            <li> Just because one likes it does not mean you will and so on.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to move it to another room due to the strong smell.  </li>
            <li> The oils hardly have any smell, at first I thought they must have been distilled, and distilled and distilled some more.</li>
            <li> The product is also packaged in a very well designed bottle which seals tightly and will dispense drops easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for Lyme disease, and it&#x27;s really too early to tell.</li>
            <li> VERY comparable to Young&#x27;s EO ...</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then Young Living.</li>
            <li> Much better than and MUCH MORE than just an acceptable substitute for the expensive Young Living Thieves oil.  </li>
            <li> You can also put a few drops in your favorite cleaner, hand soap, or dish soap.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it really helps keep you healthy</li>
            <li> just put a few or more drops in spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as awesome as thieves, but it works really well to get over a cold!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this blend which I use in this Flu season as (a) bedroom diffuser, (b) rubbing few drops on my feet, (c) using it under my armpits, (d)</li>
            <li> Has the same ingredients as Thieves Oil, at a much reduced cost, and higher quantity.</li>
            <li> I gave some to a friend, she and her kids love the scent of the carpet freshener (baking soda with a few drops of this oil blended in).  </li>
            <li> Found the aroma to be a bit harsh, but it&#x27;s okay in disinfectant sprays/laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> The following day I added 2 drops of Ravensara oil to the mix- and wow- complete clearance in the right nostril and 75% in the left (he has a huge polyp</li>
            <li> I do not know if it will prevent the winter germs from making me sick, wash hands, apply my moisture oil and you are doing the best you can.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it as a roll on diluted when he&#x27;s sick and it works great on him too!</li>
            <li> so well - and her immune system definitely needs help right now</li>
            <li> My friend had a sinus infection and she mixed a couple drops with some coconut oil and applied to her feet and her stuffy head was relieved right away.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil, although I have only used it a couple of times, I have been using a brand that cost 3 times as much, recently had a tickle in my throat, runny nose, cough, so I used my new oil on the soles of my feet after diluting with sweet almond oil to 2%.</li>
            <li> use it in combination with Plant Therapy&#x27;s Immune-Aid too and will soon try out my new diffuser with Germ Fighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am hoping it will help purify the air by using it with my new diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still finding new uses.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> When I diffuse other oils, I usually just smell them in one large room (even peppermint, which is very strong!).</li>
            <li> Mixing a few drops with other natural cleaning substances, lemon juice and water, vinegar and water, baking soda, etc gives them an added uplifting, pleasant and vibrant fragrance and added cleaning ability.</li>
            <li> The clean, subtle smell last many hours.  </li>
            <li> I also like to use a drop on a wet rag to clean counters and tables.  </li>
            <li> I was very optimistic; however for me it accomplished none of the above.</li>
            <li> have been using the other formula, and now this, to help in my master bedroom and bath which recently had a mold problem: when my house was built, someone installed the bath light fixture by screwing one side to the wall THROUGH the PVC line carrying hot water.</li>
            <li> I had mixed opinions when I first got it</li>
            <li> I think their oils are better than any other essential oil around.  </li>
            <li> This is my second purchase with Synergy...and my first purchase of their Germ Fighter blend.  </li>
            <li> This  was my first order from Plant Therapy, but it won&#x27;t me my last.  </li>
            <li> Germ Fighter Synergy definitely has become part of my overall healing (one of many parts), and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Now they have a smaller bottle and higher price.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with any essential oils</li>
            <li> We had two bottles different sizes, potency/smell is consistent  </li>
            <li> and this product had identical ingredients, and smelled exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I am an essential oil newbie and this was my first purchase, in addition to a diffuser (Zaq).</li>
            <li> it does smell SLIGHTLY different, but it&#x27;s pretty close.  </li>
            <li> Scent is a little strong, but I just started with EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The blend is quite potent, and the price and quantity make this a bargain compared to Young Living&#x27;s Thieves or other similar makes.</li>
            <li> I made my own in the past and this smells just the same.</li>
            <li> This is just like Theives OIl that Young&#x27;s Living Oils sells only plant therapy is not an MLM and is MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li> I did considerable research when I first got into essential oils, and view Plant Therapy favorably as a result.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for thieves essential oil to make toothpaste, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the higher price that doTerra and Young Living charge.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and was looking for something reasonably priced and not part of a multi-level marketing company.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely DO NOT recommend this particular item for consumption or topical use with out significant dilution.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reading the reviews, I agree that this is a less expensive and most effective alternative to the thieves oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be okay for other applications as long as you want everything within 50 feet to smell like tart cinnamon.</li>
            <li> 100% pure essential oils</li>
            <li> I did muscle testing with it and seems to be a little light on clove, so I just add a drop of clove oil when I mix it with water and drink it.  </li>
            <li> I will save my money and buy the Young Living brand which uses only pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is pure and the same stuff as &amp;#34;Thieves.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more diluted, and the mix is a little different.</li>
            <li> highly recommend dilution starting with a low dilution because of the hot oils in it.</li>
            <li> It will clear your sinuses if you take a sniff.  </li>
            <li> I will put it in my wash water to clean the fridge, stove, countertops,showers to prevent any leftover germs from the previous folks.  </li>
            <li> The oil is clear and not pungent.</li>
            <li> I added some Evian water and a drop of carrier oil to Germ Fighter to make a spray, which I used around the house to clear the air during my husband&#x27;s flu.</li>
            <li> We did use it around our nose to help with congestion but it had a pretty good sting to it that made it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to clear my throat and try to cough up mucus.  </li>
            <li> Today, we have all clear from our physician.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after reading a review on the Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of this and Young Life&#x27;s &#x27;Thieves&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li> (wow)</li>
            <li> It is described as a knock off for Young Living&#x27;s Thieves and it missed the mark.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> We really like this essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li> It really is comparable to the thieves essential oil and at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> winter thus far</li>
            <li> She was very upset and distressed about going to her counter clerk job, being seen by public.</li>
            <li> - I mix it with almond oil and apply to the side of nostrils and sinus (also using it on skin tags - wow 2 days..</li>
            <li> Next time I will spend the money for the real deal.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for young kids!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> personally I think even the smell is too intense...</li>
            <li> My 4 year old began complaining one morning of a headache and stomach ache.  </li>
            <li> I applied more to his feet around noon, when he complained again, which was just before he vomited.  </li>
            <li> I will repeat the process today and again tonight as well, which I think will clear it up completely.</li>
            <li> soon.**UPDATE 3/11/15: I have since learned by contacting Plant Therapy that you should NOT USE this product on children UNDER 10 YRS OLD (by diffusing or diluted with a carrier oil).</li>
            <li> There is no information or warnings about that on the product or on the websites, which I believe there should be one if this is the case.**you should NOT USE this product on children UNDER 10 YRS OLD (by diffusing or diluted with a carrier oil).</li>
            <li> She said it really helped her with breathing especially at night as they have both dogs and cats in house!!!!</li>
            <li> I put this with water into my electric scent burner at home and in a busy dental office.</li>
            <li> I have both this oil and young living thieves oil and feel they both work well.</li>
            <li> I tried buying this product hoping it would be like the Young Living brand.  </li>
            <li> like the doterra or young living oils.  </li>
            <li> This Germ Fighter oil seemed to have the same ingredients and was comparable to the Thieves oil at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> So far, 4 flights, no colds.  </li>
            <li> I had been hearing about the brand this formula compares to (it starts with a T and is what you might call a band of robbers) for years on a parenting message board I frequent.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the oil comes out a bit fast.</li>
            <li> sensitive, little-people feet.  </li>
            <li> A bit sweeter...not quite as spicy as Young Living Thieves.  </li>
            <li> My brother has used it directly on his feet and says that it has helped clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li> The product did not TOUCH my skin, it was on a disk NEAR my skin.</li>
            <li> Beware if you will use this product near the skin, to inhale, etc.</li>
            <li> It smells just like thieves from Young Living Oil.....</li>
            <li> We have used the Young Living blend of Thieves for a couple years and this works just as well and is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> We have used Young Living products for years.  </li>
            <li> well to young living thieves oil.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the YL brand but can&#x27;t bring myself to drop that much for a 10ml bottle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as my young living thieves.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I was looking for an immune booster for my 1 year old daughter who kept getting colds all winter.</li>
            <li> It will burn if you get it on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I still prefer Thieves by Young Living.</li>
            <li> chemical/anti bacterial cleaners- since its natural germ fighter.</li>
            <li> I seem to have a sensitive immune system since chemo and decided to try Germ Fighter oil to help with allergies and colds.  </li>
            <li> Young Living Thieves and</li>
            <li> I do not use it for all the things I would use the other essential oil, but I do put it on my vacuume cleaner&#x27;s air filter and my light bulbs</li>
            <li> free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot).</li>
            <li> free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot).</li>
            <li> Having used Thieves Oil in the past, I was a little hesitant to change products, but this is just as good, if not a little cheaper than thieves oil.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day during this winter and the house smell fresh</li>
            <li> We purchased this as a replacement for the more expensive Thieves brand, influenced mostly by the previous reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> Use a few drops or so in a spray bottle &amp; add some distilled water to clean.</li>
            <li> I love to use germ fighter in our small diffuser in different areas around our home.  </li>
            <li> I did try it on myself after that, and it was not bad, just a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this oil is effective because my husband is military and around new Marines non stop as he is an instructor, and with that amount of people he brought home pretty much every cold and flu</li>
            <li> I just received the Germ Fighter the other day and right away I used it in our diffuser at home.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Germ Fighter for topical use (used in dilute form to disinfect a wound and a swollen gum) and to freshen/</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely be buying from Plant Therapy again and if they keep their standards/quality high</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality product that I&#x27;ll definitely buy again and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get some thieves oil from young living, but didn&#x27;t want to spend quite so much as I was just starting to dabble with essential</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t sell Young Living and generally refuse to buy from pyramid schemes in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also use in plugin diffuser with a few drops of orange essential oil for lovely scent like Constant Comment tea.</li>
            <li> I did lots of research on this one because I normally buy a different brand but</li>
            <li> , it is crossed out in red and right above it in red says 1.21 fl oz.</li>
            <li> Just judging from the taste, this seems like it is lesser quality and tastes as if it is almost purely some sort of lesser grade cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my 2 1/2 year old and 5 1/2 year old and their back was covered with hives.  </li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Germ Fighter is a very close comp to YL Thieves and I will not spend the extra $$ for YL in the future.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals but it is super harsh and basically all cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I just started using this little magic in a bottle, and for the first time - in a long time - I sense a little relief.</li>
            <li> I also used it on a dog bite on my hand that was hard to bandage, and the infection did seem to clear up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> As a single mom I really have to watch what I spend</li>
            <li> I know the ingredients are listed differently than on the young living thieves bottle which means the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; is different, but these are still all pure 100% essential oils.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, this really is an excellent sub for the much more expensive version that&#x27;s so expensive because it can only be purchased through a MLM scheme.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this oil in a sink full of warm water while washing my expensive cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> As strong in smell &amp; effectiveness as other more expensive essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li> The price seems a little high and has exactly the same ingredients and smell as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34;, so if you can find Thieves cheaper elsewhere, buy it.</li>
            <li> between this Germ Fighter blend and eucalyptus oil for when my older daughter gets a stuffy nose and RC (by Young Living) for when my younger daughter has a cough, our sickies have only lasted briefly.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say for sure that this oil is less potent/ effective as other companies, but I can say it has left me skeptical.</li>
            <li> I use this in a room diffuser, also in a general purpose cleaning spray.  </li>
            <li> Not sorry we lied, sorry we have cheap junk</li>
            <li> This essential oil blend is completely clear, and does not smell like the oils that are contained within.</li>
            <li> Smelled the same as Young Living Thieves although I tried to put it on my toothpaste and it tasted chemical (which I don&#x27;t get from YL).  </li>
            <li> I also purchase Young Living Thieves and if I compare the two the Germ Fighter oil is thinner consistency and has a different smell.  </li>
            <li> I order both Immune-Aid and Germ Fighter to use as a natural approach to turn against potential flu.</li>
            <li> were nearly gone by the next day.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to young living because I never used it, but I will definite continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> If the price difference were only 5 dollars I would probably purchase from young living</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that I can order direct and not through a multi-level marketing scheme which only serves to bump up the prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of the much lower price, I was somewhat skeptical about the quality of this product, but we use thieves for so many different things that I figured we should try it.</li>
            <li> It does have a slightly different aroma than Young Living or DoTERRA.</li>
            <li> I have used essential oils for years throu young living.</li>
            <li> This products smells, an tastes just like the young living theves essential oils</li>
            <li> I bought this Germ Fighter long into the sinus infection battle, mixed it with a carrier oil and used it on my sinuses, behind my ears and at the back of my head and neck and received good benefit.</li>
            <li> We were in the middle of flu season, so I started using a few drops in a crock pot full of water since I didn&#x27;t have a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to just know the story behind it.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 7 yr old son when he came down with a high fever and virus, all symptoms vanished in about 12 hrs!</li>
            <li> My massage therapist uses another brand, but I had been using a few of the other Plant Therapy essential oils (lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint) and was 100% satisfied with them, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> i use it when i&#x27;m getting sick, by putting some in a carrier oil and rubbing in my chest, etc, it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to rub on your chest.in a lotion if you think you&#x27;re getting sick</li>
            <li> I was trying to save money by not going with the more expensive essential oils and I highly regret it.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other &#x27;Thieves Oil&#x27; to compare it too (they cost way too much to even try), so I cannot help with that.</li>
            <li> The scent is very comparable to the other brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some serious sinus problems lasting months in spite of many alternative products being used and traditional medical treatment.  </li>
            <li> This is the same blend as Thieves, by Young Living, but at a fraction of the price (30ml of Thieves will likely cost you over $80!).</li>
            <li> Kind of nostalgic actually, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it from the oils blended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help clear the air in our home after so many have been so ill this spring.</li>
            <li> I would have a cup of black tea first thing in the morning with three drops of this essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li> not exactly the same as Thieves Oil, but much cheaper</li>
            <li> I purchased this as it had the same ingredients as the more expensive Young Living Thieves&#x27; oil.  </li>
            <li> I am going to keep using this at night in our diffuser to see how it works in the long run since my son - who is 6 yrs old - seems to pick up all of the germs and sickness that he comes across at school.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops into hot water to help relieve sinus pain</li>
            <li> I use a few drops in my floor vents daily to keep the house safe and germ free during cold and flu season as we have an immune suppressed member of the family on chemo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with the other brands that are a similar blend, but when I diffused this oil, I could smell it in my whole upper level of my house.  </li>
            <li> We are buying a new house that had cats and has been closed up for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> It smells strongly of cinnamon which can be irritating</li>
            <li> I believe that it will probably work well to naturally fight germs and viruses, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t smell just like Thieves, which is half of the reason I love that blend!</li>
            <li> Thieves Oil (I&#x27;ve always been annoyed at how over-priced that oil blend is, and now I can purchase at a reasonable price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Plant Therapy Essential Oils ;)</li>
            <li> They smell absolutely identical and my friend is so envious that I paid so much less for what appears to be the same thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, we had a mold problem, and this stuff is obviously not as high quality as the Thieves we bought from Young Living for the problem.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a little less of a cinnamon scent than the original.</li>
            <li> (But I also try to eat right - no processed sugar and very little other sugars, no wheat/gluten, lots of whole, unprocessed foods, etc.)</li>
            <li> Not too bad and good value.</li>
            <li> My brother was about to take a few ibuprofen for a broken tooth, but I stopped him and had him rinse his mouth with warm water and 5 drops of this oil.</li>
            <li> after she got sweaty and her fever went to down to normal and didn&#x27;t come back anymore</li>
            <li> I am putting it in my rainbow vacuum to diffuse it into the air, but I def will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Usually when I go to bed with that gritty, dry eye, I&#x27;ll wake up with an eye infection that full blown pink eye.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am slightly mystified by the new label on the 30ml bottle, however.  </li>
            <li> This is somewhat different from the usual that I buy, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I only rated the item 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if the product is working, or the weather change has made the difference.</li>
            <li> When our local natural shop burned down, I was at a loss to find a place to get my oils.  </li>
            <li> My road to recovery from long-term black mold exposure and MCS syndrome has been considerably shortened by essential oils</li>
            <li> Last year, fall and winter were rough as far as illnesses go--stomach flu, pink eye, and</li>
            <li> We looked for a long time for affordable essential oils.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with instructions of how to use, or instructions of what all it was good for and how to use the product.  </li>
            <li> You can use it directly in a lesion( it stings a little, but it goes away in minutes) or mix it with coconut oil or any cream with glycerine for larger areas.</li>
            <li> I have several other essential oils that sit on my bathroom counter for use several times a week.</li>
            <li> You also will likely find the reviews for other products I use with my essential oils such as rollerballs, carrier oils, inhalers, carrying cases, diffiusers, etc.</li>
            <li> You also will likely find the reviews for other products I use with my essential oils such as rollerballs, carrier oils, inhalers, carrying cases, diffiusers, etc.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it isn&#x27;t bad either, maybe just not my personal preference.</li>
            <li> A couple drops in the toilet tanks.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> Ginger is an often overlooked nasty germ fighter in its own right</li>
            <li> I AM NOT SURE ABOUT OTHER PETS, BUT PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR VET FIRST.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical about whole \\&quot;EO therapy\\&quot;, and this blend in particular that it can help  to fight flu/germs, but decided to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how high quality the oil is,</li>
            <li> I used it on my son and his cold went away pretty quickly, which is typical.</li>
            <li> I love this blend; it is comparable to Young Living&#x27;s &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34;, but much less expensive!</li>
            <li> We will use more often as we get into cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> , use it  mixed with coconut oil for oil pulling (excellent results btw), every morning I put a few drops of this under my tongue , Nobody in my household got sick all winter!!  </li>
            <li> Will keep in my house for the cold &amp; flu season :)</li>
            <li> also make sure to use this oil in the diffuser if one of us has a cold or congestion</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, cant comment on wether it works or not yet as just started using it on son (one drop on soles of feet and socks) to try get him over a cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young living distributor, but, I&#x27;ve been on a budget tighter than usual recently.</li>
            <li> I have used both Young Living and DoTerra in the past and will be switching back.</li>
            <li> Although, that said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend consuming a bunch of it, but in my case, this problem had gone on for a long time and was not healing</li>
            <li> I add about 5 drops to a glass of purified water and keep it in your mouth for as long as you can - dip your dental floss in that water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Young Living Thieves by any means</li>
            <li> and I can drink this all day long.  </li>
            <li> It knocked the heck out of a long cold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He was still clearly not feeling well at bedtime when I applied it to his feet again.  </li>
            <li> I do know that my son, who has horrible allergies, actually LOVED the smell of it - and normally he hates any types of fragrances -</li>
            <li> Combine this with lemon juice and warm waterwheel coming down with a cold.</li>
            <li> I used it on myself last night for an infection that was starting around my wisdom tooth area, it was swollen all the way down my glands on the side of my throat.</li>
            <li> I also bought a less expensive oil diffuser here on amazon that I&#x27;ve really love</li>
            <li> Less expensive and more of it.</li>
            <li> I mean it takes the illness away fast.</li>
            <li> I used a diffuser, and it makes the house smell nice, but as far as any other benefits, I am still doubtful</li>
            <li> Other brands might have it going by the name of Thieves or something similar.</li>
            <li> They were excited to have an alternative to the outrageously expensive pyramid line.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not exactly like Thieves Oil, it has similar characteristics and merits.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy any other essential oil, but this one!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has the ingredients of the thieves oil that other companies sell, under various names.</li>
            <li> He did get a runny nose for several days, but never ran a fever or had to stay home like other kids did.  </li>
            <li> that was due to a standard medical procedure that I due for.  </li>
            <li> I am also trying it on a plantars wart that I have tried every other treatment possible on.  </li>
            <li> We heard another friend was using the product mixed with carrier oil for her little girl, who had similar symptoms(even though she lived almost 2,000 miles away).</li>
            <li> Other than that, I didn&#x27;t find the odor pleasing enough to use in a diffuser, but I am going to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Other companies have a similar blend called &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Four Thieves&amp;#34; which is meant for immunity.</li>
            <li> I had only one this year and it didn&#x27;t last very long and one round of antibiotic took care of it.  </li>
            <li> No grittiness or dry feeling at all</li>
            <li> That oil was much too expensive, so I found this and tried it with a diffuser plugged into the wall near the mold area.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops everyday in a diffuser and both bottles lasted me the whole fall/winter season.</li>
            <li> A few days later I smelled the bottle again to test &amp; same thing.  </li>
            <li> but it was slow gains each day - not one day rattling and next day clear.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle, not the small bottle that essential oils usually come in</li>
            <li> wow, what a difference in the smell of air (it still tends to get musty after a few days without the window being opened)!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of my first time drinking poor quality whiskey.</li>
            <li> Turn the heat down on low.  </li>
            <li> Slightly clove-y and cinnamon-y compared to medieval mix</li>
            <li> The past few nights of diffusing it, it seems that my son and I both are sleeping much deeper</li>
            <li> I woke up with slight stuffiness/sinus congestion and put Germ Fighter in my diffuser, stood over it and breathed about 10 deep breaths...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a less expensive option to &amp;#34;young living theives&amp;#34; and though I don&#x27;t like it as much as the young living version, it fits the bill!</li>
            <li> Good for gums and bad breath!</li>
            <li> about other uses and tired it mixed with hot water and a mop in the bathroom and kitchen, a few drops goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I will try to mix with some vanilla or similar to mellow it out a little.   </li>
            <li> There was a little oil left on my fingers and when I rubbed my face the oil spread there</li>
            <li> I use it mixed with a little olive oil (carrier oil) and put that mixture on the oil burner I have.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and none of us have gotten sick since I started using it!!</li>
            <li> I rinse with a drop or two of this mixed in water at least twice a day after brushing, and it drastically reduces the white buildup on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and the cold&#x27;s that they both had (complete with a very productive runny nose)</li>
            <li> this cold wow, was too much.</li>
            <li> It was just as I expected</li>
            <li> On the skin, it was excruciating, and left behind very red swollen welts that were similar to a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops are used at a time so it should last a while using every day.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my hand soap for a boost of extra goodness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also put a few drops in my dishwasher, but considering that I usually run it on the sanitation cycle, I don&#x27;t do that anymore as that is pretty much redundant.</li>
            <li> THIS PARTICULAR BLEND IS EQUAL TO THIEVES ESSENTIAL BLEND OIL, BUT LESS EXPENSIVE ---</li>
            <li> Another child of mine had a sore throat/cough a few weeks later and this worked for him also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it made me so nauseous that I had to empty it out of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> The bottle was wrapped carefully in bubble wrap and had no breakages or leakages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has practically healed in only a few applications with no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> The slow leak over the course of 7 years finally made itself known by the paint along side the 4 X 6 foot mirror starting to bubble ...</li>
            <li> I decided to seek out some oils that are less expensive and see if I could find the same quality - thieves vs. germ fighter, germ fighter wins, hands down.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been sick since using it and it smells okay too.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this blend and have been using it on my kids feet when they started to get sick.  </li>
            <li> Many people were getting sick in the office.</li>
            <li> Also we have been around some sick folks and we have remained well:)</li>
            <li> this one is not strong enough smell.  </li>
            <li> It is not as dark or as thick as the other brand, but you get twice as much for way less.  </li>
            <li> I only use half or less  from this brand.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and was excited to give it a try when a felt a cold coming on.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried Thieves Oil because I think it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, whereas this is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very very close to thieves product - which I found was TOO expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few 4 Thieves-type blends from other vendors and have never experienced a reaction, and certainly nothing remotely close to the agony this brand caused me.</li>
            <li> and the other took 6 days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to experiment with other uses for it.</li>
            <li> Still \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and not chemical-y, just sharp.</li>
            <li> The Germ fighter synergy essential oil blend has been used on small cuts on my arm and legs.</li>
            <li> Anything other than their feet you will want to dilute with a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> So we all skipped the flu and other stuff that people like to share each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a breast cancer patient dealing with sinus issues - combined with evolving double vision - for the past 7 months.</li>
            <li> It smells just like the expensive stuff and seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> DUE</li>
            <li> I am going to try it diluted in a spray-bottle and see how that works out, and maybe adding some other oils.    </li>
            <li> I have used other &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; (we add to our homemade tooth cleaning mixture).  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff during cold and flu season!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this oil in the past and I will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product, delivered via small atomizer (5-8 drops in 1 oz liquid) directed to the back of his throat, eliminated his sore throat in 24 hours.</li>
            <li> have since used it with several drops in a small spray bottle for sanitizing kitchen countertops and surfaces.</li>
            <li> However, I do like the other Plant Therapy oils that I have and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;ve been using it, my 2 year old&#x27;s daycare has had several bouts of the cough and cold spread around, and he was the only one to remain somewhat unscathed.  </li>
            <li> It kills germs for colds, flu and other sicknesses</li>
            <li> but the other scents are stronger in it.</li>
            <li> the following morning I did not hear any mucus rattling in his chest which is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a YL distributor and I&#x27;m always apprehensive ordering other brands</li>
            <li> Comparable to other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used any other version of thieves-type blend, so I have no comparison to make.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A few drops of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (admittingly this blend has a stronger cinnamon oil ratio than some other &amp;#34;theives&amp;#34; blends).</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers mentioned it had a sharper aroma then</li>
            <li> that other family members have had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE (Jan 23 2013) - somehow, we have avoided the constant illnesses that have plagued us in past winters.  </li>
            <li> it is not exactly the thieves oil blend.</li>
            <li> - my husband has gum issues and are anxious to see if it made a difference at his next periodontic appointment.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and have gone back to making my own.  </li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t get my husband on the bandwagon, and he&#x27;s the only one is out household (me, him, a 2 year old and a 9 month old) to get sick since we&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> When he awoke the next morning, he was completely and totally his normal self - as if he had not been sick at all!  </li>
            <li> be very careful when using it.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful and do not store around children or pets.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Thieves and would be very curious to compare the two.  </li>
            <li> Just be very careful to cover the area you used it on and wash your hands</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually not pure oil, it&#x27;s cut with other cheap oils, and I believe probably also some synthetic to make it burn that bad.</li>
            <li> Although the company would not necessarily recommend this, I have also placed a drop of it on my finger and rubbed it onto the roof of my mouth and also along the upper gum line on the one side where my sinus problem was worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be an acceptable substitute for the expensive Young Living Thieves oil, for daily use in a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I just dab half a dozen drops on the leftover cotton from my supplements and attached it to my mini fan with a rubber band (carefully so the rubber band doesn&#x27;t get hit by the fan blades).  </li>
            <li> I got this Germ Fighter essential oil blend as a stand-in for Thieves oil from Young Living, which is SO expensive.  </li>
            <li> and we don&#x27;t get sick easily.</li>
            <li> Once mixed with a carrier oil or with purified water for a room spray it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> After some leaked on the lid the oil was really sticky and nasty, pure essential oils are not sticky.</li>
            <li> but I have been free of any bad symptoms for around two (2) years.  </li>
            <li> I know that this stuff is supposed to be great, but I just can&#x27;t get past the awful smell.</li>
            <li> In any event, it helps the air to smell fresh without strong-smelling chemicals and potentially dangerous ones.  </li>
            <li> I take a small spice jar and put a few drops on a facial pad (can also use cotton ball)</li>
            <li> I bought the real Thieves and it works as claimed, and I still have this fake stuff because I didn&#x27;t want to bother Amazon for a few dollars and technically it was my mistake because I didn&#x27;t read the small print.</li>
            <li> Really nothing close to thieves from Young Living :(</li>
            <li> It really helped when my family became ill.</li>
            <li> Second, my symptoms have slowly been diminishing since I started using the oil.</li>
            <li> It is much closer to Thieves than the Doterra product and less expensive as well.  </li>
            <li> We use this when we start feeling like we are coming down with a bug</li>
            <li> Not watered down.</li>
            <li> I have been putting the diluted solution on her feet in the mornings and also diffusing it in her room when she seems like she&#x27;s coming down with something.</li>
            <li> she hasn&#x27;t come down with any illnesses.</li>
            <li> The swelling went way down and stopped hurting both days</li>
            <li> i need to put 8 drops in the water but still not very strong scent at all.</li>
            <li> It smells just like the Thieves oil and costs less.</li>
            <li> I was not real pleased with the diffuser I bought</li>
            <li> Typically it&#x27;d take a week or so</li>
            <li> but I have to admit it costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> This bottle is twice the size for half the price.</li>
            <li> Twice a day I put the oil on a bandaid and within about 2 weeks, the wart turned black and fell out.</li>
            <li> or less of Dawn detergent and about 8-9 drops of this oil.</li>
            <li> This seems to work just as well, does seem to have less cloves in it.</li>
            <li> Nine times out of ten it never turns into anything serious.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; blend, but less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be comparable and costs much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Thieves Oil for some time and came across this product at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Less than two minutes my head cleared.  </li>
            <li> Smells slightly sweeter than thieves.  </li>
            <li> This one works just as well and costs a lot less.  </li>
            <li> I started coming down with my first cold of the fall season.</li>
            <li> It is high quality but cheaper than that expensive brand you see online.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully the effect didn&#x27;t take as long to heal, but unfortunately, I was not the only one in my family to experience this effect.</li>
            <li> I agree that it smells a little like Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It also smells a little like what I remember hospitals and dental offices</li>
            <li> I was using it on soles of feet, as a tea and swabbing it on mouth sore and throat with no significant results.</li>
            <li> It burned his mouth a little because of the potency but it worked wonders for him.</li>
            <li> I ADD A LITTLE OIL TO MY WARMER AND THE SENT FILLS THE ROOM.</li>
            <li> I have three elementary-age children and they are prone to little ailments that require attention.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like christmas/ cinnamon rolls.</li>
            <li> so I decided to look for thieves oil as alternative read a little about it</li>
            <li> I add 5 drops to my little diffuser before bed each night</li>
            <li> Smells a little like cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Rubbed it on the soles of his feet and a little beside his nose, on the temples and over his eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a little spray bottle by the sink for fruits, veggies, and our dish sponge.</li>
            <li> This has been my little germ-fighting helper.  </li>
            <li> I had read that this was a less expensive alternative to Young Living&#x27;s Thieves.</li>
            <li> Two of the oils in this blend are cinnamon and clove, very dark, pungent spices.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already helped my son and I get over a cold FAST, inadvertently removed a skin tag I&#x27;ve had forever in this process and got me over mastitis without antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get an excessive buildup behind my lower front teeth, and even on my braces, because I have a lot of saliva, apparently.  </li>
            <li> Also putting it in a carrier oil and rubbing it on my throat, around ears and forehead during the cold really seemed to help lessen the symptoms...also rubbed it on my feet during that time.</li>
            <li> I really feel like during a cold</li>
            <li> Germ Fighter was too much for my cold.</li>
            <li> When one of use is fighting a virus we diffuse, diffuse, diffuse, and also rub a few drops on the bottom of our feet.</li>
            <li> This blend is way too heavy on the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I place a few drops on a cotton ball every night, just under the air intake on my cpap machine.</li>
            <li> I put some on my clothes everyday before going to work.  </li>
            <li> I keep this in a spray bottle diluted with water and spray my bedroom and sheets everyday.</li>
            <li> I am using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste the product</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN MY HOME EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> story short, the mold in and on the wall behind the mirror and on the backside and bottom of vanity cabinet was unreal ...</li>
            <li> I placed the crock pot in the living room with a few drops of Germ Fighter oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also put a few drops in the humidifier in his room.  </li>
            <li> For example my husband &amp; my three kiddos (7, 5, 2) all get a red skin reaction when I put it on neat (no carrier oil) behind their ears.</li>
            <li> At the onset of a sore throat I mix a few drops of this with a carrier oil and put on throat and feet.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money buying again.</li>
            <li> Just added a few drops to that recipe</li>
            <li> I put  a few drops into my bath water along with some lavender and bergamot oil.</li>
            <li> Also, you&lt;br /&gt;can put a pot of water on the stove with a few drops of this oil.  </li>
            <li> i added a few drops to my deo</li>
            <li> Will be using it when we head to Disney World in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also used used it in the oil diffuser in a Vicks humidifier in his room for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have successfully killed odors/germs in our kitchen drains by putting a few drops in the drain.</li>
            <li> and I use it on a wide variety of issues, including the common colds, skin issues, bug bites and sores.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in boiling water and inhale the vapors.  </li>
            <li> (Also put a few drops in an oil warmer in the room.)</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of this in 4 ounces of coconut oil to do oil pulling.  </li>
            <li> Place a few drops in pot of boiling water and steam the house.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or cloying.</li>
            <li> few drops diluted in water and used as Mouthwash and (e) as well apply on skin with Dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I made a cleaning spray with this and added a few drops to the humidifier.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my organic liquid soap and spray cleaners, in my wash and in distilled water for a throat spray.</li>
            <li> and I rubbed few drops in her feet, covered her with blanket and 40 min</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in the humidifier cup and infused it through the house -</li>
            <li> I place a few drops in an carrier oil and have it diffuse into the air.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> The screen is not huge like a computer, but that&#x27;s never been a problem before.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less than the doctor&#x27;s co-pay!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more expensive than it should be, sorry we have abrasive cinnamon that burns and could seriously hurt a child.</li>
            <li> Already used half the bottle, time to reorder!</li>
            <li> They attend public school and will inevitably come home every once in a while with the start of a cold (small cough, or sniffle, etc).  </li>
            <li> Use this in a diffuser when I&#x27;m feeling the need to relax, detox, or just plain amuse myself.  </li>
            <li> I used it to make lotion bars, and we put it in our kids&#x27; humidifiers in place of plain eucalyptus oil.</li>
            <li> I was very sick when I got the oil, so the jury is still out as to it&#x27;s effectiveness in keeping me healthy.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to mess with something that seems to be working!</li>
            <li> It was red and infected and very painful on the first day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I was looking for an oil that was the same quality as Thieves but less expensive.  </li>
            <li> He hardly got sick at all, and he just recovered so quickly.  </li>
            <li> but there is a kind of nasty aroma which makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> Even when diluted with vitamin e or other neutral oils, this burns so much when I put it in my mouth and tastes so horrible that I simply couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> My mom was complaining of her basement office smelly stale and moldy - I put a few drops of this oil and some distilled water in a amber glass spray bottle and sprayed it everywhere - the mold smell is still gone days later!</li>
            <li> Carry this everywhere especially during cold and flu season when going to be in crowds or closed in spaces.  </li>
            <li> A few drops on the bottoms of the feet, the chest and/or neck at the first sign of a cold and you are set!</li>
            <li> I phoned the company and spoke with a lady who couldn&#x27;t have cared less about my complaint.</li>
            <li> All was going well, until about 30 second later, when he started screaming bloody murder and kicking his little feet all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I used it with coconut oil as a carrier on his feet to clear up his lingering cold.  </li>
            <li> It worked, no more mold</li>
            <li> I keep a small spray bottle of this in my purse.</li>
            <li> and the sore throat is usually gone within a day or two,</li>
            <li> Never met a plant therapy oil I did not love.</li>
            <li> I am prone to Respiratory infections and usually have 3-6 between Sept and March.  </li>
            <li> Which I am entirely to lazy to do.</li>
            <li> When I replied to the company with what I wrote here their only reply was \\&quot;sorry</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t want this stuff to just go to waste!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> no more problem</li>
            <li> Rubbed a few drops on bottom of my feet twice a day and all my symptoms were gone within a day!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to usually write reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have used Thieves oil in the past.  </li>
            <li> not sure was it coincidence or not, but when I sprayed (filtered water with 10 drops of blend, I don&#x27;t even have diffuser yet)</li>
            <li> I am not sure just what to do with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about its effectiveness yet...</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and found a study on the \\&quot;Thieves\\&quot; oil, which showed it helped to stop or at least slow down mold growth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee this product is the reason, but I used this faithfully last year, along with the same company&#x27;s immunity blend and a lot of common sense, and my children never got as sick as the kids they were around.</li>
            <li> It really seems to help me fend off illness, or if I forget to use it until I am sick, it shortens my illness.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps keep us from getting sick.</li>
            <li> I had my first night&#x27;s sleep in a long time without horrible post nasal drip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sick around sick people!</li>
            <li> Even with a house full of sick kids and a sick wife, I didn&#x27;t catch it while using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> Of course hard to tell if it is fighting germs because how can you see and measure that...</li>
            <li> but the smell is hard to avoid.</li>
            <li> I got a bad case of strep throat around Thanksgiving and sprayed it directly onto my tonsils every time it started to hurt for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I tried using this in one of the commonly suggested ways, as an aid to fighting gum and tooth infection.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s late December).</li>
            <li> Use a diffuser or dilute at least 1-5 with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> at least I haven&#x27;t got any yet.  </li>
            <li> looking forward to using it during cold and flu season later this year.</li>
            <li> The day I started to use Germ Fighter is the day my cold left!</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been sick and I work at a YMCA and am around a lot of people.</li>
            <li> and I have not been sick so far.  </li>
            <li> I work with young children and have not been sick this year.  </li>
            <li> Saw a 1 star review where user said she used it on get small children!</li>
            <li> This summer is the first time I&#x27;m experimenting with it as a mosquito repellent, mixing it with distilled water and witch hazel in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had bought the DoTerra version of this and when I ran out I looked for something less expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a less expensive Thieves oil.  </li>
            <li> Have not had a single cold all winter.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for my mold problem, thieves is just too expensive and you get so little of it.</li>
            <li> TO THE BITTER COLD AND ALL THE SNOW.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been sick a day since using this essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still the only person not to be sick this season and have recommended Plant Therapy&#x27;s Germ Fighter Synergy oil to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> He woke up sick with a fever of 102 last Saturday morning.  </li>
            <li> Last year they were sick all the time.  </li>
            <li> My mother in-law was the one who introduced me to the product when my daughter got sick last year.</li>
            <li> He only got sick to his stomach the one time.  </li>
            <li> and I have only had one sick day this year - and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used I never have a hard time doing that!</li>
            <li> Wash your hands after because it is not pleasant to get this in your eye by accident, or your lips.</li>
            <li> I have not caught that nasty cold that do many of my co workers have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several products from Plant Therapy, none of them have disappointed me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my weapons of defense when someone starts coming down with a cold or flu.</li>
            <li> My husband wasn&#x27;t using the oil and came down with a cold a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I use this in a diffuser if I am coming down with a cold.  </li>
            <li> I am normally sick all winter long.  </li>
            <li> no one expected it to be so bad, and I started reacting severely as soon as the mold spores went airborne.</li>
            <li> We were without dental insurance for 15 months &amp; during that time I had a couple of broken fillings that exposed a nerve....</li>
            <li> This stuff helped prevented it from settling in and decreased the length</li>
            <li> My daughter is getting over a nasty infection and thanks to this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be confused as I was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on pulse points behind my ears, on wrists and bottom of feet.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know the story behind the Four Thieves I recommend you read it</li>
            <li> I use it everyday during cold and flu season</li>
            <li> short, our little girl got sick from some BAD bug going around at the time.</li>
            <li> So far, this winter, I have not been sick at all, not even a cold.  </li>
            <li> and I did not get one single cold!  </li>
            <li> This year was a bad flu season and lots of other bugs going around too.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible sinus problems that have ultimately led me to 2 sinus surgeries over the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> It helped my chest cold move out a lot faster than usual.  </li>
            <li> In the past it takes me over a week to get rid of a cold.  </li>
            <li> No more cold,</li>
            <li> If you use it on your skin, it is always recommended that you put one or two drops in a base like jojoba oil, lotion, etc., and never directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bad ass and knock you down.</li>
            <li> I have a bad tooth and when it flared up, I soaked a swab and held it on the tooth for less than a minute</li>
            <li> only wish I had found out about it and bought it &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; I got this really bad cold that is going around.  </li>
            <li> Add it to teas for added health benefits and cut down on sick time.  </li>
            <li> As a proactive measure and of course when someone gets a little sick.</li>
            <li> and I think it has saved us from getting sick a few times.</li>
            <li> Not sure if bottle is bad or not, can&#x27; return it.</li>
            <li> My kids were sick and it seems to have cut down on the length of the cold.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere to try thieves oil &amp; found this on Amazon as an alternative to the expensive name brand.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The T. brand was incredibly expensive and I wanted to try a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; to see what the fuss was all about.</li>
            <li> but man was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical...</li>
            <li> I was given antibiotics for fungus weird rash on the bottom of my daughter&#x27;s foot</li>
            <li> and you cant go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my OnGuard ran out and it is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it though.</li>
            <li> the Thieves Oil is so expensive in name brand.  </li>
            <li> whatever was making me ill in my home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with COPD and for about 15 or so years have been sick at least twice a year with bronchitis or pneumonia and have been on allot of antibiotics.</li>
            <li> Our little girl had been sick for days by this point, but overnight and within 24 hours she was HEALED!</li>
            <li> My co-worker had a nasty cold all holiday season long; stuffed nose, scratchy throat, and a triple cough every 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> have two small children, so have put this oil in my diffuser throughout the winter months and it may just be a coincidence, but nobody has been sick!</li>
            <li> So for that reason, it was disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter got a cold sore that was well underway when she came home from sleepover at friends.</li>
            <li> I just reordered for this coming cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> I like to ingest a couple drops and apply it to my feet to help with a cold.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist uses this when she has a cold to keep her clients from being infected.  </li>
            <li> I almost hope cold season gets here soon</li>
            <li> Apply to the bottom of the feet when you feel the beginnings of a cold.</li>
            <li> the cold.</li>
            <li> I diffuse it, use it in my laundry and make inhalers for the cold and flu season.  </li>
            <li> In my household, with the crazy flu going around we all use this oil.  </li>
            <li> The cold was gone.  </li>
            <li> Then my cold often goes into a sinus infection.  </li>
            <li> Have used this with shea butter to rub on the bottom of our feet when we get a cold and diluted in a spray bottle for an air freshener.</li>
            <li> and I must say, when he suffers from a sinus headache, it has helped him every time.</li>
            <li> and we often diffuse it at night to help sleep and keep the cold bugs at bay.</li>
            <li> I put it on the air filters on the furnace in the winter to help spread it throughout the house and kill those cold germs.  </li>
            <li> i do, however, have a wood stove that i fire up now and then during cold winter months, and i have kettle with water boiling non-stop on the stove, serving purpose as humidifier per se, so</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT USED IN DIFFUSER IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR CATS.  </li>
            <li> I believe it shorten my cold and prevented the rest of my family from getting it.</li>
            <li> had a cold that was kicking my butt.</li>
            <li> The cold started in Dec. 2014 and continued until Feb. 2015.</li>
            <li> , you never know when the cold bug will raise</li>
            <li> We have 5 in our house hold and since she has started using this, she is the only one who hasn&#x27;t gotten sick with this nasty cold!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you can go wrong!</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> But for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I had something unpleasant during usage.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the YL oil, but it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> We have used Thieves for years for our teeth, but it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used very expensive \\&quot;Thieves</li>
            <li> smells heavenly.......but VERY EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad.</li>
            <li> but I had a bad reaction to this oil,  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad thing...</li>
            <li> I also get really bad nasal polyps.</li>
            <li> It was so bad they had to pop the thumb.  </li>
            <li> She still got a bad virus with a fever about a week after we started using it.  </li>
            <li> also tried it on a painful, ingrown toenail that my son had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been around people with colds, even coughing in my face (grrrr), but I have not gotten sick.</li>
            <li> kids are sick everywhere.</li>
            <li> I was using it on the soles of my feet as everyone around me was getting sick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mid-January and they haven&#x27;t been sick at all.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my kids feet when they are sick.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends have been sick for weeks.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use 4-5 drops in a glass of water when we are feeling sick or run-down...</li>
            <li> use it each time people are sick around me.</li>
            <li> My family has not gotten sick since using this product.</li>
            <li> When or if he gets sick again with allergies (allergy season is coming) or something from school, I will try it with a carrier oil on his feet</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve made it through the winter without getting sick.  </li>
            <li> I started using it even before I was feeling sick, and I still got sick.</li>
            <li> I purchased to use on airplanes, as I somehow manage to get sick after flying.  </li>
            <li> the taste was in my mouth and my stomach felt sick.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, we have 2 in daycare, and they are always sick.  </li>

            <li> when I think I&#x27;m getting sick.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is working for the purpose intended, but I&#x27;m going to keep using and hope I don&#x27;t get sick.</li>
            <li> Others here at work keep getting sick</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten sick since using this blend, which is about 6 months</li>
            <li> I put it in pots of water when I start to feel sick.</li>
            <li> I use the product a lot during the winter, when we have been out and about, and when we are sick.</li>

            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> and he was over the cold within 4 days!</li>
            <li> I seem to have fewer problems with congestion and keeping my fingers crossed-not a cold since!</li>
            <li> It is so annoying.  </li>
            <li> It helped heal it and the taste wasn&#x27;t bad either!</li>
            <li> I work in a dr office and we see 50 patients a day plus their families and since i started using this at night i have not been sick once!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get sick at all!  </li>
            <li> No one from our family got sick during the flu and colds !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, they said therapeutic oils in the description</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful.</li>
            <li> they were all etched and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Smell is terrible and does not seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never done it this way, it tastes awful for about 30 seconds</li>

            <li> It was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We put this on our sleep masks sometimes as we alternate the type of oil we use there.  This has nice fragrance, although it seems to be heavy on the clove side.  We will use more often as we get into cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> I agree that it smells a little like Christmas.  It also smells a little like what I remember hospitals and dental offices smelled like when I was a kid.  So it&#x27;s like a Christmasy hospital.  It will clear your sinuses if you take a sniff.  I had mixed opinions when I first got it but now I have decided I like it.  No complaints from the family when I use it.  It smells clean.  I detect the eucalyptus and a touch of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> We use this daily and it works!!!!  Good product!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Use it to make my own hand sanitizer without chemicals or alcohol.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this better than the Young Living Thieves oil.</li>
            <li> always great product and fast shipment, very happy, highly recommend seller</li>
            <li> I think this works. It&#x27;s flu season--kids are sick everywhere. Church family has been hit. Not me! Is this because I I place a drop on my forehead and wrists??? I feel great and will continue to use this product. Thanks</li>
            <li> So happy to find a quality product with an affordable price! Was also looking for an alternative to soy-thrilled to find healthy products! :)</li>
            <li> Good product - great price</li>
            <li> Terrific price and service!</li>
            <li> Smells good but haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> Excellent service and the essential oil is very nice.  I would like to compare it with Thieves Oil to see just how similar/dissimilar they are. I was very sick when I got the oil, so the jury is still out as to it&#x27;s effectiveness in keeping me healthy.</li>
            <li> I know that this stuff is supposed to be great, but I just can&#x27;t get past the awful smell. It&#x27;s really bad. If you use it when you and everyone in your house has a stuffed up nose, it might be tolerable then.</li>
            <li> I did not like this blend at all. I have mixed this blend myself and it is one of my favorite blends, but this companies blend smelled off.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product, great price! I was using Thieves oil which I also love, however due to how pricey it is, I had to be frugal with it. I came across the Plant Therapy Germ Fighter and after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. Most often I use the product in a diffuser, my kids also love the smell. When one of use is fighting a virus we diffuse, diffuse, diffuse, and also rub a few drops on the bottom of our feet. Product smells great and quality is comparable to the pricier alternative, so no need for frugality! :)</li>
            <li> Since I have never tried any oils before, I have nothing to compare this too, but it smells good and seems to help with my stuffy nose when its being used in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice now and I really enjoy the benefits from it. I do believe it is definitely a germ fighter! Other brands might have it going by the name of Thieves or something similar. I have not tried other brands because most are out of my price range. Plant Therapy offers a good price for what appears to be a very effective and strong germ fighter. I&#x27;ve had some serious sinus problems lasting months in spite of many alternative products being used and traditional medical treatment.  I bought this Germ Fighter long into the sinus infection battle, mixed it with a carrier oil and used it on my sinuses, behind my ears and at the back of my head and neck and received good benefit. I like the smell of it. It is a blend of 5 essential oils. Although the company would not necessarily recommend this, I have also placed a drop of it on my finger and rubbed it onto the roof of my mouth and also along the upper gum line on the one side where my sinus problem was worse. It helped heal it and the taste wasn&#x27;t bad either! Although, that said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend consuming a bunch of it, but in my case, this problem had gone on for a long time and was not healing so I felt it was time to take further measures and when I did, it began to heal much faster than it had been. This is a product I would like to have on hand at all times because it has so many uses.</li>
            <li> More cinnamon in this than thieves oil, but I used it all winter during flu season and didn&#x27;t get the flu. It is a pleasant smell and I actually got compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as it had the same ingredients as the more expensive Young Living Thieves&#x27; oil.  I love it.  I put it in an oil burner and use it every day.</li>
            <li> My road to recovery from long-term black mold exposure and MCS syndrome has been considerably shortened by essential oils and I am so glad to have discovered this company since it was recommended by a wonderful FB feed that I follow.</li>
            <li> Great price, however, it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as other essential oil brands. The smell also goes away really fast, which makes me think it&#x27;s not as pure.</li>
            <li> i liked the oil. I mixed it with coconut oil and use it as a lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li> I prefer Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil, but you get a nice big bottle of what Plant Therapy calls &amp;#34;Germ Fighter,&amp;#34; which contains basically the same ingredients of thieves oil. The order of ingredients is different from Thieves. I prefer the top ingredient to be cloves, rather than lemon. I also prefer more cinnamon. Here&#x27;s an ingredient comparison:&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Germ fighter: lemon, clove, eucalyptus, cinnamon and rosemary&lt;br /&gt;Young Living Thieves: clove, lemon, cinnamon, eucalyptus, and rosemary&lt;br /&gt;Note: Young Living also is more specific about the oils than Plant Therapy because they list the botanical names, while Plant Therapy does not.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been sick a day since using this essential oil.  It smells great too and really a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This is one of my weapons of defense when someone starts coming down with a cold or flu. I put it in my diffuser 24/7 and also dilute with a carrier oil and rub on feet and chest! Company is fantastic, ships fast and protected well.</li>
            <li> Great product and is as described! My son&#x27;s have been much healthier and I believe this is part of the reason!</li>
            <li> Ordered this after reading a review on the Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil. I was using it on the soles of my feet as everyone around me was getting sick. I&#x27;m still the only person not to be sick this season and have recommended Plant Therapy&#x27;s Germ Fighter Synergy oil to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Very potent product.  Received it fast.  I ordered 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Love this for everything...</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Perfect for this time of the year &amp; it is a fraction of the cost of the competitior.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my sinuses.  Good buy.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Not as good at the Thieves I was trying to replace.  I do not use it for all the things I would use the other essential oil, but I do put it on my vacuume cleaner&#x27;s air filter and my light bulbs and it makes my house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Smells great and my kids love having it and olive oil rubbed into the souls of their feet after bath time. My kids were sick and it seems to have cut down on the length of the cold. Company has great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Seems to be working great so far.</li>
            <li> I did research beffore purchasing and have learned alot rearding this oil. It is good for many things.</li>
            <li> The best cleaner ever! A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> Smells great, not sure about it&#x27;s germ fighting capabilities. Especially since we all got the flu. Smells awesome though so I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Heard lots about this helping with colds, flu, canker sores, and sore throat. I was very optimistic; however for me it accomplished none of the above. I was using it on soles of feet, as a tea and swabbing it on mouth sore and throat with no significant results. It actually might have contributed to my loss of taste. I gave it 2 stars because it smells nice and was able to temporarily clear my sinuses. Just being honest. It may help for others but not me.</li>
            <li> As always, Plant Therapy has exceeded my expectations. I love this synergy blend!</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of this and Young Life&#x27;s &#x27;Thieves&#x27; oil. The Young Life oil smells much richer and of greater quality. Even the labels on this brand are cheap looking and leave you wondering about the company. I&#x27;ve mainly used this and the Thieves oil for cleaning, which works fine for that, but I am going to spend the extra money on Young Life for now on. I mix the Thieves oil; 30 drops, 1 tablespoon castile soap, and 2 cups distilled vinegar in a bottle to use as an all purpose cleaner.</li>
            <li> This puts thieves to shame.  So many people are using thieves and paying through the nose for it, no pun intended.  Our grandson&#x27;s school had an Essential Oils 101 class for parents, and I didn&#x27;t go.  It&#x27;s because I already know that Plant Therapy makes the best and much more affordable oils on the market.  I think their oils are better than any other essential oil around.  Germ Fighter impressed us on the first use.  Our grandson had a really high fever over the weekend.  He woke up sick with a fever of 102 last Saturday morning.  We instantly massaged Germ Fighter in almond oil as a carrier and massaged this oil onto the bottoms of his feet and on his back and neck.  I also diffused this synergy blend in his diffuser.  By Sunday afternoon he was outside playing.  All I can say is WOW.  Very highly impressed!!! The smell is sort of Christmasy, and our grandson loves it.  He calls it his &amp;#34;feel better fast&amp;#34; oil.  Works like a charm.  He slept soundly, and was fever free to go to school.  We didn&#x27;t even need to take him to the doctor!!! I&#x27;ve told his teacher and both the ladies in the office about Plant Therapy.  They were excited to have an alternative to the outrageously expensive pyramid line. It&#x27;s called thieves because of the oils used to fight off the plague. Eucalyptus, Cinnamon, Clove, Lemon, and Rosemary.  I&#x27;ve even made my own using those five ingredients.  I love the 30 mL size of Germ Fighter!! Try it, let yourself be blown away by how powerful and wonderful this blend truly is!! We are Plant Therapy believers for life!!</li>
            <li> Works great and is very affordable</li>
            <li> This blend is way too heavy on the cinnamon. It burnt both my daughter and myself. This is the only brand that has ever happened with.</li>
            <li> I tried using this in one of the commonly suggested ways, as an aid to fighting gum and tooth infection. Even when diluted with vitamin e or other neutral oils, this burns so much when I put it in my mouth and tastes so horrible that I simply couldn&#x27;t use it. Waste of money. I wish I could get a refund, I only tried using it a couple of times and just couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful. I am a fan of all types of essential oils and blends. This one in particular was not a hit with us at all. We have been happy with other Plant Therapy products, but not this one. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and this version is a much more reasonably priced. I&#x27;ll defiantly order more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> Great service.  Wonderful price.</li>
            <li> Always happy with plant therapy, this one is always effective.</li>
            <li> We purchased this as a replacement for the more expensive Thieves brand, influenced mostly by the previous reviews of this product.  I was not disappointed with this decision.  It has a pleasant odor to it and we enjoy using it as a disinfectant.  Will consider purchasing again once we deplete our current supply.</li>
            <li> I work in a dr office and we see 50 patients a day plus their families and since i started using this at night i have not been sick once!</li>
            <li> I place a few drops on a cotton ball every night, just under the air intake on my cpap machine. Haven&#x27;t gotten bronchitis or a sinus infection in years.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I use two drops on my toothpaste and sometimes only use this to brush with. Keep my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth have no buildup on them. My brother was about to take a few ibuprofen for a broken tooth, but I stopped him and had him rinse his mouth with warm water and 5 drops of this oil. It burned his mouth a little because of the potency but it worked wonders for him. He rinsed again with warm water and was able to eat right after with no pain. Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> I bought this to manage the mold in a room, here in the Pacific Northwest mold can be a problem in the winter. I did some research and found a study on the \\&quot;Thieves\\&quot; oil, which showed it helped to stop or at least slow down mold growth. That oil was much too expensive, so I found this and tried it with a diffuser plugged into the wall near the mold area. It worked, no more mold and it also smells great. I highly recommend this, and I have also ordered other oils from Plant Therapy which are also good, especially the \\&quot;Pain Aid\\&quot; which helps muscle pain, and it works well.</li>
            <li> My favorite affordable version of the famous &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; essential oil. Scent is great and I use it for fevers on the bottom of feet or in my diffusers in the home. I buy the big bottle every time!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and a family member I gifted a bottle to was also very pleased--she is very knowledgable about essential oils and their myriad applications. This is a potent, aromatic blend of oils that has a wonderful scent and even when highly diluted retains it wonderful, warm, spicy aroma. Will be purchasing more. The product is also packaged in a very well designed bottle which seals tightly and will dispense drops easily so you do not have to use a medicine dropper.</li>
            <li> My wife got the flu and the doctor said that I would get it too.  I used this blend of oils plus ate lots of homemade sauerkraut and I didn&#x27;t get sick at all!  I put some on my clothes everyday before going to work.  I just love it.  And it smells good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely harsher than young livings thieves, but for the price and my uses which are only external, I feel like it&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
            <li> great--doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like thieves, and isn&#x27;t as concentrated or something--I have to use a bit more, but it&#x27;s still SO MUCH CHEAPER than young living, which I simply can&#x27;t afford.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! My massage therapist uses another brand, but I had been using a few of the other Plant Therapy essential oils (lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint) and was 100% satisfied with them, so I decided to try this. I have a diffuser at home and in the office and the folks at work love it too! Great product. So far, I haven&#x27;t been sick and I work at a YMCA and am around a lot of people. So I hope this will get me thru flu season!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  I&#x27;ve purchased this brand many times and I use it religiously for pretty much everything from cleaning my floors to ingesting it.  I diffuse it in my home, put it on the soles of my children&#x27;s feet( they won&#x27;t take it orally), use it  mixed with coconut oil for oil pulling (excellent results btw), every morning I put a few drops of this under my tongue , Nobody in my household got sick all winter!!  I use this instead of thieves, the quality is the same in my opinion and for this great price I can use it liberally and give it away as gifts as well;)</li>
            <li> Great aroma! Love what this synergy does! We dilute it in sweet almond oil and put it on the bottom of our feet when a bug is going around. I also enjoy diffusing it.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly how you would expect cinnamon, clove, and eucalyptus to smell. Kind of Holiday/festive smelling, but I will try it in the diffuser. I will try to mix with some vanilla or similar to mellow it out a little.   *update* I love this smell in my diffuser :)</li>
            <li> Nice for the price.  Smells good too, but not as effective for personal use as Thieves.  Great for cleaning though.</li>
            <li> This was fabulous! It smells just like the Thieves oil and costs less.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and priced very well. It is just as good, if not better, than the more highly priced synergy oils of the same blend. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells great, tastes great, and is a great value. While it&#x27;s not exactly like Thieves Oil, it has similar characteristics and merits.</li>
            <li> Just wish i knew from someone if these oils i ordered are a good quality oil.  I&#x27;ve been told it isn&#x27;t always what it appears.  I use it daily anyway and am hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this stuff as my own experiment during this cold &#x27;n flu season.  It smells wonderful!  I tell people it smells like Christmas.  Just smelling the bottle will instantly open up your sinus cavity.  The label states it&#x27;s 99.9% effective against bacteria, which is a bold statement, but I am a believer.  My co-worker had a nasty cold all holiday season long; stuffed nose, scratchy throat, and a triple cough every 2 minutes.  I would have a cup of black tea first thing in the morning with three drops of this essential oil blend.  The heat of the tea would instantly fill my cramped office with the smell of cinnamon and clove, and a soothing sensation as I drank.  Winter isn&#x27;t over, but I have been sickness free.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like Thieves but without the hefty price tag. This is great. Perhaps a little less of a cinnamon scent than the original. For the price tag totally worth the try. I use it for cleaning products and I plan to diffuse it in the future.</li>
            <li> Does not gum up my diffuser like Essential Oils does</li>
            <li> Not as good asYoung Living</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase with Synergy...and my first purchase of their Germ Fighter blend.  I highly recommend Germ Fighter for topical use (used in dilute form to disinfect a wound and a swollen gum) and to freshen/cleanse/release a great smell living room air (used in an electric diffuser)</li>
            <li> Nice scent and cleaning alternative.</li>
            <li> I had read that this was a less expensive alternative to Young Living&#x27;s Thieves. It&#x27;s more diluted, and the mix is a little different. So for that reason, it was disappointing to me. But for what it is, and the price, it is fine.</li>
            <li> We made a fabulous smelling hand sanitizer.  Product is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for Lyme disease, and it&#x27;s really too early to tell. I&#x27;m diluting it in olive oil and putting it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several products from Plant Therapy, none of them have disappointed me. This one holds a high rating in quality too!!</li>
            <li> It took my sore throat  away</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as Young Living without the high price tag!  I will be ordering more from Plant Therapy for my &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; chest!</li>
            <li> Smells good, price is right, and it works.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Mixed with coconut oil and put on my feet daily. Also nice in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil. I use it in making my toothpaste powder as well as for cleaning and air purification. This is a great brand and a great price! I don&#x27;t believe you can go wrong!</li>
            <li> I keep this in a spray bottle diluted with water and spray my bedroom and sheets everyday. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I read that &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; gets rid of skin tags.  This worked for me.  I successfully got rid of two skin tags.  One happened overnight (wow) and the other took 6 days.  I was fortunate that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin - but if it irritates yours, you can dilute it with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Great quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great and price is great</li>
            <li> Started using this oil on a recommendation from my daughter.  In my opinion, it does work.  I put several drops on the bottom of my feet every night.  So far, this winter, I have not been sick at all, not even a cold.  I have very dry eyes and get eye infections very easily.  One night I thought I was getting an eye infection so put this oil on my FEET!  I really rubbed it in good.  The next morning when I woke up, I had no eye problems at all. No grittiness or dry feeling at all and I never did get an eye infection. Usually when I go to bed with that gritty, dry eye, I&#x27;ll wake up with an eye infection that full blown pink eye.  Using the oil is the only thing I did differently.  Do NOT put this in your eyes, just rub it on the bottom of your feet.  Now I use this every night just on the bottoms of my feet and I truly believe it works.  My daughter puts it on her  three kid&#x27;s feet every night, too.  Last year they were sick all the time.  It&#x27;s mid-January and they haven&#x27;t been sick at all.  Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like cloves and cinnamon.  I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I made my own in the past and this smells just the same. No problem with shopping. Looks like good quality.</li>
            <li> Compare to thieves I think it smells the same.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Exactly as described.  The residual smell is amazing!  Use just a drop or two on wet/damp hands and rub them together.  The clean, subtle smell last many hours.  I also like to use a drop on a wet rag to clean counters and tables.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This does not quite smell like Thieves blend, but it is still a pleasant scent. Some people may like it better, since it is not quite as strong a scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product! This is the closest thing to the real deal I have found – I love the bigger bottle and lower price! Thank you…</li>
            <li> I love this blend; it is comparable to Young Living&#x27;s &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34;, but much less expensive!</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter in a body cream recipe for my eczema and it is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;l love knowing that this product is organic</li>
            <li> Combine this with lemon juice and warm waterwheel coming down with a cold. I swear I felt better more quickly than I would have without it.</li>
            <li> It works! No one from our family got sick during the flu and colds ! I recommended it to all my coworkers and relatives.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  It is described as a knock off for Young Living&#x27;s Thieves and it missed the mark.  I am using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste the product but I have to say that when I put it on my skin, there is burning.  I never, ever have had any burning from Thieves.  The balance of the oils is more than comfortably different, too. I will use what is left of the Germ Fighter that I bought but then I am going back to Thieves.</li>
            <li> Great product and seems to work just as well as Young Living essential oils!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and was excited to give it a try when a felt a cold coming on.  I put the oil on the bottom of my feet.  There was a little oil left on my fingers and when I rubbed my face the oil spread there and it felt like it was burning my skin.  After putting it on my feet 2 evenings in a row I noticed a rash developing on the arches of my feet where I had put the oil. I immediately stopped using it.  A week later, I am still trying to get rid of the rash.  I do not have sensitive skin at all but I had a bad reaction to this oil,  be very careful when using it.  Something in this oil is very strong and is an irritant to skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works very well and I wont be without it in my home. Very pleasant smell and a great size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice now, I love it. I use it in multiple different ways, including brushing my teeth with a drop of it. I was getting a mouth infection and it cleared up in no time with this. I also use it on my kids feet when they are sick.</li>
            <li> We really like this essential oil blend.  It is a little over the top on the high notes and the cinnamon.  But it&#x27;s great in water or tea.  We think it does help to stave off colds and to cut them short.  We always keep this in the house now.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil blend.  It really is comparable to the thieves essential oil and at a cheaper price.  Plant therapy definitely knows what they&#x27;re doing.  I will be buying more from them.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff. I even added I to my almond oil.I did the so I could smell good all day and have people say &amp;#34;WHat do you have on, it sure smells good. This would have to out of this world for me to write a review.</li>
            <li> Quality product, and fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great for a winter&#x27;s day. I put a couple of drops on the top of the furnace filter and the whole house smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Shipping was speedy. Makes my house smell healthy.  Wanted something that did not have anything artificial in it or any hazardous chemicals and this synergy blend is just what I was looking for.  Wasn&#x27;t it Aristotle who said that &amp;#34;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> I had been looking into essential oils and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy the multi level marketing brands, I knew there had to be a great quality product without the extra &amp;#34;baggage&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy products are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about germ fighter and I&#x27;ve had it a relatively short time. It&#x27;s already helped my son and I get over a cold FAST, inadvertently removed a skin tag I&#x27;ve had forever in this process and got me over mastitis without antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure to always have this on hand, it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying from Plant Therapy again and if they keep their standards/quality high I will never go to a different brand!</li>
            <li> I had read about \\&quot;thieves\\&quot; for fighting germs and had not tried it. It was just as I expected and I love the aroma as well. As recommended, I put it on my feet just before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THE SCENT, VERY WARM AND WELCOMING. IT SMELLS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN MY HOME EVERYDAY. I ADD A LITTLE OIL TO MY WARMER AND THE SENT FILLS THE ROOM.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, this really is an excellent sub for the much more expensive version that&#x27;s so expensive because it can only be purchased through a MLM scheme. Also as I&#x27;ve seen others state, this is light on clove, which I intend to supplement for a stronger scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the other formula, and now this, to help in my master bedroom and bath which recently had a mold problem: when my house was built, someone installed the bath light fixture by screwing one side to the wall THROUGH the PVC line carrying hot water. The slow leak over the course of 7 years finally made itself known by the paint along side the 4 X 6 foot mirror starting to bubble ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, the mold in and on the wall behind the mirror and on the backside and bottom of vanity cabinet was unreal ... no one expected it to be so bad, and I started reacting severely as soon as the mold spores went airborne. My research indicated that this particular blend of essential oil has been proven to kill bacteria and mold, whether in the air or on surfaces, and I decided it was worth a try (and much healthier than almost all alternatives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the scent immediately takes care of the mustiness of mold. Second, my symptoms have slowly been diminishing since I started using the oil. Most recently, I bought a new ultrasound diffuser (Signstek, reviewed separately on Amazon) which holds 500 ml of water at a time, to use close to my bed overnight. I also made a spray of the oil and spring water, and sprayed my bed sheets, blankets, and pillows with before getting into bed last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt better today than I have in weeks! In the bathroom itself, I&#x27;ve now got some of this oil in a large coffee mug, with water, sitting on one of those &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; hot-plates designed to keep your coffee/tea/cocoa warmed (or to melt candles to avoid adding burned wick to your air) --- wow, what a difference in the smell of air (it still tends to get musty after a few days without the window being opened)! Just be sure to check the water level frequently, until you know how long it takes to evaporate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil, and am glad it seems to be performing as well as the &amp;#34;other brand.&amp;#34; Already have ordered and started using 3 more bottles ... different diffusers, as an inhaler, etc.musty after a few days without the window being opened)! Just be sure to check the water level frequently, until you know how long it takes to evaporate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil, and am glad it seems to be performing as well as the &amp;#34;other brand.&amp;#34; Already have ordered and started using 3 more bottles ... different diffusers, as an inhaler, etc.</li>
            <li> I make my own household cleaner with vinegar, orange peels and dish soap.  This oil adds fragrance as well as germ fighting properties at a fraction of the cost of Thieves&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good stuff. I&#x27;m just starting to use it and dI feel it&#x27;s erased a feeling of a sore throat/cold coming on...but I need to do more research on ways to use it. Yes, the smell is lovely and spicey. I&#x27;ve been applying it to the sides of my neck and under my chin.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and very similar to YL at 1/4 cost.  Use in diffuser</li>
            <li> Last year, fall and winter were rough as far as illnesses go--stomach flu, pink eye, and colds dominated our household for 6 weeks as we all traded off getting sick.&lt;br /&gt;This year, we haven&#x27;t changed our routine--we are still getting out; the kids go to the gym daycare, we go to the library, store, and playdates--BUT, I have added scent ball plug-ins with this Plant Therapy germ fighter blend to the family room, living room, and the kids&#x27; bedroom. The bottle says it has proven 99% effective in killing airborne bacteria in studies. I don&#x27;t know about that accuracy, but what I can say is we have not had a runny nose or cough in our house all fall/winter thus far (and it&#x27;s late December). I recommend this oil blend to anyone who wants to prevent the sickies in their house.</li>
            <li> This blend is just as great as the more popular Thieves! We are diffusing it in my house almost daily throughout the winter in hopes of staving off too many illnesses! Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome, arrived ahead of schedule and is in heavy use in our household! Will be placing another order shortly...</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy oils</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this oil at half the price of Thieves Oil. My wife even uses on her feet if she feels a throat tickle and the next morning she&#x27;s good to go. She thinks it has healing powers and that&#x27;s good enough for me :-)</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it in both my diffusers and it has drastically reduced the number to colds and flues my family has had this year. And it makes your home smell fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li> Granddaughter got a cold sore that was well underway when she came home from sleepover at friends. She was very upset and distressed about going to her counter clerk job, being seen by public. I made up a mix of 4/5 drops coconut oil to 1 drop Germ Fighter and swelling and inflammation visibly receded as we talked during the afternoon. She dabbed it on six or seven times as we talked.  By time she had to go in at 3 pm lipstick covered it enough to regain her dignity.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops into hot water to help relieve sinus pain and I like the smell. It is a good deal for the amount you get when compared to others. I have started buying all of my oils from  Plant Therapy. I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Way way cheaper. Excellent product. I much prefer it to YL. Warmer scent and very effective. Saw a 1 star review where user said she used it on get small children! These are hot oils and should NEVER be applied directly to any skin. Use a diffuser or dilute at least 1-5 with a carrier oil. Doesn&#x27;t matter what brand. I however will stick with this brand. Love the price as well</li>
            <li> I use this germ fighter oil with the classic ultrasonic aromatherapy diffuser.  (Which works like a champ.).  I used to buy the YL oil, but it is very expensive.  It smells simiiar to me.  I bought it after reading many, many reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee this product is the reason, but I used this faithfully last year, along with the same company&#x27;s immunity blend and a lot of common sense, and my children never got as sick as the kids they were around. I just reordered for this coming cold and flu season. I used a few drops everyday in a diffuser and both bottles lasted me the whole fall/winter season. That&#x27;s less than the doctor&#x27;s co-pay!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful blend, and much more affordable than the Young Living essential oils. the products arrived in a very timely fashion, and I will order again. I&#x27;m glad to have found this company, thanks to a review I read on the web site.</li>
            <li> Loved it so far. I am using it in my classroom. As a teacher I supply many of the items in my classroom at my exspence. I would live to be able for teachers to have a discount or be able to receive free trials. I was not real pleased with the diffuser I bought so if you could recommend one I would appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant aroma and only a few drops needed in my oil diffuser.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This oil blend has been an amazing help to me! We were without dental insurance for 15 months &amp; during that time I had a couple of broken fillings that exposed a nerve.... I read somewhere to try thieves oil &amp; found this on Amazon as an alternative to the expensive name brand. Let me say this is amazing! Has stopped mouth pain &amp; prevented infection, I use it every night before bed, put some on a q-tip &amp; rub it on my teeth &amp; gums, I&#x27;ve had no infection or pain for mths &amp; finally have dental insurance but will continue to use this, amazing!</li>
            <li> WOW this stuff is AMAZING!  Much better than and MUCH MORE than just an acceptable substitute for the expensive Young Living Thieves oil.  Thank You to Plant Therapy Essential Oils for being quite generous an increasing the 1 oz / 30ml bottle 20% MORE FOR FREE!  Now the size is 1.21 fl oz (36ml)  They are basically are giving you the same amount you pay from YL for 5ml for about $28+ for Free.  Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is so much I could say about this Amazing stuff.  One is to experiment but be careful as it is powerful stuff!!!  Instead of buying the exp. YL mouthwash... make your own.  I add about 5 drops to a glass of purified water and keep it in your mouth for as long as you can - dip your dental floss in that water - I mix it with almond oil and apply to the side of nostrils and sinus (also using it on skin tags - wow 2 days.. Shrinking fast! They will be gone in no time).  I also deeply inhale it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had found out about it and bought it &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; I got this really bad cold that is going around.  This stuff helped prevented it from settling in and decreased the length and it&#x27;s gone within 5 days.  Some of my friends have been sick for weeks.  5 STARS all the way!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Not sure how high quality the oil is, but it&#x27;s a wonderful alternative to other wicked high priced oils available.  I use it for cleaning and in laundry, etc.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Young Living Thieves by any means so don&#x27;t treat it as such, but for soaps it worked well.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff! My mother in-law was the one who introduced me to the product when my daughter got sick last year. My daughter is getting over a nasty infection and thanks to this product her recovery has been much faster then myself or the doctors even guessed. I rub the germ fighter on the soles of her feet at night and noticed a difference the next morning! I am thankful it actually helped my daughter!</li>
            <li> This oil is as great as the thieves from a young living, but at a friction of a cost!</li>
            <li> I have braces and someone told me they use Thieve&#x27;s Oil to fight plaque.  I get an excessive buildup behind my lower front teeth, and even on my braces, because I have a lot of saliva, apparently.  I rinse with a drop or two of this mixed in water at least twice a day after brushing, and it drastically reduces the white buildup on my teeth.  I thought I would try this as a lower-cost alternative to the Thieve&#x27;s Oil, so I have not compared the two, but I may do that soon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to experiment with other uses for it. I&#x27;ve heard it may kill toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> Good advertisement, but only half the effectiveness of the original 4 Thieves oil.  Next time I will spend the money for the real deal.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Will last forever because you dilute it. I keep a small spray bottle of this in my purse. Love it. Smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> This product replaces the thieves oil I used to use.  With any sign of tooth problems, I put some of this on a Q-tip and apply to area.  Immediate relief!  Also use a couple of drops in water for a refreshing mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and was looking for something reasonably priced and not part of a multi-level marketing company. I have a friend who ordered the Thieves oil, as this compares to, at the same time I ordered mine. They smell absolutely identical and my friend is so envious that I paid so much less for what appears to be the same thing.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product, and decided to give it a go.  We were in the middle of flu season, so I started using a few drops in a crock pot full of water since I didn&#x27;t have a diffuser.  My husband came home from work sneezing and congested. While we were watching television, he began to sound increasingly congested.  I placed the crock pot in the living room with a few drops of Germ Fighter oil.  Within ten minutes he was breathing easier! Although we both caught colds, the duration was much shorter than if we hadn&#x27;t used this oil.  I will definitely be keeping this around, from now on since we are entering pollen season!</li>
            <li> A lot of years ago I was a member of YL, and Thieves was my favorite oil. When I came back to using essential oils again, I was blown away by prices of their oils, and researched alternatives. Plant Therapy seemed a viable alternative. If you are looking for an exact duplication of YL&#x27;s proprietary blend, this isn&#x27;t it. Thieves is proprietary blend for a reason. BUT!!! If you&#x27;re looking for something as close to Thieves as possible, that works well, and costs a fraction of YL&#x27;s blend, then Plant Therapy&#x27;s Germ Fighter is for you. It is certainly worth trying, and the people at Plant Therapy are quick to reply when contacted. I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Like health in a good bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;natural and not harmful ....works great....smells great...if you cannot make your own mix, this is for you!</li>
            <li> This was my 1st essential oil purchase and I have not been let down!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this oil on the bottom of my children&#x27;s feet morning and before bed, all winter season now and i am sure it has helped them fight germs.  They attend public school and will inevitably come home every once in a while with the start of a cold (small cough, or sniffle, etc).  I quickly apply the Germ Fighter to their chest or near where ever the ailment seems to be and it does help them to get over it so quickly.  Typically it&#x27;d take a week or so, now we can beat it in a day or two! I love that I&#x27;m not having to keep putting medicine down their throats!&lt;br /&gt;I have had the beginnings of a sore throat myself, this winter -- I add 2 drops of the essential oil to 2 T of water: gargle and then swallow until it&#x27;s all gone and the sore throat is usually gone within a day or two, sometimes sooner!&lt;br /&gt;Warning : the cinnamon in this blend is very strong!!!  I have rubbed it into my skin and felt a tingling sensation.  It is also very strong to rub under your nose - especially for kids!  I have also once or twice been a bit too liberal with it, and felt a burning (equivalent (while swallowing) to having a mouthful of the fire ball candies)!! So, please use caution - especially with children.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for young kids!&lt;br /&gt;This will be a winter time staple in our house from now on!! Super pleased!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked this oil, it smells good and has done a great job of keeping me from getting sick.  Even with a house full of sick kids and a sick wife, I didn&#x27;t catch it while using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use 4-5 drops in a glass of water when we are feeling sick or run-down...it &amp;#34;does the trick&amp;#34; and gets us back to feeling good again!</li>
            <li> Received the oil quickly and as described.  Sure hoping it will work on my husband&#x27;s chronic sinusitus problems.  Thought it was worth a try, and this oil had great reviews.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not as strong and slightly different smell as Thieves but seems to still be pretty potent. Not sure how effective yet but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I love Thieves and saw that this was a fraction of the name brand version.  I decided to give it a try and have not been disappointed. It has a lovely cinnamon scent. We use it to help fight colds. At the very first sign apply it to the soles of your feet.  Ideally, you should do this several times a day.  It really has reduced the number of viruses we get each year.</li>
            <li> Smelled the same as Young Living Thieves although I tried to put it on my toothpaste and it tasted chemical (which I don&#x27;t get from YL).  I think I will use in diffuser still!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy any other essential oil, but this one!!!! This does wonders for oral health and has helped subside my gingivitis. I add it to my mouthwash too :) get this oil!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my pendant diffuser &amp; it is great for that. If I use it in my home diffuser it is too strong on the cinnamon and my husband reacts to it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever ordered and used an oil like this.  I am sure it is everything it was purported to be, I just have not decided I really buy into this oil idea. I used a diffuser, and it makes the house smell nice, but as far as any other benefits, I am still doubtful</li>
            <li> Many compare this to Thieves by Young Living.  I love the scent!  I have diffused it and applied it to the bottoms of my and my daughter&#x27;s feet to ward off illness!  :)  Who knows if it works for sure, but the scent is wonderful!  It&#x27;s both of our favorites!  My mom was complaining of her basement office smelly stale and moldy - I put a few drops of this oil and some distilled water in a amber glass spray bottle and sprayed it everywhere - the mold smell is still gone days later!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this oil. I can smell the cinnamon primarily over any other oil, and when you add this to a steamer inhaler to breathe into your lungs, it is the most delicious smelling and &amp;#34;tasting&amp;#34; steam - worked wonders to help break up phlegm in my chest. The price seems a little high and has exactly the same ingredients and smell as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34;, so if you can find Thieves cheaper elsewhere, buy it. Overall, I am glad I bought it and would buy again if I can find it at a better price.</li>
            <li> Great smelling an really seems to help speed flu and colds. Rub with oil on feet.. Great product worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it&#x27;s the same as thieves essential oil. It smells strongly of cinnamon which can be irritating but I&#x27;ve had no problems. I like to ingest a couple drops and apply it to my feet to help with a cold. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to be able to find a product that works like Thieves, but not the price.  I am very satisfied with Germ Fighter and I am happy to be able to share this oil with friends!</li>
            <li> Great smell and close to the thieves brand blend! I have used a different blend before but I like the spicy kick that this has. Slightly clove-y and cinnamon-y compared to medieval mix</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be an acceptable substitute for the expensive Young Living Thieves oil, for daily use in a diffuser.  It&#x27;s similar but much sharper - more cinnamon and peppermint, less of the warm clove. Still \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and not chemical-y, just sharp. I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much but I have to admit it costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Germ Fighter is my favorite Plant Therapy essential oil...I only have three, but, still, I love it! I like cinnamon scent and that&#x27;s what stands out to me. I&#x27;ve used it as others have suggested by licking a drop off the back of my hand when I had a sore throat. Also putting it in a carrier oil and rubbing it on my throat, around ears and forehead during the cold really seemed to help lessen the symptoms...also rubbed it on my feet during that time. I have a bad tooth and when it flared up, I soaked a swab and held it on the tooth for less than a minute and that really worked! A few drops in a salt &amp; soda mix for brushing teeth does a good job of cleaning and freshening breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in combination with Plant Therapy&#x27;s Immune-Aid too and will soon try out my new diffuser with Germ Fighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m just getting started using essential oils, I feel this is a keeper for the home remedy shelf!</li>
            <li> Great scent, I crave it when I get home now.  Nice to have during cold and flu season especially.</li>
            <li> Works great and great smelling too!!!</li>
            <li> i use it when i&#x27;m getting sick, by putting some in a carrier oil and rubbing in my chest, etc, it works great. i will order again</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon over powers the the rest of the oils, but I think he really does help with my sinus&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This oil blend was much thinner than the other product I have used, but for the price, I was satisfied with its effectiveness in the atomizer I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few 4 Thieves-type blends from other vendors and have never experienced a reaction, and certainly nothing remotely close to the agony this brand caused me. This oil was extremely potent and intense. On the skin, it was excruciating, and left behind very red swollen welts that were similar to a chemical burn. Thankfully the effect didn&#x27;t take as long to heal, but unfortunately, I was not the only one in my family to experience this effect. If you&#x27;re unlucky enough to find yourself in this predicament, I used a bottle of Oil-Free Eye Make-up remover to stop the burn while I was frantically looking for something - ANYTHING - to get this stuff off my skin. Water will just spread the burn around, while the oil-free make-up remover seemed to break up the oil and remove it pretty well. Literally had me in tears it was so hot. Perhaps it&#x27;s good for vaporizers... I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t use them... personally I think even the smell is too intense... but I absolutely DO NOT recommend this particular item for consumption or topical use with out significant dilution. But as for myself, I just went back to a brand I didn&#x27;t have to dilute.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Thieves Oil and found this at a great price.  I have been using it and liking it just fine. Just a few drops are used at a time so it should last a while using every day.  I am hoping it will help purify the air by using it with my new diffuser.  In any event, it helps the air to smell fresh without strong-smelling chemicals and potentially dangerous ones.  The medical clinic treating my daughter diffuses the Thieves oil and this one is comparable to that.</li>
            <li> Syngery. Love this oil, I diffuse it every morning. It smells great. Love the company as they are fast on delivery and have a great produt.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this oil in a sink full of warm water while washing my expensive cosmetic brushes. When I got them out they were all etched and looked horrible. Beware!!</li>
            <li> Love this blend! I have clients in daily for sessions, and am in close proximity. This helps keep me in balance and continued well-being.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as it was favorably reviewed.  Have been using the name brand for several years, on a daily basis.  When I determined that this product was very similar, yet much more affordable, I tried it. Have been very happy with the product.  Fast delivery and good packaging.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of neutralizing smells and bacteria in the air and on surfaces, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the smell. It reminds me of my first time drinking poor quality whiskey. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing... Kind of nostalgic actually, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it from the oils blended. I would recommend making your own, as this has a carrier oil and is not &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; essential oils, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and for about 1/10 the cost of making it yourself.</li>
            <li> It works AMAZINGLY!  My 4 year old began complaining one morning of a headache and stomach ache.  I immediately got his EO blend out of the medicine cabinet and added 1 drop to about 4 drops of a carrier oil.  Applied it to his feet, and also put 3 drops of the Germ Fighter in several diffusers around the house.  I applied more to his feet around noon, when he complained again, which was just before he vomited.  He only got sick to his stomach the one time.  He was still clearly not feeling well at bedtime when I applied it to his feet again.  When he awoke the next morning, he was completely and totally his normal self - as if he had not been sick at all!  Now I don&#x27;t know about you, but my kids usually take a day or 2 to recover from a tummy bug, so I was really impressed.  He hardly got sick at all, and he just recovered so quickly.  I will stock this oil from now on!  Oh, and you just can&#x27;t beat that it&#x27;s available with Prime shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for germ killing. I give it to my sister who is a teacher so she has to be in a &amp;#34;vat of disease&amp;#34; all day and it works at keeping her illness at bay. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to the wonderful world of essential oils and had been looking for a good thieves oil.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase. My youngest (13 months) was the first to benefit from this blend- I used it with coconut oil as a carrier on his feet to clear up his lingering cold.  My husband and I have both taken it in a capsule to fend off oncoming colds with success.  You can&#x27;t beat the price on this.  You will pay double for popular brands, but I have found this to be just as high quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars.  It works great in my homemade toothpase.  It tast great and my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young living distributor, but, I&#x27;ve been on a budget tighter than usual recently. I decided to seek out some oils that are less expensive and see if I could find the same quality - thieves vs. germ fighter, germ fighter wins, hands down. This bottle is twice the size for half the price. I&#x27;m sold and am going to purchase additional oils from plant therapy.</li>
            <li> We are almost at the end of cold/flu season for this year and I have not been sick so far.  I first ordered this in early January 2014 when illness was viral (pun intended!) It seemed that almost everyone I knew succumbed to something, with some having 2 or 3 rounds of illness.  During that time I faithfully used this oil by rubbing it on the bottom of my feet every night.  I also bought a diffuser and used that for many days as well.  My husband wasn&#x27;t using the oil and came down with a cold a couple of weeks ago.  I had him start using it and he was over the cold within 4 days! I was definitely exposed to a lot of illness this year and credit this oil with keeping me well.  It helps to be sensible, eat well, get your rest, etc. but mainly - USE Germ Fighter!  I have not tried Thieves Oil because I think it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, whereas this is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, smells great, great quality and I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Excelent for skin infections(bacterial,fungal,viral,scabies and parasitical). You can use it directly in a lesion( it stings a little, but it goes away in minutes) or mix it with coconut oil or any cream with glycerine for larger areas.</li>
            <li> This is their version of &amp;#34;thieves oil&amp;#34; which is an amazing essential oil blend.  It smells great and I use it to ward off colds and flu by putting on the bottoms of my feet each night and will put on my hands when I go somewhere germy like the grocery store or doctors office.  It&#x27;s nice to diffuse to kill germs in the house and I have also put a drop in my tea when I feel like I&#x27;m trying to catch something and it works right away.  I also had a tooth bothering me and rubbed some on my gums and it stopped hurting immediately and hasn&#x27;t hurt since - 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> Love this product- I bought this especially for my business trips to use in the hotel. The oils clean the air and the scent is wonderful.  I take a small spice jar and put a few drops on a facial pad (can also use cotton ball) and then I keep with me to use.  I have not chosen an aromatherapy infuser yet, when I do, I&#x27;ll be using this oil blend.</li>
            <li> If you want to fight germs at your office or in your home this is the perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it each time people are sick around me. I put it in a  diffuser and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sick around sick people! and it is only what I ask. Job done!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I diffuse it daily. My family has not gotten sick since using this product. Love it so much I just ordered relax synergy oil</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THIEVES. Don&#x27;t be confused as I was. I buy a lot of things from Amazon mostly from my handheld device. The screen is not huge like a computer, but that&#x27;s never been a problem before. I was looking for an oil that had been recommended to me very highly. It is called THIEVES, and it works. I believed at the time of the order that was what I would receive. Upon it&#x27;s arrival I noticed it read&amp;#34;similar to THIEVES&amp;#34;. It might be similar, but it&#x27;s NOT THE SAME, and it doesn&#x27;t work the same. I had opened and used this product before I noticed the DIFFERENCE. I phoned the company and spoke with a lady who couldn&#x27;t have cared less about my complaint. She instructed me to contact Amazon. I bought the real Thieves and it works as claimed, and I still have this fake stuff because I didn&#x27;t want to bother Amazon for a few dollars and technically it was my mistake because I didn&#x27;t read the small print. My advice: READ EVERY WORD BEFORE YOU ORDER ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> So happy with this product, I use it in cleaning products and in a vaporizer.  I see no difference between it and the &amp;#34;name  brands&amp;#34; that are 16 times more expensive.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t quite as good as Thieves IMO, but very close.  I did muscle testing with it and seems to be a little light on clove, so I just add a drop of clove oil when I mix it with water and drink it.  Not a big drawback for me and I will continue to buy this!</li>
            <li> I just received the Germ Fighter the other day and right away I used it in our diffuser at home. I bought it based on all of the great reviews I saw on here. I have not tried any other &#x27;Thieves Oil&#x27; to compare it too (they cost way too much to even try), so I cannot help with that. I do know that my son, who has horrible allergies, actually LOVED the smell of it - and normally he hates any types of fragrances - so I knew this was a keeper for us because of that alone. I absolutely love the smell as well - it&#x27;s more of a cinnamon smell , which I really like (it reminds me of the original flavor of Dentyne Gum-my favorite). I am going to keep using this at night in our diffuser to see how it works in the long run since my son - who is 6 yrs old - seems to pick up all of the germs and sickness that he comes across at school. When or if he gets sick again with allergies (allergy season is coming) or something from school, I will try it with a carrier oil on his feet and I will update my review based on that as well. The past few nights of diffusing it, it seems that my son and I both are sleeping much deeper and I feel much better when I wake up and I LOVE that!!!  I used it on myself last night for an infection that was starting around my wisdom tooth area, it was swollen all the way down my glands on the side of my throat. I diluted it with coconut oil and swished it around that area, then rinsed. I then put some on a q-tip and swabbed over that area inside my mouth and left it there. I used a cotton ball covered in the dilution and rubbed it all over the outside of my jaw and swollen neck. When I woke up this morning, the pain and swelling is almost gone, which is great!! I will repeat the process today and again tonight as well, which I think will clear it up completely. Overall, I am very pleased with my first bottle of Essential Oils from Plant Therapy and I will be ordering more products soon.**UPDATE 3/11/15: I have since learned by contacting Plant Therapy that you should NOT USE this product on children UNDER 10 YRS OLD (by diffusing or diluted with a carrier oil). This upset me a bit because I had no idea until I contacted the company and I actually bought it to help my 6 yr old son more than anything. There is no information or warnings about that on the product or on the websites, which I believe there should be one if this is the case.**you should NOT USE this product on children UNDER 10 YRS OLD (by diffusing or diluted with a carrier oil). This upset me a bit because I had no idea until I contacted the company and I actually bought it to help my 6 yr old son more than anything.

            <li> As always, I am pleased as can be with my purchases for Plant Therapy oils.  They arrive on time, well wrapped and fresh.  Love this Germ Fighter oil!  Will continue to buy as I need it!  Helps with many things.</li>
            <li> This is a great substitute for thieves oil.  It seems to be the same thing to me, but they&#x27;re not calling it that for whatever reason.  Anyway, I mix it with some organic shea butter and put it on my feet and my son&#x27;s feet and we&#x27;ve made it through the winter without getting sick.  My son had a bit of a stuffy nose for a couple of days, but other than that, very healthy. I&#x27;d also put a few drops in the humidifier in his room.  I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> High quality, lovely spicy smell of cinnamon and cloves, fast and friendly service. Equivalent of Thieves oil and sure beats price. I use on soles of feet for cold/flu. Also use in plugin diffuser with a few drops of orange essential oil for lovely scent like Constant Comment tea. I understand it reduces mold spores as well when used in diffuser.</li>
            <li> The Germ fighter synergy essential oil blend has been used on small cuts on my arm and legs. The smell is of cinnamon and stings upon application on the cuts but takes away the soreness PDQ.  I have several other essential oils that sit on my bathroom counter for use several times a week.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product so far! I don&#x27;t have experience with the other brands that are a similar blend, but when I diffused this oil, I could smell it in my whole upper level of my house.  When I diffuse other oils, I usually just smell them in one large room (even peppermint, which is very strong!). I am super super happy!</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  I think Plant Therapy will be a good back up/cost effective option to my Young Living collection which I am very partial to because of their amazing reputation.  With that being said, this is a great product BUT ALSO a strong blend.  Probably want to mix with a carrier oil.  For example my husband &amp; my three kiddos (7, 5, 2) all get a red skin reaction when I put it on neat (no carrier oil) behind their ears. In fact my husband went running to the bathroom at Chuck E Cheese (u know I had to put something on them for that place!!!) because his skin was &amp;#34;on fire&amp;#34; from the oil :)  I chuckled just a little ;)  I for some reason do not have a reaction but all three of them do. Fyi, when I put this oil on the bottom of their feet, no problem.  Anything other than their feet you will want to dilute with a carrier oil.  I think it&#x27;s a very effective essential oil immunity blend!! Will keep in my house for the cold &amp; flu season :) Thank u!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it really assists in keeping you healthy and well.  At the onset of a sore throat I mix a few drops of this with a carrier oil and put on throat and feet.  Also use in a mister to cleanse the air.  Just as good as any Thieves Oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my daughter-in-law. She LOVED it and plans to purchase more. She said it really helped her with breathing especially at night as they have both dogs and cats in house!!!!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quick turn around of this delivery.  I compared the ingredients to those in thieves oil, which I paid $42 for .5 oz (yes, I felt ripped off), and found no difference, except for one added ingredient, rosemary.  For 1/2 the price, it was close enough.  Results and fragrance seem to be the same in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> It smells OK and doesn&#x27;t linger anyway.  I can&#x27;t tell if it is any better than any other snake oil products.  It can burn for a minute or two so don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> This product has the ingredients of the thieves oil that other companies sell, under various names. This product has a more cinnamon smell than some of the others but i like cinnamon so it is not offensive. I purchased this product to help clear the air in our home after so many have been so ill this spring.</li>
            <li> I put this with water into my electric scent burner at home and in a busy dental office. It smells great and none of us have gotten sick since I started using it!! So we all skipped the flu and other stuff that people like to share each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased this product. It does exactly what they say it does. It&#x27;s also an excellent value considering the quantity you get for the price. I will continue to purchase their products.</li>
            <li> This is great for this time of year to keep away colds and flu&#x27;s at least I haven&#x27;t got any yet.  I mix it with a carrier oil and put it on, it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> This oil is AMAZING!!!!!!  I love it and recommend it to my friends and anyone interested in essential oils.  It works as advertised and at an affordable price.  Never met a plant therapy oil I did not love.</li>
            <li> Put on the feet and in the diffuser and germs flee. This stuff also helps cuts heal faster:)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome asset during cold and flu season.  I use it mixed with a little olive oil (carrier oil) and put that mixture on the oil burner I have.  I really feel like during a cold it makes me breath better.  The smell is like nothing I ever have smelled before and if you are sensitive you might not like it at first but it does grow on you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on reviews and was excited at the idea that it might shorten the duration of the colds my family gets. I used it on my son and his cold went away pretty quickly, which is typical. I started using it even before I was feeling sick, and I still got sick. It smells really nice, and I continue to use it. I just can&#x27;t back up claims that it helps alleviate illness.</li>
            <li> formulation just a bit different from thieves, same effectiveness though...  and that&#x27;s all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;actually smells better, not as &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use to for any sickness yet, but it smells very similar to another popular blend. I put a few drops in my hand soap for a boost of extra goodness.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil synergy from Plant Therapy. It has a great smell and even my kids like to smell it when I use it to clean around our house or diffuse it. Another great essential oil synergy from this company~ one I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This  was my first order from Plant Therapy, but it won&#x27;t me my last.  I am very pleased with the quality of the product and the speed with which it was shipped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Germ Fighter Synergy in our oil diffuser for the last year or so and it seems to work fine for me. I wanted to get some thieves oil from young living, but didn&#x27;t want to spend quite so much as I was just starting to dabble with essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two small children, so have put this oil in my diffuser throughout the winter months and it may just be a coincidence, but nobody has been sick! The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it isn&#x27;t bad either, maybe just not my personal preference. It&#x27;s more of an earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I also make sure to use this oil in the diffuser if one of us has a cold or congestion and I think it does help ease that, especially at night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just getting into essential oils and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, this is worth a try! I also bought a less expensive oil diffuser here on amazon that I&#x27;ve really love (so much that I bought a second one) and has been going strong for almost 2 years now!</li>
            <li> Really Great buy!  Excellent shopping at this store.  Would not hesitate to purchase other items certainly as well for sure.</li>
            <li> I think this works as described as a germ fighter.  I haven&#x27;t been sick since using it and it smells okay too.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> God Bless all the great things in Nature.  I  don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the oils or a combination of all that I do but I have been free of any bad symptoms for around two (2) years.  It all works together for our benefit.  I will Keep Germ Fighter on hand for myself and frliends, if they want to try, mostly they go and buy for themselves after they try them....</li>
            <li> Smells food. However it doesn&#x27;t smell like the Thieves unless you let it sit awhile. Not too bad and good value.</li>
            <li> Will buy again and again. Great product. Please keep making this magical stuff. Follow manufacturers guidelines. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years after looking for a cheaper alternative to Thieves. I previously had a compromised immune system, and GF was very good at nipping bugs in the bud when I first started feeling funky.  This works just as well in the YL Therapro diffuser.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for my mold problem, thieves is just too expensive and you get so little of it. This is perfect. It works just as good as thieves and it&#x27;s a great price. Plus you get a lot! I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I have both this oil and young living thieves oil and feel they both work well. Young livings oil has more of a clove scent but this oil so far has been just as effective as thieves brand.</li>
            <li> This is the same blend as Thieves, by Young Living, but at a fraction of the price (30ml of Thieves will likely cost you over $80!). I use it every day in my aroma therapy mister in my home during cold/flu season. I&#x27;ve got pretty much everyone in my family using it now as well.  This blend of clove, cinnamon, lemon, eucalyptus, and  rosemary is known for killing airborne germs. You can also put a few drops in your favorite cleaner, hand soap, or dish soap. I&#x27;ve also put a few drops in my dishwasher, but considering that I usually run it on the sanitation cycle, I don&#x27;t do that anymore as that is pretty much redundant. Because this is made of pure essential oils, you do need to be careful as it is very strong. If you use it on your skin, it is always recommended that you put one or two drops in a base like jojoba oil, lotion, etc., and never directly on your skin. You can test for additives by putting one drop of an essential oil on a piece of paper. If there are no additives, it will evaporate. Additives will leave an oily mark. If you use it on a car diffuser, I highly recommend you start with ONE drop or you may find yourself hanging your head out of the window.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a breast cancer patient dealing with sinus issues - combined with evolving double vision - for the past 7 months. I just started using this little magic in a bottle, and for the first time - in a long time - I sense a little relief. I can breathe better, and I can see almost an arm length without wearing my eyepatch or stick-on prism. Germ Fighter Synergy definitely has become part of my overall healing (one of many parts), and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> We use this when we start feeling like we are coming down with a bug and it nips it in the bud every time.</li>
            <li> I had been buying my Thieves Oil from another company that has a proprietary blend.  It was quite pricey so I decided to try this brand.  It smells just like the expensive stuff and seems to work pretty well.  I can&#x27;t profess to the cellular components or its effectiveness of fighting germs in comparison to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; company&#x27;s quality but it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I am prone to Respiratory infections and usually have 3-6 between Sept and March.  I had only one this year and it didn&#x27;t last very long and one round of antibiotic took care of it.  I have used this essential oils for about a year and have noticed great improvement in my respiratory health.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s well..100% pure essential oils and will get the job done. Best bang for the buck. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is a particular brand that starts with a Y that has better quality oils. I&#x27;ve used them for years so I know. However, again this is a great quality oil and you can&#x27;t go wrong. Just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it and remember you get 20% more for FREE....(At the bottom of the label where it states 1 fl oz. (30 ml), it is crossed out in red and right above it in red says 1.21 fl oz. (36 ml). - AND to the upper left in red at a 45 degree slant says: &amp;#34;Now 20% more FREE!&amp;#34; --- Bravo!</li>
            <li> Yes it is their own version of thieves oil.  It smells wonderful and works just as good if I had made my own version. Which I am entirely to lazy to do. Love the seller too. Wonderfully packed and came quickly.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Compares to the MLM brand I have bought and surpasses another brand purchased from Amazon. Will be sticking with Plant Therapy for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Just as potent as the more pricey option. I believe it works. You can smell all of the ingredients and it does get warm if you put too much on. Be very careful and do not store around children or pets. If ingested or overused, can be fatal.</li>
            <li> This product helped immensely with an abscessed tooth, and got me through to my oral surgery day a month later.</li>
            <li> I tried buying this product hoping it would be like the Young Living brand.  It is horrible.  I used it on my 2 1/2 year old and 5 1/2 year old and their back was covered with hives.  I will save my money and buy the Young Living brand which uses only pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, they said therapeutic oils in the description but that&#x27;s a lie--they are not! Very low quality. The cinnamon is so cheap, so abrasive that it burns like fire, I cannot put it on my skin, and any Thieves or Thieves-like blend I&#x27;ve used I never have a hard time doing that! I am putting it in my rainbow vacuum to diffuse it into the air, but I def will not be buying again. The oils hardly have any smell, at first I thought they must have been distilled, and distilled and distilled some more. But my sister gave me a bottle of another of they&#x27;re oils, it&#x27;s actually not pure oil, it&#x27;s cut with other cheap oils, and I believe probably also some synthetic to make it burn that bad. After some leaked on the lid the oil was really sticky and nasty, pure essential oils are not sticky. Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money buying again. I&#x27;ve been getting most of my oils from Rocky Mountain oils and Young living. Shouldn&#x27;t have tried to go any cheaper than that! For the price and the title said they were therapeutic I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d try them, but I regret that. When I replied to the company with what I wrote here their only reply was \\&quot;sorry you didn&#x27;t like them\\&quot;. Not sorry we lied, sorry we have cheap junk that&#x27;s more expensive than it should be, sorry we have abrasive cinnamon that burns and could seriously hurt a child. I have no respect for a company like that!</li>
            <li> Loved talking to the company rep. he was very helpful.  Product smells very similar to Thieves.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more as needed.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> When our local natural shop burned down, I was at a loss to find a place to get my oils.  Until I found Plant Therapy.  I have my Thieves Oil again and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Saw something about this product on FaceBook so decided to order it.  When I received it, I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with instructions of how to use, or instructions of what all it was good for and how to use the product.  Please advise.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try oils without investing a fortune. THese oils are awesome! We have been diffusing the germ fighter  in our house and it doesn&#x27;t only smell good, it really works.  I put this oil on my kids&#x27; feet before we go out, especially to school etc. It&#x27;s amazing how well it works.  My son was getting a runny nose. I put it on his feet and he woke up the next morning and did not have his runny nose anymore.  It&#x27;s very potent. Definitely read up on using these oils properly.  While I love supporting &amp;#34;mommy businesses&amp;#34; like the doterra or young living oils.  With my budget, I just can&#x27;t do it.  And the extra they charge goes towards providing incentives for the people who sell their oils, which is fine, but not something I&#x27;m willing to pay for.  These oils are of the finest quality.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have horrible sinus problems that have ultimately led me to 2 sinus surgeries over the past 5 years. The last one was because every sinus cavity was full of gunk. There was abcolutely no air space in the CT scan. I also get really bad nasal polyps. I started researching some DIY remedies that may help witht the issues that I still have which include, congestion, post nasal drip, and sinus pain. I came across a lot of people recommending Thieves oil. When I saw the price tag on it, I really didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for something that I didn&#x27;t know whether or not it would work for me. This Germ Fighter oil seemed to have the same ingredients and was comparable to the Thieves oil at a much cheaper price. I diffuse this and put a couple drops in hot water to breathe in the steam with a towel over my head. I experienced immediate results just after the first use. I had my first night&#x27;s sleep in a long time without horrible post nasal drip. I will continue to use this and hope to see my sinus symptoms improve even more.</li>
            <li> I have been nothing but pleased with this oil and intend to purchase again as willas other oils from plant therapy.  I have used it in my dental routine mostly and have noticed healthier gums.  I am so happy that it has had a positive affect on my dental health.  Also the smell is great in my homemade deodorant.  Just added a few drops to that recipe and I the smell is outstanding but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> We love this germ-fighter blend, an alternative to &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; oil.  We use it every night on our feet and it has helped keep our household healthy, along with using it in a diffuser.  The quality &amp; price are just right!  I am happy to support Plant Therapy products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about whether this product fights off any illnesses, but it arrived promptly and well packaged. I put  a few drops into my bath water along with some lavender and bergamot oil. I felt very relaxed and the scents were lovely.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist uses this when she has a cold to keep her clients from being infected.  I&#x27;ve never contracted her colds in over 6 months of regular massage.  I purchased to use on airplanes, as I somehow manage to get sick after flying.  So far, 4 flights, no colds.  Finger&#x27;s crossed</li>
            <li> I have bought a similar product from my local Health Food Store which I loved. When they ran out and couldn&#x27;t find a supplier I decided to try an Amazon purchase. I could smell some of the main ingredients in this oil blend but there is a kind of nasty aroma which makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Reasonably priced and as effective as the 50.00 bottles sold by other retailers. I diffuse and use on the bottoms of my feet</li>
            <li> Love this product. I diffuse it through the hose during the flu season. Rub it on feet diluted in oil too. I like the price and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I put it in a diffuser at night and the next morning it was like I drank it...the taste was in my mouth and my stomach felt sick.  A few days later I smelled the bottle again to test &amp; same thing.  Not sure if bottle is bad or not, can&#x27; return it.</li>
            <li> Theives oil works wonderfully. I use it mixed with water or oil as a replacement for disinfectant spray. Smells better and works very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this during flu season to diffuse in my office. Everyone loved the &amp;#34; smell&amp;#34; as they came in and I didn&#x27;t get the cold/ flu that many had this year.</li>
            <li> PLANT THERAPY MAKES GREAT ESSENTIAL OILS --- I HAVE PURCHASED A NUMBER OF THEM AND RATE THEM ALL A 5 -- I LOVE THEM. THIS PARTICULAR BLEND IS EQUAL TO THIEVES ESSENTIAL BLEND OIL, BUT LESS EXPENSIVE --- THIS IS A VERY GOOD OIL BLEND TO HAVE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN SO MANY OF US GET SICK DUE TO THE BITTER COLD AND ALL THE SNOW.  I RECOMMEND TRYING IT YOURSELF.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it is a great germ fighting blend. I mix it with almond oil and rub on my kids&#x27; feet before bedtime. I also put 20 drops in a water sprayer and mix with distilled water to spray pillows, the car, etc. I will continue to buy this product. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other germ fighter blends that just didn&#x27;t smell very good but this one smells fantastic! I put this in my liquid hand soap and I mixed up a bottle of cleaner for my kitchen counter tops. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Good product make the room fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as Thieves, and it stings when applied on the skin. My brother has used this product, receives some relief.</li>
            <li> Awesome, awesome product!!  Have purchased a couple of times and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing about the brand this formula compares to (it starts with a T and is what you might call a band of robbers) for years on a parenting message board I frequent. The T. brand was incredibly expensive and I wanted to try a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; to see what the fuss was all about. I have three elementary-age children and they are prone to little ailments that require attention. I also try to use natural cleaning products in the home most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I used the oil on was a plantar&#x27;s wart on my daughter&#x27;s foot that freezing wasn&#x27;t working for. Twice a day I put the oil on a bandaid and within about 2 weeks, the wart turned black and fell out. Her foot looks perfect now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on a painful, ingrown toenail that my son had. Within 24 hours it was better and within 48 it was definitely on the way to being cured. It was red and infected and very painful on the first day. By the second day, the redness was gone but it was still swollen. By the end of that day, the pus came out (I know, gross!) and my son was impressed (he is 8...they are impressed by such things.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being a handy-first aid item, I use it in my homemade, all purpose cleaner recipe. I take a spray bottle, fill it about 2/3 with water, 1/3 white vinegar, a tsp. or less of Dawn detergent and about 8-9 drops of this oil. It is deodorizing and it may be an effective germicide. It certainly seemed to kill the germs/viruses that were affecting the children here anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I should add that I think it smells wonderful.  Sort of Christmassy if you will. I will definitely keep this stuff on hand.</li>
            <li> So much more affordable and seems to work well. It&#x27;s not as nice smelling at Thieves, but it&#x27;s still nice at 1/2 the cost!</li>
            <li> This is our third purchase. We love the Germ Fighter Synergy blend! We used during &#x27;flu season, and it was marvelous.</li>
            <li> This is somewhat different from the usual that I buy, but much cheaper. I&#x27;ve only used it once but it seems to work .</li>
            <li> I love this blend and the price is much better than young livings thieves. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the oil comes out a bit fast.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully effective.  As strong in smell &amp; effectiveness as other more expensive essential oil blends.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> When two of my 3 kids had croup I really needed something to help ease their coughing at night. They also have asthma. I didn&#x27;t have a lot to lose or high expectations when I got this but man was I wrong. The first night my daughter slept much more comfortably than she had in days despite being on steroids to keep her breathing easier. My son also benefited and now within 3 days the cough is all but gone. Amazing. The smell is nice, spicy and warm with the main top notes being cloves and cinnamon. It&#x27;s not a combination I&#x27;d look for on my own but it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make homemade toothpaste. It works great! Good for gums and bad breath!</li>
            <li> I use this in a diffuser if I am coming down with a cold.  I also put it on the soles of my feet and lower back.  It really seems to help me fend off illness, or if I forget to use it until I am sick, it shortens my illness.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very very close to thieves product - which I found was TOO expensive.  I use this in a school classroom and the kids love it too.  Assistnt teachers who amble into the classroom invariably comment on the wonderful aroma!  I am not sure if it helps health wise, but it can&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> I think it has a bit more cinnamon that &#x27;thieves&#x27; which I love! I also love the size for the money!</li>
            <li> This product appears to be every bit as good as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; at a fraction of the cost.  The company stands behind their products and wants to make sure your happy.  I am so excited to find this product that I have let all my essential oil using friends know about it.  You will too!</li>
            <li> VERY comparable to Young&#x27;s EO ... Thieves... smells JUST LIKE IT for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a version of thieves oil.  I like it but have no proof that it is actually killing germs.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell for sure if it will make cold/flu season easier. The scent is pleasant; I mixed it with grapeseed oil to rub on my feet. I also mixed it with water in a spray bottle as a disinfectant.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with price. Quality TBD when we fight the germs!</li>
            <li> excellent oil!!!! keeps you healthty!!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful! I absolutely love it! I almost hope cold season gets here soon so I can see how well it really works!</li>
            <li> I am in the process of learning the benefits of essential oils.  I am keeping this going in a diffuser to keep our air healthy.  I have used thieves also and find both to be very similar.  This one is significantly lower in price.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and I think it works. I cannot prove it, but my son did not cough when we use this blend.</li>
            <li> This is very good essential oil.  It is very healing.  You can rub it underneath your toes and put socks on. Also, you&lt;br /&gt;can put a pot of water on the stove with a few drops of this oil.  Turn the heat down on low.  It will help sinus congestion and&lt;br /&gt;colds.</li>
            <li> Compared to Thieves Oil by Young Living which is way overpriced this stuff is great!  Same oils, same peace of mind.  My whole family is using this throughout the flu season and we&#x27;ve been well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this when it came, that instead of testing it on myself first like would have been the smarter option, I put it straight onto the bottom of my 18 month olds feet.  &#x27;Cause, gosh darnit, I wanted that stinkin&#x27; illness to go away fast!  All was going well, until about 30 second later, when he started screaming bloody murder and kicking his little feet all over the place.  I washed his feet really well and it still took about 10 minutes for the burning to calm down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T DO IT.  It&#x27;s a trick.  I did try it on myself after that, and it was not bad, just a little tingle.  But I can see how that would hurt on sensitive, little-people feet.  I have, however, been putting a couple drops into the vaporizer water whenever I fill it (I don&#x27;t want this stuff to just go to waste!).  I honestly don&#x27;t feel this has helped shorten any sicknesses.  Believe me, we have 2 in daycare, and they are always sick.  I&#x27;ve already had mulitple illnesses to test this stuff on.  I&#x27;m skeptical...</li>
            <li> I am using this in my essential oil diffuser/humidifier.  So far, it has a good smell, but we will see once my kids start school if they catch everything that goes around!</li>
            <li> This is a very strong anti-bacterial plant oil that I also use for sinusitis and overall immune boost from bacterial infections. Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> The scent is SO strong! I love this blend! I put it in my diffuser. I think it&#x27;s kept us healthy too.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing. We  diffuse it and keeps the germies away. This is a great value and we use it all the time. It does not have any funky patchouli in it which is something that I run into with a lot of blends. It smells a little like christmas/ cinnamon rolls. Very pleasant. Exactly like the Doterra OnGuard that costs a fortune.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is pure and the same stuff as &amp;#34;Thieves.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They always seem to have what I need at best price! I keep coming back!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  The fragrance is indeed the same as Thieves.  I use it in my difuser to cleanse my home of harmful microbes.</li>
            <li> 100% pure is rare and it has the smell the germ runaway from- I use it in a spray bottle and it is my handsanitzer, throat spray, etc. etc. Nice product</li>
            <li> It was a great price when I got it. And the bottle size was bigger. Now they have a smaller bottle and higher price. It is still cheaper than everything else.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it really helps keep you healthy but I don&#x27;t get sick. the cinnamon is strong in this product and I love it.</li>
            <li> We buy a lot of oils for various reasons. Finding a replacement for thieves oil has become a challenge for some reason and finding the right mixture is very important. We are very happy with this mixture  because it is perfect. Thank you so much. We will be buying our oils here from now on.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this, it&#x27;s a great value. It doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals but it is super harsh and basically all cinnamon. Really nothing close to thieves from Young Living :(</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, is perfect, was surprised it was not the brand I had used before however no worries as it smells &amp; works great :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on essential oils or anything and had tried thieves but it was a bit pricey for me so I tried this instead. I am hopelessly hooked on it. My humidifier has a built in well for essential oils and I put about 3-4 drops in every night before bed and sleep like a baby. I seem to have fewer problems with congestion and keeping my fingers crossed-not a cold since!</li>
            <li> I was going to make my own Thieves formula when I came across this bottle and it seemed like a good price.  I had never smelled Thieves, but everyone seemed to say it smelled like \\&quot;Christmas\\&quot;, so I had this idea in my head.  I stuck some on a cotton ball and put it in the room nearby to cleanse the air.  I ended up having to move it to another room due to the strong smell.  It reminded me more of vapor-rub, as it was filling and clearing my lungs.  I am going to try it diluted in a spray-bottle and see how that works out, and maybe adding some other oils.    A week later: Now after using the oil diluted in a bottle as a room spray, and in my vinegar water to clean floors and surfaces, and also diffusing it to add a pleasant scent as well as kill germs...I actually now love it!  It smells much better than straight out of the bottle; maybe it took my nose awhile to get use to the scent.  I am thinking of ordering some bottles for gifts.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived quickly and is much, much, much more affordable than Young Living&#x27;s Thieves blend. I believe that it will probably work well to naturally fight germs and viruses, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t smell just like Thieves, which is half of the reason I love that blend! This blend seems to be much heavier on the eucalyptus, and Thieves has a dominant note of cloves. I will still use this blend to clean with and maybe diffuse when someone in the family has an upper respiratory illness, but I loved being able to diffuse Thieves anytime I wanted a wonderful smell that also killed germs.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  The scent is a bit different.  I like it but some may find it a bit strong.  I mix with a carrier oil and use it on my hands.  I do not know if it will prevent the winter germs from making me sick, wash hands, apply my moisture oil and you are doing the best you can.  Great scent for winter- have not yet tried with the diffuser burner- it should work well for me.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; as more highly priced blends.  I burn it in an oil burner and I put it on the bottom of our feet.  It truly does keep my family healthy.  I would never be without it in our house, and when this runs out, I willl be ordering again from Plant Therapy.  This is a large bottle, not the small bottle that essential oils usually come in and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic essential oil for cleaning or to use when I am not feeling well.  I use it in my deodorant blend and it is more efficient than any store bought deodorant I have found.  It is an excellent combination.</li>
            <li> Hands Down, best thing out there. I highly recommend this product. I use it as a substitute for the higher priced Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; quality. Just like thieves.</li>
            <li> A bit sweeter...not quite as spicy as Young Living Thieves.  But for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance.  I have used other &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; (we add to our homemade tooth cleaning mixture).  Pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a less expensive option to &amp;#34;young living theives&amp;#34; and though I don&#x27;t like it as much as the young living version, it fits the bill!</li>
            <li> When my son starts school every year, he always get either a sinus or ear infection.  I bought this in August and started him on it.  He still has seasonal allergy problems, but he has not been sick since we have started with it.  It smells great too.  I rub it on the bottom of his feet before bed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for use in a diffuser. Makes the house smell wonderful and helps us get over nasty bugs faster. I love that it comes in this larger size. I go through so much of it that next time, I&#x27;m ordering the 3-oz. size. :)</li>
            <li> I make up spray bottles with purified water and this oil and spray in bathrooms, surfaces, kitchen - everywhere and love it.</li>
            <li> Best Thieves oil I&#x27;ve ever used!! I use this on my whole family. While everyone around us has had family members contract the flu, we have stayed well.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific. I have used it in my dishwasher, diffused it into the air, and even put some in the laundry. My brother has used it directly on his feet and says that it has helped clear his sinuses. We are glad to have found it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use  YL, Rocky Mountain and Plant Therapy essential oils.  I have been more and more impressed with Plant Therapy.  Plant Therapy Germ Fighter is a very close comp to YL Thieves and I will not spend the extra $$ for YL in the future.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 7 yr old son when he came down with a high fever and virus, all symptoms vanished in about 12 hrs!</li>
            <li> Low Voltage Arrester for ATS&lt;br /&gt;TM-GL-L2FL220V</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for over a month. Made up a combination of coconut oil and synergy oil blend.&lt;br /&gt;Use it everynight on my feet, and I feel great.  I&#x27;ve been around a lot of sick people and haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;caught anything.  Would continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> This is not Thieves. I used it in the same way I have used Thieves, in a diffuser necklace, and it burnt my skin, causing redness, itching and swelling that lasted several hours. The product did not TOUCH my skin, it was on a disk NEAR my skin. Thieves does not burn. Beware if you will use this product near the skin, to inhale, etc. (I actually thought I was ordering Thieves, a product I use daily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not sure what \\&quot;therapeutic grade\\&quot; means if I can&#x27;t get too close to it. I&#x27;m going to try it on a cotton ball in my car and enjoy the scent. I might try mixing it in a spray bottle and spraying it in my kids stinky shoes, etc. where it does not contact the skin. This large bottle, for a great price, will probably last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly and seller appears to be good, although I have not contacted seller.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing. i added a few drops to my deo, I use it for aromatherapy, anything I can think of. Wonderful smell and my cut wound finally healed after putting this oil on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty fair dupe for more expensive oils. It smells great and a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t ingest it so no advice on that but in a diffuser and cleaning products I really like it.</li>
            <li> Item as described and customer service is great!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product!  It&#x27;s an exceptional mixture of great oils, has a good smell and is an excellent germ killer.  This company&#x27;s oils are all awesome and I am always happy with them.  The company is great too as they ship promptly and package well.  I just wish they sold it in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It is high quality but cheaper than that expensive brand you see online.  I dilute this into coconut oil and use it as a chest rub. It helped my chest cold move out a lot faster than usual.  I would definitely order in the future.</li>
            <li> Apply to the bottom of the feet when you feel the beginnings of a cold.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff during cold and flu season!</li>
            <li> Exactly like Young Living Thieves oil.  I use it in a diffuser in my school clinic.  Highly recommeded!</li>
            <li> While the smell of this oil is strong, a dab here and there is not over powering.  Still using to see the results!</li>
            <li> I was given antibiotics for fungus weird rash on the bottom of my daughter&#x27;s foot and she had already taken antibiotics for an ear infection days before so I decided to look for thieves oil as alternative read a little about it online and it worked amazingly it has cleared up her irritation under her foot now skin is smooth and no more problem this is the first time I use thieves oil and I&#x27;m just so excited it works!!!! Thank you for fast delivery to!</li>
            <li> Plant therapy products are great and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff...I use it in my humidifier and put a drop on my scarfs when outside i  the cold. I havent caught the flu yet (work i  a hosptial)...I cNt say that is because of this or not, but I think it has contributed! Theives Oil (what this oil really is) Rocks IMO!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!!! Smells soooo good!  My husband and 9 year old son love it too!!</li>
            <li> Really great price for &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; thieves oil. Don&#x27;t pay high prices for this mixture. Great antimicrobial. Use it in all sorts of ways.</li>
            <li> We use this during the flu season especially. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the health of my family since using it.</li>
            <li> great for a spattering on throw pillows, bottom of sheet, on a piece of paper towel near your computer, etc.!</li>
            <li> Smell is terrible and does not seem to do anything. Smells like pure cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Yet to try...but love their products. Glad to have this one in-case-of flu.</li>
            <li> We love the scent, it fills the whole house. I would recommend Plant Therapy to all that seem to buy more expensive but are truly receiving less.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Plant Therapy , Jerry and Nancy</li>
            <li> This works fantastic.  Highly recommended.  I was feeling a bit under the weather.  I put thus on the bottoms of my feet. Went to bed. Felt much better in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil for my diffuser. Not watered down. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this to make cleaners for my home, and is smells great. My house feels clean, and it&#x27;s safe for my kids and pets.  If you are looking for a safe way to clean your home, this is it.</li>
            <li> This stuff does smell a bit different than Thieves, but it is close.  It is much closer to Thieves than the Doterra product and less expensive as well.  I still buy Thieves, but this acts as a good low cost supplement for some of the less important uses of Thieves (cleaning, air freshening, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jaden</li>
            <li> This is great to have around the house~!</li>
            <li> Love this oil blend.  Good clove smell.  Not overpowering...just the right amount for us.  Will be using it when we head to Disney World in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this oil in the past and I will purchase it again in the future. I diffuse it, use it in my laundry and make inhalers for the cold and flu season.  I have even put it in boiling water in our hotel room and let the germ fighting steam rise into the room. I have also made a room spray/linen spray with this germ-fighting oil.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and item was just as described.  Very happy to add this oil to my collection</li>
            <li> It smells just like thieves from Young Living Oil.....but the smell lasts about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is potent stuff that works incredibly well for diffusing and making a cleaning solution. The house smells clean and fresh and I hope this keeps some of the fall and winter illnesses at bay.</li>
            <li> We have used Thieves for years for our teeth, but it is very expensive. This seems to work just as well, does seem to have less cloves in it.</li>
            <li> This smells like cinnamon...not like a proper thieves oil blend.  I am very disappointed and have gone back to making my own.  I like the smell of cinnamon but not for the price of this vial.  I prefer the balanced smell of clove, cinnamon, eucalyptus, rosemary and limon.  It makes me wonder about the formula.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Germ fighter is as good as the others and ginger was a nice touch. Ginger is an often overlooked nasty germ fighter in its own right</li>
            <li> We love this essential oil blend. I use it in so many ways. We make a disinfectant spray for cleaning my house and even keep little ones in the cars to keep the steering wheel and handles cleaner, plus it helps the car to smell good. I also use this in homemade soaps to help battle the winter colds. When we start to get a sore throat, we mix a couple drops with some sweet almond oil and massage it on our necks. Nine times out of ten it never turns into anything serious. I got a bad case of strep throat around Thanksgiving and sprayed it directly onto my tonsils every time it started to hurt for a couple days. It definitely helped when Chloroseptic couldn&#x27;t help at all. If you&#x27;ve never done it this way, it tastes awful for about 30 seconds but after you get used to it, it&#x27;s not bad and I really think it helped to lessen the duration of the virus. I would highly recommend this blend to anyone. We have used the Young Living blend of Thieves for a couple years and this works just as well and is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in place of the Thieves oil because the price was so much better.  I have never tried Thieves and would be very curious to compare the two.  With that said, I did find this oil to have a pleasant aroma and I believe the quality is very good.  The sent is more cinnamon that I anticipated, but it is very nice.  I use it in our home and also in my car.</li>
            <li> In my household, with the crazy flu going around we all use this oil.  I diffuse it  and it smells great.  We use it added to lotion with no side effects except a wonderful rich aroma.  Would highly recommend.  Love the price and the size of the bottle.  Will definitely keep in stock in my home!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  We have used Young Living products for years.  Got this for what i would say is the price it should be at!</li>
            <li> I started coming down with my first cold of the fall season. I decided to try my Plant Therapy Germ Fighter Therapeutic oil blend that I ordered from Amazon. I sniffed the oil about 3 times that day and I rubbed some of the oil on my feet before I went to bed.  I woke up in the morning feeling fine. The cold was gone.  In the past it takes me over a week to get rid of a cold.  Then my cold often goes into a sinus infection.  I am a believer in Germ Fighter. I now have convinced my daughter and a couple of friends to buy some Germ Fighter.</li>
            <li> The oils are great, considering the price, and the germ fighter smells better than I expected.  I used this particular one in my humidifier and it helped with congestion.  The cinnamon seemed to be the most noticable smell, which was nice.</li>
            <li> I feel like this works okay and it&#x27;s a great price, but it&#x27;s not exactly the same as Young Living Oils Thieves mix.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  If you&#x27;ve never smelled Thieves I&#x27;d say go for it, but if you&#x27;re used to YLO&#x27;s mix, it won&#x27;t be the same for you.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, although I have only used it a couple of times, I have been using a brand that cost 3 times as much, recently had a tickle in my throat, runny nose, cough, so I used my new oil on the soles of my feet after diluting with sweet almond oil to 2%. I  Usually use every 2 hours for the first day. It took care of my cold/flu.  I do not like the smell as well, smells like cloves. strong, but that is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Scent is a little strong, but I just started with EO&#x27;s. Loving it!</li>
            <li> A life saver for people suffering from environmental illness such as toxic mold and chemtrails: brain fog, blurry vision, chronic fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just put a few or more drops in spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the reviews, I agree that this is a less expensive and most effective alternative to the thieves oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also use this before open houses as people love the smell of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. Seems to be just as potent as Young Living&#x27;s oil, only way more affordable. Will definately buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Have used this with shea butter to rub on the bottom of our feet when we get a cold and diluted in a spray bottle for an air freshener.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own foam soap.  It appears to be good quality.  I also purchase Young Living Thieves and if I compare the two the Germ Fighter oil is thinner consistency and has a different smell.  Since there is no way for me to &#x27;test&#x27; the effectiveness of this, I have to assume it works.  I am happy with it overall though.  I will continue to purchase to use in my soap.  I will probably continue to purchase the Y.L. brand though to use topically or in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for several months. In that time, my son who has suffered from sore throats several times a year had one about two months ago. This product, delivered via small atomizer (5-8 drops in 1 oz liquid) directed to the back of his throat, eliminated his sore throat in 24 hours. I also used used it in the oil diffuser in a Vicks humidifier in his room for a few hours. Another child of mine had a sore throat/cough a few weeks later and this worked for him also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have since used it with several drops in a small spray bottle for sanitizing kitchen countertops and surfaces. I have successfully killed odors/germs in our kitchen drains by putting a few drops in the drain. A spray of it on the hands and rubbing them together is a great way to kill germs too, and more convenient and less messy than gel hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li> great product, great price&lt;br /&gt;excellent service. Product rvcd quickly.&lt;br /&gt;compares well to young living thieves oil.&lt;br /&gt;will buy this agin</li>
            <li> We looked for a long time for affordable essential oils. A friend showed me this. It&#x27;s just as good as the brand that is twice the price.</li>
            <li> Having used Thieves Oil in the past, I was a little hesitant to change products, but this is just as good, if not a little cheaper than thieves oil. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells great and a couple drops in my water or tea taste good. I would recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for Doterra OnGuard.  It is very offensive. Would NOT recommend the Germ Fighter.  However, I do like the other Plant Therapy oils that I have and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love this EO Blend - just like Thieves but less $$. Use it on the soles of the feet and in the diffuser in my massage room. Clients love the aroma - very light as many folks are averse to scents. I love that i breathe it in all day!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a more affordable option to YL Thieves.  I found this for a fraction of the price.  The scent is very comparable to the other brand.  I use it mostly for aromatherapy in a diffuser.  It is not as dark or as thick as the other brand, but you get twice as much for way less.  I am very happy with my purchase and it works well for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I order both Immune-Aid and Germ Fighter to use as a natural approach to turn against potential flu. Germ Fighter has a pretty strong cinnamon smell, while Immune-Aid is more sweet and mild. What makes me glad is that the company is responsible enough to send email for purchase feedback, leaving their contacts in case I had something unpleasant during usage. However since I&#x27;m still in a strong allergy reaction from another brand oil, I will probably don&#x27;t apply them in any skin touch or massage for now, and just use them in cleaning to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t sell Young Living and generally refuse to buy from pyramid schemes in general.&lt;br /&gt;However, we had a mold problem, and this stuff is obviously not as high quality as the Thieves we bought from Young Living for the problem. We&#x27;ll see if we can find another use for it.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with any essential oils and I am impressed.  I put it on my feet and my cold/flu that had been hanging on for weeks disappeared the next day.  Gave some to my sister and she had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Read about other uses and tired it mixed with hot water and a mop in the bathroom and kitchen, a few drops goes a very long way.  Best use I have found so far is that by putting a few drops in the rarely used guest bathroom toilet it stays fresh even when it goes weeks without flushing.  No ring in the bowl.</li>
            <li> use it every day in my toothpaste</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34; blend, but less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I love the aromatherapy value and its ability to clean the air of bacteria/mold spores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blend for about 6 months now, and dare I say -- I like it better than any of the theieves blends?  I actually prefer the YL brand but can&#x27;t bring myself to drop that much for a 10ml bottle.  I&#x27;ve bought about 5 different theives blenda on amazon and this one, in my opinion, smells the best and lasts the longest.  I add 5 drops to my little diffuser before bed each night and I rub it on the bottom of our feet.  Since we&#x27;ve been using it, my 2 year old&#x27;s daycare has had several bouts of the cough and cold spread around, and he was the only one to remain somewhat unscathed.  He did get a runny nose for several days, but never ran a fever or had to stay home like other kids did.  I still can&#x27;t get my husband on the bandwagon, and he&#x27;s the only one is out household (me, him, a 2 year old and a 9 month old) to get sick since we&#x27;ve been using it.  This is my go- to brand now that I&#x27;ve tried several others.  Would definitley recommend.</li>
            <li> when my husband and baby got sick i started using this on my feet. I catch everything! not this time. yay!</li>
            <li> I had bought the DoTerra version of this and when I ran out I looked for something less expensive. This is about half the cost and is just as good of a product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the quality of this oil</li>
            <li> Love it ! Great smell. Used it  and felt  better after one day along with Breathe easier oil  for a recent bout with sinus infection / bronchitis.</li>
            <li> This Product is awesome and I use it on a wide variety of issues, including the common colds, skin issues, bug bites and sores.</li>
            <li> I make homemade body wash, toothpaste, mouthwash, etc. and when the formula calls for 20 drops of essential oil I only use half or less  from this brand. Why? This essential oil is not diluted so it is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the lavender oil. I will buy more when I have more money.</li>
            <li> this is my go-too &amp;#34;potion&amp;#34; when I think I&#x27;m getting sick.  I put a few drops in boiling water and inhale the vapors.  It always works.</li>
            <li> My son has always suffered from sinus issues and allergies, and I thought I would give this a try and I must say, when he suffers from a sinus headache, it has helped him every time. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as awesome as thieves, but it works really well to get over a cold! Rubbed a few drops on bottom of my feet twice a day and all my symptoms were gone within a day!  (Also put a few drops in an oil warmer in the room.)</li>
            <li> I use it in my diffusers around the house to kill bacteria in the air. Much cheaper then Young Living.</li>
            <li> Same as Theives oil, use it for colds and in my homemade soap</li>
            <li> This product is great. My husband &amp; I both use it on  our feet mixed with coconut oil. Makes a significant difference in our allergy suffering.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> I originally got this to make hand sanitizer, and absolutely fell in love with this oil.  It smells amazing, almost like gingerbread cookies. In addition to making hand sanitizer with it I&#x27;ve added it to some homemade salves and  use a few drops to wipe down my countertops and mop my floors and it makes the house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Although this isn&#x27;t the exact blend of On-Guard by Doterra, it functions well and is a great value! We use this in our difusser daily, in our hand soaps, and applied topically (diluted in oil). I have been satisfied with all of the Plant Therapy oils I have received.</li>
            <li> There are many different formulations for this type of blend. I really like cinnamon and this one delivers. Excellent blend and just as hoped and better than expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I will be keeping this in our home at all times! It smells great and killing germs at the same time!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I was looking for an oil that was the same quality as Thieves but less expensive.  Well this oil smells great and I have been using it almost daily!  I am thankful that Amazon has this wonderful germ fighting oil available at such a bargain price.  I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to find this! It&#x27;s helps a lot wit my health conditions! Defiantly will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was trying to save money by not going with the more expensive essential oils and I highly regret it. I purchased three bottles of different scents from Plant Therapy Essentials Oils and they smell nothing like what they are labeled. I have used both Young Living and DoTerra in the past and will be switching back. Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them. I have requested a refund/credit, but if that doesn&#x27;t happen I will be throwing these oils out.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The price is great too. It&#x27;s very strong so it should be diluted before use. Much cheaper than thieves oil.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this EO! Smells a little like cinnamon. Don&#x27;t know if it is working for the purpose intended, but I&#x27;m going to keep using and hope I don&#x27;t get sick. (But I also try to eat right - no processed sugar and very little other sugars, no wheat/gluten, lots of whole, unprocessed foods, etc.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as my young living thieves.  I purchased this before I started using thieves because I thought I would save some money and it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing right?  Nope.. wasn&#x27;t impressed.  It&#x27;s like comparing a tomato and a tomato one taste amazing and the other ehh.  you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve got until you have the real thing.</li>
            <li> LOVE this EO!  It&#x27;s a great buy, works beautifully and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The fragrance is fabulous.  It&#x27;s great to kill bacteria in the air, the laundry, in general home cleaning, etc.  It&#x27;s a quality product that I&#x27;ll definitely buy again and highly recommend.  Excellent product, price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to usually write reviews.  However, this stuff is amazing. I bought the glass roll containers to dilute in a carrier oil and to apply easy.  I have three girls and one has a very week immune system. But since we started applying this, only when we see signs of sickness it takes it away.  I mean it takes the illness away fast. Fever for only a day, since school started, and that was a weekend. So no missed school.  Last year she missed a day or two a week.  She also had an infection on her thumb. We first thought she broke it so we took her to urgent care. It was three times it&#x27;s size. It was so bad they had to pop the thumb.  I rubbed this on her thumb (diluted) and the infection was gone a day later.  I still have an unused bottle of antibiotics in the fridge.  Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and grrrreat price!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment great product</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of this in 4 ounces of coconut oil to do oil pulling.  Others here at work keep getting sick and I have only had one sick day this year - and that was due to a standard medical procedure that I due for.  I am amazingly healthy for someone in my mid-60&#x27;s and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this morning and night.  First night I put in on my chest, slept better than I have for a very long time.  The smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> SO worth it! Use for decongestion, colds, stress, immune support, cleaning. Dilute and use for massage. Place a few drops in pot of boiling water and steam the house. Smells more spicy than the other brand, which is fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this. I&#x27;m not sure I can testify to its germ fighting powers, but it smells wonderful. I add it to water in a glass spray bottle and spritz it liberally around the house. The scent is warm, refreshing, and perfect for winter. People always seem to like it. It isn&#x27;t heavy or cloying.</li>
            <li> Began using this as soon as we received it in our childrens diffuser (along with calm the child which we also love!) and the cold&#x27;s that they both had (complete with a very productive runny nose) were nearly gone by the next day.  It&#x27;s wonderful, but use extreme caution if you use it on children under age 12 as it has eucalyptus which is not recommended unless you dilute with a carrier oil.  I would avoid it all together on skin and just diffuse, works great that way!  My husband uses it as a roll on diluted when he&#x27;s sick and it works great on him too!</li>
            <li> Carry this everywhere especially during cold and flu season when going to be in crowds or closed in spaces.  A dab on my neck area or a hankie is all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> I put a drop on my baby&#x27;s socks every night. I also put a drop in my listerine when gargling twice a day! helps sore throat right away! I put drops in hand soap and hand sanitizer. I think it really works!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t paid full price for the brand-name variety of this oil, but I&#x27;m loving this blend.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this also helped me get over the flu last month!</li>
            <li> I bought this and then ended up going to a young living party the next week and getting the starter set that comes with thieves, I find myself using germ fighter more then the thieves and It has helped minimize our cold symptoms, we&#x27;ve had two come through our house since we got it but they have been short &amp; sweet. I ended up buying some other oils from plant therapy and like all of them, respir-aid is great, it helped with my cough a lot. They also have great customer service, I emailed them several times with questions about the use of eo&#x27;s and they were very fast to respond.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite essential oil! Perfect for diffusing, making into a germ fighting spray for hands or disinfecting. It kills germs for colds, flu and other sicknesses</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order. I LOVE this blend which I use in this Flu season as (a) bedroom diffuser, (b) rubbing few drops on my feet, (c) using it under my armpits, (d) few drops diluted in water and used as Mouthwash and (e) as well apply on skin with Dermatitis. I love very pleasant (strong) smell and HOT sensations on my feet. My no. 1 Winter Oil.</li>
            <li> I received my order the next day and it was well packaged.  I love the smell of this blend and have been using it on my kids feet when they started to get sick.  After 1 day, they were better.  I made a cleaning spray with this and added a few drops to the humidifier.  I will be stocking up on this product.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and I think it has saved us from getting sick a few times. We had two bottles different sizes, potency/smell is consistent  I can&#x27;t compare to young living because I never used it, but I will definite continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Thieves oil in the past.  I do like its scent better, but the cost has made me search for an alternative.  I find Plant Therapy Germ fighter to be a very satisfactory alternative.  I think using it in a diffuser works as good as Thieves.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It smells really good and tastes really good. I have put a drop in a glass of water and it tastes so yummy.  Also, I put it in my gallon mixture of water with one apple, one cinnamon stick, a slice of ginger and one drop of oil.  It is so refreshing and tastes so good that if you are a soda drinker, this would be a great refreshing replacement for you.  I love my water and I can drink this all day long.  I have also put a drop of it with my arnica gel and rub on my knee to help in healing of a torn muscle.  I don&#x27;t know if it will help it or not but it sure does feel good on it and warms the muscles up after I put it on.  I figure it can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Plant Therapy Essential Oils company is a great, they follow up on the products they sell to make sure that you are completely happy with your product.  I will be ordering from this company again in the future for any oils that I may need.  Have a great day everyone.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and in good condition.  I have used very expensive \\&quot;Thieves Oil\\&quot; and this product had identical ingredients, and smelled exactly the same.  In the winter I use this product to creat a home made sugar scub with&lt;br /&gt;raw sugar, sweet almond oil, and a few drops of germ fighter for a wonderful scent.  I really love this product and will purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> Helps fight colds and other illnesses naturally, and it smells great!  A few drops on the bottoms of the feet, the chest and/or neck at the first sign of a cold and you are set!</li>
            <li> This is just like Theives OIl that Young&#x27;s Living Oils sells only plant therapy is not an MLM and is MUCH cheaper! This seems to be quality oil. I put a few drops in my organic liquid soap and spray cleaners, in my wash and in distilled water for a throat spray.</li>
            <li> Good size bottle that will last me quite a while. Of course hard to tell if it is fighting germs because how can you see and measure that...but I have used to add to my cleaning products and I feel like I am getting a good product and that this is helping to eliminate germs. Still trying to figure out all uses for this product. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on pulse points behind my ears, on wrists and bottom of feet. I&#x27;ve been around people with colds, even coughing in my face (grrrr), but I have not gotten sick. Seems to be doing its job. I use it daily and love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product and such a great price for a high quality oil. Its very comparable to the MLM brand and you cant go wrong with it. Dont let no one fool you into thinking this isnt the same as &amp;#34;T&#x27;s&amp;#34; brand, its spot on. Love it</li>
            <li> This oil is so amazing!  It works very well for a fraction of the price of leading brands.  I am totally hooked on this stuff.  I diffuse it in my room every night.  Apply to skin and many other uses come out of it.  It is very effective.  Love this oil and company!  Always fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about this! Total life saver when running around with 2 kids. Will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Germ-Fighter: Lemon, Clove, Eucalyptus, Cinnamon cassia, and Rosemary&lt;br /&gt;This is a similar type blend to YL thieves, doterra on guard, edens garden four thieves. I have used all and find all are effective. If you have children, there is a child safe blend by this company called Germ Destroyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: I like the scent, it is a strong scent though, but christmasy, which most people like, I can&#x27;t imagine someone finding this scent to be offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this at a 2% dilution on me, to my feet at the pressure points in my feet and my spine, and then I follow the pressure points associated with what illness I am trying to ward off. I have no doubt that this oil is effective because my husband is military and around new Marines non stop as he is an instructor, and with that amount of people he brought home pretty much every cold and flu I could think of. I haven&#x27;t gotten sick since using this blend, which is about 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend dilution starting with a low dilution because of the hot oils in it. I have sensitive skin so I started with 1% to see how I handled it, and I stayed at 2% and find this works just fine. Wash your hands after because it is not pleasant to get this in your eye by accident, or your lips. I have seen others recommend this oil applied to the lips, but I can not recommend that because the clove and cinnamon bark may irritate as they are powerful oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know the story behind the Four Thieves I recommend you read it just so you know where this came from. It&#x27;s about 4 thieves who were robbing graves and using these ingredients to ward off the plague. It&#x27;s interesting to just know the story behind it. Germ Fighter is a blend based off this tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of uses for this oil and you will find many just by using google. This is an oil I recommend you have regardless if you like the scent or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix Germ Fighter and purified water into spray bottle to kill bacteria and harmful germs. By spraying in front of the A/C unit, the mixture travels through the filter onto bed covers, sheets, pillowcases and bathroom counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot). You also will likely find the reviews for other products I use with my essential oils such as rollerballs, carrier oils, inhalers, carrying cases, diffiusers, etc. I didn&#x27;t buy all through amazon, some were purchased from the sellers website, so I may not show up as a verified reviewer on some, but I am only reviewing products I own and have tried.kill bacteria and harmful germs.

            <li> I have made my own version of Thieves Oil and I think this product, as well as being affordable, compares favorably with the recipe.</li>
            <li> I am normally sick all winter long.  This was my first winter of using the germ fighter oil and I did not get one single cold!  This stuff is no joke!  I bought extra bottles to share with family and friends!  Do not spend the extra money on the Young living brand, this is just as good.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. My husband gets abscesses and this stuff heads them off once they pop up. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, warm and cinnamony. I add to the humidifier and so far the family is healthy (in addition to healthy nutrition).</li>
            <li> I bought this because my OnGuard ran out and it is just too expensive. Just judging from the taste, this seems like it is lesser quality and tastes as if it is almost purely some sort of lesser grade cinnamon oil. I can&#x27;t really taste anything but the cinnamon. I have never tried the name-brand Thieves Oil, so maybe it tastes the same. I view most of this stuff as snake oil anyway but OnGuard really did take that I&#x27;m-getting-sick-tickle-in-the-throat away for 3-4 hours and I would gargle and drink some more diluted in water. I noticed to reaction from this oil so I think it is pretty much pointless for me to take it. I do like the taste of cinnamon though, so there&#x27;s that...</li>
            <li> As ordered!  Love Thieves!  My only suggestion is rather trivial, I would of liked an eye dropper top, would make life a bit easier.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is so versatile. I use it to make a cleaning solution for the counters.&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I was looking for an immune booster for my 1 year old daughter who kept getting colds all winter. I have been putting the diluted solution on her feet in the mornings and also diffusing it in her room when she seems like she&#x27;s coming down with something. It may be coincidence, but since I started using the product on her she hasn&#x27;t come down with any illnesses. I only rated the item 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if the product is working, or the weather change has made the difference. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It&#x27;s good and here&#x27;s more words to make up the required number yes eh yes eh</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to dilute and use on my skin --- even very diluted it burned.  I&#x27;ve never had this happen before; I have used essential oils for years.  Would be okay for other applications as long as you want everything within 50 feet to smell like tart cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Germ Fighter is wonderful. The scent reminds me of Christmastime, which is never a bad thing! I use it with my air purifier to fight airborne germs and have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, warding off colds and viruses?........smells nice</li>
            <li> While this is not an equivalent to thieves, it is an adequate substitute for my purpose.  If the price difference were only 5 dollars I would probably purchase from young living but it is not.  I am using to neutralize the air in my clinic and for that it seems a perfect fit.  For any of the disinfecting purposes it seems excellent.</li>
            <li> I was very leery of using oils for colds or anything but to make things smell good.  I have been using this in with my family now for several weeks and I am in love.  It has cut the length of colds to 2-3 days.  We use a drop rubbed on the soles of our feet in the morning and at night.  Helps with nasal congestion and chest congestion.  I am also trying it on a plantars wart that I have tried every other treatment possible on.  We&#x27;ll see how that goes.  Wonderful product for the price.  Just be very careful to cover the area you used it on and wash your hands or you may risk getting it places you do not want it.  It will burn if you get it on sensitive skin and I&#x27;m sure if in the mouth, eyes, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this! I diffuse it in my classroom and the kids love the smell, and I love the germ fighting benefits.  I&#x27;ve use the higher priced &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t tell a difference. :)</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of the blend.  BUT if it works who cares.  The problem is that one will never know if it works!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and its very aromatic! I soaked maybe two q-tips with this and now my whole room smells like a spicy kind of cinnamon. Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it though. I applied a dab of the soaked q-tip on my hand and 2 mintues later it itched and turned very red, with the redness expanding across my hand. I&#x27;m trying not to inhale it but the smell is hard to avoid. I was going to rate this 3 stars because of the reaction but the bottle came with 6 more ml than I payed for (20% more free it says) which isn&#x27;t bad and it looks of good quality.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical about whole \\&quot;EO therapy\\&quot;, and this blend in particular that it can help  to fight flu/germs, but decided to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter had a fever (101F) and I rubbed few drops in her feet, covered her with blanket and 40 min after she got sweaty and her fever went to down to normal and didn&#x27;t come back anymore ( well I kept doing it for 3 days, twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure was it coincidence or not, but when I sprayed (filtered water with 10 drops of blend, I don&#x27;t even have diffuser yet) her room - her nose started to breath well right away and the mist calmed her cough.</li>
            <li> Going to use it when SHTF.  Hope it will work then.</li>
            <li> Works very well! Just a good as Thieves by Young Living. Smells great, too!</li>
            <li> Really like the taste and scent of this better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Just getting to know the product but I love the way it smells.  It arrived quickly and well packaged.  I ordered it after reading about thieves oil being good for pets.  This is supposed to be comparable and costs much less.</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil blend. However, the first time I purchased it, it seemed &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;. The second time I ordered it, it seemed like either it was an older batch or had lost some potency as it didn&#x27;t smell as strong or have the same effect as the first bottle I had.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to be more of a cinnamon-dominant odor but the other scents are stronger in it.</li>
            <li> I love this version of the &amp;#34;four theives&amp;#34; blend. I ran out of my favoritefrom Edens Garden and  needed some fastso I took a chance on this blend and I&#x27;m happy I did. I have since shared it with my friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Young Living Thieves but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> not exactly the same as Thieves Oil, but much cheaper....love it</li>
            <li> right now this is a five star product for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;#1 it smells heavenly!! oh my Gosh, I would buy it just for the smell... it smells sooo good! I would give it 5 stars just for the smell!&lt;br /&gt;#2 - my son was suffering from a nasty case of bronchittis - now the day I  received this - I put a few drops in the humidifier cup and infused it through the house - did it all that day and all that night.... the following morning I did not hear any mucus rattling in his chest which is unbelievable.  Now I&#x27;ll say that I was giving him several herbs for this as well, and I do believe they were working but it was slow gains each day - not one day rattling and next day clear. Too good to be true -  That said, the jury is still out on this, for its germ killing capability, I will definitely update after I&#x27;ve given it some good use over a period of time.</li>
            <li> I love this as an alternative to thieves. As a single mom I really have to watch what I spend and this is a great option for less $ to keep my daughter and myself healthy..LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Great smell, love to sprinkle around my house.&lt;br /&gt;I add it to my deodorant for a good smell and on the bottom of my feet each day when I go to work (at an elementary school) to ward off illness!</li>
            <li> Works for us! I add it to aloe gel.to use in.place.of hand sanitizer and it really helps keep us from getting sick. I have a two year.old and one year.old and I use it on them too. It&#x27;s also great to rub on your chest.in a lotion if you think you&#x27;re getting sick and we often diffuse it at night to help sleep and keep the cold bugs at bay. Will buy again soon.</li>
            <li> Great way to save money. I like the blend.</li>
            <li> Our family swears by Germ Fighter and we love the results we see by diffusing it or blending it with a carrier oil to create homemade remedies for when any of us aren&#x27;t feeling the best. I have lost count as to how many times we have ordered it both through Amazon and PlantTherapy.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, our little girl got sick from some BAD bug going around at the time. She was running 103+ fevers and throwing up daily. It was terrible. It seemed like she would get better at times in the day, but then it came back with a vengeance. We heard another friend was using the product mixed with carrier oil for her little girl, who had similar symptoms(even though she lived almost 2,000 miles away). So we ordered the oils and used immediately. Our little girl had been sick for days by this point, but overnight and within 24 hours she was HEALED! Never went back to that junk and we&#x27;ve been using the product almost daily ever since. As a proactive measure and of course when someone gets a little sick. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Really like this blend. Smells similar to thieves and works well.  Have been using it on the bottom of our feet this winter, and wipes out colds in a day! No flu in our house either. What a great price too!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have ordered extra for work, friends and family.  I work with young children and have not been sick this year.  Put some in a carrier oil and rubbed it on my mother&#x27;s arthritic knee, it helped her a lot.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of placing 2 drops of this oil on my knee morning and night, the swelling from bursitis is gone, and I can bend my knee again.</li>
            <li> Has the same ingredients as Thieves Oil, at a much reduced cost, and higher quantity. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it, and will be purchasing it going forward instead of Thieves Oil (I&#x27;ve always been annoyed at how over-priced that oil blend is, and now I can purchase at a reasonable price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Plant Therapy Essential Oils ;)</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy has proven to be a solid well-run company.  Excellent products and Fantastic customer service.  I will buy from them again and again.  They supply great quality essential oils and at a fair price.  The Germ Fighter (Thieves Oil Blend) smells wonderful and has many health benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a YL distributor and I&#x27;m always apprehensive ordering other brands but I needed something comparable to Thieves rather quickly. Great quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product. Comparable to other brands.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this product from this seller.  I will continue to buy this product from them.  Love this product.  I use it in lots of ways.  I make my own laundry soap because I have so many allergies to products and I put a couple drops in this to kill any bacteria or germs that might be on our clothes.  I use it in steam to breathe when I get sinus infections.  I put it on the air filters on the furnace in the winter to help spread it throughout the house and kill those cold germs.  We rarely get colds.  We are buying a new house that had cats and has been closed up for 6 months.  Yuk......  So I will be putting it everywhere!  I will put it in my wash water to clean the fridge, stove, countertops,showers to prevent any leftover germs from the previous folks.  A couple drops in the toilet tanks.  So many uses!  I won&#x27;t continue but you get my drift.  It kills germs folks.  I like the quality, the blend and the sellers are great.  You have to love the smell.  Smells are a very personal thing. Kind of clove-ish.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil with it&#x27;s clean smell and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> Use this in a diffuser when I&#x27;m feeling the need to relax, detox, or just plain amuse myself.  More affordable than YL oils.. seems to be fairly good quality.</li>
            <li> Use all the time for my two Oil diffusers (I have 2 of the ZAQ diffusers.  Was recommended this by a friend and I passed the info on to others.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after talking to a friend about thieves oil. Many people were getting sick in the office. After doing some checking online I figured I would give it a try and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good, for the price I am satisfied. I still prefer Thieves by Young Living. Have yet to find anything as good quality-wise.</li>
            <li> This essential oil blend is completely clear, and does not smell like the oils that are contained within. Essential oils have substance, depth and, many have color. This oil blend has none of these qualities. Two of the oils in this blend are cinnamon and clove, very dark, pungent spices. The oil is clear and not pungent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because my husband has nasal polyps and on many days he can&#x27;t breathe at all through his nose. Not knowing much about aromatherapy or ratios I needed to mix it with, I mixed 2 parts coconut oil with 4 drops germ fighter.  Rubbed it on the soles of his feet and a little beside his nose, on the temples and over his eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within minutes, his right nostril was almost completely clear.  His left nostril could breathe just a bit.  The following day I added 2 drops of Ravensara oil to the mix- and wow- complete clearance in the right nostril and 75% in the left (he has a huge polyp there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works, and it smells heavenly, like Christmas dinner cooking for a big gathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks guys for a great product that&#x27;s reasonably priced.  Ordered 2 more, 1 for when we run out, (which shouldn&#x27;t be for awhile since the bottle has about 900 drops) and one for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who fall for the hype of MLMers who tout their overpriced competition, this is the same product at 1/5th the price.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Mix with water, grain alcohol and use as room spray! Even spray on my smelly cat before he runs off! All the better if it kills bacteria.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, which is Plant Therapy&#x27;s version of (Four) Thieves.  It has antibacterial properties and I use it in my homemade liquid soaps and sometimes diffuse it in the house.  This summer is the first time I&#x27;m experimenting with it as a mosquito repellent, mixing it with distilled water and witch hazel in a spray bottle.  It seems to be working, and I&#x27;m excited to have a solution that isn&#x27;t a lethal chemical!  I just ordered a lot more bottles from Plant Therapy, as I have been happy with their products, and the prices are excellent compared to other providers.  I did considerable research when I first got into essential oils, and view Plant Therapy favorably as a result.  Some of their oils are organic.  I also like the fact that I can order direct and not through a multi-level marketing scheme which only serves to bump up the prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am slightly mystified by the new label on the 30ml bottle, however.  It reads &amp;#34;Now 20% more free&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;1 fl oz. (30 ml)&amp;#34; is crossed out and amended to &amp;#34;1.21 fl oz. (36 ml)&amp;#34;.  Yet compared side by side with my prior unopened bottle, the two bottles are the exact same size, and my prior bottle is actually filled more than the &amp;#34;20% more&amp;#34; bottle.  The description has changed from &amp;#34;Essential Oil Synergy&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Synergy Blend&amp;#34;, the ingredients appear to be the same.  Very mysterious...</li>
            <li> I needed something that was similar to Thieves Essential Oil but cheaper and discovered this.  I&#x27;m amazed.  I add this to my diluted cleaning solution and you can&#x27;t even notice the difference between the Thieves cleaner and my homemade mixture.  Will continue to order and use this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil made it so I didn&#x27;t have to make my own blend of the same! Thanks</li>
            <li> Very happy with this blend.  Seems to be as effective as Four Thieves but cheaper.  Has a very pleasant smell as well.</li>
            <li> This synergy blend is great for disinfecting in cleaning. Use a few drops or so in a spray bottle &amp; add some distilled water to clean. It does smells great-very warming to the spirit! -Just be careful not to get on hands or skin, as it is so potent &amp; will burn.</li>
            <li> It might be a &amp;#34;germ fighter&amp;#34; but you&#x27;d only know if you can stomach the smell... it made me so nauseous that I had to empty it out of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 bottles and am about to purchase my third. I use this oil for everything. I mix with vinager to clean. I have a little spray bottle by the sink for fruits, veggies, and our dish sponge. I put it in pots of water when I start to feel sick. I use it on my pets diluted for flea control. This is a great price... I will continue to always buy this trusted blend.</li>
            <li> My kids and I had colds recently and really liked using this. I got some on my finger and discovered it tastes good too. I diluted it a bit and rubbed it on my swollen lymph nodes when it felt like my whole neck was sore. The swelling went way down and stopped hurting both days I did this. I&#x27;m just starting to learn about essential oils, after I used clove oil with great success for pain after wisdom tooth extraction. So far I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I did lots of research on this one because I normally buy a different brand but the Thieves Oil is so expensive in name brand.  This product is awesome and after reading reviews by several that have been working with oils for over 20 years, I decided to try it..  LOVE IT...and the price is REASONABLE..</li>
            <li> I used it every other day during this winter and the house smell fresh and we don&#x27;t get sick easily. I might find more use on this product later.</li>
            <li> I added some Evian water and a drop of carrier oil to Germ Fighter to make a spray, which I used around the house to clear the air during my husband&#x27;s flu. It smelled great, and I also put a few drops on our hands at bed time to fight germs while we slept.</li>
            <li> This year was a bad flu season and lots of other bugs going around too.  Glad to say we stayed healthy through the peak so far.  Used this stuff on our feet a couple drops to the soles daily to keep the germs away.  Also made some cleaning products and a carpet freshener with this.  I gave some to a friend, she and her kids love the scent of the carpet freshener (baking soda with a few drops of this oil blended in).  They have requested more and I have ordered a second bottle since it seems to work and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product for the first time a couple weeks ago and have used it in my humidifyer.  I cannot tell if it is helping with germs.  I put it on my wrists and the bottoms of my feet with a cotton ball just about every day.  I also use on my daughter&#x27;s wrists and feet with the hope of keeping germs at bay.  She still got a bad virus with a fever about a week after we started using it.  I&#x27;ll keep on using unless I determine that it doesn&#x27;t do anything for us.</li>
            <li> This type of products are user preference based...Just because one likes it does not mean you will and so on. With that said, i personally like this synergy oil blend. My primary purpose was to buy for sauna times when i am at the gym and such...i do, however, have a wood stove that i fire up now and then during cold winter months, and i have kettle with water boiling non-stop on the stove, serving purpose as humidifier per se, so i add some oil drops (quantity is personal preference) to the water and have a very nice aroma around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. when i first got this blend i did not know how much to add to my kettle, my first portion happened to be too much, but i still liked it since it was clearing up my breathing airways very well. As i said, do not over do on drops, but its a good blend...out of all the ingredients eucalyptus is probably the strongest in this blend.</li>
            <li> I love the blend.  It helps having it already blended together for my recipes.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product!!!  I love the smell.  The cinnamon really stands out, but it&#x27;s not at all overpowering.  I use it for everything...a drop on my toothbrush with my regular toothpaste makes my mouth feel fresh for hours, in my car diffuser for a great smelling commute, massage my feet with it and a carrier oil to boost my immune system, and simply just rub it in my skin (again with a carrier oil) so I can inhale its lovely scent.  I&#x27;m still finding new uses.  It&#x27;s amazing to me that something so powerful and effective can be so pleasingly aromatic.  I highly recommend this oil (unless you really don&#x27;t like cinnamon).</li>
            <li> Smell great and it does work.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to those pricey brands...</li>
            <li> Nice blend for a fair price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent to it. I use it in a diffuser throughout the day. Hoping it might actually keep us healthier this winter. I have also used it to clean with.</li>
            <li> So far we have been very healthy this season. I use this each time after we have been around alot of people. Also we have been around some sick folks and we have remained well:)</li>
            <li> I really love this oil...it smells so good in the house when I put it in my little crockpot with water. I also put it in a diffuser in our school room !!</li>
            <li> I use the product a lot during the winter, when we have been out and about, and when we are sick. I place a few drops in an carrier oil and have it diffuse into the air. It really helped when my family became ill. It was nice to not have to take any medicine to mitigate our cold/flu symptoms. The smell of this product is very nice. The cinnamon and cloves seem most prominent. I have no experience with Thieves oil aside from this product so I am unsure how it compares. But I would give this a try</li>
            <li> I prefer this Plant Therapy Germ Fighter over Eden Organic Four Thieves Oil. The smell was more intense and I could use less product b/c of this. I also preferred this scent overall over the Eden Garden product.  UPDATE: I have also made my own 4 Thieves oil &amp; it is much more expensive to make your own, however, I prefer to use organic oils. I do not buy this product anymore. THIS PRODUCT USED IN DIFFUSER IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR CATS.  IT WILL DAMAGE THEIR ORGANS. I AM NOT SURE ABOUT OTHER PETS, BUT PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR VET FIRST. NEVER PUT EO&#x27;s ON YOUR PETS. ------------------  This company also sent out another bottle to me when amazon messed up delivery on my order.</li>
            <li> II need to order more, it will be a staple in my cleaning cabinet</li>
            <li> I use this in a room diffuser, also in a general purpose cleaning spray.  Love the larger quantity. Buy this version.</li>
            <li> I love diffusing this oil.  Even more so gargling with this added to saltwater showed my sore throat to quickly fade.</li>
            <li> this works well for me as I am exposed to lots of illness and my immune system is compromised. Helps keep me healthy</li>
            <li> Great for rubbing on the bottom of sons feet diluted with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> A good substitute for the original</li>
            <li> smells heavenly.......but VERY EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t afford the big name brand, so I tried this. smells great. I use it in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Great for use with an electric diffuser ball - smells wonderful, too!  Fast, free shipping!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. Slightest sniffle, we are putting it on our children&#x27;s feet (and ours). Next day, no signs of anything.</li>
            <li> I like this oil. I feel it is a good value. I believe it shorten my cold and prevented the rest of my family from getting it.</li>
            <li> I use this in our homemade toothpaste and we love it. I have noticed my breath seems fresher for longer than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read this well enough before buying to understand it was for topical use only. We did use it around our nose to help with congestion but it had a pretty good sting to it that made it unpleasant. I also used it on a dog bite on my hand that was hard to bandage, and the infection did seem to clear up pretty fast. Other than that, I didn&#x27;t find the odor pleasing enough to use in a diffuser, but I am going to give it a try. What the heck. I&#x27;ve spent the money, might as well :-)</li>
            <li> I have COPD and this really opens up my lungs.  I use the Aroma Ace diffuser with it and have been very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and thought I would give it a try. well after using it for a couple months I can really tell a difference in my allergy and sinus issues.  I have suffered from them for years and this product definitely helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Good product. I would have liked instructions sent with product.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a less expensive Thieves oil.  Found the aroma to be a bit harsh, but it&#x27;s okay in disinfectant sprays/laundry detergent.  Would recommend Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s Thieve&#x27;s oil over this oil - it just has a more pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and diffusing it and am pleased. Love that it is 100% Pure, Undiluted and Therapeutic Grade essential oil blend.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this order.</li>
            <li> I used to buy another, much more expensive oil, but if have found Plant Therapy has just as good of product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Service was good whether from Amazon or Plant Therapy themselves.</li>
            <li> I love the clove, cinnamon, euculyptus smell of this oil! We have used it in our diffuser almost every day since receiving it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and a great price!</li>
            <li> This blend smells amazing, and based on my symptoms, it seems to be helping with mold spores / toxins / bacteria / whatever was making me ill in my home.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it as a room spray, mixing about a drop of Germ Fighter with each ounce of water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used any other version of thieves-type blend, so I have no comparison to make.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the pre-diluted roll-on version of this blend.</li>
            <li> I am a big person for essential oils.  This oil blend has all one needs to fight off any type of germ.  I use it for colds, tooth/gum problems, even brush with it.  I use it for cleaning the house also.</li>
            <li> Very happy with Germ Fighter synergy blend ! Same ingredients as theives  blend .. Less expensive and more of it. I put it on my feet every day and I never get sick. :) Thank you</li>
            <li> The blend is quite potent, and the price and quantity make this a bargain compared to Young Living&#x27;s Thieves or other similar makes.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I USE IT IN MY DIFFUSERS AND FROM NOW ON WILL ONLY USE THIS BLEND FROM THIS GROUP THE PLANT THERAPY. EXCELLENT OIL BLEND.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very satisfied Momma.  The price beats the multi level marketing brands and the quality does too!!</li>
            <li> Use it in my diffuser at night and like the smell as well as the germ fighting ingredients. The oil was packaged well and delivered in timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> An excellent value in both quality and cost as compared to other leading brands. This is my 3rd order for the same product from Plant Therapy</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I use it in my oil diffuser and helps my family when we start to feel like we are getting sick. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate sickness but definitely minimizes the symptoms. I also use it as a cleaner instead of using chemical/anti bacterial cleaners- since its natural germ fighter. I put 8-10 drops is a spray bottle, fill it up with water and Ive got a great cleaner. Its safe, non toxic and effective. Love this stuff, I&#x27;m buying more- so worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolute LOVE this product.  It is every bit as good as OnGuard or Thieves.  I have used both of the more expensive brands and Germ Fighter works equally as well.  I teach K4 and have a diffuser running in my classroom every day.  It has helped the spread of germs and illness. I wish it came in a purse-sized spray like Thieves though.</li>
            <li> This has been my little germ-fighting helper.  Add it to my humidifier and heater filter.  Pleasant fragrance that just feels like it’s doing something good for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product and great service in delivery and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Have reordered this item and several other items. Will use&lt;br /&gt;again and again as I learn more about this therapy.</li>
            <li> very nice for the price smell just like theive use it in my humitifier nice job would recommend it for any oil lover</li>
            <li> Expensive but I love the smell.  Use it daily with my no heat diffuser.  Smells christmasy.</li>
            <li> It smells good! Only time will tell as to it&#x27;s effectiveness. I will update.</li>
            <li> I can tell you this stuff works! I made a room spray that I use in my office and home. I have not caught that nasty cold that do many of my co workers have. This product does what it says. Also, this is the only oil that had not clogged my diffuser. I&#x27;m going to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Because of the much lower price, I was somewhat skeptical about the quality of this product, but we use thieves for so many different things that I figured we should try it. I have been very happy with this product and recommend it to others. FYI, the bottle recommends that it not be taken orally.</li>
            <li> I find this very effective with colds. Works for me just fine.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when purchasing this that it would actually be the same as Thieves Oil. I should have had no fears. The ingredients are the same, the overpowering scent and flavor is the same. The results are the same!! Great product.</li>
            <li> This wonderful blend kill germs and most critical for me MOLD!  I just dab half a dozen drops on the leftover cotton from my supplements and attached it to my mini fan with a rubber band (carefully so the rubber band doesn&#x27;t get hit by the fan blades).  Works brilliantly, and makes the house smell divine.  Already used half the bottle, time to reorder!</li>
            <li> OK...really don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my sister.  I seem to have a sensitive immune system since chemo and decided to try Germ Fighter oil to help with allergies and colds.  Update: I sent some to my daughter because I like it so well - and her immune system definitely needs help right now</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, cant comment on wether it works or not yet as just started using it on son (one drop on soles of feet and socks) to try get him over a cold. But my main concern is it burns the skin eg if it touches the outside hand (palm and soles of feet seem ok) and its v strong if ingested - burns the mouth. Which is a bit worrying. Is it pregnancy safe?</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with the quality of the oil, the larger size, and the amazing price.  This tested better for me than Thieves.</li>
            <li> I think I will enjoy this. I am not sure just what to do with it. I was  going to use it in a diffuser for a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;fragrance. Was hoping it would have more of a cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li> Just ok. It smells nothing like Thieves. I read a review that said to add clove oil. I do that, but it still isn&#x27;t the same. I&#x27;m ordering Thieves.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as good as Thieves. It smells identical and is a fraction of the price. I use it in an ultrasonic diffuser with purified water and let the smell take over my house. It is divine. And a lot safer than burning candles. A few drops of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is better than Thieves, better than On Guard. The smell is amazing and I wear it in my diffuser necklace all of the time. I&#x27;ve made a sort of perfume spray out of it (for clothing, it&#x27;s a warm oil for skin). The smell is so wonderful that my entire family loves this and is willing to use it daily. I had a &amp;#34;cold ?&amp;#34; recently and this knocked it right out, super fast. That&#x27;s why we got the LARGE bottle. I have doTerra, I have YL, I have Native American but this beats all of them. Our absolute FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> Flew to Paris from the states.  Stayed in hotels and 8 days on a ship. Used Germ Fighter generously and neither of us got sick.</li>
            <li> I am an essential oil newbie and this was my first purchase, in addition to a diffuser (Zaq). I tried it out in my diffuser and Germ fighter has a Christmas-spice kind of scent. I only had to use 1-2 drops and it smelled wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am looking forward to using it during cold and flu season later this year. I figure this will be part of our health regimen including exercise, healthy diet, judicious washing of our hands, prayer, etc. The bottle was wrapped carefully in bubble wrap and had no breakages or leakages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfied with Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil.  Very strong cinnamon smell which kills germs,</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with a carrier oil (Coconut or Almond) in my humidifier in the cup intended for vapo-rub. Makes the house smell great! I mix it with distilled water for mopping and again it makes the house smell nice. It also makes my hardwood floors shine. I also rub it on our feet before bed to help against sickness. Our family used it during a cross-country trip and didn&#x27;t get sick when others caught a bug. I can&#x27;t prove this helped but it sure smells wonderful (admittingly this blend has a stronger cinnamon oil ratio than some other &amp;#34;theives&amp;#34; blends).</li>
            <li> Great product , got here fast!</li>
            <li> I was looking for thieves essential oil to make toothpaste, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the higher price that doTerra and Young Living charge. Are we paying more for higher quality or multilevel marketing? I like the toothpaste I made: hydrated bentonite clay, celtic sea salt, germ fighter essential oil, and tea tree oil. I don&#x27;t know the exact measurements. I mix the ingredients, try it, and add whatever I think is necessary to taste better. I&#x27;ve tried adding coconut oil, and it works well too. It&#x27;s a great alternative to the very toxic toothpastes we find at the stores.</li>
            <li> It works!  My friend had a sinus infection and she mixed a couple drops with some coconut oil and applied to her feet and her stuffy head was relieved right away.  She had been on antibiotics for 2 days at the time, but it would have been interesting to see the effects without any other measures.  Some other reviewers mentioned it had a sharper aroma then Young Living Thieves and I would agree.  Once mixed with a carrier oil or with purified water for a room spray it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love germ fighter. I use it every day for so many things...I love plant therapy products.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I&#x27;ve only rubbed it on my feet.  I need a diffuser!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and extremely reasonably priced especially compared to Young Essential Oil &amp;#34;Thieves.&amp;#34; The fragrance is not quite as strong as Young&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s wonderful all the same and I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use in a diffuser.  It is very effective.  The oil is pure and does not gum it up.</li>
            <li> this was a lifesaver in the winter</li>
            <li> The smell and the use are fantastic. I use it all the time and have ordered it many times since.</li>
            <li> Great product,  will buy again.</li>
            <li> Super strong!  1 drop in a carrier oil does the trick for skin.  More than that can cause irritation.  Divine smell.  I make an all-purpose cleaner out of this, Sovereign Silver, and water.  I am definitely a Plant Therapy fan!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and I believe it keeps me from getting the flu etc. that other family members have had. I mix it with olive oil and rub it on the bottoms of my feet in the P.M. &amp; A.M. Also just inhale it.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Smelled great, diffused nicely and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to anyone with a home diffuser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Thieves Oil for some time and came across this product at less than half the price. It&#x27;s excellent!! I use it everyday during cold and flu season and I stayed healthy!</li>
            <li> This smells a lot like Thieves oil, as it is advertised. I used it to make lotion bars, and we put it in our kids&#x27; humidifiers in place of plain eucalyptus oil. Our house smells AMAZING. I am planning to add it to cleaning products, too, on the off chance it does battle germs. Here is my recipe for cleaning products:&lt;br /&gt;One part Dr. Bronners liquid castille soap&lt;br /&gt;One part filtered water&lt;br /&gt;20-30 drops of Germ Fighter&lt;br /&gt;Put all in a spray bottle and shake up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for anyone interested in natural cleaning products who enjoys this combination of smells, to wear, clean with, or make skin products with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard from several people that this product works well against fleas and mold. We put 8-15 drops in a gallon cool mist humidifier and the scent is distributed all day.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  It smells great, keeps me healthy, and tastes great too!  I will often put a drop on my tongue just to freshen my breath.  It&#x27;s flavor is delicious and makes me smile.</li>
            <li> I have tried most other essential oil brands over these last 16 years, and Plant Therapy is by far my favorite.  I love to use germ fighter in our small diffuser in different areas around our home.  I also use this in our homemade laundry soap and foaming hand soaps. I love the price and the scent and the germ fighting properties. Fast shipping too.  Thanks Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils.  I woke up with slight stuffiness/sinus congestion and put Germ Fighter in my diffuser, stood over it and breathed about 10 deep breaths... Less than two minutes my head cleared.  I was a skeptic.... But it sure worked that way for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good sub for Thieves - NOT great but good.  It&#x27;s scent is very similar to thieves and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this essential oil works, but it does, and I am assuming the odor causing mold and mildew went away.  Very nice fragrance that is not overpowering even if the effects are powerful.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I love this oil combo.  I had an ear/sinus infection and started using this in a humidifier and within days all of my symptoms disappeared.I rub it on my children&#x27;s feet anytime something is going around, seems to help a lot!</li>
            <li> This stuff is one of the best ways to clean and disinfect counters, tables, and any surface that is used for eating or is used by children.  I use it to make a foam handsoap instead of buying antibacterial hand soap.</li>
            <li> I got this Germ Fighter essential oil blend as a stand-in for Thieves oil from Young Living, which is SO expensive.  it does smell SLIGHTLY different, but it&#x27;s pretty close.  it makes a room smell lovely.  I&#x27;m not sure about its effectiveness yet...I&#x27;m just starting out with this essential oil thing.  but for the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Jan 23 2013) - somehow, we have avoided the constant illnesses that have plagued us in past winters.  between this Germ Fighter blend and eucalyptus oil for when my older daughter gets a stuffy nose and RC (by Young Living) for when my younger daughter has a cough, our sickies have only lasted briefly.  is it a coincidence?  maybe.  but I don&#x27;t want to mess with something that seems to be working!</li>
            <li> My daughter is just learning about oils and herbs, she saw this on Amazon and wanted it.  We have 5 in our house hold and since she has started using this, she is the only one who hasn&#x27;t gotten sick with this nasty cold!</li>
            <li> I give only four stars b/c it is not exactly the thieves oil blend. But it is close enough for the price. I clean with this oil...add to water in a spray bottle and my whole house smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li> This seems to be very much like Thieves oil blend.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and we love it. We are using it diluted when we brush our teeth - my husband has gum issues and are anxious to see if it made a difference at his next periodontic appointment.  I have also used it in cleaning the inside of  the refrigerator</li>
            <li> This essential oil blend is wonderful...it smells great and I love to sprinkle it throughout the house. I recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> I use it diffused, but I also swabbed some in my nostrils for allergies and stuffy nose and it cleared me up..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery service.  Smells good and has all the ingredients as other that cost much more. I use this for killing germs in the house and also on skin for fighting colds, flu, etc..</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with COPD and for about 15 or so years have been sick at least twice a year with bronchitis or pneumonia and have been on allot of antibiotics. Since I have been going to a naturopathy doctor and using essential oils in my house, in my car and anywhere else I go I have had no problems. I bought an automatic diffuser and use this Germ Fighter in my house and I love it. I recommend it to anyone that might have breathing problems.</li>
            <li> Comparative to Thieves!  I diffuse this daily and absolutely LOVE it.  Have not had a single cold all winter. If you like Thieves oil try this.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Add it to teas for added health benefits and cut down on sick time.  It is spicy,  and smells great.  Smells slightly sweeter than thieves.  I think it has more cinnamon,  but it still good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely good quality, I know nothing about this particular brand, but I use Thieves SO much during flu season, to diffuse, or to make my own cleaning product (small amount of vinegar, add mostly water, and few drops of &amp;#34;Germ Fighter&amp;#34; depending on how powerful you want. This is a pretty large bottle for the price. I&#x27;m very satisfied and will purchase again. It does have a slightly different aroma than Young Living or DoTERRA. I find this blend has a less overwhelming amount of clove, meaning it&#x27;s just the perfect mix of blends( in my opinion)</li>
            <li> I have used many different EO oil companies. This was my first time trying Plant Therapy. It was recommended to me by my sister in laws. Other companies have a similar blend called &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Four Thieves&amp;#34; which is meant for immunity. The particular blend smelled great. I loved using it in my diffuser. I also put it on the bottom of my feet at night to build immunity. I will say though, while using this product over the duration of the winter months I did get the stomach flu multiple times. I cannot say for sure that this oil is less potent/ effective as other companies, but I can say it has left me skeptical. I will be using a different brand this winter to see if I stay healthier.</li>
            <li> Great product at an affordable price!  I love the scent of it, and truly feel as if it&#x27;s disinfecting my environment!  I have two large dogs that often smell less than lovely, I place a couple of droplets of this oil into a burning candle and it is diffused throughout my home for a fresh, clean smell!</li>
            <li> I know the ingredients are listed differently than on the young living thieves bottle which means the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; is different, but these are still all pure 100% essential oils. Check out plant therapy&#x27;s website for more info. So far this has helped my family from catching any additional flu bugs. I&#x27;ve used it in a scent warmer with a carrier oil and also applied to our skin with a carrier oil when we are out and about. It smells like Christmas!</li>
            <li> I must say this product is just amazing! I have used essential oils for years throu young living. This products smells, an tastes just like the young living theves essential oils I would say its an amazing doup for much less! :) 100% good quality essential oils</li>
            <li> Best bang for your buck! Love the scent and it works as well as high priced brand name oils. Will certainly continue buying this as my stash runs out.</li>
            <li> I just found out about this oil in march and have been using it each time anyone in my house feels the slightest germ...so far so good....I am impressed!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think.  It burned my husband&#x27;s skin, whereas Onguard doesn&#x27;t burn his skin (but Onguard does burn my son).</li>
            <li> We use it each night in our humidifier during the winter months. It smells great and has a comforting feel.</li>
            <li> I simply can not say enough greatness about this product!! I will never use anything else to clean my home again. This will be used on my children&#x27;s feet when school starts to help ward off germs. The smell is leaves is wonderful!! I have no regrets with this purchase and most definitely will be returning repeatedly to purchase more. Great product!! Great seller!! I purchase most of my oils from Plant Therapy! Superb company!!</li>
            <li> Smells ok, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Liked the product and will be purchasing more - i put it on my heels with some almond oil and rubbed it into the bottom of my feet then put on some socks! Also put some on my wrists and the temples of my head.  Its really strong so only used a small amt and it worked great when i had a lung infection!</li>
            <li> Having alergy and sensitivty reactions to eviromental substances, this synergy blend has fast become a favorite. Mixing a few drops with other natural cleaning substances, lemon juice and water, vinegar and water, baking soda, etc gives them an added uplifting, pleasant and vibrant fragrance and added cleaning ability. Putting a few drops in an aromatherapy device leaves the room also pleasantly aromatic. I have recipes that make using this oil so delightful and I practice aromatherapy, love it, absolutely love germ fighter and all its attributes!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews.  I have a friend who buys Thieves.  Was staying at her house a couple of days.  She had diffused the oil.  I find myself having to clear my throat and try to cough up mucus.  It is so annoying.  I don&#x27;t like using inhalers unless it becomes absolutely necessary.  I noticed I was able to breathe better.  I bought this and I&#x27;m diffusing it at home.  Also, for help in clearing my lungs I drink Mullein tea.  FYI</li>
            <li> Add it to hand sanitizer, makes a big difference. Smells like cinnamon.</li>
            <li> It is working great both at home and in my classroom. Nobody has missed a day yet!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Useful for most everything. Great price great size bottle</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one, it&#x27;s the perfect fall scent which makes it&#x27;s germ fighting ability even better! Just one or two drops in my diffuser pad works for most of the day, great quality oil!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that worked as good or at least almost as good as &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; from Young Living. This doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Wonderful essential oil, I have used this to clean up a moldy smell and folks walk in now and ask what smells so good!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I diffuse it often but my favorite way to use it is to put two drops in my coffee then add my coconut  creamer. Awesome!  I have a bunch of oils from Plant Therapy  and they are all amazing, this one is my go   to though.</li>
            <li> smells great...wards off the bubonic plague fantastically</li>
            <li> I have been using this (mixed with water :1 drop of oil per oz of water:) as a cleaner for my kitchen and bathroom and not only does it smell good, it kills germs too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using a few drops in my natural salt deodorant spray with great results. Also put some in a mixture of witch hazel and water to spray on my daughters back acne which hasn&#x27;t responded to anything I&#x27;ve purchased. It has practically healed in only a few applications with no harmful chemicals. This is definitely on my purchase again list.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I use this daily to help prevent infection with airborne illnesses.  It is pleasant smelling and works well.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for to replace the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; version.  I use a few drops in my floor vents daily to keep the house safe and germ free during cold and flu season as we have an immune suppressed member of the family on chemo. Also use in a Now diffuser bedside.  So far, so good - no colds or flu. Smells like clove and cinnamon, but not cloying.  I am prone to scent originated headaches and found no issues with this product.  Love love love. Great seller too. Highly recommend to all.  Easy drug free way to keep family safe and healthy with no side effects.</li>
            <li> excellent price and in using immediately on a facial clogged pore, twice daily, healing resulted within week. I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;We also used on hubby&#x27;s soles of feet to ward off cough and brewing lung infection. Today, we have all clear from our physician. But, I asked the Great Physician for healing as well.and we are very thankful.</li>
            <li> Havent used thieves oil before, just mixed my own, but this makes my house smell good along with knowing its killing germs!</li>
            <li> This is a good product!  There are several similar products out there, that I have tried.  This one works just as well and costs a lot less.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice, but it doesn&#x27;t stink.  I will keep plenty this on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I first used this product when I received it in a set of oils.  It is great!  I had to order more so went with the 30 ml.  It has helped me to fight off colds/flus this season.  I haven&#x27;t been sick yet.  I mainly use it on my feet with a carrier oil, both day and night.  I also have diffused it.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and use it for many things like room sprays, mouth rinses, on tooth brush and homemade hand sanitizer. The oils seem strong enough and pure and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I had a cold that was kicking my butt. The cold started in Dec. 2014 and continued until Feb. 2015. It would go and then drop me and then go and then drop me, this cold wow, was too much. The day I started to use Germ Fighter is the day my cold left! Germ Fighter was too much for my cold. It knocked the heck out of a long cold.&lt;br /&gt;I brushed my teeth, washed my mouth with it, placed several drops on my feet and placed 10 drops in my water defuser. No more cold, ya.&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to go out on a night on the town, don&#x27;t put the Germ Fighter on your body. You get use to the smell, however, others will not. The first time my wife came home and smelled the house she told me to never use it again. Then she saw that I was feeling much better and now she is a believer in this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more so I can keep one at work, you never know when the cold bug will raise it&#x27;s bad ass and knock you down.</li>
            <li> same as lavender oil. this one is not strong enough smell.  i use in restroom with a electric essential oil diffuser.  i need to put 8 drops in the water but still not very strong scent at all.</li>
            <li> ...and way more cost effective. It&#x27;s great for the immune system and we use it on our dog&#x27;s collar for that purpose as well as keeping bugs away. There are multiple purposes for this oil, but as with anything else, talk with someone who has had lots of experience using essential oils before trying anything you&#x27;ve never done before. Essential oils may also interfere with medications, so do your homework. I am just speaking from personal experience and am not a physician or aromatherapy expert. However,  have grown to have a healthy respect for essential oils and Plant Therapy is as good a product as any I have used.</li>
