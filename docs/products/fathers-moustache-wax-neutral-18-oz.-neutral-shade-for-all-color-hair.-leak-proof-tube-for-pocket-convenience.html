            <li>The smell is noticeable, but it has a pleasant earthy aroma-</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of putting this on when I had a hangover...not a good idea.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clubman wax, and Father&#x27;s is superior in every concievable way:    </li>
            <li>but after I saw how good it was working I didn&#x27;t even think about it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keeps discretely hair in place and smells good</li>
            <li>Almost no odor which is good if you&#x27;re going out beer tasting.</li>
            <li>A good quality wax.  </li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>Comes in a chapstick type tube and it goes on good.  </li>
            <li>The Father&#x27;s Mustache Wax holds great and smells even better.  </li>
            <li>works good, doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest...but couldn&#x27;t find the kind I had before</li>
            <li>It has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Great smelling, easy to use, and convenient to carry in pocket.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea, but I tried this</li>
            <li>The container was the perfect size not to take up too much room in the trash when I tossed this piece of garbage out.</li>
            <li>It blends in nicely and not a lot of clumpy build up.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it felt, but it was WAY too smelly.</li>
            <li>Its not the kind if smell you can get used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll note that my lip caterpillar had ample length to achieve some spectacular shape.</li>
            <li>The hold on this wax is pretty good, great for touch-ups.   </li>
            <li>most amazing product...must be honest i havent tried them all</li>
            <li>The hold is good and it applies easily -</li>
            <li>The clean, smooth feel is the best thing Father&#x27;s has going for it, and it more than makes up for anything it&#x27;s lacking in control and firmness.</li>
            <li>Application is easy and it smells good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Smells good and is quick to apply.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good, kind of herbal-y and the tube is convenient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde, and Father&#x27;s is beeswax colored - a perfect match.</li>
            <li>You take it with you, and all it takes is 5 seconds to touch up a spot where you want more hold.</li>
            <li>He has tried several others, but said I found the perfect one with this.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The stick is longer than the tube its self, resulting in more way for your money.</li>
            <li>every use,like it more than stach wax</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to many products like this</li>
            <li>I will continue to by this product if I don&#x27;t find something better</li>
            <li>Naysayers notwithstanding, love the smell.</li>
            <li>Simply a better idea.</li>
            <li>for me, I would like more if it was un-scented .</li>
            <li>I now I use \\&quot;Handlbars\\&quot; which works well for me, and the scent is more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and not over-powering.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for aprox:10 years now the product has always performed outstanding.</li>
            <li>I used this product over 10 years ago, wasn&#x27;t able to find it till now.</li>
            <li>From there you can rub your fingers together and get it nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My favorite wax.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>This wax is OK</li>
            <li>This is OK for carrying in your pocket for touch-ups</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this wax a try since it was one of the more inexpensive waxes.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It works so much better than gels sold for women.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>nothing more than a man should smell like.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t mind smelling this fragrance all day, I guess it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>waxes, like Firehouse Wacky Tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent.  </li>
            <li>My husband has a long handlebar mustache and he is impressed with this wax.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sold on the chapstick-style applicator, but compared to the metal tube and cheap plastic brush, Father&#x27;s is easy to apply, and even easier to carry!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is fine for mustaches, but I bought it to use on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>So, overall a very good product that does the job.</li>
            <li>type wax that you have to work into, and more importantly, OUT of your moustache.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and item arrieved in good condition.  </li>
            <li>This is a good wax for control, but not so much for flamboyant shaping.</li>
            <li>Everything about this is near perfect -- good hold, extremely convenient &amp;#34;chapstick tube&amp;#34; applicator -- except the very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>The convenient tube is nice, but it&#x27;s scent is too strong--especially for a product that is used right under ones nose.</li>
            <li>Forms perfectly for my tastes with a little more wax.</li>
            <li>Easy-to-use chapstick sized tube makes it easy to store and carry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, carries well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t wash off when taking a drink but easy to wash off in shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, just wax over the moustache and shape by hand or comb.</li>
            <li>Comes in a chapstick style tube which makes for easy carrying.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is in a tube because it is easy to cary with me.  </li>
            <li>The tube form makes it really easy to apply, as well as transport.</li>
            <li>Application was easy after warming it up in my pocket.</li>
            <li>Easy to have around; easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasing scent and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply....</li>
            <li>Strong odor, so strong I threw product away.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty nice...</li>
            <li>Needs mustache to be dry; but very good at holding errant hairs.</li>
            <li>id be fine with it.</li>
            <li>Why not make it fragrance free?</li>
            <li>Really fantastic in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Lasts around six hours and provides a light to medium hold.</li>
            <li>Works great to put stubborn hairs back into place.  </li>
            <li>Recieved the neutral shade, works well but took another post&#x27;s advice on using hair drier to help hide the \\&quot;white spots\\&quot; after applying (which is great when at home).</li>
            <li>delivery and securely packaged.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for that sweet, sweet balance of hold, convenience, and ease of use, I&#x27;venot yet found a better wax than Father&#x27;s Moustache Wax.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first tube, ordering 2 more.    </li>
            <li>In any case it fades pretty rapidly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with enjoying food or drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean-</li>
            <li>Way too strong and right under your nose all day.</li>
            <li>At body temperature it quickly melts in and gives a good hold for a few hours, but I found that with longer mustaches/beards the wax doesn&#x27;t have the hold that will keep a larger/more imaginative shape.</li>
            <li>It is easy to loose it because it&#x27;s so small lol but good quality!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really ask for anything more.  </li>
            <li>Back to the drawing board to find my husband a good mustache wax.</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, cool.</li>
            <li>I have a full stache and goatee</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad - but it gets to you after a while - meaning to say:</li>
            <li>For the price not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell...</li>
            <li>This product comes in a very easy to apply container (like chap-stick for your lips) and packs a pleasant aroma for the first few hours after applying.</li>
            <li>The packaging was hilarious it really made the product worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I think that the convenience of being in a chapstick like tube helps out tremendously as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;See, I&#x27;ve had a beard since 2k, but kept it short for most of it (a 1 guard on most clippers).</li>
            <li>The hold is good, not great, but good.  </li>
            <li>A company with this quality ethic must have other great products I would be interested in!</li>
            <li>Mine is average and this wax works great.</li>
            <li>You can vary it nicely by adding more or less.  </li>
            <li>Works fine but too much money.</li>
            <li>It works great for my moustache and it was delivered within a few days of me placing the order.</li>
            <li>I rarely give 5 stars for anything, so don&#x27;t let the rating fool you.  </li>
            <li>My four tubes of Fathers&#x27; Moustache Wax came lovingly wrapped in tissue, folded neatly and sealed with tape like a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>WORTH the money to buy this stuff over tube creams.</li>
            <li>SO WORTH IT to have a tube with you when you need to do a touch up.</li>
            <li>You can apply a touch up, and that will get it through the rest of the day, or leave it alone and have a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly wonder how this mixture is different from Chapstick lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Other than that issue it is a good product.</li>
            <li>The hold - just right.</li>
            <li>A product that is to be used right under your nose should not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Having it in a tube in your pocket keeps it warm and pliable without having to extensively work it first.</li>
            <li>With a little warm up softening, it&#x27;s easy to apply with the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li>This is best for FIRM poins of beards/Moustaches and for getting it to stay that way for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>This would not be a good wax for a sharp Dali... fine for me, but if you are looking for a sharp shaping wax I&#x27;d go with Firehouse Wacky Tacky.</li>
            <li>The price is really reasonable for a nice product like this, so I get four at a time to save on shipping; hey, it&#x27;s big &#x27;stache, I&#x27;m going to need it.    </li>
            <li>I shopped around for a while for a good natural facial hair styling product-</li>
            <li>This is a great wax for everyday use, for the guy just starting out and maybe gone past the &amp;#34;intro&amp;#34; wax, Clubman, (you could easily bypass that product altogether, but I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re already tried it before you got to this review) and a great wax to use for that established &#x27;stache that is already trained.</li>
            <li>When I am asked I gladly give out the info on how to get this terrific product!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - just a bit of an odor.</li>
            <li>it holds pretty well but will need to be reapplied through out the depending on your moustache style....</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a mustache wax, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is the first mustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Definitely returning for more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I actually get  better control with just hair spray.</li>
            <li>(Eyebrow wax is priced much higher.)  </li>
            <li>Not quite as stiff as some, but smells better than many and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Quick</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a musky, masculine one but without a strong perfumey smell--but you really don&#x27;t notice it after a day or two.    </li>
            <li>That was further wrapped in more paper padding, and put in a very strong small box and taped neatly and securely.</li>
            <li>Good product, not a strong smell under the nose.</li>
            <li>The hold is a medium, easily readjusted , holding is really good for the center of the mustache, the curls at the end are in loose gentle curves.</li>
            <li>What really turns me back to this product over the others I&#x27;ve tried (traditional mens grooming brands and some more modern unisex hair products that promote really strong hold on hair) is that the viscosity (for lack of a better word) of the wax, is gentle enough for me to curl my 2 inch handle bars with my fingers while not drying out or freeze holding my hair in place before I finish styling it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If what you&#x27;re looking for is a \\&quot;full\\&quot; &#x27;stache that goes out to the side in a natural look, but don&#x27;t plan on styling it (read: wax it out to points, or handlebars, or other), then this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend only uses this type of wax for his moustache because it is so easy to apply and carry in one&#x27;s pocket.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to throw in my pocket for later touch-ups.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to carry and takes only seconds to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry for daily touchups.</li>
            <li>10 bucks for a large tub</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also certain that it is not the products loosening the curls</li>
            <li>Came fast and easy, and I use it daily.</li>
            <li>A quick shot in the car, carry it in a pocket, no mess on your suit or car interior.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Clubman fan, and Father&#x27;s is a totally different product.  </li>
            <li>I really really like how convenient the stick is.</li>
            <li>the upside, it does feel and look VERY</li>
            <li>A bit greasy but not as much as Colonel Conks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it has much of a smell, either...</li>
            <li>and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I really like the no-touch convenience</li>
            <li>I swear, I have received electronic components that didn&#x27;t have as much care taken in shipping them.</li>
            <li>YOU CAN USE TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I think the application technique (rubbing the stick straight on the hair) helps in this regard.    </li>
            <li>I can imagine Wyatt Earp smelling like this just as he stepped out of a 1910 barbershop with his mustache freshly and professionally</li>
            <li>For someone who wants that sort of scent, it would probably be a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Light enough not to interfere with after shave or cologne if I choose to apply any.  </li>
            <li>I can smell it the whole day.</li>
            <li>this product has done really well at training my mustache to grow out to the sides vs straight</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need much to keep hairs away from my mouth.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a matter of contention among some, as it&#x27;s really subjective.  </li>
            <li>But at least it had good hold...</li>
            <li>The mildly sweet beeswax smell of the Father&#x27;s product is actually pleasant--all the more so compared to the acrid, almost-metallic odor of Clubman    COLOR: The natural wax color fades almost instantly into my stache.  </li>
            <li>the product was everything it stated, it holds well and smells good but for the price it is a very small tube.</li>
            <li>The wax comes in a small handy tube the size and shape of chapstick</li>
            <li>In moustache terms, think more bare-knuckle boxer and less Belgian detective.  </li>
            <li>decent hold.</li>
            <li>The stick is convenient to carry in your pocket for quick touch ups (which it might need since it does not last all day for me like some of the firmer waxes do).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll last most of a day with minimal loss, provided that you don&#x27;t drink a lot of hot liquid, the bane of every moustache wax.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sold by Amazon, so the shipping is artificially high.  </li>
            <li>: I highly recommend this product over the 2-3 others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Father&#x27;s rubs easily into my hair, and distributes evenly, whereas the other tends to clump.    </li>
            <li>I notice it when we kiss, but it is by no means off-putting, or strong as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything and isn&#x27;t messy cause of the chapstick style applicator.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>It stays in my right back pocket all day.</li>
            <li>I only use this stuff on the ends as right under the nose</li>
            <li>Bought this from a recomendation from a friend who enters moustache contests with his super long &amp;#34;stache&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find anything anywhere else locally that was even available, let alone that would work with my red beard.</li>
            <li>It will blend in smoothly, give enough grip to shape it outwards, but will still be relaxed enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my girlfriend loves the smell, so there&#x27;s a definite upside ;)</li>
            <li>Hold is decent - better than clubmans and is quite firm - my tactic is to actually rub it into the tines of my comb and then comb it through my mustache before shaping.</li>
            <li>If you are curling your lip broom for a quick picture, with no intention of keeping it thus styled, and accepting that if you apply even a little too much you&#x27;re going to look like you ate a glazed doughnut by rubbing it in, you need</li>
            <li>It provides a decent hold- not quite tacky or \\&quot;hard\\&quot; enough for sharply curled tips, but more than enough if you&#x27;re just looking for a way to keep your stache out of your beer.  </li>
            <li>Well the fragrance was a big turn-off, the behavior of the little stick was OK to Good?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My girlfriend liked the sent, this was a major concern due to other reviews.</li>
            <li>The look - clear, blends invisibly.</li>
            <li>Smells like an old man...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as Clubman.</li>
            <li>This wax is equal to any I have used in quality and hold, but the real plus is the tube applicator.</li>
            <li>Not too soft so it holds well.</li>
            <li>This product smells like old people, and the smell doesn&#x27;t fade during the day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not going to come near you until you sanitize your face.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a thicker product, similar to Dax wave and groom, but I do like the fact that it is pocket size.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and is not  obvious unless you use too much.  </li>
            <li>Smells like an old man who&#x27;s just been to his old man barber.  </li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t want to smell like old hippy, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like a thick pasty...</li>
            <li>If you have a mini flat iron it works REALLY well as a protector for your hair.</li>
            <li>After a pass with a flat iron your hair is SILKY and ready to hold</li>
            <li>After deciding I wanted to sport a more luxurious &#x27;stache, I found that to get the style I wanted, I would need some serious control.</li>
            <li>No noticeable clumping or excessive shine, and it blends exceptionally well with my black hair.</li>
            <li>The smell of this stuff does not dissipate, and it has a smell very similar to Murray&#x27;s Pomade, with a faint whiff of play doh for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the hold is really strong enough for him and</li>
            <li>The last - stays on, and less water soluble than the clubman, so I can wash my face and my mustache won&#x27;t &#x27;melt&#x27; into some funny new position.    </li>
            <li>Ease of use and long lasting only down side is price after years at a fairly stable price, in a period of less than a year the price has near doubled, possible alternitives will be looked at.</li>
            <li>The color of the wax is white and goes on clear.</li>
            <li>I think as long as I keep this unusual facial hair experience going, I will not buy another product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will echo what other people have said, this isn&#x27;t really an all-day wax.</li>
            <li>The only major qualm I have is with the scent...</li>
            <li>a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light, and comes off as a very subtle cedary/talc powder combo.</li>
            <li>I have started three hobbies: combing civil war battle fields with a metal detector, old coin collecting and long distance bicycling.</li>
            <li>After a few uses you&#x27;ll see how much better it holds than other thin light waxes, and you can ALSO use this WITH other waxes.</li>
            <li>It does take some effort to wash off which is good and bad</li>

            <li> I made the mistake of putting this on when I had a hangover...not a good idea.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clubman wax, and Father&#x27;s is superior in every concievable way:    </li>
            <li> but after I saw how good it was working I didn&#x27;t even think about it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keeps discretely hair in place and smells good</li>
            <li> Almost no odor which is good if you&#x27;re going out beer tasting.</li>
            <li> A good quality wax.  </li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> Comes in a chapstick type tube and it goes on good.  </li>
            <li> The Father&#x27;s Mustache Wax holds great and smells even better.  </li>
            <li> works good, doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest...but couldn&#x27;t find the kind I had before</li>
            <li> It has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great smelling, easy to use, and convenient to carry in pocket.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea, but I tried this</li>
            <li> The container was the perfect size not to take up too much room in the trash when I tossed this piece of garbage out.</li>
            <li> It blends in nicely and not a lot of clumpy build up.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it felt, but it was WAY too smelly.</li>
            <li> Its not the kind if smell you can get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll note that my lip caterpillar had ample length to achieve some spectacular shape.</li>
            <li> The hold on this wax is pretty good, great for touch-ups.   </li>
            <li> most amazing product...must be honest i havent tried them all</li>
            <li> The hold is good and it applies easily -</li>
            <li> The clean, smooth feel is the best thing Father&#x27;s has going for it, and it more than makes up for anything it&#x27;s lacking in control and firmness.</li>
            <li> Application is easy and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Smells good and is quick to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good, kind of herbal-y and the tube is convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde, and Father&#x27;s is beeswax colored - a perfect match.</li>
            <li> You take it with you, and all it takes is 5 seconds to touch up a spot where you want more hold.</li>
            <li> He has tried several others, but said I found the perfect one with this.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The stick is longer than the tube its self, resulting in more way for your money.</li>
            <li> every use,like it more than stach wax</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to many products like this</li>
            <li> I will continue to by this product if I don&#x27;t find something better</li>
            <li> Naysayers notwithstanding, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Simply a better idea.</li>
            <li> for me, I would like more if it was un-scented .</li>
            <li> I now I use \\&quot;Handlbars\\&quot; which works well for me, and the scent is more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for aprox:10 years now the product has always performed outstanding.</li>
            <li> I used this product over 10 years ago, wasn&#x27;t able to find it till now.</li>
            <li> From there you can rub your fingers together and get it nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My favorite wax.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> This wax is OK</li>
            <li> This is OK for carrying in your pocket for touch-ups</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this wax a try since it was one of the more inexpensive waxes.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> It works so much better than gels sold for women.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> nothing more than a man should smell like.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t mind smelling this fragrance all day, I guess it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> waxes, like Firehouse Wacky Tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a long handlebar mustache and he is impressed with this wax.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sold on the chapstick-style applicator, but compared to the metal tube and cheap plastic brush, Father&#x27;s is easy to apply, and even easier to carry!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is fine for mustaches, but I bought it to use on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> So, overall a very good product that does the job.</li>
            <li> type wax that you have to work into, and more importantly, OUT of your moustache.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and item arrieved in good condition.  </li>
            <li> This is a good wax for control, but not so much for flamboyant shaping.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is near perfect -- good hold, extremely convenient &amp;#34;chapstick tube&amp;#34; applicator -- except the very strong smell.  </li>
            <li> The convenient tube is nice, but it&#x27;s scent is too strong--especially for a product that is used right under ones nose.</li>
            <li> Forms perfectly for my tastes with a little more wax.</li>
            <li> Easy-to-use chapstick sized tube makes it easy to store and carry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, carries well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wash off when taking a drink but easy to wash off in shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, just wax over the moustache and shape by hand or comb.</li>
            <li> Comes in a chapstick style tube which makes for easy carrying.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is in a tube because it is easy to cary with me.  </li>
            <li> The tube form makes it really easy to apply, as well as transport.</li>
            <li> Application was easy after warming it up in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Easy to have around; easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasing scent and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply....</li>
            <li> Strong odor, so strong I threw product away.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty nice...</li>
            <li> Needs mustache to be dry; but very good at holding errant hairs.</li>
            <li> id be fine with it.</li>
            <li> Why not make it fragrance free?</li>
            <li> Really fantastic in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Lasts around six hours and provides a light to medium hold.</li>
            <li> Works great to put stubborn hairs back into place.  </li>
            <li> Recieved the neutral shade, works well but took another post&#x27;s advice on using hair drier to help hide the \\&quot;white spots\\&quot; after applying (which is great when at home).</li>
            <li> delivery and securely packaged.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for that sweet, sweet balance of hold, convenience, and ease of use, I&#x27;venot yet found a better wax than Father&#x27;s Moustache Wax.  </li>
            <li> I just finished my first tube, ordering 2 more.    </li>
            <li> In any case it fades pretty rapidly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with enjoying food or drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean-</li>
            <li> Way too strong and right under your nose all day.</li>
            <li> At body temperature it quickly melts in and gives a good hold for a few hours, but I found that with longer mustaches/beards the wax doesn&#x27;t have the hold that will keep a larger/more imaginative shape.</li>
            <li> It is easy to loose it because it&#x27;s so small lol but good quality!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really ask for anything more.  </li>
            <li> Back to the drawing board to find my husband a good mustache wax.</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, cool.</li>
            <li> I have a full stache and goatee</li>
            <li> The scent is not bad - but it gets to you after a while - meaning to say:</li>
            <li> For the price not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell...</li>
            <li> This product comes in a very easy to apply container (like chap-stick for your lips) and packs a pleasant aroma for the first few hours after applying.</li>
            <li> The packaging was hilarious it really made the product worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I think that the convenience of being in a chapstick like tube helps out tremendously as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;See, I&#x27;ve had a beard since 2k, but kept it short for most of it (a 1 guard on most clippers).</li>
            <li> The hold is good, not great, but good.  </li>
            <li> A company with this quality ethic must have other great products I would be interested in!</li>
            <li> Mine is average and this wax works great.</li>
            <li> You can vary it nicely by adding more or less.  </li>
            <li> Works fine but too much money.</li>
            <li> It works great for my moustache and it was delivered within a few days of me placing the order.</li>
            <li> I rarely give 5 stars for anything, so don&#x27;t let the rating fool you.  </li>
            <li> My four tubes of Fathers&#x27; Moustache Wax came lovingly wrapped in tissue, folded neatly and sealed with tape like a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> WORTH the money to buy this stuff over tube creams.</li>
            <li> SO WORTH IT to have a tube with you when you need to do a touch up.</li>
            <li> You can apply a touch up, and that will get it through the rest of the day, or leave it alone and have a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly wonder how this mixture is different from Chapstick lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Other than that issue it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The hold - just right.</li>
            <li> A product that is to be used right under your nose should not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Having it in a tube in your pocket keeps it warm and pliable without having to extensively work it first.</li>
            <li> With a little warm up softening, it&#x27;s easy to apply with the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> This is best for FIRM poins of beards/Moustaches and for getting it to stay that way for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> This would not be a good wax for a sharp Dali... fine for me, but if you are looking for a sharp shaping wax I&#x27;d go with Firehouse Wacky Tacky.</li>
            <li> The price is really reasonable for a nice product like this, so I get four at a time to save on shipping; hey, it&#x27;s big &#x27;stache, I&#x27;m going to need it.    </li>
            <li> I shopped around for a while for a good natural facial hair styling product-</li>
            <li> This is a great wax for everyday use, for the guy just starting out and maybe gone past the &amp;#34;intro&amp;#34; wax, Clubman, (you could easily bypass that product altogether, but I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re already tried it before you got to this review) and a great wax to use for that established &#x27;stache that is already trained.</li>
            <li> When I am asked I gladly give out the info on how to get this terrific product!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - just a bit of an odor.</li>
            <li> it holds pretty well but will need to be reapplied through out the depending on your moustache style....</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a mustache wax, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first mustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Definitely returning for more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I actually get  better control with just hair spray.</li>
            <li> (Eyebrow wax is priced much higher.)  </li>
            <li> Not quite as stiff as some, but smells better than many and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Quick</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a musky, masculine one but without a strong perfumey smell--but you really don&#x27;t notice it after a day or two.    </li>
            <li> That was further wrapped in more paper padding, and put in a very strong small box and taped neatly and securely.</li>
            <li> Good product, not a strong smell under the nose.</li>
            <li> The hold is a medium, easily readjusted , holding is really good for the center of the mustache, the curls at the end are in loose gentle curves.</li>
            <li> What really turns me back to this product over the others I&#x27;ve tried (traditional mens grooming brands and some more modern unisex hair products that promote really strong hold on hair) is that the viscosity (for lack of a better word) of the wax, is gentle enough for me to curl my 2 inch handle bars with my fingers while not drying out or freeze holding my hair in place before I finish styling it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If what you&#x27;re looking for is a \\&quot;full\\&quot; &#x27;stache that goes out to the side in a natural look, but don&#x27;t plan on styling it (read: wax it out to points, or handlebars, or other), then this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend only uses this type of wax for his moustache because it is so easy to apply and carry in one&#x27;s pocket.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to throw in my pocket for later touch-ups.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to carry and takes only seconds to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry for daily touchups.</li>
            <li> 10 bucks for a large tub</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also certain that it is not the products loosening the curls</li>
            <li> Came fast and easy, and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> A quick shot in the car, carry it in a pocket, no mess on your suit or car interior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Clubman fan, and Father&#x27;s is a totally different product.  </li>
            <li> I really really like how convenient the stick is.</li>
            <li> the upside, it does feel and look VERY</li>
            <li> A bit greasy but not as much as Colonel Conks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it has much of a smell, either...</li>
            <li> and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like the no-touch convenience</li>
            <li> I swear, I have received electronic components that didn&#x27;t have as much care taken in shipping them.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN USE TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I think the application technique (rubbing the stick straight on the hair) helps in this regard.    </li>
            <li> I can imagine Wyatt Earp smelling like this just as he stepped out of a 1910 barbershop with his mustache freshly and professionally</li>
            <li> For someone who wants that sort of scent, it would probably be a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Light enough not to interfere with after shave or cologne if I choose to apply any.  </li>
            <li> I can smell it the whole day.</li>
            <li> this product has done really well at training my mustache to grow out to the sides vs straight</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need much to keep hairs away from my mouth.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a matter of contention among some, as it&#x27;s really subjective.  </li>
            <li> But at least it had good hold...</li>
            <li> The mildly sweet beeswax smell of the Father&#x27;s product is actually pleasant--all the more so compared to the acrid, almost-metallic odor of Clubman    COLOR: The natural wax color fades almost instantly into my stache.  </li>
            <li> the product was everything it stated, it holds well and smells good but for the price it is a very small tube.</li>
            <li> The wax comes in a small handy tube the size and shape of chapstick</li>
            <li> In moustache terms, think more bare-knuckle boxer and less Belgian detective.  </li>
            <li> decent hold.</li>
            <li> The stick is convenient to carry in your pocket for quick touch ups (which it might need since it does not last all day for me like some of the firmer waxes do).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last most of a day with minimal loss, provided that you don&#x27;t drink a lot of hot liquid, the bane of every moustache wax.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sold by Amazon, so the shipping is artificially high.  </li>
            <li> : I highly recommend this product over the 2-3 others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Father&#x27;s rubs easily into my hair, and distributes evenly, whereas the other tends to clump.    </li>
            <li> I notice it when we kiss, but it is by no means off-putting, or strong as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything and isn&#x27;t messy cause of the chapstick style applicator.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> It stays in my right back pocket all day.</li>
            <li> I only use this stuff on the ends as right under the nose</li>
            <li> Bought this from a recomendation from a friend who enters moustache contests with his super long &amp;#34;stache&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anything anywhere else locally that was even available, let alone that would work with my red beard.</li>
            <li> It will blend in smoothly, give enough grip to shape it outwards, but will still be relaxed enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my girlfriend loves the smell, so there&#x27;s a definite upside ;)</li>
            <li> Hold is decent - better than clubmans and is quite firm - my tactic is to actually rub it into the tines of my comb and then comb it through my mustache before shaping.</li>
            <li> If you are curling your lip broom for a quick picture, with no intention of keeping it thus styled, and accepting that if you apply even a little too much you&#x27;re going to look like you ate a glazed doughnut by rubbing it in, you need</li>
            <li> It provides a decent hold- not quite tacky or \\&quot;hard\\&quot; enough for sharply curled tips, but more than enough if you&#x27;re just looking for a way to keep your stache out of your beer.  </li>
            <li> Well the fragrance was a big turn-off, the behavior of the little stick was OK to Good?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My girlfriend liked the sent, this was a major concern due to other reviews.</li>
            <li> The look - clear, blends invisibly.</li>
            <li> Smells like an old man...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as Clubman.</li>
            <li> This wax is equal to any I have used in quality and hold, but the real plus is the tube applicator.</li>
            <li> Not too soft so it holds well.</li>
            <li> This product smells like old people, and the smell doesn&#x27;t fade during the day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not going to come near you until you sanitize your face.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a thicker product, similar to Dax wave and groom, but I do like the fact that it is pocket size.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and is not  obvious unless you use too much.  </li>
            <li> Smells like an old man who&#x27;s just been to his old man barber.  </li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t want to smell like old hippy, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more like a thick pasty...</li>
            <li> If you have a mini flat iron it works REALLY well as a protector for your hair.</li>
            <li> After a pass with a flat iron your hair is SILKY and ready to hold</li>
            <li> After deciding I wanted to sport a more luxurious &#x27;stache, I found that to get the style I wanted, I would need some serious control.</li>
            <li> No noticeable clumping or excessive shine, and it blends exceptionally well with my black hair.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff does not dissipate, and it has a smell very similar to Murray&#x27;s Pomade, with a faint whiff of play doh for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the hold is really strong enough for him and</li>
            <li> The last - stays on, and less water soluble than the clubman, so I can wash my face and my mustache won&#x27;t &#x27;melt&#x27; into some funny new position.    </li>
            <li> Ease of use and long lasting only down side is price after years at a fairly stable price, in a period of less than a year the price has near doubled, possible alternitives will be looked at.</li>
            <li> The color of the wax is white and goes on clear.</li>
            <li> I think as long as I keep this unusual facial hair experience going, I will not buy another product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will echo what other people have said, this isn&#x27;t really an all-day wax.</li>
            <li> The only major qualm I have is with the scent...</li>
            <li> a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light, and comes off as a very subtle cedary/talc powder combo.</li>
            <li> I have started three hobbies: combing civil war battle fields with a metal detector, old coin collecting and long distance bicycling.</li>
            <li> After a few uses you&#x27;ll see how much better it holds than other thin light waxes, and you can ALSO use this WITH other waxes.</li>
            <li> It does take some effort to wash off which is good and bad</li>
            <li> : Be careful of napkins and hot liquids as they will loosen the wax out of the moustache and leave you with a messy look until you wash it off and reapply.</li>
            <li> and so it was pretty hard to get it to lay on my stache.  </li>
            <li> Does a decent job of keeping things in place, but the smell gets tiring - being right under your nose all day long - and is difficult to wash the fragrance out.  </li>
            <li> The neutral shade works with all hair color as mine changes from blonde to grey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on growing it out long enough that styling (i.e. points, handle-bars, curls, etc)</li>
            <li> I like this product because once my stach gets longer I think it will tame the beast of wild hairs on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> firm but not really stiff.</li>
            <li> grey    CONSISTENCY:</li>
            <li> dried finish is rather soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li> You end up using less and it goes as far as larger sizes without the mess.</li>
            <li> He loves this brand over other bigger brand names because of the smell, neutral color, and portability (he carries it in his front shirt pocket).</li>
            <li> Firm enough to stick, loose enough that it doesn&#x27;t glue.</li>
            <li> Seriously, those thicker waxes are hard to properly use, and as a first-time starter wax, will put you right off the use of any product.  </li>
            <li> Clubman leaves white residue unless I wash a little out and wipe it with a towel.    </li>
            <li> but I find that when I do, it leaves a white residue (rubbing it in helps a little).</li>
            <li> but could be a little larger package</li>
            <li> Styling left little to be desired.</li>
            <li> The white goo of the other product makes my black hair look</li>
            <li> I expected it to apply to my face and harden, like candle wax I guess</li>
            <li> It allows me to get all the individual whiskers aligned on my &amp;#34;Fu Manchu&amp;#34; style mustache without a heavy buildup</li>
            <li> Not really good for thick full mustaches.</li>
            <li> The wax is good, I would recommend using this wax in a rotation, the sent everyday could become annoying.</li>
            <li> - I use shampoo every day to rinse it off, washing my face with plain water will not wash it out, but will loosen out enough to make the curls I have loosen out a bit.</li>
            <li> I have been using other products for years.</li>
            <li> With what I&#x27;ve seen, I am going to look at your other products.</li>
            <li> Somehow I missed this when I was reading the other reviews of products.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviews</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, doesn&#x27;t have very strong hold, and didn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> Anything wax thin enough to be used from a squeeze tube just can&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> A masculine smell almost like a cigar but the hold is weak.</li>
            <li> The only negative?  </li>
            <li> Maybe if they&#x27;d kick it down a notch</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that using the stick would pull too much on the hairs, but it&#x27;s not that bad actually.    </li>
            <li> a manly, turn of the previous century barber shop sort of smell.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and at the end of the day my girlfriend asked if I had powdered my face with something weird, which is her polite way of saying, &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve tried a new mustache product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less of a messy hassle than the creams for me.</li>
            <li> The scent takes a little getting used to--</li>
            <li> Helps him get a little curl to the ends of the mustache.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson to not cheap out on moustache wax.</li>
            <li> As with others, I&#x27;m not huge on the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It does not get stiff as the days goes along</li>
            <li> Everything else I&#x27;ve tried is way way too stiff, or too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so stiff that you need a shovel to dig it out, and 20 minutes to work into your &#x27;stache.  </li>
            <li> It will probably tame your beast too.</li>
            <li> most of which were too expensive or had bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Clubman is excessive on my handlebar, just too sticky.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive for initial grooming in the morning.</li>
            <li> have used this for years and recently it became difficult to find on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> Tube makes it hard to apply to my stache</li>
            <li> This is hard to find elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> When you use it, run about 1/4 inch out (about 5mm) put your finger and thumb on the product and then TURN the tube so it slowly melts onto your fingers.</li>
            <li> This is basically a tube of chapstick - seriously.  </li>
            <li> This moustache wax was unable to tame my &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li> This really is not much more than an expensive tube of Chapstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a consistency like chapstick, and unfortunately has to be applied the same way that chapstick does, which can be a bit annoying if you&#x27;ve got an unruly stache that needs a lot of wax to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The problem I had was it growing down over the lips, which looked horrible, and prompted the search for mustache wax to \\&quot;train\\&quot;</li>
            <li> According to my girlfriend, it smells like a dirty hippy grandma&#x27;s douche.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to hold any crazy styles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold isn&#x27;t too bad (but nothing to write home about), and it comes in a chap stick sized container.</li>
            <li> man does it smell bad.</li>
            <li> It comes in a tube identically to Chapstick, and I am disappointed in the lack of holding power.  </li>
            <li> The smell is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand the smell. Way too strong and right under your nose all day. Why not make it fragrance free? Trash can item.</li>
            <li> Easy-to-use chapstick sized tube makes it easy to store and carry.&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself works well enough to maneuver stray hairs into place, but isn&#x27;t something for heavy-duty sculpting.&lt;br /&gt;No build up, which is a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light, and comes off as a very subtle cedary/talc powder combo. I notice it when we kiss, but it is by no means off-putting, or strong as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic in my opinion. Clubman is a reference metric.    The hold - just right. Firm enough to stick, loose enough that it doesn&#x27;t glue. You can vary it nicely by adding more or less.  Clubman is excessive on my handlebar, just too sticky.    The look - clear, blends invisibly. I&#x27;m blonde, and Father&#x27;s is beeswax colored - a perfect match. Clubman leaves white residue unless I wash a little out and wipe it with a towel.    The last - stays on, and less water soluble than the clubman, so I can wash my face and my mustache won&#x27;t &#x27;melt&#x27; into some funny new position.    The stick - I really really like how convenient the stick is. You take it with you, and all it takes is 5 seconds to touch up a spot where you want more hold. You couldn&#x27;t do that with clubman, which doesn&#x27;t work in as well. It stays in my right back pocket all day. I just finished my first tube, ordering 2 more.    THANK YOU FATHER&#x27;S!</li>
            <li> My husband has a long handlebar mustache and he is impressed with this wax.  He has tried several others, but said I found the perfect one with this.  He has me order a dozen at a time just so he doesn&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> This was my maiden voyage into the seas of mustache wax and I think my ship has sank.  According to my girlfriend, it smells like a dirty hippy grandma&#x27;s douche.  But at least it had good hold...</li>
            <li> If you are going to buy this I suggest that you keep in mind that its only for a touch up during the day . I&#x27;m not a fan of it since I have no time to look in the Mirror apply and comb .</li>
            <li> The hold is good and it applies easily - I can&#x27;t really ask for anything more.  I rarely give 5 stars for anything, so don&#x27;t let the rating fool you.  This is my everyday wax.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works better than anything and isn&#x27;t messy cause of the chapstick style applicator. Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> The wax does come in a &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; tube. The product does have a sent that is &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34; but in a good way! The sent lingers through out the day. My girlfriend liked the sent, this was a major concern due to other reviews. The stick is longer than the tube its self, resulting in more way for your money. The color of the wax is white and goes on clear. The hold is a medium, easily readjusted , holding is really good for the center of the mustache, the curls at the end are in loose gentle curves. The wax is good, I would recommend using this wax in a rotation, the sent everyday could become annoying. All in all good!</li>
            <li> Best moustache wax every use,like it more than stach wax</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to many products like this but I&#x27;ll say what I think anyway. I like this product because once my stach gets longer I think it will tame the beast of wild hairs on my upper lip. It smells like leather soap, almost to soapy for my tastes, it conflicts with my Deodorant and Cologne. I expected it to apply to my face and harden, like candle wax I guess but it&#x27;s more like a thick pasty... Something. The instructions say to apply an ample amount but I find that when I do, it leaves a white residue (rubbing it in helps a little). The container is supposed to be portable and in one review I read, the reviewer said that he carried the tube around in his back pocket. I liked the idea, but I tried this and before I had it in my pocket an hour the lid had come off. I will continue to by this product if I don&#x27;t find something better and I do recommend it. It will probably tame your beast too.</li>
            <li> This wax is perfect in every way...except for the smell.  It has a sandalwood/patchouli aroma that is nauseating to me.  Back to the drawing board to find my husband a good mustache wax.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. When I am asked I gladly give out the info on how to get this terrific product!!</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff! Easy to apply, carries well. Naysayers notwithstanding, love the smell. Never greasy, holds well.</li>
            <li> It works great for my moustache and it was delivered within a few days of me placing the order. What else can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Smells like an old man... if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, cool.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - just a bit of an odor.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product but when I finally tried it, I was dissappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as Clubman.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and especially the tube delivery system. Do not leave it in your car during a sunny July day  though!</li>
            <li> Great for my unruly eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, neutral color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Clubman fan, and Father&#x27;s is a totally different product.  It&#x27;s got a consistency like chapstick, and unfortunately has to be applied the same way that chapstick does, which can be a bit annoying if you&#x27;ve got an unruly stache that needs a lot of wax to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it does feel and look VERY clean- no buildup or stickiness at all.  It provides a decent hold- not quite tacky or \\&quot;hard\\&quot; enough for sharply curled tips, but more than enough if you&#x27;re just looking for a way to keep your stache out of your beer.  The clean, smooth feel is the best thing Father&#x27;s has going for it, and it more than makes up for anything it&#x27;s lacking in control and firmness.</li>
            <li> I have been using other products for years. This wax is equal to any I have used in quality and hold, but the real plus is the tube applicator. Once you have used it you will never go back to anything that requires your fingers. You end up using less and it goes as far as larger sizes without the mess. A quick shot in the car, carry it in a pocket, no mess on your suit or car interior. Simply a better idea.</li>
            <li> Does the job well and holds shape. tube shape is a plus.  The scent is not bad - but it gets to you after a while - meaning to say: it went in the garbage after a three days.  for me, I would like more if it was un-scented . I wont buy this product again until they make a different scent. I now I use \\&quot;Handlbars\\&quot; which works well for me, and the scent is more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> The hold on this wax is pretty good, great for touch-ups.   I was a bit worried that using the stick would pull too much on the hairs, but it&#x27;s not that bad actually.    As with others, I&#x27;m not huge on the fragrance.  Maybe if they&#x27;d kick it down a notch so there&#x27;s just a hint of it.   I only use this stuff on the ends as right under the nose is too overbearing.   I made the mistake of putting this on when I had a hangover...not a good idea.   However, my girlfriend loves the smell, so there&#x27;s a definite upside ;)</li>
            <li> Well the fragrance was a big turn-off, the behavior of the little stick was OK to Good?&lt;br /&gt;The price &amp; the odor are a big enough turnoff that I will not be making another purchase of this brand!</li>
            <li> Best mustache wax on the market, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Not too soft so it holds well. One tube lasts several months.</li>
            <li> The product worked well on my boyfriend&#x27;s mustache but then I got close enough to smell it and was horrified. No man should ever smell like pungent flowers and patchouli, it&#x27;s still in my nose.</li>
            <li> This product smells like old people, and the smell doesn&#x27;t fade during the day. I put it on in the morning and at the end of the day my girlfriend asked if I had powdered my face with something weird, which is her polite way of saying, &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve tried a new mustache product and I&#x27;m not going to come near you until you sanitize your face.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold isn&#x27;t too bad (but nothing to write home about), and it comes in a chap stick sized container. The container was the perfect size not to take up too much room in the trash when I tossed this piece of garbage out.</li>
            <li> most amazing product...must be honest i havent tried them all but it is pretty nice...it holds pretty well but will need to be reapplied through out the depending on your moustache style....vivat mustacium!!!</li>
            <li> decent hold. firm but not really stiff. A bit greasy but not as much as Colonel Conks. The stick is convenient to carry in your pocket for quick touch ups (which it might need since it does not last all day for me like some of the firmer waxes do). For the price not bad at all.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend only uses this type of wax for his moustache because it is so easy to apply and carry in one&#x27;s pocket.  I don&#x27;t find it has much of a smell, either...and I have quite a nose.  So, overall a very good product that does the job.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, easy to use, and convenient to carry in pocket. Doesn&#x27;t wash off when taking a drink but easy to wash off in shower. Lasts around six hours and provides a light to medium hold.</li>
            <li> works good, doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest...but couldn&#x27;t find the kind I had before</li>
            <li> After deciding I wanted to sport a more luxurious &#x27;stache, I found that to get the style I wanted, I would need some serious control. After trying several of the brands mentioned in reviews here, I went with Father&#x27;s Moustache Wax and I really like it a lot. With a little warm up softening, it&#x27;s easy to apply with the tube it comes in. I really like the no-touch convenience and it&#x27;s easy to throw in my pocket for later touch-ups. The scent takes a little getting used to--it&#x27;s a musky, masculine one but without a strong perfumey smell--but you really don&#x27;t notice it after a day or two.    The price is really reasonable for a nice product like this, so I get four at a time to save on shipping; hey, it&#x27;s big &#x27;stache, I&#x27;m going to need it.    I&#x27;ve got to mention Colonial Dames Co. Ltd, the manufacturer, and the care they take in their shipping. I always check how a company packages their product for delivery to the customer. To me, it says a lot about how they view their operation. Is it cut corners and do the minimum or finish up with the same care in packaging that I hope they take in their manufacturing?    Colonial Dames Co. Ltd scores 110% on that count. My four tubes of Fathers&#x27; Moustache Wax came lovingly wrapped in tissue, folded neatly and sealed with tape like a Christmas present. That was further wrapped in more paper padding, and put in a very strong small box and taped neatly and securely. I swear, I have received electronic components that didn&#x27;t have as much care taken in shipping them. BRAVO Colonial Dames Co. Ltd for taking pride in ALL aspects of your operation. With what I&#x27;ve seen, I am going to look at your other products. A company with this quality ethic must have other great products I would be interested in!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for aprox:10 years now the product has always performed outstanding. Ease of use and long lasting only down side is price after years at a fairly stable price, in a period of less than a year the price has near doubled, possible alternitives will be looked at.</li>
            <li> I needed a wax to traine my unruly stash and this works great. It has a nice smell that my wife likes too!</li>
            <li> I used this product over 10 years ago, wasn&#x27;t able to find it till now. It&#x27;s almost easier to use after you&#x27;ve had it in your pocket for a while.  When you use it, run about 1/4 inch out (about 5mm) put your finger and thumb on the product and then TURN the tube so it slowly melts onto your fingers. From there you can rub your fingers together and get it nice and smooth.  A comb works for getting it to all the places you need it, but a brush can get it there without the build up.  YOU CAN USE TOO MUCH. If you have a mini flat iron it works REALLY well as a protector for your hair. After a pass with a flat iron your hair is SILKY and ready to hold however you have it. It&#x27;s best to use it for a week before tossing it off.  After a few uses you&#x27;ll see how much better it holds than other thin light waxes, and you can ALSO use this WITH other waxes. This is best for FIRM poins of beards/Moustaches and for getting it to stay that way for more than a few hours.  WORTH the money to buy this stuff over tube creams. It&#x27;s not a ton of money so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re out 10 bucks for a large tub you can only keep at home. SO WORTH IT to have a tube with you when you need to do a touch up.</li>
            <li> A masculine smell almost like a cigar but the hold is weak. Tube makes it hard to apply to my stache</li>
            <li> My favorite wax. Smells good and is quick to apply. This is a softer wax that will give you control without stiffness. Don&#x27;t expect it to hold any crazy styles. That&#x27;s what Clubman is for.</li>
            <li> A product that is to be used right under your nose should not have a fragrance. It is almost unbearable.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a thicker product, similar to Dax wave and groom, but I do like the fact that it is pocket size.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a mustache wax, so I have nothing to compare it to. Bought this to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; the hairs of my mustache a bit, as they prefer to grow downward, rather than the outward direction I&#x27;d prefer. Does a decent job of keeping things in place, but the smell gets tiring - being right under your nose all day long - and is difficult to wash the fragrance out.  Also keep in mind, if you kiss your wife/girlfriend/whatever, they will have to deal with the fragrance themselves all day.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find elsewhere.  I am glad I found it.  Shipping was fast and item arrieved in good condition.  will buy again.</li>
            <li> Order this from Amazon.com and it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ve sported a moustache for years and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> The product works well and has a medium hold, but the fragrance is something between a bathroom air freshener, baby powder and my grandfather&#x27;s cologne. Not really what I was hoping for, especially for a product applied directly under my nose.</li>
            <li> Having it in a tube in your pocket keeps it warm and pliable without having to extensively work it first.</li>
            <li> If you have an unruly moustache, or just one that you&#x27;re trying to  shape, Father&#x27;s Moustache Wax is for you. It&#x27;s easy to use, just wax over the moustache and shape by hand or comb. The wax comes in a small handy tube the size and shape of chapstick so it&#x27;s easy to carry and takes only seconds to use. Can be used on eyebrows too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very easy to use and works well. It holds for about 8 hours until it needs another coat. The packaging was hilarious it really made the product worth the buy. I was all set to \\&quot;groom my bloom\\&quot; when it showed up at my door.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, smells great and fits in my pocket for repairs on the go. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This wax is OK but I&#x27;ll be buying another brand and size for grooming in the morning. This is OK for carrying in your pocket for touch-ups but it&#x27;s too expensive for initial grooming in the morning.</li>
            <li> This really is not much more than an expensive tube of Chapstick. Works fine but too much money. 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anything anywhere else locally that was even available, let alone that would work with my red beard. Came fast and easy, and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clubman wax, and Father&#x27;s is superior in every concievable way:    APPLICATION: I wasn&#x27;t sold on the chapstick-style applicator, but compared to the metal tube and cheap plastic brush, Father&#x27;s is easy to apply, and even easier to carry!    SMELL: The mildly sweet beeswax smell of the Father&#x27;s product is actually pleasant--all the more so compared to the acrid, almost-metallic odor of Clubman    COLOR: The natural wax color fades almost instantly into my stache.  The white goo of the other product makes my black hair look grey    CONSISTENCY: Father&#x27;s rubs easily into my hair, and distributes evenly, whereas the other tends to clump.    HOLD: Works great to put stubborn hairs back into place.  I think the application technique (rubbing the stick straight on the hair) helps in this regard.    The only negative?  It&#x27;s not sold by Amazon, so the shipping is artificially high.  I figure I&#x27;ll just buy several at a time, to offset the shipping cost.    I love this product!</li>
            <li> If you have a moustache then this wax if for you.  I use it all the time as it holds my moustache in check.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a very easy to apply container (like chap-stick for your lips) and packs a pleasant aroma for the first few hours after applying. What really turns me back to this product over the others I&#x27;ve tried (traditional mens grooming brands and some more modern unisex hair products that promote really strong hold on hair) is that the viscosity (for lack of a better word) of the wax, is gentle enough for me to curl my 2 inch handle bars with my fingers while not drying out or freeze holding my hair in place before I finish styling it. It does take some effort to wash off which is good and bad - I use shampoo every day to rinse it off, washing my face with plain water will not wash it out, but will loosen out enough to make the curls I have loosen out a bit. I&#x27;m also certain that it is not the products loosening the curls but rather my face moving around a lot and the hair getting moved around. I think as long as I keep this unusual facial hair experience going, I will not buy another product. My partner likes the smell, she says its a manly aroma that nudges for a second kiss ;) For me, the smell took a bit to get used to (about two weeks of daily use) but after I saw how good it was working I didn&#x27;t even think about it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: I highly recommend this product over the 2-3 others that I&#x27;ve tried. keeps discretely hair in place and smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: Be careful of napkins and hot liquids as they will loosen the wax out of the moustache and leave you with a messy look until you wash it off and reapply.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this wax a try since it was one of the more inexpensive waxes.  Comes in a chapstick style tube which makes for easy carrying. Application is easy and it smells good. It blends in nicely and not a lot of clumpy build up. Keeps mustache hair in place but I find myself needing several applications through the day. Not really good for thick full mustaches.</li>
            <li> okay but could be a little larger package</li>
            <li> Did&#x27;nt like.  I don&#x27;t remember why.  I bought it awhile ago and put it on once and never again.  I think because it seemed to be to oily.</li>
            <li> Recieved the neutral shade, works well but took another post&#x27;s advice on using hair drier to help hide the \\&quot;white spots\\&quot; after applying (which is great when at home). Good product, not a strong smell under the nose.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is near perfect -- good hold, extremely convenient &amp;#34;chapstick tube&amp;#34; applicator -- except the very strong smell.  Several hours later, it was still all I could smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, especially if you&#x27;re not as fragrance-phobic as I am.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell... a manly, turn of the previous century barber shop sort of smell.  I can imagine Wyatt Earp smelling like this just as he stepped out of a 1910 barbershop with his mustache freshly and professionally waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not for me, at all.  For me personally, it would be a 1.  For someone who wants that sort of scent, it would probably be a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the wax I want is not made, so I guess I&#x27;m going to have to start looking at recipes.</li>
            <li> this is the only moustache wax he&#x27;ll use, he swears by it!!! doesn&#x27;t leave the waxy residue that others leave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my husband, who has been attempting to style his &#x27;stache for awhile now.  The smell is pretty good, kind of herbal-y and the tube is convenient.  I&#x27;m not sure if the hold is really strong enough for him and what he&#x27;s attempting to do (twist the ends of his moustache) but he likes it.  He has to use quite a bit to achieve his desired results.  We haven&#x27;t purchased moustache wax before so maybe that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and continues to be the best moustache wax on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 11:48...wax ain&#x27;t stickin like it was @ 8:15 when i applied. it looks like a chapstick and i&#x27;d suggest keepin it wit u versus just one apply in da morn</li>
            <li> I got this in the winter and so it was pretty hard to get it to lay on my stache.  It ended up ripping a lot of hairs out trying to apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only wax I use.</li>
            <li> The convenient tube is nice, but it&#x27;s scent is too strong--especially for a product that is used right under ones nose.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  Light enough not to interfere with after shave or cologne if I choose to apply any.  I like the fact that it is in a tube because it is easy to cary with me.  I have a full stache and goatee (grey)and it keeps me looking well gromed.  I buy 4-5 tubes at a time to save on shipping and then I always have extra on hand if I should need it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my eyebrows.  It works so much better than gels sold for women.  It lasts all day and is not  obvious unless you use too much.  The price is great too.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Father&#x27;s Mustache Wax holds great and smells even better.  I think that the convenience of being in a chapstick like tube helps out tremendously as well.  Love it.</li>
            <li> the product was everything it stated, it holds well and smells good but for the price it is a very small tube. Somehow I missed this when I was reading the other reviews of products. I thoght I was getting an ounce and it is 1/8th of an ounce. Other than that issue it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Bought this from a recomendation from a friend who enters moustache contests with his super long &amp;#34;stache&amp;#34;.  Mine is average and this wax works great.</li>
            <li> This is the first mustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used. It allows me to get all the individual whiskers aligned on my &amp;#34;Fu Manchu&amp;#34; style mustache without a heavy buildup and I only have to apply it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Father&#x27;s Moustache Wax for several years now.  It does not get stiff as the days goes along but it continues to hold it&#x27;s shape.  No messly flakes of hardened wax falling off either.  The neutral shade works with all hair color as mine changes from blonde to grey.</li>
            <li> The wax works well. I like the tube application, its like putting on chapstick. The smell is terrible. It smells like pouporri. If not for the smell id be fine with it. I can smell it the whole day. My next wax will be unscented.</li>
            <li> The tube form makes it really easy to apply, as well as transport. I like the smell of it, it is rather comforting and lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will echo what other people have said, this isn&#x27;t really an all-day wax. It works well in the morning, but by the afternoon it starts to fall. You can apply a touch up, and that will get it through the rest of the day, or leave it alone and have a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I don&#x27;t plan on growing it out long enough that styling (i.e. points, handle-bars, curls, etc) this product has done really well at training my mustache to grow out to the sides vs straight down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I&#x27;ve had a beard since 2k, but kept it short for most of it (a 1 guard on most clippers). A friend suggested that I try growing out the &#x27;stache part a bit, to be fuller. The problem I had was it growing down over the lips, which looked horrible, and prompted the search for mustache wax to \\&quot;train\\&quot; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If what you&#x27;re looking for is a \\&quot;full\\&quot; &#x27;stache that goes out to the side in a natural look, but don&#x27;t plan on styling it (read: wax it out to points, or handlebars, or other), then this is a good solution. It will blend in smoothly, give enough grip to shape it outwards, but will still be relaxed enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since bought several tubes, so I can have one at home, one at work and one with me, to touch up as necessary.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for a while for a good natural facial hair styling product- most of which were too expensive or had bad reviews. This one was advertised as to smell of patchouli and sandalwood. The smell is noticeable, but it has a pleasant earthy aroma- nothing more than a man should smell like. Application was easy after warming it up in my pocket. I didn&#x27;t really need much to keep hairs away from my mouth. No noticeable clumping or excessive shine, and it blends exceptionally well with my black hair. Styling left little to be desired. Forms perfectly for my tastes with a little more wax. Next to no residue on the fingertips. Definitely returning for more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It applies like a Chap-Stic balm. Needs mustache to be dry; but very good at holding errant hairs. Almost no odor which is good if you&#x27;re going out beer tasting.</li>
            <li> It keeps my mustache out of my mouth.  Easy to have around; easy to apply.  Smells like an old man who&#x27;s just been to his old man barber.  Like tobacco mixed with barbicide.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, doesn&#x27;t have very strong hold, and didn&#x27;t last very long either. I gave my tube away to my dad.</li>
            <li> Strong odor, so strong I threw product away.</li>
            <li> Hold is decent - better than clubmans and is quite firm - my tactic is to actually rub it into the tines of my comb and then comb it through my mustache before shaping. The only major qualm I have is with the scent... if you don&#x27;t mind smelling this fragrance all day, I guess it&#x27;s ok... I prefer for the smell to die off an hour of so after application. The smell of this stuff does not dissipate, and it has a smell very similar to Murray&#x27;s Pomade, with a faint whiff of play doh for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dried finish is rather soft, not sticky. This would not be a good wax for a sharp Dali... fine for me, but if you are looking for a sharp shaping wax I&#x27;d go with Firehouse Wacky Tacky.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it felt, but it was WAY too smelly. Its not the kind if smell you can get used to. My throat began to burn after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> This mustache wax makes me smell like I could kill a man during a Bowie-knife duel to the death over a woman&#x27;s honor. Also, it holds like a pit bull on a hog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since purchase I have started three hobbies: combing civil war battle fields with a metal detector, old coin collecting and long distance bicycling. Next month I intend to try my hand at musket making.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s basically what this is, Chapstick for our moustache.  It has a pleasing scent and is easy to apply.  It&#x27;s a lot less of a messy hassle than the creams for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my boyfriend.  Some mentioned the smell, niether of us have a problem with that.  He doesn&#x27;t feel it gives the hold he wanted, but his &#x27;handlebars&#x27; are still in training.  He does like the stick type applicator</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving 5 stars for the perfect moustache wax.  I may never get to use it.  Father&#x27;s wax is coming close, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold.  The hold is good, not great, but good.  Real good.  It&#x27;ll last most of a day with minimal loss, provided that you don&#x27;t drink a lot of hot liquid, the bane of every moustache wax.  And with the twist tube in your pocket, you&#x27;re a mirror visit away from a touch-up.  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried is way way too stiff, or too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery method.  The stick is brilliant.  Anything wax thin enough to be used from a squeeze tube just can&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;m looking at you Clubman.  Not so stiff that you need a shovel to dig it out, and 20 minutes to work into your &#x27;stache.  Now I&#x27;m looking to the current crop of &amp;#34;artisan&amp;#34; waxes, like Firehouse Wacky Tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent.  This is a matter of contention among some, as it&#x27;s really subjective.  If you think Bay Rhum aftershave smells like a man should smell, this is a your wax.  If you wear whatever CK scent your metrosexual man mag tells you is the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; scent, keep moving along, nothing to see here.  In moustache terms, think more bare-knuckle boxer and less Belgian detective.  In any case it fades pretty rapidly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with enjoying food or drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a wax that renders your &#x27;stache into something that looks applied rather than grown, look for a &amp;#34;tin&amp;#34; type wax that you have to work into, and more importantly, OUT of your moustache.  Seriously, those thicker waxes are hard to properly use, and as a first-time starter wax, will put you right off the use of any product.  If you are curling your lip broom for a quick picture, with no intention of keeping it thus styled, and accepting that if you apply even a little too much you&#x27;re going to look like you ate a glazed doughnut by rubbing it in, you need Clubman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for that sweet, sweet balance of hold, convenience, and ease of use, I&#x27;venot yet found a better wax than Father&#x27;s Moustache Wax.  It ain&#x27;t perfect, but then there may not be a perfect moustache wax for sale anywhere.  This is a great wax for everyday use, for the guy just starting out and maybe gone past the &amp;#34;intro&amp;#34; wax, Clubman, (you could easily bypass that product altogether, but I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re already tried it before you got to this review) and a great wax to use for that established &#x27;stache that is already trained.</li>
            <li> Holds your mustache rather well but if you don&#x27;t want to smell like old hippy, this isn&#x27;t for you. I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviews but I went for it and man does it smell bad. Smells like patchouli oil and unless you want to go back to Woodstock, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> A good quality wax.  Like the dispensing tube.  Easy to carry for daily touchups.</li>
            <li> My husband was wanting some mustache wax - so I found this. He uses it every day! Helps him get a little curl to the ends of the mustache.</li>
            <li> This moustache wax was unable to tame my &#x27;stache. I tried to saturate my cookie duster with the chapstick like wax dispenser, but the food broom carried on its merry way. I&#x27;ll note that my lip caterpillar had ample length to achieve some spectacular shape. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson to not cheap out on moustache wax.</li>
            <li> I honestly wonder how this mixture is different from Chapstick lip balm.  It comes in a tube identically to Chapstick, and I am disappointed in the lack of holding power.  I actually get  better control with just hair spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband ! He loved it. It is easy to loose it because it&#x27;s so small lol but good quality!</li>
            <li> Not quite as stiff as some, but smells better than many and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery and securely packaged.</li>
            <li> have used this for years and recently it became difficult to find on store shelves.  Amazon.com came to the rescue.  Found it here with no problem.</li>
            <li> This is basically a tube of chapstick - seriously.  Imagine rubbing chapstick on your moustache.  That&#x27;s what applying this is like.  I can&#x27;t imagine this product working well for anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is fine for mustaches, but I bought it to use on eyebrows.  (Eyebrow wax is priced much higher.)  So it&#x27;s not the manufacturer&#x27;s fault the product didn&#x27;t work for me.  It is easy to apply....it just goops up.</li>
            <li> Works to keep mustache out of your mouth.  Comes in a chapstick type tube and it goes on good.  But it only last for about 3 hours or so, if you don&#x27;t drink coffee  (coke, pepsi or whatever) for that time.</li>
            <li> This is a good wax for control, but not so much for flamboyant shaping. At body temperature it quickly melts in and gives a good hold for a few hours, but I found that with longer mustaches/beards the wax doesn&#x27;t have the hold that will keep a larger/more imaginative shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several tubes for my husband&#x27;s handlebar mustache. He loves this brand over other bigger brand names because of the smell, neutral color, and portability (he carries it in his front shirt pocket). Great product and great price!</li>
