            <li>A staple for my full-face-make up days for sure.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price either &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this during the company&#x27;s promotion and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this duo set.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, it also came with a free &amp;#34;dont&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Love this brow brush.</li>
            <li>It is better than the eyebrow brush that I am using now.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I think I will love it for my pomade I have.</li>
            <li>Use this every day and I love it</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>The spoolie is nice and full too.</li>
            <li>I then bought this one and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 6.5 inches long and is a perfect fit for my collection.</li>
            <li>A great tool to have a natural look.  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice eyebrow brush, easy to hold in hand and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is my first brow brush, and I really liked it, I&#x27;m using it with the anastasia dipbrow.</li>
            <li>I love the double-ended brushes and it is super easy to use👍</li>
            <li>The first one must have be defective because the second one is really great!</li>
            <li>I super mega love it</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and if taken good care of, this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>The comb brush can be bent a little so its at a perfect angle for you.</li>
            <li>I currently use a Paula Dorf brush which is great</li>
            <li>Works great and is essential when using Dipbrow...</li>
            <li>Got a defective brush but seller sent another free of charge.</li>
            <li>This brush applies powdered eyebrow color lightly and then the brush makes them fuller.  </li>
            <li>; so I couldn&#x27;t get a precise line with it</li>
            <li>The brush is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is way better than the eyebrow brush I have right now.</li>
            <li>This angled brush has very tight bristles that&#x27;re perfect for when I&#x27;m filling in my brows.</li>
            <li>I got this brush and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Anastasia brow tool but have switched over to this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to everyone I know who needs a good brow duo brush, but realizes how overpriced the higher end ones can be.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying that it is a duo brush because right now I use two separate brushes right now.</li>
            <li>this is just what I needed and for a reasonable price satisfied customer</li>
            <li>this brush comes dual ended as this removes the hassle of keeping two different brushes for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The brush stick is also of good quality and make.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about&lt;</li>
            <li>It is my first time using one and your brush made it easy.</li>
            <li>The spoolie on the other side is great when you see some brow hairs you need to trim.</li>
            <li>The brush is thin and precise, which helps me to draw a perfect brow line.</li>
            <li>Received item quickly.</li>
            <li>I already like this new brush much better than the ABH brush.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE my new Keshima Eyebrow Duo</li>
            <li>My new favorite brush comparing it to the Anastasia of Beverly Hills brush.</li>
            <li>Love it very professional results</li>
            <li>Great little eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of your brand when I had found this brush, but it looked to be high quality for a much better price than the ones that are sold by Anastasia Beverly Hills.</li>
            <li>The spoolie end combs through every hair smoothly and the angled brush works very well with my dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li>I ordered yours instead and it was definitely worth the $10.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My Keshima eyebrow brush is so much better than the ones I have used that I have just thrown the old ones out.  </li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too soft, not too stiff and perfectly applies my brow powder.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness for filling in brows.</li>
            <li>Lines came out clean and straight.</li>
            <li>And the good thing is it&#x27;s not expensive as the other brushes.</li>
            <li>When you put too much on your eyebrows, it helps brush off the excess, and give it a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>When a couple of coworkers suggested a duo brush that was double what this one cost, I did some research because I really can&#x27;t imagine paying over $10 for any kind of brush.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Like this brush very much.  </li>
            <li>Its made of strong wood and hence it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>mascara want is great for when I&#x27;m trying to trim my eyebrows and it helps me to see the extra long ones that make plucking and shaping my brows easier to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is the exact angle and firmness I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love the brush, It was also sent and delivered in a timely matter</li>
            <li>Work really well!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to, which is to apply brow powder in a manageable way and groom my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, made such a difference for me...</li>
            <li>I got the exact results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I actually like this brush a lot better than my $26 brow brush I have.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This is the first eyebrow brush I have ever gotten</li>
            <li>Thank you soooo much!</li>
            <li>These bristles did not seem as full or as stiff as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me along my eyebrow journey ;)</li>
            <li>It is also long enough provide a good grip.</li>
            <li>is fine enough to draw a defined line.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy little brush to have for brows.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine and soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li>I can use the very tip of the brush to flick color into my brows.</li>
            <li>Its inexpensive and works really well.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d wind up with much heavier brows than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable and well made.</li>
            <li>I never thought there was much difference in eye brow brushes.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this is a highly recommended duo eyebrow brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li>I also use this side of the tool to brush my eyebrow hair straight up so that i can trim them.</li>
            <li>I really like the Keshima Eyebrow Duo brush.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this for my brows.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to apply it as much as I did with my anatasia brush.</li>
            <li>but yours is at least as good</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, yet stiff for a good application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use,not too hard nor too soft,and the price is great comparing with other brands!!</li>
            <li>This brush is of high quality and is priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>love the double usage of the brush and not needing to have extra brushes in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super simple to use!</li>
            <li>high quality</li>
            <li>So far, I really do like this Duo Brush</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more of these brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li>I normally use the ABC #12 brush for my brows</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for new products or updating my existing stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love how the spoolie is not too harsh but not too soft either.  </li>
            <li>The brush is stiff enough to draw a nice arch.  </li>
            <li>My friend who has the Anastasia brush said it&#x27;s almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li>and it looks NATURAL!</li>
            <li>so when my more expensive brow brush began to wither away I had to find a replacement quickly.  </li>
            <li>Excited to check out other products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super convenient to have an eyebrow brush on one end and a spoolie on the other to groom your eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I really can&#x27;t see this one wearing out anytime in the near future or in 2015 or 2016.</li>
            <li>the Spoolie is a bit softer but it works and the bristle of the brush is semi soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really really soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brush is soft</li>
            <li>I have yet to actually use the brush; however, I love how firm the brush side is</li>
            <li>My eyebrows looked like crap before I started using this brush, now they look awesome!</li>
            <li>Nice very smooth and thin but not as thin as i excepted.</li>
            <li>: After writing the above review, the sellers of this Duo Eyebrow Brush reached out and sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>I like the spoolie side of this tool a lot, but I&#x27;m finding that the angled brush on the other end is too soft to make really defined brows.</li>
            <li>love how thin the brush is</li>
            <li>I do wish the bristles on the dipping end were a little more stiff</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this duo set.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, it also came with a free &amp;#34;dont&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> It is better than the eyebrow brush that I am using now.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and I think I will love it for my pomade I have.</li>
            <li> Use this every day and I love it</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> The spoolie is nice and full too.</li>
            <li> I then bought this one and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 6.5 inches long and is a perfect fit for my collection.</li>
            <li> A great tool to have a natural look.  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice eyebrow brush, easy to hold in hand and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first brow brush, and I really liked it, I&#x27;m using it with the anastasia dipbrow.</li>
            <li> I love the double-ended brushes and it is super easy to use👍</li>
            <li> The first one must have be defective because the second one is really great!</li>
            <li> I super mega love it</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and if taken good care of, this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> The comb brush can be bent a little so its at a perfect angle for you.</li>
            <li> I currently use a Paula Dorf brush which is great</li>
            <li> Works great and is essential when using Dipbrow...</li>
            <li> Got a defective brush but seller sent another free of charge.</li>
            <li> This brush applies powdered eyebrow color lightly and then the brush makes them fuller.  </li>
            <li> ; so I couldn&#x27;t get a precise line with it</li>
            <li> The brush is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the eyebrow brush I have right now.</li>
            <li> This angled brush has very tight bristles that&#x27;re perfect for when I&#x27;m filling in my brows.</li>
            <li> I got this brush and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Anastasia brow tool but have switched over to this one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to everyone I know who needs a good brow duo brush, but realizes how overpriced the higher end ones can be.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying that it is a duo brush because right now I use two separate brushes right now.</li>
            <li> this is just what I needed and for a reasonable price satisfied customer</li>
            <li> this brush comes dual ended as this removes the hassle of keeping two different brushes for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The brush stick is also of good quality and make.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about&lt;</li>
            <li> It is my first time using one and your brush made it easy.</li>
            <li> The spoolie on the other side is great when you see some brow hairs you need to trim.</li>
            <li> The brush is thin and precise, which helps me to draw a perfect brow line.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly.</li>
            <li> I already like this new brush much better than the ABH brush.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE my new Keshima Eyebrow Duo</li>
            <li> My new favorite brush comparing it to the Anastasia of Beverly Hills brush.</li>
            <li> Love it very professional results</li>
            <li> Great little eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of your brand when I had found this brush, but it looked to be high quality for a much better price than the ones that are sold by Anastasia Beverly Hills.</li>
            <li> The spoolie end combs through every hair smoothly and the angled brush works very well with my dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> I ordered yours instead and it was definitely worth the $10.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My Keshima eyebrow brush is so much better than the ones I have used that I have just thrown the old ones out.  </li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft, not too stiff and perfectly applies my brow powder.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness for filling in brows.</li>
            <li> Lines came out clean and straight.</li>
            <li> And the good thing is it&#x27;s not expensive as the other brushes.</li>
            <li> When you put too much on your eyebrows, it helps brush off the excess, and give it a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> When a couple of coworkers suggested a duo brush that was double what this one cost, I did some research because I really can&#x27;t imagine paying over $10 for any kind of brush.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Like this brush very much.  </li>
            <li> Its made of strong wood and hence it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> mascara want is great for when I&#x27;m trying to trim my eyebrows and it helps me to see the extra long ones that make plucking and shaping my brows easier to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is the exact angle and firmness I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love the brush, It was also sent and delivered in a timely matter</li>
            <li> Work really well!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to, which is to apply brow powder in a manageable way and groom my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, made such a difference for me...</li>
            <li> I got the exact results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I actually like this brush a lot better than my $26 brow brush I have.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This is the first eyebrow brush I have ever gotten</li>
            <li> Thank you soooo much!</li>
            <li> These bristles did not seem as full or as stiff as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping me along my eyebrow journey ;)</li>
            <li> It is also long enough provide a good grip.</li>
            <li> is fine enough to draw a defined line.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy little brush to have for brows.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine and soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li> I can use the very tip of the brush to flick color into my brows.</li>
            <li> Its inexpensive and works really well.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d wind up with much heavier brows than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and well made.</li>
            <li> I never thought there was much difference in eye brow brushes.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this is a highly recommended duo eyebrow brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li> I also use this side of the tool to brush my eyebrow hair straight up so that i can trim them.</li>
            <li> I really like the Keshima Eyebrow Duo brush.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this for my brows.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to apply it as much as I did with my anatasia brush.</li>
            <li> but yours is at least as good</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, yet stiff for a good application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use,not too hard nor too soft,and the price is great comparing with other brands!!</li>
            <li> This brush is of high quality and is priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> love the double usage of the brush and not needing to have extra brushes in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super simple to use!</li>
            <li> high quality</li>
            <li> So far, I really do like this Duo Brush</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more of these brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li> I normally use the ABC #12 brush for my brows</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for new products or updating my existing stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love how the spoolie is not too harsh but not too soft either.  </li>
            <li> The brush is stiff enough to draw a nice arch.  </li>
            <li> My friend who has the Anastasia brush said it&#x27;s almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li> and it looks NATURAL!</li>
            <li> so when my more expensive brow brush began to wither away I had to find a replacement quickly.  </li>
            <li> Excited to check out other products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super convenient to have an eyebrow brush on one end and a spoolie on the other to groom your eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I really can&#x27;t see this one wearing out anytime in the near future or in 2015 or 2016.</li>
            <li> the Spoolie is a bit softer but it works and the bristle of the brush is semi soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really really soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brush is soft</li>
            <li> I have yet to actually use the brush; however, I love how firm the brush side is</li>
            <li> My eyebrows looked like crap before I started using this brush, now they look awesome!</li>
            <li> Nice very smooth and thin but not as thin as i excepted.</li>
            <li> : After writing the above review, the sellers of this Duo Eyebrow Brush reached out and sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> I like the spoolie side of this tool a lot, but I&#x27;m finding that the angled brush on the other end is too soft to make really defined brows.</li>
            <li> love how thin the brush is</li>
            <li> I do wish the bristles on the dipping end were a little more stiff</li>
            <li> Not too firm, not too soft.</li>
            <li> Very thin fine angled brush.</li>
            <li> have to work on my brows every day as half of one is missing [due to a scar] and what&#x27;s left of both brows is very sparse.  </li>
            <li> It is firm enough to apply eyebrow powder and flexible enough to soften it.  </li>
            <li> It not what I expected but still good&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyebrows no longer look like they&#x27;re fighting each other.</li>
            <li> The angled brow brush has firm bristles, firm enough to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I bought the Ardell duo brush thinking the reviews of the brush being too soft might be different to me and it cost less, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> If my other brush was dirty I would use it, but it&#x27;s not one that I would grab for first.</li>
            <li> I also use it to line my lids with powder for a line that&#x27;s a little softer than eye liner gives.</li>
            <li> I like the brush and use it everyday</li>
            <li> I received the brush few days ago.</li>
            <li> I used it already few times.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are light and skimpy and I hate the look of &amp;#34;drawn</li>
            <li> They were not cheap brushes either.  </li>
            <li> This product was a complete fail.</li>
            <li> and I am hoping that it holds up longer than my previous ABH one!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to the Anastasia brow brush that is usually used with the dip brow pomade.</li>
            <li> There was a drop of dried glue in the brush, so I was annoyed and returned it, not planning on buying another.</li>
            <li> the round bristles!!</li>
            <li> (Plus it&#x27;s about $12 less expensive!)  </li>
            <li> The bristles do not feel hard or uncomfortable while using.</li>
            <li> My daughters thought that it was very poor quality and did not work well at all.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad for the price  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, after 2 uses the wand at the end fell off.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed by any Keshima brushes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered a pricey eyebrow pomade and was very disappointed to discover they didn&#x27;t include a brush.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A bit disappointed, after 2 uses the wand at the end fell off.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this combo eyebrow brush is probably one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  I love how the spoolie is not too harsh but not too soft either.  The bristle end is perfect in the length and stiffness of the bristles.  It&#x27;s clearly well designed and a very good deal too!  I currently use a Paula Dorf brush which is great but yours is at least as good and it has a spoolie too!  (Plus it&#x27;s about $12 less expensive!)  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for shaping and combing your eyebrows. I love the double-ended brushes and it is super easy to use👍</li>
            <li> I love everything about doing makeup, the application, the products, brushes and the variety of colors with makeup.  I am always on the lookout for new products or updating my existing stuff.  I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this makeup brush and the fact that it&#x27;s a duo brush. It has the mascara wand on one end and an eyebrow brush on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara want is great for when I&#x27;m trying to trim my eyebrows and it helps me to see the extra long ones that make plucking and shaping my brows easier to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush on the opposite end of the brush for filling in eyebrows.  The bristles are soft, yet stiff for a good application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the double usage of the brush and not needing to have extra brushes in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> The brush is great, very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with an eyebrow pomade.  I like that I can use the very tip of the brush to flick color into my brows.</li>
            <li> Very thin fine angled brush. Love it!</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush is very easy to use.  When you put too much on your eyebrows, it helps brush off the excess, and give it a more natural look.  Definitely a great product to use.</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyebrows on point! Love the stiffness of the brush and the angled tip defines so well.</li>
            <li> Works great and is essential when using Dipbrow... the most amazing thing ever!</li>
            <li> awesome product...try it!</li>
            <li> I love the brush. it is the exact angle and firmness I was looking for. I use it with the Anastasia Dipbrow and it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of your brand when I had found this brush, but it looked to be high quality for a much better price than the ones that are sold by Anastasia Beverly Hills. I ordered yours instead and it was definitely worth the $10. The spoolie end combs through every hair smoothly and the angled brush works very well with my dipbrow pomade. It applies with great precision and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to everyone I know who needs a good brow duo brush, but realizes how overpriced the higher end ones can be.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DUO BROW BRUSH!&lt;br /&gt;I love how thin the brush is, it helps a great deal to achieve the perfect look for your brows, or liner. Not only do I love the brush, It was also sent and delivered in a timely matter and I had a great experience when contacting the seller for information. I got a quick response and seller was pleasant. I would definitely recommend this product! Its inexpensive and works really well. Hope this review helped anyone who&#x27;s indecisive on purchasing.</li>
            <li> this is just what I needed and for a reasonable price satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow duo brush! It is my first time using one and your brush made it easy. Thanks for helping me along my eyebrow journey ;)</li>
            <li> Great premium quality brush.  The brush is stiff enough to draw a nice arch.  I use it with my Anastasia dipbrow.</li>
            <li> I like this brow brush. It&#x27;s really perfect. It works wonderful with Anastasia Dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely delighted with the Keshima Eyebrow Duo Brush. Wish I had known about it years ago. It has made such a difference with my brows. You have done an awesome job with both design and quality. Kudos!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I would re purchase or even give as a gift! Nice quality.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely wonderful duo brow brush. It&#x27;s not too soft, not too stiff and perfectly applies my brow powder. It&#x27;s 6.5 inches long and is a perfect fit for my collection. Keshima has the highest quality brushes in this price point. Very well made.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this brush awesome to use!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to the Anastasia brow brush that is usually used with the dip brow pomade. I love it! It works just as good and it&#x27;s about $8 cheaper. My friend who has the Anastasia brush said it&#x27;s almost exactly the same. I use it with the Anastasia Dip Brow Pomade and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. This is the perfect size brush so you dont create monster brows. The comb brush can be bent a little so its at a perfect angle for you.</li>
            <li> Got a defective brush but seller sent another free of charge. I like the brush and use it everyday</li>
            <li> I just love this brush! It applies my pomade effortlessly. Nice sturdy little brush to have for brows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use,not too hard nor too soft,and the price is great comparing with other brands!!</li>
            <li> I received the brush few days ago. I used it already few times. I really enjoyed it. Not only the brush looks good and the packaging is beautiful, but also the quality of the product is very very good. The brush is thin and precise, which helps me to draw a perfect brow line. I love it - great job!</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product, it works really good.</li>
            <li> This is my go to brush whenever  I do my brows I do wish the bristles on the dipping end were a little more stiff but it&#x27;s a great brush</li>
            <li> This angled brush has very tight bristles that&#x27;re perfect for when I&#x27;m filling in my brows. Love this product</li>
            <li> I have purchased many eyebrow brushes and they can not compare to how awesome this brush is.  I love how skinny the brush is.  It makes me have perfect eyebrows every time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. The quality bypasses its price and it helps my eyebrow application look nearly flawless!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, amazing product &amp; has my eyebrows looking so good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used it with dipbrow for a flawless application</li>
            <li> Awesome brush with an awesome price! Gives you great control!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush!!</li>
            <li> Love the combo eyebrow brush. The bristles are just the right stiffness for filling in brows. I also use it to line my lids with powder for a line that&#x27;s a little softer than eye liner gives.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush! Not too firm, not too soft. The spoolie- spooly?!) the round bristles!! Work really well!</li>
            <li> This brush works great!  It does exactly what I want it to, which is to apply brow powder in a manageable way and groom my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and beautiful and lightweight hand</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price point! Excited to check out other products!</li>
            <li> I got this brush and was excited to try it. Hell, it&#x27;s a makeup brush... I love brushes. I didn&#x27;t LOVE this brush though. I think if I didn&#x27;t have one before it would do the job, but I think I preferred the one I had prior. These bristles did not seem as full or as stiff as I would have liked. Granted it does the job though. If my other brush was dirty I would use it, but it&#x27;s not one that I would grab for first.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, made such a difference for me...I am a Grandma, so I have used many brush&#x27;s, thank you&lt;br /&gt;Keshima Products...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good brush for this money. I use it every day, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this product for everyone. The brush perfectly defines my brows now. And the good thing is it&#x27;s not expensive as the other brushes. I love this product and I&#x27;ll surely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase. This brush is of high quality and is priced reasonably. I got the exact results I was hoping for. Will definitely purchase more of these brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li> i use it for trim my eyebrows.  great brush!</li>
            <li> Great quality for affordable price. Received item quickly. Would buy again. Seller contacted me asking my opinion. Great customer service</li>
            <li> I love the duo brush!  My eyebrows are light and skimpy and I hate the look of &amp;#34;drawn on&amp;#34; eyebrows.  This brush applies powdered eyebrow color lightly and then the brush makes them fuller.  Great product</li>
            <li> It works! Now if I can only figure out how to use them correctly!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  A great tool to have a natural look.  Couldn&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for using with my Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade!! Allows me to fill in my brows to the desired shape. I love it! Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love this! My eyebrows looked like crap before I started using this brush, now they look awesome! I use it with Anastasia Beverly Hills dip brow and I love my brows. :)</li>
            <li> This is my first brow brush, and I really liked it, I&#x27;m using it with the anastasia dipbrow.</li>
            <li> Brush is amazing! Great value! I&#x27;m using it for my Laura Mericer brow&lt;br /&gt; definer and it&#x27;s perfect! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush/spoolie to replace brush #12 by ABH.  I already like this new brush much better than the ABH brush.  I am hoping that it holds up better, as well.  The ABH brush started to &amp;#34;fluff out&amp;#34; so I couldn&#x27;t get a precise line with it and I&#x27;d wind up with much heavier brows than I wanted.  Then the spoolie part went AWOL in my makeup bag one day....just...poof, dropped off the handle....I hadn&#x27;t used it, just went to get the brush and the spoolie was floating about in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to work on my brows every day as half of one is missing [due to a scar] and what&#x27;s left of both brows is very sparse.  I *need* to fill them in ... so when my more expensive brow brush began to wither away I had to find a replacement quickly.  So far, I really do like this Duo Brush and I am hoping that it holds up longer than my previous ABH one!</li>
            <li> Received a defective brush but seller took care of problem.</li>
            <li> Great brush wont use anything else!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought the more expensive equivalent to this duo brush and I can&#x27;t imagine why I would. This brush does the trick!!! It&#x27;s very durable and well made. I love the precision of this brush. Keep in mind, that I&#x27;m a makeup minimalist and I&#x27;m just getting into doing my eyebrows. When a couple of coworkers suggested a duo brush that was double what this one cost, I did some research because I really can&#x27;t imagine paying over $10 for any kind of brush. I&#x27;m too happy I found this one! It works beautifully! The description for this duo brush is spot on. It is premium quality indeed. i definitely recommend the Duo Eyebrow Brush to any and everyone. And when and if this one wears out, I&#x27;ll buy the same brush all over again. Nevertheless, I really can&#x27;t see this one wearing out anytime in the near future or in 2015 or 2016.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because of the reviews. It wasn&#x27;t bad for the price  and I love it. Best eyebrow brush that I own.</li>
            <li> This brush works well with both powder and brow pomade. The spoolie end is good quality and the angled brush end is fine enough to draw a defined line.</li>
            <li> Brush works great! Awesome customer Service(:</li>
            <li> Like this brush very much.  It is firm enough to apply eyebrow powder and flexible enough to soften it.  It is also long enough provide a good grip. Would order again.</li>
            <li> There was a drop of dried glue in the brush, so I was annoyed and returned it, not planning on buying another. The company emailed me asking how I liked it, so I told them what happened, and they sent me a free replacement. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks like it will be perfect. The brush is fine and soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li> I never thought there was much difference in eye brow brushes.  I saw differences in blush brushes but not eyebrow.  My Keshima eyebrow brush is so much better than the ones I have used that I have just thrown the old ones out.  They were not cheap brushes either.  I am really impressed by the difference in the applicator end of this duo brush.  It is wonderful.  I am going to stick with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I super mega love it this brush works better then my MAC brush this been my favorite since I bought it</li>
            <li> Using it daily w/my Dipbrow Pomade, and it&#x27;s wonderfully easy and perfect.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> best eyebrow brush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I use this brush with the Anastasia Beverly Hills Pomade, and I love it! It makes it so easy apply, and at a fraction of the price of the ABH brush!!</li>
            <li> Love it very professional results my eyebrows never looked so good!</li>
            <li> A must have. A staple for my full-face-make up days for sure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new Keshima Eyebrow Duo&lt;br /&gt;Brush! The bristles of both ends work perfectly with my eyebrow pencil and&lt;br /&gt;gel. Can&#x27;t beat the price either &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It&#x27;s super convenient to have an eyebrow brush on one end and a spoolie on the other to groom your eyebrow hairs. The brush is perfectly angled and is great for gel or powder brow products. The spoolie on the other side is great when you see some brow hairs you need to trim. The brush is really easy to clean. I actually like this brush a lot better than my $26 brow brush I have. I have yet to be disappointed by any Keshima brushes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review and testing*</li>
            <li> Genuinely liked the product. I really liked the dual ended make of this eyebrow brush.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the bristles is very good. The angled brush is for shaping and defining the brows and the spoolie brush is for grooming. The bristles do not feel hard or uncomfortable while using. Infact it glides away nicely.&lt;br /&gt; Its a good thing this brush comes dual ended as this removes the hassle of keeping two different brushes for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The brush stick is also of good quality and make. Its made of strong wood and hence it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the eyebrow brush I have right now. Very easy to apply my eyebrow powder and it looks NATURAL! The quality is excellent and if taken good care of, this will last you a long time. I bought this during the company&#x27;s promotion and I am glad I did. My eyebrows no longer look like they&#x27;re fighting each other. Yes, this is a highly recommended duo eyebrow brush!</li>
            <li> I like the spoolie side of this tool a lot, but I&#x27;m finding that the angled brush on the other end is too soft to make really defined brows. Bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After writing the above review, the sellers of this Duo Eyebrow Brush reached out and sent me a new one. The first one must have be defective because the second one is really great! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had for about a week so hopefully it will last. So far I love it. It&#x27;s the perfect size for filling in my brows.</li>
            <li> Love it! Really great! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Will recommend friends..</li>
            <li> Great little eyebrow brush. Very well made and the perfect angle to line your brows with powder. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Anastasia Dipbrow. I love this brush!!</li>
            <li> I love this duo set. It&#x27;s great to have the brow brush and the spool brush all in one. The brow brush doesn&#x27;t shed at all. It&#x27;s very well made. The spool brush is not prickly and very smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Very nice, inexpensive brush. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I normally use the ABC #12 brush for my brows so I thought to give this a try. The packaging is nice, it also came with a free &amp;#34;dont&amp;#34; makeup tips Web link.  The bristles are good and it worked just as good as my ABH brush. Lines came out clean and straight. I like it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush!! I bought the Ardell duo brush thinking the reviews of the brush being too soft might be different to me and it cost less, but I was wrong. I then bought this one and was not disappointed at all! The brush is perfect to hold powder or a pomade. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!  This was exactly what I was looking for.  On top of that, the customer service was excellent.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyebrow brush I have ever gotten but it seems to be pretty good. great deal for the price</li>
            <li> Love the dual ended brush, great functionality.  Angled brush is perfect for eyebrow powder application and the spoolie works great.  Glad I gave this one a try!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow brush is perfect for taming my brows.&lt;br /&gt;The comb is perfect for putting all my hairs in the right place. I also use this side of the tool to brush my eyebrow hair straight up so that i can trim them. As for the angled brush side of the tool...It is perfect for applying my brow definer. I use Anastasia brows. I originally bought the Anastasia brow tool but have switched over to this one. It works well and has an awesome price. Cant complain there!</li>
            <li> Nice very smooth and thin but not as thin as i excepted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving using this brush in my make-up routine!!!!  The angled&lt;br /&gt;brush itself is just the right size and perfect for making my eyebrows on&lt;br /&gt;fleek!  The spoolie is nice and full too. I cannot say enough good things about&lt;br /&gt;it... I LOVE this brush!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, not too stiff, the spoolie is just right, and it doesn&#x27;t shed, perfect!</li>
            <li> I ordered a pricey eyebrow pomade and was very disappointed to discover they didn&#x27;t include a brush. I was resigned to paying almost $20 for their applicator…then I found this duo brush by Keshima. I really like the Keshima Eyebrow Duo brush. It works very well. The combination of the angle and spooley brushes helps me apply my eyebrow gel with accuracy and precision. Also, the duo brush works just as well as pricier options.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Great for Anastasia Dip brow pomade!</li>
            <li> Love this brow brush. The bristles aren&#x27;t falling off like others I&#x27;ve purchased. Which in turn helps me while I apply my brow powder. I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete fail. My daughters thought that it was very poor quality and did not work well at all.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice eyebrow brush, easy to hold in hand and easy to use. It is not flimsy and works well. It is better than the eyebrow brush that I am using now. The angled brow brush has firm bristles, firm enough to fill in my eyebrows. This is a good quality eyebrow brush. I got it at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s perfect for grooming and filling in my eyebrows. The brush tip is a perfect angle and firmness. I would recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this for my brows. A perfect dupe for the Anastasia of Beverly Hills brush.</li>
            <li> I have yet to actually use the brush; however, I love how firm the brush side is and I think I will love it for my pomade I have. I am really enjoying that it is a duo brush because right now I use two separate brushes right now.</li>
            <li> My go to eyebrow brush</li>
            <li> Perfect angle brush. I get the perfect eyebrows when I use this brush</li>
            <li> I love it! It is perfect and gets&lt;br /&gt;the job done! Thank you soooo much!</li>
            <li> Use this every day and I love it</li>
            <li> I love it! been using it for 2 weeks! It works almost as good as my anatasia beverly hills duo eyebrow brush. the Spoolie is a bit softer but it works and the bristle of the brush is semi soft. It doesn&#x27;t pick up a lot of the powder, but that&#x27;s how i like it. It&#x27;s a good blender brush and I don&#x27;t need to apply it as much as I did with my anatasia brush.</li>
            <li> great item to add to my makeup brushes. works great! high quality</li>
            <li> I love the brush! It makes filling in my eyebrows a lot easier and smoother! It&#x27;s also really really soft. My new favorite brush comparing it to the Anastasia of Beverly Hills brush. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It not what I expected but still good&lt;br /&gt;Brush is soft which is what I was looking for and the brush was alright</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Perfect size and texture, makes doing your brows super easy.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow brush. It it not the plastic kind which means I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking. And it&#x27;s super simple to use!</li>
