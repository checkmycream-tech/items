            <li>All a state of mind :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li>Regardless of what year I wear, I always get great comments on my fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I first opened the bottle I had to put my noise to the bottle to smell it but to be fair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as strong.  </li>
            <li>Got it for my husband but its really a gift for me as I love the scent and love it when he wears cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a very clean, light and fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t yell out COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>Light and airy with a clean smell.</li>
            <li>It smell familiar to me</li>
            <li>I use some of my CK one (The original) and pour in bottle .1</li>
            <li>I use some of my CK one (The original) and pour in bottle .1</li>
            <li>with each version you add or take away an element - this one is clean as they all are yet not as obtrusive as the 2012 version</li>
            <li>You will fit right</li>
            <li>Fresh water, clean, and sporty fyi.</li>
            <li>It is a very refreshing scent, not flowery at all, which I don&#x27;t personally care for.</li>
            <li>dont think its worth $40 bucks&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon&lt;br /&gt;it smells so fresh - can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li>you get a whiff of a frsh clean, Lime (Not very strong lime) and some kind of melon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only things I dont like is it is a very light.</li>
            <li>Very much smells like a man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>first spritz</li>
            <li>and I would say it more melon than traditional orange,lemon,lime citrus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, The beauty to this scent is spraying on the skin and wearing it in Hot</li>
            <li>This is ment for warmer seasons and hot days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>first time I did that for CK summers</li>
            <li>Someone would have to get close in order to really smell it..</li>

            <li>The scent is very uplifting; citrusy without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for some time, so I could compare a real bottle (from a dept. store) and what arrived here.  </li>
            <li>Nice sent could be for male also but doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li>now mostly wear this outside or work or if I am going to be outside</li>

            <li>I have read other reviews from women who feel this is more masculine than past versions, and I tend to agree, although I think it&#x27;s mostly just the way it smells out of the bottle and not so much as it wears through the day.</li>
            <li>just want to add a few more things since I have been wearing this for months</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts long enough.  </li>
            <li>He does get every summer the new one at the department store, but I was not looking to pay the price this time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming or too strong</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone look for a new different scent or if you plan to go to the beach or someone tropical.</li>
            <li>Everything about this scent says clean and subtle which I normally like</li>
            <li>The only con is that it seems to lack the staying power of the 2013 edition but other than that this is an amazing fragrance, one that can be worn all-year round and not just in summer!</li>

            <li> This is a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband but its really a gift for me as I love the scent and love it when he wears cologne. It&#x27;s not overwhelming or too strong</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I read bad reviews and someone said you will smell like an Alcholic beverage all day.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was always told to think for yourself. I am glad I gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first spritz you get a whiff of a frsh clean, Lime (Not very strong lime) and some kind of melon. At lest that what My noise can detect.&lt;br /&gt;During the dry down and during the day it settles down to a melon and I swear I actually smell salt but maybe its just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very lovely and I would say it more melon than traditional orange,lemon,lime citrus. It smell familiar to me but I cant pinpoint the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The only things I dont like is it is a very light. Everything about this scent says clean and subtle which I normally like but I wanted something more with presence .&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle I had to put my noise to the bottle to smell it but to be fair I was suffering from sinus that night LOL&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is this does not have great projection. I would give it a B- for projection.

            <li> CK Summer has been my only choice of fragrance for the past 5-6 years. Regardless of what year I wear, I always get great comments on my fresh, clean scent. This 2014 edition is no exception. I have read other reviews from women who feel this is more masculine than past versions, and I tend to agree, although I think it&#x27;s mostly just the way it smells out of the bottle and not so much as it wears through the day. It&#x27;s still a very clean, light and fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t yell out COLOGNE. Highly recommend this and all CK Summer scents.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts long enough.  I can spray it about 6 - 8 times on my skin and clothes and an hour later you won&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I love CK one Summer Series...at least I can imagine that I am on the beach.  It is a very refreshing scent, not flowery at all, which I don&#x27;t personally care for.</li>
            <li> Its my fav CK One Summer Edition. Its a tad weak sometimes, run time to me is about 2-3 hours tops (which is avg for Eau de Toilette) and after that you can kinda smell it only on you or if you are close with someone. To help remember put on pulse points wrists, behind ears, and neckline. Don&#x27;t rub it after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes to me are summer beachy undertones of sandalwood, coconut, hint of lime, and sea grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it all year, idc what you may think but summer scents get rid of winter blues for me. All a state of mind :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I bought 2, first time I did that for CK summers and I own 5 versions. 2013 is a close 2nd. Fresh water, clean, and sporty fyi.</li>
            <li> Nice sent could be for male also but doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> Light and airy with a clean smell. Perfect for Summer</li>
            <li> Bad smell. Expensive perfume ever. I would rather use the toilet water</li>
            <li> Great scent and not too strong.</li>
            <li> This is very hard to find in stores  - it&#x27;s a good thing we have Amazon&lt;br /&gt;it smells so fresh - can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using One Summer exclusively for over two years now and I have to say that this year&#x27;s is probably the best so far. The scent is very uplifting; citrusy without being overpowering. The only con is that it seems to lack the staying power of the 2013 edition but other than that this is an amazing fragrance, one that can be worn all-year round and not just in summer!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne and I&#x27;m SO disappointed with the quality, not only does it not smell the same the scent does not stick! It doesn&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;s not as strong.  If you are thinking about purchasing any scent from amazon I would think twice! I have been wearing this fragrance for some time, so I could compare a real bottle (from a dept. store) and what arrived here.  Waste of money. Very Disappointed</li>
            <li> Not as beachy as I thought.  Very much smells like a man&#x27;s cologne.  Very sharp smelling.</li>
            <li> with each version you add or take away an element - this one is clean as they all are yet not as obtrusive as the 2012 version however I wish it had the staying power of 2011 and 2012 -  if you want a light scent for the office or a casual weekend this is the one.....</li>
            <li> The smell is so good but it last for only 1 hour.</li>
            <li> He does get every summer the new one at the department store, but I was not looking to pay the price this time. Less expensive to buy at Amazon and better I received at home.  Great father&#x27;s day gift, great cologne from CK.  We have not have any complaint with the summer editions.  I will recommend.</li>
            <li> my wife does love the fragrance, but it is kind of pricey, but what are you going to do.</li>
