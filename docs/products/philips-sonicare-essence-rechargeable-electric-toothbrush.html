            <li>I had the sonicare rechargeable toothbrush and loved it</li>
            <li>I bought a SONICARE for each member of my family because there is no doubt &amp;#34; PHILLIPS SONICARE ESSENCE IS SUPERIOR TO EVERYTHING ELSE.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good toothbrush.</li>

            <li>this is a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li>Was good, but it doesn&#x27;t have the timer on it like his pervious one did.</li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare Elite for 5 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>I notice it got good reviews from the people who had never had an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Good toothbrush</li>

            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I was a bit dismayed at the lineup of Sonicare brushes and having to make a good choice.</li>
            <li>That said, it seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>I like the features like cover for brush and good instructions for use.</li>
            <li>I loved this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise a good and reliable tooth brush, good size for traveling too.</li>
            <li>I loved sweets (I had a lot of cavities).</li>
            <li>Time will tell if cleaning efficiency is good.</li>
            <li>Good replacement product.</li>
            <li>I like that it is timed so that I know I have cleaned my teeth for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>it is convenient to use, the battery is good and can used for a month with out charging( I use it twice a day).</li>

            <li>My hygienist will be delighted that I am using this twice a day.</li>
            <li>Its all good.</li>
            <li>listerine, my mouth has never felt this good.</li>
            <li>THE BRUSH FEELS GOOD IN MY HANDS</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>AND IT IS GOOD FOR USE.</li>
            <li>I knew it was good though.</li>
            <li>Good quality, as pictured, work well as the manufacture describes.</li>
            <li>And also to my surprise, my son loved it.</li>
            <li>Loved the lightness and simplicity.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I have good dental practices</li>
            <li>God is good.</li>
            <li>Good price too at $39.00.</li>
            <li>The travel case is a good bonus.</li>
            <li>After a good brushing my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>It may be good for a child&#x27;s baby teeth but not for anyone else.  </li>
            <li>Good at cleaning your teeth, but the gunk buildup in the replacement heads is grim.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Good job Phillips.</li>
            <li>Good Deal</li>
            <li>I think the toothbrush works really good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips electric stuff is always good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to explain how good this product works.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonocare has a good reputation and had the components I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>the price is fair</li>
            <li>This is one good toothbrush .</li>
            <li>The price on this for a Sonicare was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased one before and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good quality as well.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are in good condition because I have been using Sonicare for years.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.  </li>
            <li>It does as good a job with my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is an incredible value at $39.99, as this model used to be more like $100.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare is a product that works well and keeps the teeth and gums in good condition.  </li>
            <li>You do not get the impression that it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li>it actually a good feature but</li>
            <li>our dentist always has good reports for us too.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the the that died.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product for this price.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare makes good products to meet the consumers budget.</li>
            <li>I picked up this edition because of the price and the decently good reviews.</li>
            <li>This brand is good, just not the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 1 and 1/2 years- still working good.</li>
            <li>We have had these before and loved them.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>so i bought this one for a really good promotional price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>you feel good</li>
            <li>Massages gums and does a good job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>When I found this one I wondered if it would be as good.  </li>
            <li>When I went to my dentist for my checkups, he told me, &amp;#34;you have good hygiene&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>You can get a good deal on replacement brush heads at Costco.</li>
            <li>HX5610/30 Essence 5600 is a superior way to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>A good product, we have been using them for years,</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li>It also has a fairly durable carrying bag for travel!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I loved it then because of how well it cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>and I loved that I saved an additional $10 on coupon/deal offered.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing as good of a job.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>So that is good.</li>
            <li>Also good buy</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>.. Holds charge good..</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Good power, speeds up toothbrushing time.</li>
            <li>So I think it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Frighteningly good.</li>
            <li>Wife loved the one I bought for her</li>
            <li>Mine lasted a good 6 years.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>, if mom loves it, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>good seller</li>
            <li>I had thought I had a good toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is a good choice.</li>
            <li>And think quite good value.  </li>
            <li>Everyone loved them.</li>
            <li>I guess it was just good timing.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for one week, good but need a power converter for 220v.</li>
            <li>I loved the price as well.</li>
            <li>I think it works just as good as the 200+ one.</li>
            <li>replacement,&lt;br /&gt;good toothbrush, does the job, good price, comes with case and charger</li>
            <li>This is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels good when I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li>It has proven to be a good investment.</li>
            <li>and I loved it forever.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift, is good product for the price point.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>it is so good ,i like it ,I like it</li>

            <li>It works well and is good quality.</li>
            <li>but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>this sonicare good?  </li>
            <li>I had an Oral B electric brush before, and I thought it was a good brush, and must be just as good as these Sonicare brushes, but now I know that I was just kidding myself.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>price with good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it for my mom and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>I have had good dental check-ups since using Sonicare, which I started about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good dental report from your dental hygienist buy this brush.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO ANYONE THAT WANTED A GOOD TOOTH BRUSH WITH A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li>because you can&#x27;t glob it on, this is a good thing, trust me) and go to town, when you&#x27;re done - it beeps and turns off.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, all good.</li>
            <li>and I was thanked about a hundred times because they just loved it.</li>
            <li>I got a good price on this from Amazon</li>
            <li>A good purchase.</li>
            <li>I have one and just sent another to a good friend, who is also delighted.  </li>
            <li>If  you have used one then you know how good it is.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>I have a good sense of humor.</li>
            <li>Have used it for over six months and the brush head is still good.</li>
            <li>It works great on my teeth and the travel case will be handy on trips.</li>
            <li>Ya this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if it was good or not</li>
            <li>Always loved sonicare...</li>
            <li>Good price...great shipping</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist, and for good reasons.</li>

            <li>works good</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job</li>
            <li>A good choice for the price.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare makes a good product, just not this one.</li>
            <li>Good buy and good product.</li>
            <li>As advertised good product cleans my teeth well but does not have the beep function.</li>
            <li>but it was on a really good deal and Phillips Sonicare is a recommended brand by my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I really loved that toothbrush, but my wife convinced me to switch to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for your gums.</li>
            <li>to find a good electric toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;M.J.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is good</li>
            <li>A good choice.</li>
            <li>good regharging capacity and good speed.</li>
            <li>In the end I would give it a good rating.  </li>
            <li>it is a fair product for this price.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this was a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Perfect clean feeling, however the toothpaste and saliva tend to cake about the power button where the brush-head attaches.</li>
            <li>and I especially love the clean feeling I get after using it.</li>
            <li>The spinning of the toothbrush head is perfect to effectively clean your teeth and remove anything.</li>

            <li>so I could easily return if/when it broke!!</li>
            <li>but i didnt charge it for 14 days and it was still going strong!!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is beautifully and elegantly designed.  </li>
            <li>the best of any brush I have ever had, and the price is not bad at all.  </li>

            <li>Hope that all works out well, as I also want to be able to just go brush my teeth without a bunch of things that I have to listen to or watch out for, like the type of toothpaste to use so that the plastic doesn&#x27;t crack!  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love my toothbrush now like I never have!</li>
            <li>The 2 minute brush timer is also perfect to make sure you clean for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li>These sonic brushes clean your teeth wonderfully while keeping your gums healthy and preventing gum damage by brushing.</li>
            <li>very good product as good as the higher priced one</li>
            <li>Great for gum health; the 2 minute timer encourages you to brush for the full amount of time - no cheating here!</li>
            <li>Great tool to make sure your teeth are in great shape and clean.</li>
            <li>Works great but not as easy to find replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>It buzzes in your mouth quite strongly and seems to get the job done great.  </li>
            <li>This device makes teeth cleaning easy and does a great job (just talk to my dental hygienist).  </li>
            <li>The number of cavities greatly diminished when I started using this brush, my teeth feel clean and nice and the hygienist always tells me I have good home</li>
            <li>Works great and is perfectly easy to use.</li>
            <li>I will never use another kind unless they make this one even better!  </li>
            <li>We just needed an easy to pack toothbrush for our trips and this one fit the bill perfectly for us.</li>
            <li>The gum massage is very important to assure good gums after periodontal surgery.</li>
            <li>Great product, packaged well, and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this toothbrush, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>The power of the Sonicare toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>The charge is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Essence turned out to be a great fit.</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel amazing.</li>
            <li>and this this is amazing</li>
            <li>Cleans the teeth well for a great price, cheap and plentiful replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Simply Amazing.  </li>
            <li>I opted for this one because of the price, its amazing</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works amazing</li>
            <li>There was a free extended warranty for registering on-line, so this was a great deal.</li>
            <li>battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>Changed from a cheap battery operated toothbrush and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>the price here on amazon is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush without all the bells and whistles, just one that did a great job and was comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Amazing toothbrush, and you can&#x27;t argue with the price.</li>
            <li>These sonicare toothbrush are great with their vibration but the brush head are really cheap.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I credit this brush with that amazing feat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing to me the difference between the two, and that&#x27;s why I wanted to share my story and give a review on this.</li>
            <li>The brush would not spin well on its own.</li>
            <li>and it operates effectively.</li>
            <li>Awesome ultrasonic tooth hygiene at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Nice travel case .easy</li>
            <li>Nice slim profile not cluttering the counter.  </li>
            <li>so use your own judgment.</li>
            <li>Even my dental exams are awesome thanks to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is kind of the bottom of the line toothbrush for Philips sonicare</li>
            <li>(The kind that just rotates is circles.)  </li>
            <li>his teeth are much brighter and he says it&#x27;s the best gift I ever gave him!</li>
            <li>The manual brush really isn&#x27;t as effective though, so I bought the Sonicare unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof which is nice</li>
            <li>Nice item, works well and holds a charge</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re using this kind of toothbrush, it requires yet another technique.  </li>
            <li>This brush cleans your teeth just a effectively.</li>
            <li>I liked the featured on the Oral B that buzzed every 30 seconds to let you know when to change quadrants when brushing and</li>
            <li>Carrying case is handy.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have the quadrant timer that pulses every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Everything is nice with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li>We love it and get good check ups since we have been using it.</li>
            <li>and I liked that.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and the carrying case is a perfect size for packing and taking on trips.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>As advertised, fast shipping, VERY pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li>This works really nicely,  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say, it almost doesn&#x27;t even hurt anymore...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The brand stands on its own.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, I charged the device for 12 hours to make sure it had a good charge.</li>
            <li>It is nice</li>
            <li>Kind of Ok&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li>Since we have started using it we have experienced a much cleaner feel and have been receiving great comments from out dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- case is nice to keep everything together&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles and this was the best option for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>though - everything seem is included, but it came in a brown cardboard box instead of the nice packaging in the stores.  </li>
            <li>My husband can travel for a wk w/o taking the charger which is nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the Awesome Price Amazon!</li>
            <li>has it all, and the travel case is nice.</li>
            <li>It was a nice feature to have.</li>
            <li>Gums get a nice workout too.</li>
            <li>I have avoided paying the money for a Sonicare toothbrush, because I thought my re-chargeable Oral B with the spinning head on it had to be just as effective.  </li>
            <li>but it was really nice to know that you had evenly covered brushing all of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I can figure that out on my own....</li>
            <li>It is effective and convenient for use.</li>
            <li>Travel case is nice to have.</li>
            <li>I move around a lot so its nice to have.</li>
            <li>It keeps me honest.</li>
            <li>, Looks nice.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a way to not have water  leak into bottom of brush from where it meets the removable brush head.</li>
            <li>Came with a nice travel case.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s effectively on the cleanness and freshness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Kind of reluctant for use</li>
            <li>Nice to get away from batteries.</li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer is nice, because I don&#x27;t have too be conscience of brushing time.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does the job and comes with a handy travel case.</li>
            <li>Effective for cleaning.</li>
            <li>and I liked the idea of the travel case that it came with.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t just an electric toothbrush, it&#x27;s in a league of its own.  </li>
            <li>Everyone should own AND use an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It did not come in a nice box like at the store, though.</li>
            <li>NICE HANDLING ALSO</li>
            <li>Just loving it.</li>
            <li>We have used our own Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable electric battery is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It honestly feels like a massage for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>A family can buy one unit and each use his or her own brush head, but we like the convenience of having our own separate units so we don&#x27;t have to keep changing heads.</li>
            <li>I sometimes, ok most of the time, I wait longer than I should to visit the dentist but still have great check-ups.</li>
            <li>i really love this tooth brush and the price was good</li>
            <li>If you are looking to get a nice electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li>good job for the money ended up getting deal and coupon love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>this may be a nice christmas gift as well.</li>
            <li>I take mine apart every time I use it and rinse both parts with warm water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a morning person &amp; it kind of takes me by surprise ~</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too noob for this kind of power</li>
            <li>so loving it.and will recommand to friends.&lt;br /&gt;feeling</li>
            <li>and I liked.  </li>
            <li>WE love our Sonicare toothbrushes and ordered this one thru Amazon as the price was good.  </li>
            <li>The carry case is nice if you are vacation or our for a night or two.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t own anything else.</li>
            <li>The 30-second timer is a nice feature</li>
            <li>is a handy addition.  </li>
            <li>Nice price and works well.</li>
            <li>It is a nice weight and cleans well.</li>
            <li>The dentist insisted that I use this and it has resulted in better check ups and good plaque control.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and in perfect working order</li>
            <li>This model automatically shuts off after two minutes of use, which is nice; however, I wish it beeped every 30 seconds or so to let you know when to switch quadrants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WHat kind of Product it is ???</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift and the receiver was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I used (and really liked)</li>
            <li>well I had many Philips products and this is good also.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The 2 minute times that pauses every 30 seconds is handy.</li>
            <li>Brushes very well and battery is great!</li>
            <li>It is a great workout for your gums as well as the best overall tooth cleaner.</li>
            <li>I like that it has its own bag to store to keep it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into this kind of oral dental care this brush can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>It could be better than or as good as the Braun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a store bought battery operated toothbrush for some time, the $10 kind .</li>
            <li>It tends to ooze some kind of gooey substance when not in use.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m loving the Sonicare tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>This is just my honest opinion, no games, no gimmicks, no tricks.</li>
            <li>I will always own and use a sonicare toothbrush .&lt;br /&gt;telmail</li>
            <li>This was a very affordable electric toothbrush and the price was excellent compared to brick and mortar pricing.  </li>
            <li>Nice ability to split apart for travel, which I have used twice.  </li>
            <li>Got this one for my boyfriend &amp; I already have one of my own.  </li>
            <li>it was a nice feature.</li>
            <li>It has excellent battery life and cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li>but I still am enjoying it and feel that it is good value for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>and so I wanted her to make sure she took good care of her teeth.</li>
            <li>This one is probably superior to most.</li>
            <li>The case is a nice added touch.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price, but prefer a more deluxe model</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice travel pack too.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, works perfect!!</li>
            <li>Stores nicely in its dock.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and an excellent value for a reliable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and it is just as good:)</li>
            <li>This model does not do this, it does not stop on its own when the 2min are up either.</li>
            <li>Nice grip.</li>
            <li>and a nice guy told me how to bypass that 14-day slow-vibration situation.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are feeling very clean!</li>
            <li>she tells me I am doing something right, because my gums and teeth are healthy and  look great!!</li>
            <li>Great price and very powerful</li>
            <li>This was the best price i found on this, after much research--It works great, and is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>It clean my teeth so good and my checks ups come out so good and not a problem at all.</li>
            <li>The best way to clean teeth and save huge amounts of money at the dentist.........easy to use, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without a Sonicare................</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my original, and for the price it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great replacement for my original Sonicare</li>
            <li>Had the original model Sonicare for about 10 years and it always did a great job.  </li>
            <li>happy with the original</li>
            <li>Great price, great item, highly suggest.</li>

            <li>My new best friend!  </li>
            <li>Works great, no problems so far, great product.  </li>

            <li>Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>good instructions, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>awesome ... clean ... sparkly .. smooth feeling in my mouth these days - but the vibration takes some getting used to ... :)</li>
            <li>The power of this sonicare HX5610/30  is great, I feel it really does a good job.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it makes the teeth and gums feel good.</li>
            <li>Works great, charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I chose this product for her -- she really does love it.</li>
            <li>Great Price, product and quick shipping</li>
            <li>Very easy to use - I like the travel case.  </li>
            <li>Buying the heads r also very easy.</li>
            <li>The vibration is very strong and takes a couple of days to get used to.</li>
            <li>The plug in charge lasts for days and is still very strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very Easy to setup and learn to use.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to handle</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get the plaque between the teeth and gums very easily at all.</li>
            <li>That packaging was a pleasure, and recycled very easily.  </li>
            <li>If he&#x27;s pleased, I&#x27;m pleased!  </li>
            <li>Love this Sonicare, use it twice a day and a much better price than in the store!</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace it and love it more!</li>
            <li>Loved it so much ordered 4 more for everyone else in my family!!</li>
            <li>it is probably fine and even a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good, fine, neato and well done.</li>
            <li>This one was more than adequate: fit our needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit noisy and the vibration on my top teeth and gums took a bit of getting used to, but my teeth are incredibly clean, great value</li>
            <li>love how these toothbrushes make my teeth and gums clean, and I have been getting great reports from the dentist ever since I switched to them.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants to combat plaque and dental disease with a very good cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>so I think the newer ones are therefore more effective.</li>
            <li>Many people complain and rate it four stars because it does not beep after 30 seconds or have some kind of quarter minute timer.</li>
            <li>However, that is okay with us when it produces these kind of results.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product, well worth the money for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought this model after retiring a more deluxe version of a Sonicare toothbrush that I had been using for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>So far they work great!!</li>
            <li>I fell in love and HAD to get my own.</li>
            <li>but not as nice as the better model(s)</li>
            <li>The price here at Amazon is by far the best price I could find -- even with a 20% off coupon for Bed, Bath and Beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far it works great!!</li>
            <li>far as function, it works great!</li>
            <li>I can brush my teeth much more effectively and efficiently with this brush.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is an excellent replacement for the old Sonicare with the dying battery.</li>
            <li>Nice brush better than Braun.</li>
            <li>travel kit was a nice touch that I enjoyed using whenever I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>may find it suitable to their oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>This is a soft rotation which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Replaced my old one, its not as deluxe but does a good job, I am happy.</li>
            <li>Amazon by far made the best prices.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get caught up in the trendy BS just to spend more money.</li>
            <li>I have the newer style sonicare and love the way my teeth feel when I get done brushing, so he asked me if I liked it and</li>
            <li>IT  IS GREAT WITH THE BUILT IN TIMER AND RARELY NEEDS TO BE CHARGED.</li>
            <li>I spend more time brushing of my own choice.</li>
            <li>just read the instructions for most effective use.  </li>
            <li>Her grandfather has also been using his Sonicare for over 10 years with great success.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is so far awesome!  </li>
            <li>says its the best one he has had so far</li>
            <li>Most amazing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>feels great when I brush, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it had more power.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush might be great for a lot of people, but it wasn&#x27;t the right toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great toothbrush the price is right and replacement brushes are affordable.</li>
            <li>It is great for children as well as adults and the price is right on</li>
            <li>Works great and the price is right.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to travel with...with no charger!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate (even though it still tickles!)</li>
            <li>It topples over too easily!  </li>
            <li>and it was delivered very quickly!</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel very clean after using and the two minute timer is a nice perk.</li>
            <li>This is as good as the original product I replaced with the newer model.</li>
            <li>Good quality, simple to handle and very good cleaning results.</li>
            <li>My teeth now look and feel clean, and my gums feel good.</li>
            <li>It is a good product that helps you keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>This is a good price &amp; makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>&amp; I feel that it does do a good job in keeping me teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush with great action.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy that my dentist is an honest person who will recommend solutions to me not based on personal gain, but on quality.</li>
            <li>great price and is just as good as my old one</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended and although I was using another brand electric this is really good and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth and gums feel good and clean..  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush is good size, brushes well and leaves mouth and teeth feeling clean like coming from dentist office.</li>
            <li>A Q-tip is a good way to reach inside to clean it if needed.</li>
            <li>My son has been asking me for ages to purchase this for him, and so far so good, it has been working great</li>
            <li>Works great and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it turns off automatically after two minutes of brushing, telling you the optimal time for a good clean.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush makes ya feel clean</li>
            <li>It is a good product that helps you keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>, quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I lost my original one on vacation and could not wait to get a replacement !!!</li>
            <li>, I purchased this one for a very reasonable price and the quality is great.  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush arrived very fast and it is great.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li>Glad I started with this one instead of the more pricier one that I own and love.</li>
            <li>However, this is not the first time he&#x27;s requested the toothbrush, so I assume he&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li>so  have to return the product and try to search for a more suitable one.</li>
            <li>and once you get through the tingling of the first uses it great</li>
            <li>I bought my first one 20 years ago when they were 100.00 bucks so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Works great, as advertised....just be aware that this does not come in retail packaging.......</li>
            <li>Also very satisfied with ease of shopping at Amazon and the accurate delivery information provided by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>There are no frills, but does exactly what is needed &amp; at a great price point.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that cleans so well, my dentist even sells this product though at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>Son is getting married so it made a great gift for his fiance.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush worked great when first received.</li>
            <li>Great the first month</li>
            <li>whenever this toothbrush is no longer suitable I&#x27;ll replace it with another toothbrush I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Its my first experience with an electric toothbrush and although this one is great I&#x27;m looking to upgrade</li>
            <li>it sounds/feels like a wood sander in your mouth (not painful, but surprising).</li>
            <li>and I got a new one of these, a very good electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean and it is so easy to use!!</li>
            <li>It works fine....!</li>
            <li>Works just fine, cleans my teeth well, and I just have to keep track of the time myself!</li>
            <li>but product was fine!</li>
            <li>The brush is very accurate....</li>
            <li>Very smooth and polished.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty good for a sonicare, and the power is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The heads are easy to find everywhere, and the charger is amazing - no plugs</li>
            <li>Nice travel case and easy to take apart for travel.</li>
            <li>you have not used this before, you should notice an exceptional squeaky clean every time after using this.</li>
            <li>Cleans good and charges quick.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush came in good condition, as mentioned, and quickly.</li>
            <li>, luckily I have good teeth or my dentist would have been mortified.</li>
            <li>This brush works nicely, and is easy to charge and use, but the brush head is already falling apart, separating into two pieces.</li>
            <li>First time you use it you feel the difference very nice.</li>
            <li>With Prime, I got free shipping, so that made the price even better!</li>
            <li>Has a good hand fit and easy to pack travel pack.</li>
            <li>I got a great price (including a $10.00 discount by ordering the Monday after Christmas) and quick free delivery.</li>
            <li>very good upgrade from my old battery-operated model</li>
            <li>I am a rapid tarter producer and this has made a huge difference in my cleaning appointments!</li>
            <li>Awesome in every way, only hassle is cleaning</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not big on brushing, a habbit reinforced by my awesome genetics where i can basically do nothing and have no tooth issues at all.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush will  help give you the discipline (that most of us do not have) to do a thorough brushing (set to an automatic 2 minute duration) twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has proven it heals and keeps the gums healthy and keeps the cavities away.</li>
            <li>Took some getting used to, and now love the job it does.</li>
            <li>keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>However, did not expect how much better the cleaning was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had another electric toothbrush for years, and this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>In addition it has a two minute timer which helps in making sure</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The detachable toothbrush head comes with a tightly fitting plastic cover for travel.</li>
            <li>However, I’ve found that steripods work better.</li>
            <li>I like the tapered bristles and the more compact shape.</li>
            <li>and, therefore, covers more teeth as I brush.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare, thank you</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>If you have healthy teeth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a better toothbrush on the market for cleaning</li>
            <li>It works soo much better.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying a fresher brush with each use.</li>
            <li>My gums love the thing too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping works great</li>
            <li>But this is ok</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li>LOVE SONCICARE</li>
            <li>Have used this brand for many years with no complaints.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dentist and does a much better job than Oral B.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so pleased that I&#x27;ve bought one for each member of my family.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I have been using the sensodyne for many years.</li>
            <li>Over all I a more than satisfied with the product and could recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare e-Series toothbrushes, but they have a flaw for anyone who likes brushing their teeth in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Sure, this is mostly my fault and another consequence of my tragically dysfunctional relationship with gravity, but I do wish their interior moisture resistance was a bit more robust.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>works great - always ready to use.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a timer.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I used it 2Xs a day, most days and it lasted about a month before I had to rechare it.  </li>
            <li>I got mine on sale for $25 love it.</li>
            <li>Also, this latest Essence model does not have Quadpacer.</li>
            <li>They love sunbathing in them  and look so warm and comfortable.</li>
            <li>So much better than my OralB tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Pleased</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Had an oral B this one is better.</li>
            <li>Fully satisfied with the performance, I use it for 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>Hope that it holds up better than he two sonicare products purchased a number of years ago....</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums, but cleans better than all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>This is an interesting toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>had one many years ago, bought this one for my sister, and another one for me.</li>
            <li>After digesting 7-8 models, their features, prices, etc, I decided this cheaper unit would surely do the job.</li>
            <li>Now if I want to repurchase it I have to pay more for it.</li>
            <li>This one was much cheaper and still works great.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it shuts off after 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li>Have used Sonicare toothbrushes for many, MANY years.</li>
            <li>:) I love them.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li>I always brush longer than needed because I love how Sonicare makes my mouth feel, so don&#x27;t need timers, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the portability and ease of use.</li>
            <li>Compared with store price much better.</li>
            <li>Love idea of warrenty as have had</li>
            <li>My hygienist recommended getting a Sonicare, but they are much more costly than manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I LOVE the way this one works.  </li>
            <li>This brush works so much better</li>

            <li>/&gt;Fresh great product would recommend it over and over and over again thanks</li>
            <li>i love the travel case.</li>
            <li>We love that they came with the travel case too.</li>
            <li>Must be a better way to make it waterproof</li>
            <li>I read the reviews prior to purchasing and was very impressed with the honesty.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand toothbrush for many years, replacing it about every 3 years.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Works much better than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I love sonicare products and I bought this for a backup because everyone in my family uses one, and none of us want to be without one.  </li>
            <li>I was more reluctant to spend money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like at all, so I got this &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works better then</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone! :)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t brush your tongue with the thing on, it will sling toothpaste all over you AND the sink/mirror/wall, etc :)</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with this way of taking care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>In just a month or so, the dental assistant cleaning my teeth said they looked much better.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>After a week of using it my gums felt better, and are visibly healthier.</li>
            <li>Okay have I satisfied the word requirement...</li>
            <li>This was to replace another electric toothbrush that stopped working after many years.</li>

            <li>Love the price.</li>
            <li>WRAP - Like most Sonicare models, this one has one at the bottom of the charger to store any excess cord.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>WRAP - Like most Sonicare models, this one has one at the bottom of the charger to store any excess cord.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>I love that the 2 minutes shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid more for one with</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t quite make to &amp;#34;I love It.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This works better than Sonicare&#x27;s newer model.  </li>
            <li>This is a genuine Sonicare toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>keeps your teeth feeling fresher than ever :)</li>
            <li>I chose this toothbrush because I&#x27;ve been using it for approx 3 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Elite and Essence toothbrushes for years and love them.</li>
            <li>sure why they bother with a travel case</li>
            <li>Yes I do have better check ups.</li>
            <li>This is my second sonic are, and they are awesome.  </li>
            <li>It is way better than Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li>Great product,cleans teeth really well,Good recharging platform.</li>
            <li>works great, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The person who actually uses it is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>And I love the color.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Better than oral b automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But, I love how they work.</li>
            <li>I like the sonic vibe style way more than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love the travel case.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I also find that I save more water since I shut it off while im brushing which is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It is heavier, has more battery storage, and vibrates with more power than Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it works better as a cleaning device.</li>
            <li>I love using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare hasn&#x27;t caused any sores or soreness from brushing top of the molars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but it doesn&#x27;t have the timer that pauses at 30-second intervals to let you know that you&#x27;re done with each quadrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also incompatible with the charger for the better model.</li>
            <li>been using the Sonicare for years and my teeth love it.  </li>
            <li>The device is very noisy but provides a great cleaning to all teeth.</li>
            <li>charger, while it works phenomenally at home, does not travel well.</li>
            <li>, also make sure toothbrush is in mouth.when</li>
            <li>The oscillations work to vibrate water molecules in your mouth that work between your teeth and gums to remove food, plaque and tartar many times better than a manual brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gums were perfectly healthy too.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t replace flossing though, so make sure to floss before brushing (as recommended by my dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been having dental problems, have implants or appliances, or want to take better care of your teeth, get one of these.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been having dental problems, have implants or appliances, or want to take better care of your teeth, get one of these.</li>
            <li>but that is OK.</li>
            <li>good, i like it.it is worth to buy.</li>
            <li>What can I say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Sonicare&amp;#34;  could not have gotten a better price than</li>
            <li>works better than my dentist said</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The head is comfortable, and the way it vibrates seems effective for cleaning.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Overall, great product for the price!</li>
            <li>Anyway, the cycle  keeps getting shorter (most of the time) and has to be restarted.  </li>
            <li>I love it more every day</li>
            <li>I am a retired dentist, and have been using this brush for many years....</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for something that cleans a lot better than a manual toothbrush, get one of the more pricier models.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I found that I love it.</li>
            <li>While I question the efficacy of cleaning your teeth with what seems to be nothing more than a vibrator, my immediate frustration is from a support standpoint.</li>
            <li>I would like it better if it had adjustable speed settings.</li>
            <li>I seem to be able to reach all areas well.  </li>
            <li>I love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li>Does not have 2 speed settings or the 30 second interval timer, but if you don&#x27;t want or need those features, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I have purchased three more units, two for myself and one for my son, none lasted for more than one year.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find myself wishing that it did anything more than it does.</li>
            <li>It requires more maintenance since you have to unscrew it and drain the water out after each use.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of changes I would love to see, however.</li>
            <li>Excellent- a traditional toothbrush can&#x27;t get under my braces.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>I just love this sonicare electric touthbrush.</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleans my teeth</li>
            <li>so it is great for vacation, and it really cleans</li>
            <li>I bought my daughter and my husband one, and they love it</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who likes having healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for many years; I ordered replacement brushes for it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Much better than an oral-B.</li>
            <li>Love my purchase.</li>
            <li>Great quality, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>For 40 dollars you can&#x27;t find a better tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Better than others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they included a travel case, but this model does not have the LED power indicator.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace one we&#x27;d had for many years, and still worked, but was falling apart.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I love the travel pack this toothbrush comes with.</li>
            <li>I love this pr</li>
            <li>I would gladly exchange it for one that has that feature.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush...doesn&#x27;t have the quadpacer feature</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t really necessary to get the job done and the price is great!  </li>
            <li>Well done Amazon :).</li>
            <li>I swear by them because they took me from the brink of periodontal disease to healthy gums...</li>
            <li>we love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Now if I would just use it more often.</li>
            <li>and I saw that it was a better deal buy it on amazon.</li>
            <li>But this Philips Sonicare Essence 5600 Rechargeable is even better.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the latte seems to work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love the sonic</li>
            <li>Glad we bought it.</li>
            <li>But that is probably my fault for not checking more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I love the timing feature that keeps me on track with brushing time</li>
            <li>Pay $20-30 for a better one.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li>I love using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>, I really do love it.  </li>
            <li>So much more affordable, then the retail stores</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy two more for the family.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love the Philips Sonicare products and this one did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>sincerely wish you try this item for yourself.  </li>
            <li>or I would say much better</li>
            <li>I only use Sonic toothbrush and am very happy with it</li>
            <li>Great product at reasonable price</li>
            <li>Teeth feels smooth like when you return from your dentist!</li>
            <li>I needed to detach the top, rinse out the compartment after each brushing.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Even the price has gotten more affordable nowadays.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>love this tootbrush.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare continues to provide me with healthy teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;First time to use electric toothbrush, it is much better than manual one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this item after a coworker suggested it.</li>
            <li>This was a great price for the whole package.  </li>
            <li>yep, i love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>As I was to begin a five week trip, I decided to leave the brush home and take my more dependable electric toothbrush....from a rival company.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After verbally praising this product in my household, my brothers and mother have all purchased one and are equally satisfied.</li>
            <li>the front teeth on top...</li>
            <li>I love the product,</li>
            <li>Brush size was okay for her</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>After buying one, I had to get two more for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li>The carrying pouch makes it even more convenient.</li>
            <li>It is still way better for cleaning than a manual brush and even way better than the oral-B version, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>After a couple years I decided I don&#x27;t like the taste of the brown-gray goo, and it probably isn&#x27;t safe to eat while brushing.  </li>
            <li>I still rate it 5 stars because it is much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It motivate me to brush more often</li>
            <li>cleans way better than you would if you were manually brushing.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have an outlet in an appropriate place though.</li>
            <li>I really like toothbrush, it does a great job.</li>
            <li>been using for about a month seams to be cleaning my teeth better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it thanks for selling</li>
            <li>After having about 5 battery operated toothbrushes around, I finally found my perfect rush.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Really works great.</li>
            <li>Expect better Dentist visits.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that so many of my family members did not use electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to get a timer and brush it that way so each quadrant gets an equal time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love them.</li>
            <li>Feels so much better cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>This upgrade is even better.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with all os</li>
            <li>So let&#x27;s see if this makes it any better after six months.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, OK.  </li>
            <li>It takes getting used to the tingling of the cleaning, but hopefully will be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it and it was dirt cheap $39!</li>
            <li>I had one of these for years and it had seen its better days.</li>
            <li>and I love the two minute timer.  </li>
            <li>She was impressed with the low level of tartar and plaque, and you know what that means....</li>
            <li>Would love that.</li>
            <li>Have used Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 minute timer to make sure you brush for the correct dentist recommended length of time.  </li>
            <li>They LOVE them.</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>time and charge much more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been very reliable and provided great dental hygiene over the decade</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I specially love how it had a 2 minutes timer.</li>

            <li>this one is doing a great job of cleaning my teeth very well...fits my needs.</li>
            <li>Love the travel case</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to replace an identical unit I had had for many years when the non-replaceable battery died.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Sonicare ... what more to say?  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This on is lighter and more compact</li>
            <li>so I was sure to give each section of my mouth 30 seconds of brushing.  </li>
            <li>better than the Philip I used before</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I switched.  </li>
            <li>Only difference is no quad-pacer but otherwise is perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li>so why pay more.</li>
            <li>Came better than described.</li>
            <li>Got as a Christmas gift but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a plug in or cordless</li>
            <li>feel a lot cleaner too:)</li>
            <li>She loves it as much as I love mine.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and delivered so rapidly and safely.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing more to tell you about the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>so I only expect the best.</li>
            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>I also noticed some of the newer heads vibrate more and massage the gums.  </li>
            <li>After using this for several months, I went to my dentist for my teeth cleaning and he commented on the excellent condition of my teeth (without knowing of my switch to an electronic toothbrush).  </li>
            <li>I had no idea that this newer design would be so much more mouth-friendly.  </li>
            <li>I love this one too.  </li>
            <li>It also pounds mouthwash, peroxide, coconut oil or whatever exotic treatments</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I Will buy more.</li>
            <li>I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and it was ok...</li>
            <li>Move this toothbrush and glad I converted to Sonicare</li>
            <li>I love it, and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and I like the upgrade much better..</li>
            <li>Way, way better than battery operated drug store toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>And would want to continue enjoying it and maybe even buy another set for my family.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I received this item as a Christmas Gift and it was just what I needed to encourage me to brush my teeth:)</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for many days; it shuts itself off after 2 minutes to make sure the brusher uses it an appropriate length of time.  </li>
            <li>How many times have you heard a teenager say, &amp;#34;look at my teeth, they look and feel great!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>, I love it, my dentist can not stop complementing my teeth....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>, I was glad that I did buy this bursh</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job then the Braun.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Teeth look better with two or three uses.  </li>

            <li>Such a great buy!</li>
            <li>However, this Sonicare was defective and would not tighten when attempting to connect the top and bottom of the toothbrush.  </li>

            <li>I love this tooth brush and have purchased for all my family.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Glad I took a shot</li>
            <li>Since I started using it, more than 10 years ago, all my dentist has to do is the twice a year cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I have dental issues and wanted a better electric toothbrush than what I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Also love the timer.  </li>
            <li>winning combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I wondered if I would be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>I will surely buy some more for my husband and daughter.</li>
            <li>I really do think these are great tooth brushes and the price</li>
            <li>I love using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago it was recommened to me</li>
            <li>It has saved my teeth from more dentist vists.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They actually enjoy brushing their teeth now!</li>
            <li>It must be ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I think it doesn&#x27;t do a better job than my manual toothbrush of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with these until somebody can convince me that there is a better product out there.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Can you believe I was able to get the dentist to see me on a Sunday night???&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If they could fix the design issue I would love it</li>
            <li>Amazon is attempting to fix the problem, but in the meantime make sure you get what your ordered and paid for.  </li>
            <li>For the money, you can not do better than this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I started to love this but about 6 weeks</li>
            <li>ask for a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth a lot more because of this</li>
            <li>My husband and I bought 2 and love them.</li>
            <li>I also love that it goes for 2 minutes then shuts itself off</li>
            <li>Make sure this is what you are intending to order.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this unit.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>

            <li>We have two of these and love them.  </li>
            <li>Even though the $3 model doesn&#x27;t work as well it would still be better for my health.</li>

            <li>Love it.  </li>

            <li>a week after having it, it felt perfectly normal to use and works great.</li>
            <li>So happy to have an electric toothbrush back,  I would recommend this sonicare for sure!</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush over all for thoughts on a budget or first time user.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought one a long time ago - I had no idea they were so great!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a pretty good battery.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I know how long I need to brush for and it is doing all the work for perfect strokes.</li>
            <li>but as a first time user this is good.</li>
            <li>Looks like PRETTY GOOD quality.  </li>
            <li>I have 2 of these in my house already and this one is a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>Loved it at first then the battery died within 2 months.</li>
            <li>Good price and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I invested in this toothbrush because it works just fine and removes more plack at a faster pace than my battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I do like that you can brush for the full two minutes because then you are getting a good clean</li>
            <li>It has the timer on it for one thing, so he brushes for a full two minutes, but it is also just a superior clean with this brush.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it and the company was very good about allowing me to send it back.  </li>
            <li>and I am so happy with my new one.</li>

            <li>i will purchase this item again nice price too and quick delivery</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a great job cleaning my teeth and gums, but feels much more gentle yet leaves my mouth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and the easy and convenient travel package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and alleviated some of my carpal tunnel issues.</li>

            <li>It looks well made and works perfectly, it cleans teeth really well and much faster hand brush.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>I love the clean this provides, however the vibration is overwhelming some times.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works great, Would recomend it to anyone who wants to have perfectly clean teeth.</li>
            <li>One thing I love it is the fact that after I was done brushing, it feels after-a-dentist-cleaning clean :)</li>
            <li>He loves it and states he could never make his teeth feel do smooth and clean on his own.</li>
            <li>I think Oral-B&#x27;s give you a better clean, but sonicare&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>Overall this was a  very good value.</li>
            <li>Very good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with debilitating Depression for the last year and have not taken very good care of myself as a result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, just wish it h ad the 30 second timer for each side of my teeth....</li>
            <li>I have consistently been impressed with the quality and reliability of Sonicare, so making the decision to purchase a new one was easy.  </li>
            <li>Clean, easy to place and waterproof!</li>
            <li>I was worried at first with not getting one of the most current ones, but this toothbrush was cost effective and is very good.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s amazing how fresh my mouth and teeth feels after using.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare and I am very pleased with it as is my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my old one with this and the price was great.</li>
            <li>Just replaced my old Phillips with this one and it&#x27;s great, everything i wanted in a electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job cleaning and my gums feel better too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product so far</li>
            <li>We are glad these are still available-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note that replacement head will be needed every ninety days to make the most of the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>I noticed the light kept blinking and wasn&#x27;t sure why as I had it plugged in.</li>
            <li>So far, this one works great and is holding its charge.</li>
            <li>He uses it frequently and is happy to be improving his oral hygiene by using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(Google &amp;#34;fake reviews&amp;#34; and notice how many reviews for this product fit the bill.)  </li>
            <li>Sure wish they had been available 50 years ago.</li>
            <li>Cannot imagine that the higher priced ones are any more effective.</li>
            <li>So far, this toothbrush is working great.  </li>
            <li>Surely cleans well: leaves teeth and gums feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Great packaging, complete with an anti-theft strip.</li>
            <li>So far Its working out great.  </li>
            <li>great replacement for a 10 year old sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>My old one died and this was a great price</li>
            <li>Liked the first one and am enjoying this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure she will enjoy using it as I have been.</li>
            <li>the old one did - otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It really does help get teeth cleaner, and the price on Amazon was a good price.</li>
            <li>It really is that good.</li>
            <li>Good price, no unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fast delivery and good value.</li>
            <li>The price is good and it works very well.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a good job and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>So thanks Philips for the good teeth I have</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work and thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I got the &amp;#34;easy packaging&amp;#34; which was nice, and the travel bag was useful.</li>
            <li>and this is a good price for a very efficient model.</li>
            <li>I guess it is good for what you pay, if I strictly talk about the brush functions, it works really well</li>
            <li>So while this may be a good toothbrush I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Ellite.</li>
            <li>good product fast service</li>
            <li>Loved my so much I bought one for each of my kids and my nephews.</li>
            <li>If you have periodontal disease, this toothbrush can really help keep your mouth in good shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many electrical toothbrushes, but the Philips Sonicare is hands down the best you can get for the money.</li>
            <li>The two minute timer is great to make sure you are getting everything super clean, and the ramp up of the amount of vibration through the first 12 times of use made it easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just right said Goldilocks!!</li>
            <li>It certainly does make my teeth feel clean and great on brushing the tongue and palate which is important, too, of course.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would, very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I was using a disposable battery-operated toothbrush, which I loved and which I do still like a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Amazing what this can do with the right toothpaste.</li>
            <li>These do an amazing job and the price is right.</li>
            <li>That said, I do wish the batteries were replaceable, but on one of my units like this they lasted for about 10 years before the batteries gave way and the whole unit had to be replaced, so that&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li>Very happy to have my smooth, clean teeth back.</li>
            <li>I still love this brush, a caveat:  Change the brush head much more often than you&#x27;d think - every 2 months - it works SOOOOO much better with a new brush!!!  </li>
            <li>this is my third one to buy, for myself and two for a cousin, they work great no problem fine!</li>
            <li>Love this - handy but powerful enough to brush teeth great.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality, just need to clean it every time after using.</li>
            <li>It makes me teeth feel very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>the cost is more than what I originally paid for.</li>
            <li>After many years of use, my original P.S. quit on me.</li>
            <li>Yes, just like other ones I have owned, it cleans wonderfully well.</li>
            <li>Product provides the best results of any other product on  the market.......</li>
            <li>We replaced our original Sonic Care of many years duration with this product.  </li>
            <li>We returned the original toothbrush that was defective and Amazon shipped us a new one, which was great.</li>
            <li>new one has been great, it is sleeker and yet more powerful</li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean out</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The included charger is quite convenient as it can be easily tucked away and easy access.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel like I have a clean, healthy, just-left-the-dentist mouth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and waterproof.</li>
            <li>easy to assemble and charge.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>The handle is a bit chunky, but is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge well and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack for trips and charge</li>
            <li>It seems to be easy for travelling too with the travel bag included.</li>
            <li>She loves the darn thing, and I love mine.&lt;br /&gt;Squeaky clean teeth.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have the 20 sec timer like the Elite, but the price is excellent and this feature is not that important.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>and easy to carry on.</li>
            <li>BRUSH IS EASY TO ATTACH TO UNIT.</li>
            <li>well and easy to carry if you are on business trip</li>
            <li>,it was delivered very quickly and packaged to get started quite easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does all the work for you.</li>
            <li>It does come with an easy to use carrying case, but the case doesn&#x27;t carry the charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like it GREAT, next time buy better one.</li>
            <li>The battery won&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; as easily unlike NiCad cells, so it will stay functional longer.</li>
            <li>and I found that it&#x27;s easy to get replacement heads for it.</li>
            <li>It is the most basic sonicare tooth brush, but it&#x27;s reliable and works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Love that teeth feel so clean, Took on a trip</li>

            <li>It may clean even better than the cleaning you get at the dentists office, and it whitens teeth that you didn&#x27;t even realize were stained.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product; it is simply amazing.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully easy to use.  </li>

            <li>I know there are a lot of options out there with more features, but this basic model works great.</li>
            <li>I often went through the two minute brush time twice trying to make sure I got every part of my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this toothbrush, always bought those cheaper $8 ones from the store and this thing is like having the dentist clean your teeth every morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy to accidentally turn it off and think that your 2 minutes are over.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean as visiting the dentist for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Now I know when 2 minutes are up and it easy two use</li>
            <li>so I bought this hoping to increase blood flow and clean better along the gum line.  </li>
            <li>charging station makes it rather easy to recharge, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with batteries.</li>
            <li>and I love the feeling of having all my teeth clean</li>
            <li>The unit is easy to use but you have to turn it off after use for it to charge.</li>
            <li>However, the casing and the charger get &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; very quickly even though I rinse the toothbrush every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Its the most affordable of its kind and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>We had the older model of this Sonic Care toothbrush for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Over a month and the battery is still strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 52 year old man who doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the notion that I need some kind of upgrade in how I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>This thing is electric and strong.</li>
            <li>2-minute timer makes me more conscious about giving my teeth and gums a good brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since then, its made me a strong believer</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as my old Sonicare which lasted more than 5 yrs.</li>
            <li>This is a good replacement for my old Sonicare which quit after many years of family use.  </li>
            <li>Always strong brush if you keep it charged.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare toothbrush gave me many good years of service.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong toothbrush and brushes</li>
            <li>Felt almost too strong.  </li>
            <li>, part of it is genetics, everyone in my family was blessed with strong teeth</li>
            <li>I finally did, and honestly it feels like I have just come from the dentist every time I brush (a good thing).  </li>
            <li>Vibration was too strong.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a while ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Not putting those down but for a little more money I now have an excellent toothbrush &amp; the best part</li>
            <li>He has been very happy with his electric toothbrush at more than half the price!</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning, is very easily used, and had a special feature that made it easier for the sensitive gums to adjust.</li>
            <li>It was highly rated and the reviews were quite good.  </li>
            <li>Good product, I would highly recommend the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>that we liked them very much.  </li>
            <li>Once this product had full charge it had strong brushing ability better than another electric toothbrush I used to have.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in the future I will upgrade to a better model, but I am perfectly satisfied with my Essence to do the job it was purchased to do!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect and not too hard and the wider base/handle suits me as I tend to get a hand cramp from gripping more slender brushes.</li>
            <li>first time using one, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Though the toothbrush contains 2 AA batteries (glued into the unit), the time to a full charge is more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I liked the first one</li>
            <li>Philips will allow you to return the product for a full refund if you are not fully satisfied with your purchase.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>the carrying bag is also pretty nice to have for transport.  </li>
            <li>At first, &amp;#34;yay!&amp;#34;, its a nice step up.  </li>
            <li>The first time was kind of understandable - it fell onto a tile floor.</li>
            <li>so you are more inclined to finish the full two minutes that dentists recommend.</li>
            <li>Charges fast and doesn&#x27;t need charging for many many many uses.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a great job, but you have to almost take it completely apart and clean it after every use.  </li>
            <li>We have not found anything better for leaving your mouth clean and free of bacteria, even when just brushing with water.</li>
            <li>Feels more substantial than the battery-powered version, charges quickly, and the travel bag makes packing easy.</li>
            <li>Really gets my teeth good and clean.</li>
            <li>Everything looks all good and new except I didn&#x27;t receive the case.</li>
            <li>With these new rechargeable toothbrushes my grandsons are good about brushing their teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li>The new one is just as good, and no day is started without using it .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush to try if you are new to Sonicare or electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Works great last without recharging for the week when I&#x27;m gone, cleans well thanks for the coupon right away was great</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works fine and does what it&#x27;s designed to do</li>
            <li>It works fine otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I just changed toothpaste &amp; everything was fine.</li>
            <li>This one is just fine.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and love the rechargeable feature, no more batteries to buy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to handle, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>AND IT SEEMS TO BE IN FINE WORKING ORDER &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>Need to take off the head and do the best you can cleaning up the black mold inside.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth and does a fine job at it.</li>
            <li>It took a while for my teeth and gums to get used to the vibration, but after 3 days I was fine.  </li>
            <li>It says after 3 months, but the head still seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>My first Soniccare lasted over 10 years (the plastic turned yellow but the brush still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine.  </li>
            <li>If it is mentioned on the carton it must be in the fine print.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s fine, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The brush works fine.  </li>
            <li>model is economically priced and functions flawlessly to give you a clean you thought only a trip to the dentist could give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself works fine.</li>
            <li>Has been working fine.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare is made by Phillips and is fine</li>
            <li>Works fine but doesn&#x27;t have the built-in 30-sec split timer.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>The items works fine but does not have circular motion.</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Gets into those nooks and crannies just fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It does not have the 30-sec. alert that it&#x27;s time to change quadrant in your mouth, but I do just fine using my watch for that.  </li>
            <li>Trimmed with scissors and it seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is fine.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine for an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought the exact same model because it served my purposes wonderfully</li>
            <li>The product is fine, the service was fine.  </li>
            <li>Price is just fine.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need it, it is fine.  </li>
            <li>It appears fine.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has continued to produce a fine product.  </li>
            <li>This is the lowest end model, and does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>my toothbrush is totally fine.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was doing a fine job without one.</li>
            <li>brush seems fine.  </li>
            <li>It does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>It was fine</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and for that I was grateful because mine had stopped working!</li>
            <li>But I quickly became accustomed to it, and now love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time to buy an electric toothbrush, very comfortable to use, very clean brush</li>
            <li>The whole family got one of these for Christmas and they love them!</li>
            <li>Ordering on line was easy and delivery very timely !!!</li>
            <li>As long as it&#x27;s the right price, these tooth brushes are awesome.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, and I can feel my teeth are healthier because I made the switch to an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and  mainly because of the good job it does keeping my teeth clean, I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>great cleaning,  easy to use,  stays charged for several days so travels well</li>
            <li>However, the bottom line is that since using the Sonicare my dental hygenist says my plaque buildup is much less and my teeth stay in good condition between cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li>It is not as easy to keep all the groves clean and is not as easy to disassemble for travel.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and sits nicely on its charger so it is ready to use at any time.</li>
            <li>, it fits in tight spaces and does an excellent job!</li>
            <li>But, since I could not find an available HX5810, this one will do just fine.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are very strong and at first they tickled my lips before I got use to it.</li>
            <li>Love at first site, will not be without again, this is one of life&#x27;s nesecities !</li>
            <li>Vibration takes a little to get used to, but your teeth feel great after brushing!  </li>
            <li>This really is an excellent little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush and the brushes themselves seem improved because although my old ones fit this handle, the new brushes seem to vibrate more giving better cleaning power.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this as a replacement, and am doubly happy that it used the same kind of heads as her old brush!  </li>
            <li>Six months of use made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Who honestly uses traditional toothbrushes anymore after this amazing invention?</li>
            <li>A really huge improvement in electric tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference with my gum health.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy enough with the toothbrush, but not these added huge costs.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to buy at a cheap price compared to commercial battery-type brushes in the market.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is a great price for a valuable product that should last years.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Clean easy charging design</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought one for each of my parents and now my brother.  </li>
            <li>This just goes 2 minutes and off, so the brushing is not as precise.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush did not have to charge for 24 hours before using, it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Indicator light seems to be on at all times despite charging for a day (will keep an eye on that)  </li>
            <li>fantastic toothbrush .. .</li>
            <li>enjoy that it turns off after 3 minutes</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t fit well and rattle around.  </li>
            <li>I am vey enjoy to use it</li>
            <li>Used as primary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>The price on this is extremely reasonable, you can keep it as a backup if you upgrade, or pass the handle off to a family member (they can buy their own brush heads).</li>
            <li>It is efficient and light weight.</li>
            <li>Battery/motor unit is sealed  so is easy to rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>Mine, after fully charged according to the light on the charger, didn&#x27;t beep at all.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it just has a blinking light on the on/off switch.</li>
            <li>but nothing I tried could repair the sound.</li>
            <li>My dentist appt should go much smoothly this time.</li>
            <li>HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush works great, is my second Sonicare and can&#x27;t go anywhere over night without it.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, can last for weeks without recharging.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product isn&#x27;t that enough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an abuser of my toothbrush, I actually take great care of it.  </li>
            <li>It was such a great deal we bought 2.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and store.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is cheap and cleans teeth well.  </li>
            <li>doesnt sound the timer alarm.</li>
            <li>so each person doesn&#x27;t have to have their own set up - taking up too much room on the bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li>My son and I use the battery operated, cheap toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My roommate told me this kind of toothbrush would change my whole brushing experience.</li>
            <li>this cheap -</li>
            <li>Yes I would recommend this to everyone who would enjoy  cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li>Over the 10 years the battery life degraded to the point that it would only hold a charge for about 3 days, but up until it died it was a great brush, working dependably.  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and it does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It will also remind you when it&#x27;s time to charge with a blinking light on the power button and a beeper that turns the brush off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic oral health tool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic oral health tool.</li>
            <li>Have been using this since December and its fantastic.  </li>
            <li>this cheap -</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, and I looked online for brands available.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too tall to fit in the medicine cabinet, however we can adjust the shelving.  </li>
            <li>I checked all over online, no one could beat the price, and free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and the brush does clean the teeth as well as whiten them.</li>
            <li>But for the big guy (or gal), the Sonicare is great.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, the only problem is the charging.</li>
            <li>extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is absolutely fantastic for the price!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>is Sonicare&#x27;s most basic model, and, honestly, for most people this is all you&#x27;re gonna need.</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;re supposed to use it 30 seconds each on the insides and outsides of the top/bottom of your teeth, resulting in quadrants that evenly space into the recommended 2 minutes of brushing), which I admit would be a handy feature, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>They r easy to clean, and assemble.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a thinness to the brush that makes it quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>Overall a great electric toothbrush that I do not regret buying.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>My dentist is happy I switched to this (from regular toothbrush)!</li>
            <li>purchased this Sonicare and told my daughter to get it when she needed a \\&quot;cheap electric toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It has exceeded all my expectations its a great toothbrush especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning back molars.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for the one I left at a hotel</li>
            <li>Light won&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just as happy with this one as I was with the last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and fabulous at dental cleaning -- and that&#x27;s what I want.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>More powerful.</li>
            <li>My teeth are cavity prone, so anything that helps keep them healthy is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I used the Crest cheap one before this</li>
            <li>Instructions show that it&#x27;s available on some models, but not this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Explains why this model is so cheap.</li>
            <li>Dentist recommended getting a Sonicare, so I finally picked one up and it works great.</li>
            <li>they now have available -  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know if I could justify spending the money on an electric toothbrush instead of just buying those cheap plastic toothbrushes from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Great, basic, Sonicare Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Most of us are on a budget and this is one tool that is worth the family money.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>My teeth actually feel cleaner, and I&#x27;ve always had great teeth (never a cavity).</li>
            <li>Great value at a low price.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush , the dentist recommended .</li>
            <li>registered  online and got free extended warranty.</li>
            <li>she can go back to the manual brush while I continue to get great compliments from the dental hygenist.</li>
            <li>It is just a push in or press fit.</li>
            <li>Mold free for over a year using this method.</li>
            <li>but we have a pack of &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; brushes to use and they aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
            <li>the manual, and enjoy.</li>
            <li>When you look at it like that, then it is well worth spending the money for a competent toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>Just ordered extra heads for this brush from Amazon at a great price as well.</li>
            <li>her cleaning my teeth feels so smooth after</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing tartar from my teeth, and my time with the dental hygienist has been been reduced.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m told that you must shine light in your mouth while using it.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a total of 2 of these great toothbrushes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the charging light.  </li>
            <li>Dont be fooled by the low price - this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush overall</li>
            <li>Our second Sonicare - it is a great power</li>
            <li>Edit: Confirmed --</li>
            <li>Think it&#x27;s Great Open it up after 2 days of use</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;m home during the days,will use it after lunch.&lt;br /&gt;Great product fantastic price.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend, amazon has great service for this product</li>
            <li>Two of them work great, however, within six months, two of them no longer work properly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smooth as if I just went in for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>but it feels cheaply made and has this &amp;#34;going to break soon&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I will bring it out and let it charge for a day once the light starts blinking.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at getting at the back molars</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order this as it was so cheap...</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>No blinking light, nothing.</li>
            <li>I reallyu enjoy this and am brushing for the time period they recommend.  </li>
            <li>But, as they say, cheap just buys you cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; for days when off the charger, easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>thing is fantastic, though.  </li>
            <li>Easy to charge, clean and use.  </li>
            <li>Whiter, cleaner, smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li>Nice  and affordable , delivery was fast</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably.  </li>
            <li>The heads do not come cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for several months now and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>this is one great toothbrush,its awesome,simple to use,I did notice my teeth cleaner,wont go back to Manuel toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Fantastic...</li>
            <li>This toothbrush came in the frustration free packaging.  </li>
            <li>Cheap bastards.</li>
            <li>does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>brush does a good job with cleaning, but wow, huge design flaw.  </li>
            <li>Done at Northwestern Dental School, the study says that &amp;#34;Overall, this study demonstrates that long-term use of these two electric toothbrushes improves periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients, and that the Sonicare brush is superior to the Braun [Oral-B] brush in reducing gingival inflammation and probing depth.</li>
            <li>Loved the last one- love this one.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>this is an old style brush and works good</li>
            <li>I liked my old one better.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my old Oral B, which I liked quite well, but the Phillips is even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted a spin brush and this one has been good so far.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as my old one.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item to replace a similar Phillips device that cost a good deal more.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>An electric toothbrush is far more effective than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The travel bag is not as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This model seemed to be the closest to my old one, and I have had good luck with it in the month since it arrived.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 13 year old son, who needed to be reminded to brush his teeth twice a day and to do a *good* job.</li>
            <li>I have another brush which is better, but this one&lt;br /&gt;is good for traveling or a second brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not essential, but it&#x27;s a good training tool because most manual brushers don&#x27;t come even close to brushing for two minutes.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good..</li>
            <li>Does a good job, for the basic model you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>its too bulky and noisy, and the bristles are not at all good, its better to brush your teeth with manual/ regular toothbrush rather than this one.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for any adult who a values good dental care.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and need to take good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>This product keeps me from having to visit my dentist more often, it really helps keep your gums healthy too.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought two more for my parents...</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, we are very pleased with this new one.</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed my gums felt better.</li>
            <li>The Essence toothbrush, HX5610/01, helps remove more plaque than a manual toothbrush, because it uses patented sonic technology that will knock plaque right off enamel and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do like that it is supposed to clean in between teeth and be more gentle on gums, and use it mostly for these reasons.</li>
            <li>Our original Sonicare toothbrush finally gave out,  This one works great.  </li>
            <li>I was, however, fortunate to find a highly rated generic brand of replacement heads that work perfectly - Sonimart.</li>
            <li>If you have dental problems, this is a very useful tool.</li>
            <li>Very nice toothbrush at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>Very worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s takes time to get used to because it&#x27;s very powerful, but when you&#x27;re done brushing you feel like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>This is easier to clean than any I&#x27;ve had before and does the same great job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth have that fresh from the Dentist kind of clean and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It does and excellent job of cleaning,  mean it gets my teeth very very clean.  </li>
            <li>So far it has been great, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>She said that she can tell a huge difference in how clean her teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Keep my teeth clean, works great to clean those back molars.</li>
            <li>First time moving to an electric toothbrush and had a great experience so far.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>HX5610/30 Essence 5600 surely pays for itself in saved trips to the dentist and overall delivery of a very satisfying brushing experience every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might only be good for super healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>Interesting and  full of fun.</li>
            <li>Best little brush you could ever want for travel!</li>
            <li>I personally like the more expensive Sonicare brushes better, but my mom likes the original and it is a great price and works great!</li>
            <li>Teeth feel so much cleaner using the Sonicare, very easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the toothbrush lasted a good 2 weeks before it started showing signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Surely the new design toothbrushes seal better than this one.</li>
            <li>so I needed to find a new sonicare to use the same replacement heads and this one was perfect.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I&#x27;ve used the manual toothbrush per day it doesn&#x27;t even come close to how well this cleans and the Sonicare isn&#x27;t even operating at full power right now.</li>
            <li>Great item, motor is definitely better than my previous one.</li>
            <li>This is for good regular dental hygiene made easy</li>
            <li>The cost is worth it!</li>
            <li>One year after I started using my original Sonicare</li>
            <li>The timer is great letting you know when its time to switch sides and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush so much!</li>
            <li>It is worth the price!</li>
            <li>worth every dime!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I FEEL SUITABLE SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted many years.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working after having it for many years.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my original Sonicare brush that died after ~10 years of service.  </li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush and it feels like it does a much better job than a manual brush</li>
            <li>The customer service is worth it alone!</li>
            <li>Travel bag fits perfectly into small cosmetic bag or shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see that they&#x27;re definitely in a class of their own!</li>
            <li>This however is significantly inferior.</li>
            <li>However, when I saw the price dropped to $39.95 I was much more willing to shell out the cash.  </li>
            <li>After 6 years my original gave up so I purchased the Essence 5600.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for many years and always had a higher priced model.</li>
            <li>First time using Sonicare and love it.  </li>
            <li>Seeing this really made me happy and my teeth were indeed more white.</li>
            <li>Did not come in original packaging......</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, though!</li>
            <li>The original one lasted over 3 years before the battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>We originally bought ours because of the recommendation of our dentist.  </li>
            <li>much cleaner, much better, more smile</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>They work great for almost exactly as long as the warranty lasts, then you have to buy another.  </li>
            <li>pouch is an improvement over the bulky plastic case that came with my original Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about eight years, but after this period of time the battery wouldn&#x27;t do more than the first two-minute brushing.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly fresh mouth and breath!</li>
            <li>I can say, after first use itself, I felt my teeth much more cleaner, and</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>And I am pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t fully charged to start</li>
            <li>The original unit I had lasted approx 5 years.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to lazy brushers for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, finding the best angels need skills</li>
            <li>This is worth the price when you see how your dental check ups improve!</li>
            <li>I am not overly excited about it.</li>
            <li>This model is almost identical to my original.  </li>
            <li>This one was the original brown box that sonicare had mailed to amazon (the label was still attatched).</li>
            <li>so I was familiar with it.  </li>
            <li>I love it now but the first time I used it</li>
            <li>This brush kept my teeth and gums pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I use this brush once a day and still using the original brush.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!  </li>
            <li>The vibration speed seems to be higher and it does a better job.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very satisfied with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This replaced my original Sonicare the died after 15 years of use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you expect, it works well, is easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so I have had it for quite some time I highly recommend this!!!!!;)</li>
            <li>there are other, better, more effective electronic</li>
            <li>I ordered this new one from Amazon at an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>A nice to have feature but can easily live without it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>The new brush head seems to vibrate more than the old ones which makes it more effective.</li>

            <li>so I just walk around with it getting my teeth clean til it shuts off.  </li>
            <li>The shipment went fine, although it took a couple more days than I expected, but when it arrived he was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I now clean it after each use which is a hassle, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price.</li>
            <li>If not diligent to clean often, mold grows in that.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean....</li>
            <li>Every time I brush my teeth I walk away smiling and thinking about how wonderfully clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li>have never been this clean before, trust me.  </li>
            <li>need to clean it every 3-4 weeks or else</li>
            <li>You do need to take it apart and keep t clean to avoid nastiness</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth like no toothbrush could ever clean.  </li>
            <li>Bought a Sonicare at recommendation of dental hygienist,  It does clean teeth well.  </li>
            <li>In order to keep it clean, you have to dismantle everything and clean</li>
            <li>My teeth also just started to not feel clean even after brushing.</li>
            <li>Compared to a regular toothbrush, this electric brush by Sonicare is exceptional and for the price its well worth it for keeping teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>The charger is very convenient, product is well built, good quality, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The bells and whistles of the higher end models sound great, but I came to the realization that I&#x27;ve been brushing with a good old fashion toothbrush my whole life, and this cheaper unit offers the advantage I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>Try and find a single one of this at a great price ..........</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this toothbrush my teeth gleamed and felt so smooth</li>
            <li>...as long as I just charge it every couple of days, until the light stops flashing...so far, so good!!  </li>
            <li>Unless you believe the earth is flat, and the sun rotates around the earth you should own a Sonicare !</li>
            <li>and I needed an electric toothbrush that would be both gentle and effective and this model if just right for me.</li>
            <li>Also, a quick release top shouldn&#x27;t be a \\&quot;feature\\&quot; of a higher priced model.</li>
            <li>It has been not enough time to really give it a good test drive, but so far its seams great.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up, charge, and use right after.</li>
            <li>Thought it came in a simple package and not in the original package, it&#x27;s good for use.</li>
            <li>This one was on special and I bought it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure there is probably a clever way of opening this up and replacing the battery, but I imagine not everyone can be so crafty.</li>
            <li>Though this brush has good power and cleans teeth well, the head needs to be removed daily to clean inside</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high powered and takes some getting used to, but it is great so far.</li>
            <li>It came ahead of schedule, was well packaged, worked right out of the box and is still working fine.</li>
            <li>Not so good, after using it, I find some part of my teeth is very clean, but other part not.</li>
            <li>Works great just what I expected</li>
            <li>The most controversial aspect of Sonicare is the relatively pricey brush heads.</li>
            <li>Great product that performs as expected.  </li>
            <li>Thus far works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and as expected is great.</li>
            <li>The unit brushes perfectly though, just like my old one, and the battery lasts a long time (2 weeks).</li>
            <li>After the first use, it was clear that this thing just does a superior job with cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is just what I expected, and it does a great job on the teeth.</li>
            <li>It is better than the Sonic unit with  replaceable batteries that suck away the $$ fast.  </li>
            <li>my old one had would be nice</li>
            <li>Love the travel case it comes with, makes it so much easier to take my electric toothbrush with me anywhere.</li>
            <li>teeth and gums feel much cleaner and better than using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Wish the replacement heads had a more reasonable price tag,..</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is fairly light and really powerful.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if this product is worthwhile - it was shipped without any brush heads.</li>
            <li>, I got two full years of use.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>My experience with the company has definitely left a good impression on the PHILIPS brand.</li>
            <li>Teeth are super clean and my dentist comments on the lack of plaque.  </li>
            <li>good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I own anything else that is this old and still works.</li>
            <li>The travel pouch is a soft, zippered pouch and does not protect the toothbrush as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>After use, my mouth feels super clean unlike any manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>The included travel pouch is a soft, zippered pouch and does not protect the toothbrush as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it seemed to be such a good on-line bargan</li>
            <li>Good value on this basic, no bells and whistles model.</li>
            <li>If you want your teeth and gums to feel super clean then this is the toothbrush for you to try.  </li>
            <li>Ear plugs just seem to make the experience more intense and compacted.  </li>
            <li>Get the teeth and gums super clean with ease.</li>
            <li>Time will tell, but so far I&#x27;m completely thrilled.</li>
            <li>The handle is bigger circumference wise, but still manageable.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good product to have in your bathroom</li>
            <li>After about 12 brushings, it will increase to full power.</li>
            <li>just one call to Amazon, and they credited the full amount to my account, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>With most devices that have a rechargeable battery, I would advise letting the whole thing die before recharging to converse the half-life of the battery.</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled so far.</li>
            <li>Good price for the replacement battery for the larger head model.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and comfortable brush.  </li>
            <li>Works like charm cool product.</li>
            <li>I just need the patience to figure out how to set the 30 second timer, then i’ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>This one is a good basic unit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to experience full power.</li>
            <li>It keeps a full charge all the time.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to go back and get a good review from my Dentist.</li>
            <li>This cleans my teeth perfectly and with daily flossing has allowed my teeth to remain free of decay and gum breakdown through several hygienist visits.</li>
            <li>Overall good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It was recommended my our dentist, and after my last check up he said he never saw my gums and teeth look so good.</li>
            <li>Came fast and was able to give as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li>The rave reviews for these sonic brushes are true....</li>
            <li>He loves it, and obviously it&#x27;s had a good life span.  </li>
            <li>super clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Currently, I have to count to cover all areas uniformly, time wise.  </li>
            <li>However,as stated above, for the price its a really good product.</li>
            <li>Looks about the same and works just as good.  </li>
            <li>A good size for an average-sized mouth - not too big.</li>
            <li>it was a good deal and that it should last forever.  </li>
            <li>If only someone would make a good bathroom caddy for this.</li>
            <li>It also came with a soft travel case which was nice as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling super clean and your gums invigorated.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend, as it is so much better than a manual toothbrush, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I hope that is true.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare brush for several years with good results.</li>
            <li>Love it but replacement heads cost too much.</li>
            <li>A good buy overall.</li>
            <li>as opposed to using his services - he said it would cost me $500 dollars, then laughed and gave me the 2nd</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to ask for a full refund from Philips.  </li>
            <li>but it does have more modern and up-to date features.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I found surprising is that the vibration causes me to salivate like Niagara Falls every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Overall a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love my electric toothbrush, and I bought one this year for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Hope this one is just as good as the last.</li>
            <li>This one is an improvement, though I would have liked the 30-second timer the old one had.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had more updated models, but this one performs very well.  </li>
            <li>When I stay true to that, I do not have any excess toothpaste gumming up the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I feel better and believe this will really improve your dental health.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise I find what it actually does for my teeth to be good.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a travel bag because they say it lasts 2 weeks on a full charge.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if Sonicare recognized that and fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>It does a very thorough job better than manually or those battery operated rotating tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>I thought since my dentist recommended it, it was cool</li>
            <li>Smile and enjoy</li>
            <li>Oh yes, it took 3 days to get a full charge.</li>
            <li>It really keeps the gums healthy.</li>
            <li>very well, the Sonicare is even better.</li>
            <li>It took me a bit to get used to having all that power in my mouth but after sticking with it I am finding my whole mouth feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>Seems like the same product brushing wise.</li>
            <li>Teeth are cleaner, which is true for any electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The true test will be whether my dentist tells me in 3 months that my gums are improved.</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>so when I needed to replace it, finally, it seemed like a good idea to order online.  </li>
            <li>truly cleans your teeth and if used properly is also good for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Powerful, smooth, compact.</li>
            <li>This is a tried and true product.</li>
            <li>It has the full timer</li>
            <li>This one tickles a bit more but my teeth feel so much cleaner when I am finished.  </li>
            <li>Overall  a good sonic care toothbrush.</li>
            <li>A good basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>After the 12 cycles the brush runs at full speed.</li>
            <li>Feels like you&#x27;ve had a dentist&#x27;s cleaning if you use it for the full timed period.</li>
            <li>and he is more motivated to brush (wants to brush like mom and dad do).</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s full, I leave the toothbrush inside the bathroom and use it until it&#x27;s run out of battery.  </li>
            <li>My dentist told me and its so true.</li>
            <li>and I found it was a lot more gentle on them than a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Not even 2 full years?  </li>
            <li>Once the brush reached full speed</li>
            <li>Not particularly a bad feature but no warning as you approach the day it shuts off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad price</li>
            <li>The sonicare is a nice product, holds a charge for several days, and the replacement heads are easy to install.  </li>
            <li>The original one was still working, but would no longer hold a charge for more than one brushing, so it was not any good if I needed to be away from home for a few days.  </li>
            <li>Excellent dental visit after using for a few months!!</li>
            <li>The motor also seems to have a problem as it doesn&#x27;t run nearly as strong as it did when I first bought it</li>
            <li>Manual one seems to &#x27;deep clean&#x27; more (better reach).  </li>
            <li>Works better than I expected and better than Oral B!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sure that Sonicare is probably the best or least best know electric toothbrush out there</li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference compared to conventional ways of brushing your teeth,  feels great on your gums and cheeks :)</li>
            <li>Now I have to count each time I brush my teeth to make sure I am getting complete &amp;amp; adequate coverage!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how clean the Sonicare makes my teeth feel (it was initially recommended by the woman who cleans my teeth) and how it helps keep plaque under control.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It works great, just as expected!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare times your brushing to let you know when you&#x27;re done, and it leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.  </li>
            <li>It works great, and unlike that other brand, it will never get clogged up with gunk.  </li>
            <li>A great investment for my teeth and gums, I think this electric toothbrush works extremely well.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very small and is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>other than that great product.</li>
            <li>This works great as expected!  </li>
            <li>For the price and how long it last, a good good buy.</li>
            <li>is pretty big and the head does not pop off easy, so having multiple heads for each person in your house is optimistic at best (for the price, you can buy a unit for each person).</li>
            <li>Love my new Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums always feel fresh and clean after brushing my teeth with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>First power toothbrush - works fine I assume.  </li>
            <li>clean and fresh everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it and makes my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and my mouth felt so fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Clean teeth are worth the costs.</li>
            <li>My first one was still working fine</li>
            <li>My mouth would always feel clean and fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li>After the first use it was fine though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a decent toothbrush</li>
            <li>Although this is the older model, I love it.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a super deal on this toothbrush - not</li>
            <li>The solution to this is after brushing your teeth and rinsing the brush I turn it on again so that the brush shakes off the water and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Item received quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>A beep or a quick on/off/</li>
            <li>The second one took me more than a year to order hoping the experience would be better except this time I noticed that water gets in the compartment where the brush head screws on and off and spawns mold.  </li>
            <li>Loyal Sonicare lover here.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Works awesome, like the last one that worked over TEN YRS!  </li>
            <li>super speedy.</li>
            <li>and I used a Sonicare toothbrush before that which should qualify me as both a &#x27;loyal customer&#x27; and, hopefully, a knowledgeable reviewer for the Essence.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will not beat the price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>My first sonic toothbrush arrived the first of 2013 and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommends this brand since it does a super job.</li>
            <li>For me, this sensation is fun and enlivening, though I imagine it would be too intense for many people.  </li>
            <li>Arrived as hoped for, quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>My last one lasted for many many years.  </li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t the mold it can build up in there is truly revolting, it&#x27;s one of my main negatives of owning most electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Bought this for myself and loved it so much that I bought one for everyone in my family including my 7 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly when it does need charging.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Does a super job.</li>
            <li>The more you pay the more bells-n-whistles you get, whether you actually need/use them or not.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>This was quickly shipped to me with no issues.</li>
            <li>The well collects water and quickly develops to mold.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly.</li>
            <li>My dentist has assured me that it has helped with my dental care tremendously.  </li>
            <li>this unit becomes moldy, which it most likely will, I will toss it and look for a better product or start using the manual brushes that my dentist gives to me.</li>
            <li>Ordered, shipped and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>so they would better brush their teeth and know when they needed to move to top, bottom, back &amp; front</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li>They are well constructed, easy to use and clean and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love it and amazed at how much better it is than my last one which was an Oral B Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The travel case is nice, but doesn&#x27;t fit the actual charger in it.</li>
            <li>Pro: super job for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Time saving product completely worthy every penny</li>
            <li>I am 77 years old ant the old choppers are in great shape.</li>
            <li>Costco quickly with no questions.</li>
            <li>They worn out so quickly and to replace it</li>
            <li>My most recent cleaning at the dentist was noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>the timer doesn&#x27;t line up with how quickly I am cleaning my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these things and my dentist wishes he could do more deep teeth cleaning....</li>
            <li>The only thing I miss in this model (excellent price, by the way) is the beep every 30 seconds to let you know it is time to move on to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m loyal to this brand since it&#x27;s worked well for</li>
            <li>charges fast easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Enjoy product very much.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about this and highly recommend picking this up if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this, it&#x27;s not an electric brush, it&#x27;s much more like a dental tool.</li>
            <li>I purchased this model based on the high ratings, but am now baffled as to how it got so many.  </li>
            <li>Two minutes can seem like a long time, but it&#x27;s worth the smooth and shiny bright smile.</li>
            <li>High tesh product, will recommend to many people!&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>Really gets your teeth sparkling clean!  </li>
            <li>Special price 39.99 is worth.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it right there!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scalding hot water, used Q-tips to clean in the crevices and still - it won&#x27;t stay clean and gives me the creeps to think that this is going into my mouth.</li>
            <li>I am using this product for less than 1 week, I am very pleased with the sonicare toothbrush and the results are visible and outstanding.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean right up to 6 month cleanings.</li>
            <li>It actually makes brushing more fun, as well as providing more efficient cleaning.</li>
            <li>chose this rechargeable one instead of the battery operated lower-end model because, with my cheap electric toothbrush I got first</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied, hope my dentist is on my next visit.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other Sonic Toothbrushes that are much more effective than this one.  </li>
            <li>It cleans so much better than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but this is my very first review.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>We are aware that for the 2-minute &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; brushing time, some (also adults), prefer and seemingly enjoy the brush quitting, burping out a ding, and then continuing...as a reminder to move-da-brush.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li>My dentist recommends a small 1/4 inch dab of toothpaste is the ideal amount.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied &amp; wud definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>this is truly an amazing product...much much better than some of the other ones I have used.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush since they first became available through my dentist- around 1994.</li>
            <li>Just checked and the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush which costs 2 bucks more has \\&quot;Quadpacer with 30 second interval timer\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush I&#x27;m sure it cleans just as well as the more expensive versions.</li>
            <li>And - very, very fast Prime delivery!</li>
            <li>This is my very first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; battery-operated toothbrush (replacing my rather abrasive Arm &amp; Hammer).</li>
            <li>long battery life between charges making it good for travel.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money and as with all Sonicare products lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>If it holds up for a good long time I will be ecstatic.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and keeps a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Good product, works well and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>Set up was easy and it works well for him, the handle is a bit large for me</li>
            <li>clean it off daily, but I keep a bottle of peroxide handy and hose it off with it every couple of days</li>
            <li>Amazing feeling!Its like a clean up from the dentist on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare since they first came out, and they make a large contribution to keeping a healthy mouth and gums.</li>
            <li>Such an awesome toothbrush that I&#x27;m ordering a second right now for my Mum.</li>
            <li>She said,  \\&quot;Sonicare&#x27;s clean so thoroughly that it&#x27;s easy for me to tell.\\&quot;  I highly recommend Sonicare</li>
            <li>This is a high quality toothbrush that is easy to clean with.</li>
            <li>I love my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li>i love my new sonicare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this new one more than a month by now, peefect aleays.</li>
            <li>Between this and my new water pik my dental hygene is so much better.</li>
            <li>When I went to pick a new one I didn&#x27;t expect so many choices.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>My kids love their new Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love my new sonic.  </li>
            <li>The new Sonicare cost a lot more for one than we paid for both.</li>
            <li>I had this product for many years and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>As I was looking for a new one I read the reviews of Oral B toothbrushes and decided to give it a try to see if it might be even better.</li>
            <li>I have had one for many years and bought this new one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s an older model I was able to buy the right charger to go with the 2 heads I had.</li>
            <li>This is an great toothbrush, and my dentist has said he seens an improvement in my teeth with less tartar.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is quieter than my previous rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It works great, was less money</li>
            <li>This one is just as great as the previous models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I really missed that feature which was on my first purchase some many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Works fast, easy to charge, does not hurt my gums, but does massage those well and reduces irritation and bleeding.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really noisy, and it cleans and stores easily.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and is just as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li>EASY TO USE, AND IT CLEANS YOU TEETH VERY</li>
            <li>Luckily I found a deal, but this toothbrush is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li>A minor drawback, though, to an otherwise great electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>gentle thorough toobrush- easy to assemble and charge</li>
            <li>I noticed my teeth seemed whiter even after the first couple uses as well!  </li>
            <li>I sure hope it lasts longer than the old one!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Phillips Sonicare--I love it!  </li>
            <li>The effectiveness of the cleaning and the gum stimulation made me a fan with the first brushing session!  </li>
            <li>Makes brushing your teeth so much easier!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for like 4 years and it still works just as well as when I first got it!</li>
            <li>First impression: Wowzers!</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are very costly!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a battery charger for my son&#x27;s sonicare (the model escapes me at the moment), but this actually costed a tad bit more than just a battery charger!</li>
            <li>I had to have one exactly like it!</li>
            <li>The new one is so far so good after one month.</li>
            <li>More effective than typical battery-powered toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>and actually I brush more often since it is so easy.  </li>
            <li>The vibration is strong enough to blow (most) of my plaque away AND embarrass me at the airport when picking up my luggage.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and the handle is comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I love that this was the easy open option.</li>
            <li>Better price and an easy open box.</li>
            <li>Those not accustomed to electric brushes might be surprised by the intensity of the vibration, however most people adapt quickly.</li>
            <li>I know I paid many times more for my first Sonicare and definitely got my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>The Oral B toothbrush is very comfortable &amp; it is not harsh.  </li>
            <li>This replaced my old Philips Sonicare toothbrush and I am sold on Sonicare because they last a long time and really do a good job of cleaning my teeth and exercising my gums, which is all-important for great dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>Had to replace one that was very old, happy to have it back</li>
            <li>but I like the tooth brush - lasts a long time - my other one lasted years - easy to use, easy to clean - great product</li>
            <li>After my first time I was amazed how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says...gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The Phillips brush vibrates at a much higher speed and leaves my teeth feeling incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>You do need to remove the head and clean these pretty well between each use because the head of the brush can collect stuff in it.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, it came in two days, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>This one is fine and seems to have a much faster charge rate.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to but great  </li>
            <li>Great little tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it can make my teeth very clean and white easily.</li>
            <li>I finally got a very good electric toothbrush that actually works.</li>
            <li>Hoping the battery lasts and I can find replacement brushes easily because this little device is helping me with better oracare and my teeth feel so clean!  </li>
            <li>The power of the brush is great and you don&#x27;t need to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li>But instead of rotating or moving much, these bristles vibrate, sort-of buzz and the sound reminds me of a electric hair-clippers (getting a buzz-cut).  </li>
            <li>I also notice that I also notice that my gum sensitivity is no longer an issue as it cleans them very well and the increased brushing of the Philips sonicare HX5610 essence is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and it worked great until it just quit working a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>So cheap and works very well.</li>
            <li>this works great 3 people using it everyday.</li>
            <li>It is gentle but does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>It really does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Wife would have liked a more narrow handle.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth amazingly and in a very short time.</li>
            <li>After just one time my teeth felt so much cleaner and smooth.  </li>
            <li>using this everyday, feels great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just an amazing toothbrush, totally unlike any of the powered toothbrushes you buy at the pharmacy or grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its amazing and quiet.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I had an old sonicare for a while and this one seems better.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the cleaning action and ease of use.</li>
            <li>I rarely have dental problems.</li>
            <li>My dentist bills prove the Sonicare is worth owning.</li>
            <li>He kept telling me that I needed to get my own as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and does the job.</li>
            <li>What a difference in my smile , you can feel the improvement</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of it, but after only a couple of months, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore.  </li>
            <li>Another set of fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li>Powerful with a kick.</li>
            <li>Our old one broke after many years.  </li>
            <li>Cleans teeth much better than my old toothbrush</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Much better brushing action than I could ever do with a manual toothbrush...do miss the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; in this model, when it&#x27;s time to switch to another section of teeth during brushing.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>fresh and convenient</li>
            <li>this is definitely worth the price...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li>Good deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li>The noise can bother some, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>This brush definitely is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>It does feel like a really powerful teeth cleaning comparable to that of a dentist.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>and whenever I use it, it gets powerful to help beginners learn how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is way better that my old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the choppers fresh.</li>
            <li>I would have liked an extra charger though.</li>
            <li>much better cleaning than my old Oral B electric.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, toothpaste splattering everywhere</li>
            <li>That means you have to have a clock handy, and remember to look at it,  in order to get all your teeth brushed before it automatically turns off in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Is this worth $40?</li>
            <li>It is worth to buy for price offer.</li>
            <li>I recommend it.way better than my old oral B</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I&#x27;d say this product is well worth the money, and then some.</li>
            <li>This cheaper model is good as, or even better than, then more expensive models.</li>
            <li>Way better than the old fashion toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My husband purchased this recently and has really liked using it.</li>
            <li>My old electric toothbrush stopped working after many years of use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and useful for my needs.</li>
            <li>It charges via the stand which is pretty cool</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it until it become completely unresponsive after about a month.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The old one lasted several years and I have great hopes for this one.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>As far improved an electric is over a manual, this is even more improved over an electric.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite electric toothbrush thus far.</li>
            <li>then the old one.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I punched one for my wife, see loves hers also.</li>
            <li>in my opinion, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a brush as powerful as this one before.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both have one too and for the cost it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but pretty cool if it does.</li>
            <li>This cleans better than the old Braun toothbrush I used to have.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s actually fun and somehow...ritualistic?</li>
            <li>For the price I paid it is well worth it .</li>
            <li>My wife bought me one of these, and I liked it enough that when hers died I bought her one too.</li>
            <li>gets them nice and white again.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Wow lol yes it functions as an electric toothbrush but the design actually inflicted pain on me...</li>
            <li>Good product as expected.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Sonicare for taking such good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s so powerful that i&#x27;m a bit worried i&#x27;m dehydrating my teeth, that&#x27;s my concern</li>
            <li>but like my old one better.</li>
            <li>I have a sonic toothbrush of the same kind</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s useful for brushing at the gum line.</li>
            <li>When I started getting up and doing the things I needed to do, especially self care, I ordered this toothbrush because to be honest my oral hygiene has been non existent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Sonic toothbrush for many years, and it was time to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all still worth it.</li>
            <li>After using it for many years, my old one stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I noticed with my old tooth brushes that it was easy to miss parts of my teeth when brushing, but I&#x27;ve noticed with this toothbrush that my teeth get really clean with 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li>It does not have as many functions as my old sonicare</li>
            <li>I always thought &amp;#34;that fresh from the dentist feel&amp;#34; was just marketing BS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a buy but the replacement heads are costly.</li>
            <li>and so far they love it to.</li>
            <li>sure to take the head off and rinse out the inside frequently</li>
            <li>or it will get kind of gross.</li>
            <li>This is completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Have to wait until next visit to dentist to see how effective it is.</li>
            <li>felt I had better brushing with my old one.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>My old sonicare the Advance had that feature and it kept by brushing time more on point.</li>
            <li>online price was also far better than in-store.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Well worth it,</li>
            <li>Makes brushing your teeth fun.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and easy on your gums, but still keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be a lot nicer and useful if it were a bit heavier</li>
            <li>I liked the price and that this has a standard shape toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I hate that because that&#x27;s what I loved the best about the sonicare.</li>
            <li>Get all the power of Philips Power Toothbrush and get a brighter smile and fresher breath.</li>
            <li>I just like the performance of this one far better.</li>
            <li>, I liked the toothbrush, so I ordered the same model.  </li>
            <li>I initially gave this Sonicare toothbrush 3 stars because my experience with it was rather ticklish, plus I found that \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; with it is kind of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>i think the old design is more robust.</li>
            <li>A positive brushing stroke produced sonically to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>highly recommended and easy to use.</li>
            <li>With the right toothbrush end, this brush is more powerful than my old one.  </li>
            <li>- works good and hold battery for pretty long time!</li>
            <li>Because I am right handed, I had difficulty in attempting to retrain my left hand to effectively brush my teeth....</li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare toothbrush purchase and so far I am completely satisfied, nice product and this one appears to be easier top clean up than the last one as well.</li>
            <li>One tip, when buying replacement heads do not get the generic replacements from CVS or other outlets; those are much louder on the vibration and the head doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well or as comfortably; that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like an earthquake in my mouth&amp;#34; but it cleans my teeth very well, and the timer is very useful.</li>
            <li>But, overall the toothbrush works great and it has a two year warranty, more than any other manufacturer out there.</li>
            <li>The various brushes have pretty minuscule cleaning advantages/disadvantages, but I was able to find an academic article that made me more confident in choosing the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I bouth it for my son and he brushes his tooth more now due to the fact he likes it better.</li>
            <li>Love it and it is much better than the e-toothbrush I got from other brand.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a good one I am sure but it would not fit the brushes that I have from an older model.  </li>
            <li>After the USPS lost the first order, Amazon quickly sent out another.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that Amazon offered a single, and the price was lower than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean it regularly.</li>
            <li>I totally enjoy my brushing experience, my teeth feel clean and look professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>My wisdom teeth are in, and they don&#x27;t need to come out, but it&#x27;s critical to keep them clean and my Sonicare is able to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you decide to buy one be aware that you M-U-S-T clean that portion of the head after E-A-C-H use with hot water.</li>
            <li>this is the second one that I bought and I absolutely love how it makes my teeth feel clean and my dentist noticed the difference too.</li>
            <li>This particular unit is one of the more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It keeps the teeth clean and makes him feel better than the traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had an older model and after several years of good service</li>
            <li>I had an older model Sonicare toothbrush which gave me good service for several years.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this replacement for my older model Sonicare that finally refused to recharge.  </li>
            <li>It does get gross if you don&#x27;t clean it very often, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>it basically because of the price and the other good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you turn it on other wise</li>
            <li>like it almost as much as the original.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare, but I doubt that any other type of electric toothbrush could be as good.  </li>
            <li>We have used sonicare for more than 25 years and found their products to be good quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful value as the toothbrush is easy to use--cleans as well as the larger more expensive models and can be used for travel.  </li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush very much but would be nice to have the 30 second timer.  </li>
            <li>right you are beyond all reason.</li>
            <li>Even though I brush right after each meal, I have had staining that occurs where my gums are recessed.  </li>
            <li>Maybe nobody can do it right.  </li>
            <li>Hygienist noticed right away.</li>
            <li>Bought this right after my insurance rates went up dramatically and had to drop my dental coverage.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>I got it out and used it right a way.</li>
            <li>Also the price was right.</li>
            <li>The price was right compared to buying anew at the store.</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to but the automatic built in break in period is just about right.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it does everything it says it does.</li>
            <li>Right priced.</li>
            <li>Worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li>This was the right item and well priced.</li>
            <li>I charged it right away and the charge has lasted for weeks.  </li>
            <li>have MS and my right hand (dominate hand)</li>
            <li>This product was priced right</li>
            <li>I was right and now that my right hand is well I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>Mechanical toothbrush needed while right arm is in a sling.  </li>
            <li>It will take stains right off your teeth and leaves the enamel intact.</li>
            <li>, pricing was just right for me.</li>
            <li>It came in the right amount of time and was what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>right now it does the job,and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Seems like I started noticing whiter teeth right away.</li>
            <li>The quality is there and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Although Sonicare brushes have served us well for years, I discovered after purchase that it does not have the &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; feature to help get the right coverage of each of the 4 tooth surface areas.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and battery lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li>I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t be the right ones for my older sonicare, but they fit and work well.</li>
            <li>I must laugh at this purchase, although it was shipped quickly, priced right, and arrived in great condition, the person I bought it for said it was just confusing for him to use to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to get an older version of this product, but it wasn&#x27;t available anywhere I searched.  </li>
            <li>I think these toothbrushes really make your mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it tickles and makes my mouth really itchy, but my teeth do feel really clean after.</li>
            <li>Sonicare brush works very well and teeth feel clean when done.  </li>
            <li>Getting ready to go the dentist, but my teeth feel so clean after brushing with sonicare.</li>
            <li>This brush makes it so much easier to clean</li>
            <li>Clean very well head worn quic</li>
            <li>so I was really struck by how clean (un slimey)</li>
            <li>~$30, this toothbrush really helped me maintain a clean oral hygiene routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really makes your mouth feel clean after you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats Sonicare for really getting your teeth REALLY clean.</li>
            <li>It makes your whole mouth feel clean and doesn&#x27;t hurt like some others do.</li>
            <li>Love this model as the toothbrush head is really a great size for me (smaller than previous models I have used).  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done, no matter how much chocolate and caramel I have wedged in my teeth.</li>
            <li>It can clean my tooth very well.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone who wants clean.</li>
            <li>whole process makes me mouth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s the best thirty bucks I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really gets them clean and helps with plaque.</li>
            <li>Its ok of a tooth brush, not as good as the more expensive ones but better than a standard brush</li>
            <li>It is not shaky at all but is wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>They make your teeth feel so clean and are very durable.  </li>
            <li>whole idea is to let the ultrasonic waves do most of the cleaning, not hard brushing.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am a major fan.  </li>
            <li>Ever since i purchased my 1st sonicare toothbrush, no other brand will do, really love the product.</li>
            <li>The feed back I got on this product, is the recipient simply loves it and is very happy to receive such a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li>This new model is much lighter and seems to be more efficient...as efficient as an electric toothbrush can be.  </li>
            <li>+ ago) and decided to just get a whole new set, since it was on sale for about $10 more than just the charger.</li>
            <li>so ordered this one loved the new blue color line !</li>
            <li>When they are relatively new, say a year or two old, they will go a week without having to recharge them - handy for not needing to pack the recharger when on vacation.  </li>
            <li>It was a great price around black Friday, but I really wish I had purchased this from another vendor instead.</li>
            <li>However,  this latest one is an improvement over the previous ones in that the brush oscillations are much more vigorous, with a longer stroke.  </li>
            <li>I love that this one is lighter weight and more maneuverable than my previous one.</li>
            <li>I have alwasy liked the Phillips toothbrushes, but I ordered this one too quick and did not realize that it did have the feature that have interval (30 sec) signals that tells you to move to another quardrant of your teeth.</li>
            <li>This is my second sonic--they are incredible at keeping tartar down and your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>This was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift since my husband had been using the manual version his whole life previously.</li>
            <li>Definitely scrubs away plaque much better than a manual toothbrush leaving your teeth feeling super clean/smooth.</li>
            <li>Works great, but this is our second one, because the battery (NiMH) eventually will not hold a charge for more than a few days.</li>
            <li>pretty powerful, works well</li>
            <li>Costs a bit more than the old reliable toothbrush, but you really do get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>My old tooth brush was on its last-leg and was dead on arrival, too many choices online to choose from but this item is a good replacement.</li>
            <li>-often to keep your mouth from becoming overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>It works great, as usual, but I miss the timer, as it keeps me on track.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tooth bush and an improvement over past models on all counts save one.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning action is excellent and the two minute timed cleaning cycle has actually trained me to use it for the entire time until it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li>you want great results, white shiners and fresh smelling breath look no further than this bargai!</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads are very good,I love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it made my teeth feel any more clean or look any more white than my Colgate Optic White toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I buy generic replacement heads at a lower price and they work and fit fine.</li>
            <li>and it really was impressively clean at first brush</li>
            <li>I have made a point to clean this area every month using intense hot water and dishsoap, then drying it.</li>
            <li>The original older model like this one lasted for 4 yrs.</li>
            <li>I liked the hard case that I had before better.</li>
            <li>Dissapointed, I filled out a return on amazon so that we could get a new one.</li>
            <li>readily available new heads.</li>
            <li>time with the new \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; on which the charging light stays on 24/7 after 2 weeks of ownership.</li>
            <li>so it would fit in the new handle.  </li>
            <li>We bought this on the recommendation of our dentist &amp; it certainly has proven that they know what they are talking about!</li>
            <li>If is your first time with Electric Toothbrush this is the right product.</li>
            <li>Simple packaging, for such a great toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I changed back and this is solid and it works great.</li>
            <li>A good product but water builds up inside and turns black.</li>
            <li>It came super fast.</li>
            <li>today I&#x27;d definitely go with the more affordable Essence and use the savings to buy my a couple of years worth of brush heads.eth.</li>
            <li>today I&#x27;d definitely go with the more affordable Essence and use the savings to buy my a couple of years worth of brush heads.</li>
            <li>seem good, used half one month</li>
            <li>I have only had this for 3 days, and can not tell you enough how great this brush is.  </li>
            <li>However, the device is loud and top bristles oscillates so fast, it looks like its gon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and love that it comes with a portable bag for my future travels.</li>
            <li>Great service, arrived in couple days &amp; price was same as the lowest prices advertised in local stores.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes really help with periodontal disease, my dental hygienist recommended it, and it has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer my old WaterPic, (better head, quieter) but will wait till this one quits to replace it.</li>
            <li>But it works as advertised, and does a great job if used daily as recommended, along with flossing!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li>, I used this a few times and got some nice smooth teeth.</li>
            <li>My last one worked great for years, I hope this does the same.</li>
            <li>Plus they had super fast delivery</li>
            <li>He says my last check-up was great and asked me what I had done different.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how expensive these still are, but good for Philips that they own this franchise</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is great but this one makes changing brushes more difficult.  </li>
            <li>it works as it shall be, like a old pal without handsome  words but always ready to help you in need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean so not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the previous oral b</li>
            <li>The pulsating/sonic action is extremely strong and jarring for anyone not use to it (i.e. me).  </li>
            <li>looked everywhere for an extra toothbrush for traveling, this was such a great deal I bought 2 to have one for a gift.</li>
            <li>THere are better models (Braun) that seem to clean to tongue better than this one does, but I am not dissatisfied in the least.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy with the price, since most of Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrushes are expensive.</li>
            <li>Even this lowest priced one does essentially the same great job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is a very basic Sonicare model, but it definitely does a great job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend buying the Sonicare HX6511 Easy Clean, which is designed differently.</li>
            <li>I got this as a replacement for my old Sonicare that broke after several years of good service.</li>
            <li>My previous one had two speeds, this one has one, but I still like it and this is a good price</li>
            <li>a great value compared to more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>It took me three days to clean it using hydrogen peroxide and blasting the interior with high pressure from my Water Pic.</li>
            <li>The top and bottom of the toothbrush screw together, but not tightly, and it giggles apart a bit, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem.  </li>
            <li>I know his mom paid about $80 for his, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I found such a great deal on the exact same model on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the first one i bought that i bought the same one for the 2nd house.</li>
            <li>In the past 6 months I&#x27;ve made it my goal (with the help of my dentist) to have the healthiest, cleanest and whitest smile possible in preparation for my best friend&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that  I bought a second for the bathroom on the first floor,</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean and I finally brush for a full two minutes (goes by quicker than I thought).</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on a tight budget and want a replacement for a manual toothbrush this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush very much</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find the same on this site, at a much more reasonable price than the local stores.  </li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My husband and I use this all the time and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Like it very much.  </li>
            <li>The price of this replacement was very reasonable and&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li>She seems to like it very much.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>thank you very much ,</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Really surpassed expectations, very different (and much more effective) compared to a traditional brush.</li>
            <li>My old one was great only reason purchased new the batteries died after 15years.</li>
            <li>This model did not have the 30 second timer in it, but it is OK as the clock in my head is pretty much right.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to get used to it, but it works just fine so far.</li>
            <li>The old model was velcro and worked fine...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;working fine for about a week so far.  </li>
            <li>Even after drinking a cup of coffee, I run my tongue across my teeth and there is nothing, no food particles, no scum; just a clean feeling like you get after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>You could brush for an hour with a normal toothbrush and not be as clean as this device makes them in 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Good for people who brush too hard makes your teeth feel like they are getting clean even without scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I was pleased, it was sent quickly and I have owned one before but really like the next model.  </li>
            <li>It came with 2 new heads, charges right up and is full of speed.</li>
            <li>Better clean than a standard toothbrush, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth so smooth and clean, it feels like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>The old one worked fine, but when I packed it to take it on a trip (first time it had been out of the charger for any length of time)</li>
            <li>I guess my main gripe is that eventually crud gets into the cavity inside the replaceable brush modules and gets kind of gross.  </li>
            <li>even if u clean it use hot water to clean it pop it loose to clean where the battery is also every three months</li>
            <li>and I use a little warm water and s cap full of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>At first my teeth were sensitive because I wasn&#x27;t used to such high force of a vibration from a tooth brush, but it is nice!</li>
            <li>I has a two-minute timer, but it does NOT have the 30-second intervals to remind you to switch to a new section to clean in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I imagine new ones are easier to clean.</li>
            <li>So I returned it and bought a different model that works better.</li>
            <li>And this is my first electric toothbrush, so maybe it&#x27;s with this toothbrush or maybe electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try something else, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>This one has no bells and whistles but cleans my teeth just as well because I didn&#x27;t have time in my life to use the bells and whistles in the first place.</li>
            <li>I ordered this replacement one and just love it and have no doubts it will last for years to come.</li>
            <li>Over time, I’m sure that the battery life will degrade; currently it lasts 2-3 weeks before it needs recharged.</li>
            <li>I abosolutely love them after using them you can&#x27;t go back to using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>the first Sonicare</li>
            <li>and I see no change in functionality since I first bought.</li>
            <li>With the first elec.</li>
            <li>Performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted ~20 years with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had before</li>
            <li>Love it, I couldn&#x27;t go back to reg toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My first one quit after 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I am not sorry for product</li>
            <li>This results in improved teeth cleaning in my opinion, although it takes some getting used to and may leave you with sore gums for the first week or so.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not the case.</li>
            <li>This thing really works!</li>
            <li>I feel like it really gets to the core and cleans my teeth well!</li>
            <li>Will update later once I&#x27;ve had the chance to use it more</li>
            <li>works great, have been using one since the late 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>First off let me start by adding that this products does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>We purchased the \\&quot;hassle free\\&quot; packaging...don&#x27;t know what that means, exactly, but the product wasn&#x27;t encased in hard-to-get-into plastic.  </li>
            <li>not even better than a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li>And on top of that I only paid 16$ for it!</li>
            <li>like he had just been to the dentist and he was brushing his teeth for the first time at home.</li>
            <li>and it claimed to be an upgrade from the first model</li>
            <li>I wanted my husband to be able to open it on Christmas</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted me 8 years.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li>First electric toothbrush, so for me it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Not so much!  </li>
            <li>It tickled a bit at first</li>
            <li>Love this product especially when there are coupons for discounts!</li>
            <li>It has a built in feature that allows you to &amp;#34;get used&amp;#34; to the vibration over the first 12 times you use it.</li>
            <li>The first time I went to this dentist, he suggested I switch from Oral B to this Sonicare Electric toothbrush, so I did.</li>
            <li>At first I did not use it consistently, but now I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is supposed to beep twice when it is in the lower speed mode, and once in the higher.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my husband because we love sonicare and suddenly stopped to work.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is timed and will turn off after a minute of deep teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>It looked like my first one but instead of having a gauge to check the battery</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for many years but recently bought this model with charger and carry case.</li>
            <li>Be patient when you first charge the unit.</li>
            <li>I recently had to put my first one to rest after more than a decade.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Philips sonicare I purchase</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted for about 8 years, it was a champ.</li>
            <li>This is my second electric tooth brush and the essence 5600 is ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all of the dentists out there would scoff at my not flossing, but with this toothbrush, it&#x27;s just not necessary.</li>
            <li>very wasteful design!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the first one of these I have received.  </li>
            <li>this my second one,  the first one lasted for 10 years,  what could be better?????????????  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The product is exactly like the one it is replacing.  </li>
            <li>Even my dentist said, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t bother with all the fancy add-ons; get the most basic model,&amp;#34;  so I did.  </li>
            <li>First electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>All-in-all, love this toothbrush and have purchased for the entire family.</li>
            <li>I had the same one for many years  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find the same brush which I have been using for 15 years.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I wish I had one when I was younger, it would have prevented more cavities.</li>
            <li>, I had my first post-Sonicare teeth cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Another year, and two more teeth cleanings later</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is is supposed to do</li>
            <li>I do brush my teeth twice a day, but I never seen able to properly scrub everything off.</li>
            <li>I think this device is partly responsible for that!</li>
            <li>and the instructions do say it will tickle the mouth at first -- which it does.</li>
            <li>It tickles at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m getting a better cleaning than my regular tooth brush with it.</li>
            <li>It was instant love for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing but not as protective as the Advance&#x27;s solid plastic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing but not as protective as the Advance&#x27;s solid plastic</li>
            <li>I have lower teeth that were worn and yellow across the top</li>
            <li>No need for the higher end one in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is well made and seems to work well better than a similar product I have used</li>
            <li>Love the power of this toothbrush and charge last for weeks.</li>
            <li>My first 2 lasted @</li>
            <li>The first one lasted over 3 years.</li>
            <li>This was my first Sonic brush.  </li>
            <li>Must first charge for 24 hours, as instructed,the</li>
            <li>My teeth were visibly whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted for years.</li>
            <li>I recommend Philips Sonicare to anyone who is interested in maintaining and keeping their teeth.  </li>
            <li>The younger you start, the better</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s the second one I have owned</li>
            <li>Cleans much better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for 5 years now and will never be able to go back.  </li>
            <li>This is such a crummy throw-in item, they&#x27;d have been better off not including it at all.  </li>
            <li>and i know it works better then the traditional brushing methods.</li>
            <li>Works well, better than using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This one will definitely last longer, and hold a charge better.</li>
            <li>I went almost 2-1/2 years without going to the dentist, and went I finally was able to go in, they said my teeth were spotless-</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I used manual toothbrushes and more recently, several battery-operated brushes.</li>
            <li>These our first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is his first one.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I wish I had done this years ago.  </li>
            <li>Not knowing this I bought him his first one and he also likes it.</li>
            <li>I prefer the compact head for the smaller size and can do a better job cleaning.</li>
            <li>They are difficult to find, but the Essence series Sonicare toothbrushes are excellent for cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Perhaps there&#x27;s a higher quality alternative to Philips on the market...</li>
            <li>this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve had a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare replaces another similar one which we had for many years that stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>plus the 80 dollar one has a different industrial design which is cleaner, thinner, and therefore, better.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how much cleaner this brush gets your teeth!  </li>
            <li>its then that you really can tell and it makes you wish you had taken the time to pack your electric one!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>One word of warning: the first 2-3 times you use it, the vibration tickles the inside of your mouth a bit and takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Will see at next dental exam if better results</li>
            <li>This is my first electric brush.  </li>
            <li>If, as they say, this is the &amp;#34;gentler version&amp;#34; during the first two weeks of use to prepare you for the real-deal mode of teeth cleaning, I am a bit nervous.</li>
            <li>I lost the first one in a hotel while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>had the first one for over 2 years and it would probably have gone longer if I had not lost it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to operate exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It finally died (it did not recharge any more).  </li>
            <li>the motor really kicks butt!  </li>
            <li>First one still worked</li>
            <li>It was the first time she&#x27;s ever said that to me.</li>
            <li>Have had several Sonicare toothbrushes over the years and love them.  </li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This most recent Sonicare works well for us, as we expect it to.  </li>
            <li>better than regular tootbrush.</li>
            <li>This is one of many Sonicares I have purchased for my entire family.</li>
            <li>i noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>The battery on the first unit stopped charging after 10 years.</li>
            <li>It also reaches the back teeth better than an manual.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to buy the more basic Essence 5600 Rechargeable model.</li>
            <li>yeah, its definitely worth the money as your teeth will be so much</li>
            <li>the back of teeth on top.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for three years now and have had zero problems for the first time in my life after averaging about a cavity a year.</li>
            <li>sleeper!&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work ok but not sure if its really better than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes are pretty pricey though running about $12.00 each</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t believe this is healthy and personally think Sonicare should discontinue this model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; tooth brush</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it any higher, and just bought one for my partner too.</li>
            <li>I had a more expensive one before that was better, but it was around 25% more.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Reliable, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and well priced</li>
            <li>Water leaked into the battery compartment upon first use.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted and came as advertised.</li>
            <li>By the way, this is the first mechanical brush I have owned</li>
            <li>you first use this brush, and if it&#x27;s your first time using a battery-powered brush, you&#x27;re going to feel a lot of noise in your mouth, traveling up to your head.</li>
            <li>At this point, I can&#x27;t exactly recall what that feels like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>During a standard cleaning of the top battery water entered the brush and destroyed it.</li>
            <li>Purchased several more.</li>
            <li>But it brushes very well!  </li>
            <li>This being my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>First Philips lasted five years.  </li>
            <li>I like the rechargeable battery much better than having to replace regular batteries</li>
            <li>the top doesn&#x27;t connect proper and gets  toothpaste inside having to clean&lt;br /&gt;every</li>
            <li>The first step was to upgrade my toothbrush from my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to use this product for exactly 2 minutes,</li>
            <li>but it is my first Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I have now upgraded to the higher priced version.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered the Healthy White Plus model --</li>
            <li>The first (non-Sonicare) lasted a couple years.</li>
            <li>My last Sonicare - most of a decade.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my Sonicare essence 5600 and the 2 extra brushes I purchased.  </li>
            <li>After I first used this I said to myself</li>
            <li>I could literally see the difference after the first time I used the brush.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery &#x3D; THANKS!  </li>
            <li>Comes with charger and travel pouch, in generic, frustration free packaging, Yay!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about four years before the power button collapsed.</li>
            <li>Tomorrow I have my first appointment since I started using this brush and look forward to her response.</li>
            <li>These can be expensive and this was the best value I found.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted 5 yrs no problems.</li>
            <li>No issues at all, all working parts and instructions, yet MUCH cheaper than purchasing in store!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and had one when I was younger....</li>
            <li>The most recent purchase was for my wife.  </li>
            <li>It works well and after a full day of a blinking light, it finally fully charged.  </li>
            <li>At first this will train your gums and teeth at a slower speed then increase gradually.</li>
            <li>I like how it eases you into using it by increasing the intensity throughout the first 12 uses or so.</li>
            <li>Your charge lasts a long time, probably around 1 month without needing to recharge and the extra carrying case is great for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It does tingle in the beginning if it is your first time using a Sonic toothbrush,</li>
            <li>It is his first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that did not come with the feature that lets you know when to move the toothbrush to another area.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought got rujined</li>
            <li>it first came on the market I bought it through the Canadian Shopping Channel&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had had this product earlier I would have been able to save the lost tooth as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really efficient! :</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using a regular toothbrush any more.  </li>
            <li>They last a long time, and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>It works with internal magnets that somehow produce sonic waves rather than mechanical abrasion like manual toothbrushes and most electric brushes that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has been using cheaper battery components since I first used their electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My first toothbrush took 6 years before it lost the capacity to fully charge a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It vibrated so much at first</li>
            <li>Charges fast!</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li>Make sure you only brush for the allotted time.</li>
            <li>My first brush lasted 7 years before it stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>This replaces my first Sonicare toothbrush, which helped my gum health, according to my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li>It really works well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say more after my next dental checkup.</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted for years</li>
            <li>My first sonicare was given to me as a gift over 15+ years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smooth, minimal seams design means they don&#x27;t build up anywhere near as much grunge as my old one - the wireless charging is a great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got my first Sonicare Essence (5300) rechargeable electric toothbrush as a perk from my health insurance company.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in the ionic toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Does not have the 4 short pauses indicating when to change sides, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in to charge - that first charge did take about 30 hours to fully charge the unit up -</li>
            <li>Love it, this last forever.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush, this is my second one</li>
            <li>My first one quit working after about 6 years.  </li>
            <li>The was the first sonicare I owned before I upgraded to the healthy white model.</li>
            <li>Also the brush head is a pretty big assembly that screws onto the top.</li>
            <li>I actually DID get a better checkup at the dentist because I was using the Sonicare, so I bought another one for a family member and my daughter bought one too.  </li>
            <li>The zipper split the first time I used it, and since then it doesn&#x27;t zip at all.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush purchase</li>
            <li>This one is much different and works much better.  </li>
            <li>Two minute timer ensures a consistent brush every time.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth better than a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ll start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It was first recommended to me by my dentist</li>
            <li>and I recall my dental hygienist&#x27;s comment on my first check-up after using my Sonicare for six months.  </li>
            <li>My family has 4, so obviously we&#x27;re quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Why so many, I have property in different places and keep a unit at each location!!!  </li>
            <li>After using the Oral-B brush for years, and feeling like the brush was pretty aggressive on my teeth, I did not worry about it until my dentist pointed out that the brush needs to be softer or it damages gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush - this is my second one.  </li>
            <li>I would give this brush 5 stars, except that while it has a 2 minute timer, it does not beep every 30 seconds so you can be sure to brush all your teeth equally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend it and do not look further:-)</li>
            <li>Our first Sonicare lasted years and years and years.  </li>
            <li>As expected, this Sonicare product is just as effective as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li>Bought to try this at first since it was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>Of great importance, the unit holds a charge for a long time, several days-five days easily-and then I charge it so that it never runs out.  </li>
            <li>But this one is a bit better than the last one that I had in that problem.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for 10+ years and this one is every bit as efficient as the first one.  </li>
            <li>This is my first powered toothbrush and I was sold after the first use.</li>
            <li>Tingles at first until you get used to it</li>
            <li>Lastly, I should be able to switch out the brush at will, not the entire top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will feel the same as she gets used to using her Essence.</li>
            <li>It feels funny at first brushing with this</li>
            <li>As my heading states, with the two-minute auto-cut-off, it makes sure you do brush your teeth &amp;#34;long enough&amp;#34;, i.e. properly.</li>
            <li>Though this is the simpler version of what has many different kinds and features now, it still does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>As a user of a Sonicare toothbrush for many years I am pleased to report that you do not need all of the bells and whistles that the more expensive Sonicare models have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but you gotta buy a more recent model, I think.</li>
            <li>My OralB electric died after 9 years so I decided to purchase this unit based on infomercials when product first came into the market years ago.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what my periodontist wanted me to purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this simple toothbrush</li>
            <li>When I first got my e series</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>and I have replaced it twice since then - says much for the longevity!..</li>
            <li>For the price of it, it does exactly what you need an electric toothbrush to do.</li>
            <li>The written ad content should be more specific in providing information as to which models have that added feature.</li>
            <li>Ive had this toothbrush for about 2 years and it works great the battery stays charged for at least a month still.</li>
            <li>OLD MAN WITH FREE CHECK UP TWICE A YEAR</li>
            <li>After a recommendation from my dentist to go with Sonicare over the Oral-B, not only did I save money, but I love my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>is very costly!</li>
            <li>Am thoroughly pleased with this product for ease of use, battery longevity, and low cost.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Cheap, works just like my old one.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my old charger</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will purchase something better in the future.</li>
            <li>#34;step-up&amp;#34; to a higher level.  </li>
            <li>The comparison chart here on Amazon was helpful as well for a first time re-chargeable Sonicare brush buyer like me.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li>Finally wore out my first Sonicare brush after many years.........</li>
            <li>First time trying one of these &#x27;sonic&#x27; tooth brushes.. I have to say, it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling</li>
            <li>Amazed at how well this product really works!  </li>
            <li>just got done using it for the first time, and</li>
            <li>This replaces similar models with more that five years use.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 11 years before battery died.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and it worked the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush for a number of years now and my dentist says my teeth are in much better shape than they were when I used a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>what they use to tell you to do when first tb came out on the market and have just kept on doing</li>
            <li>I contacted customer service more than 5 times and they have not gotten back to me.</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than before!</li>
            <li>I should have done more homework before I bought this model, but I would also give Philips feedback that this is a basic feature that should be included on all models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several Philips Essence toothbrushes and love them.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to replace the exact model, after 3 years.  </li>
            <li>and it stayed revved up the whole time!</li>
            <li>I turned it on for the first time and I was like &amp;#34;yoooo</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times that I used it</li>
            <li>This works well in that it automatically stops at exactly two minutes.</li>
            <li>first  Sonicare</li>
            <li>The price certainly was right</li>
            <li>Thie toothbrush replaces a similar one purchased many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Glad to come back to this, plus my dentist is happy.l</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 18 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this model for more than 5 years and it finally broke.  </li>
            <li>This is a really food preventative maintenance tool!</li>
            <li>First Sonicare purchase.</li>
            <li>It operated  exactly as described</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t love the experience, but I do like it, especially the results!  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>Bought the first one because my dentist recommended it and had a brochure on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I would pay more for a brush that keeps everything the same but eliminates those two problems.</li>
            <li>So I thought for christmas I would spend a few dollars on him a good one.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush, regret did not have to buy a few brush head</li>
            <li>The new, smaller travel bag is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought one with a sensitive brush head because this tooth brush is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast and was priced fairly ( a bit less than the reatil stores).</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is much more effective than both regular and the other cheaper electric ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>My mean dentist said that I was doing a great job brushing.</li>
            <li>Our original Sonicare was more that ten years old.  </li>
            <li>My mother in law bought the whole family sonicare tooth brushes right after they came out.</li>
            <li>The modes of the other units (tongue cleaning, gum care, etc) are cool, but the reality is most people won&#x27;t use those features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not fully satisfied with is that it isn&#x27;t completely sealed and gets a bit yucky inside if you don&#x27;t maticulously clean it after each use.</li>
            <li>it shakes so intensely that you feel only a need to press very lightly.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are feeling very clean and look white.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good, but when it wears out, I&#x27;m going back to the Oral B.</li>
            <li>The brush has a mind of its own; sometimes the charge lasts for a while other times it shuts off on you while you&#x27;re brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked that feature and was not aware that the one I purchased did not have it.  </li>
            <li>I love the timer on it which makes sure I brush for long enough.  </li>
            <li>Loud, but you get used to it- also totally worth it for the whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>first reaction was WOW, this is so much better than my old Sonicare ever was.</li>
            <li>When the Advance died on Tuesday of this past week I ordered this from Amazon and was sure glad for the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Man this thing can clean teeth like your favorite hygienist, only no sharp hook!</li>
            <li>I really love this product, make brush teeth fun and easy to reach the area that are hard to reach</li>
            <li>I tell you what, my mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this fresh from just using a new toothbrush before!</li>
            <li>Battery works a long time and the brush heads are very comfortable on gums</li>
            <li>Really the first true upgrade to brushing, can&#x27;t wait to show off my new gums to the dentist.</li>
            <li>This unit is great, the stem is narrow, easy to reach for those back teeth, the stand is lighter and easier to dock the hand unit.. if you are looking for a new brush, get this one..</li>
            <li>Wow, this is such an amazing deal.  </li>
            <li>Better clean in half the time.</li>
            <li>I more or less guess when it&#x27;s time to move parts of my mouth and my teeth feel squeaky clean afterward.</li>
            <li>my dentist always mentions that it&#x27;s clear I keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clean nearly as well as this one with the vibration.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still surprised every time I brush at just how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>They do come clean (as far in as I can see...)</li>
            <li>I bought the smaller brushheads to be sure i get to my back teeth easily, per dentist suggestion.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel as clean as after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel as clean as they do after professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Yes I replace on charger immediately and clean the machine frequently....</li>
            <li>This is the older model but it&#x27;s price is worth it.</li>
            <li>What we both noticed the most was how obvious the spots we missed were - making easy to go back and get those pesky spots.</li>
            <li>I clean it out frequently and there is no stopping the problem.</li>
            <li>You have to unscrew the head, clean the insides out with  a Q-tip and old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel dentist visit clean after using it just like the old one.  </li>
            <li>charge has worked well so far and my teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>When it was also leaking just the same I returned and bought again the same product, now from Amazon trusting it will not be faulty building on my good experience with the company.  </li>
            <li>The newer size of the brush is far better than my old head.</li>
            <li>I understand that for people who have used more expensive version, this toothbrush did not get good reviews.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a good value, there is a noticeable difference in how it operates compared to more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li>The soft case is more convenient than the plastic case that was part of the old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoying this item everyday and thank you for a good price and fast delivery...Will do business again and again..</li>
            <li>Not cheap to replace that much stuff that still looks good.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, and my teeth feel so much cleaner than using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap, but the results make it worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>good price and works just as well as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for several years and can&#x27;t say enough good about them.  </li>
            <li>This brush works very well, and I&#x27;m pleased with the actual product.</li>
            <li>The sonicare Essence is a good toothbrush especially if you are short on cash.  </li>
            <li>Wow, even more vigorous cleaning action.</li>
            <li>I was glad to get it again at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have the nicer sonicare unit that has a smaller handle part and significantly more intense &amp;#34;vibration&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>And this one does just as good of a job as their more expensive models.</li>
            <li>In fact, I brushed much longer than the two minutes because I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Packing seems to be not-so-great as the first brush I received had a large slice into the handle (plastic wrapping was sliced as well, but the shipping box was undamaged).</li>
            <li>After the first month, I removed the toothbrush head and found a large accumulation of toothpaste and moisture.  </li>
            <li>The main benefit to this kind of toothbrush is that I used to get about one cavity every two years or so, and I literally have not had a single one since I started using Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much - my teeth feel so much cleaner than when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I barely have to put any action into my brushing movements and it leaves my teeth wonderfully smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>on the power--the brush is powerful, but it ramps up the speed over your first week to get your gums used to the new movement.&lt;br /&gt;Sleek charging stand&lt;br /&gt;Dishwasher</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after brushing, I love the built in 2 minute timer and the charge lasts for over a week at least (I can attest to that).</li>
            <li>Good value.&lt;br /&gt;Had replacement brushes which only fit a few models.</li>
            <li>I was using a manual toothbrush, and have not been satisfied with it in a long time.  </li>
            <li>If it tickles your gums too much when you first use it, you can solve this by using an oral irrigator for a while before you use the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it would tickle too much</li>
            <li>Happily, I had used my last Sonicare long enough to have my own timer internally now.</li>
            <li>It continues to perform very well and holds a charge just as well as it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>After just one brush, my teeth felt better than they have in a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought a Sonicare FlexCare Plus which is a higher end model costing four times as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the upgrade to a better version and one that has the intervals to tell you when to switch to cleaning other areas of your mouth.</li>
            <li>The long, slender brush seems to allow me to gain better access to the harder-to-reach areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Can happily say I&#x27;m never going back to other toothbrush brands again.</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t come with a timer of flat screen TV on the handle, but I don&#x27;t really need those anyway.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare brushes but it is definitely worth it to upgrade to a model that uses the other style of brush head.  </li>
            <li>but I must say I really do see a noticeable difference in the cleanliness of my teeth even after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>At first he had to get used to the vibrations, but now he says he really likes the way it cleans his teeth.  </li>
            <li>They pretty much blew me off and said that was the way they are now..</li>
            <li>The slower gentler cycle that you initially experience is great especially because the brush is a soft brush</li>
            <li>I love the product, though I am wondering just HOW LONG it takes to charge up?  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, it tickled so much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are all pretty much alike when it comes to cleaning them.  </li>
            <li>it was not until I got my first Sonicare that I saw a real improvement in cleaning.</li>
            <li>really like the Sonicare line and think it should be considered first by anyone looking to get an electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I should preface this review that this is the first real re-chargeable electric toothbrush I have owned.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s pretty much all</li>
            <li>Love it that I can go on a week long business trip and not have to worry about charging it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this toothbrush and think it does a great job of cleaning my teeth, I will, however, echo the cons of some other reviewers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for a Philips Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;d had for the past five years which I loved.</li>
            <li>If you used Sonicare in the past and loved the Quadpacer  feature -- don&#x27;t expect this model to have it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes in the past but none as good as this.  </li>
            <li>You can usually get good deals on multi-packs of the heads.  </li>
            <li>I realize that I should have done a bit more research before buying (my fault); however, I think the fact that it ONLY works on certain voltages and you can&#x27;t even use transformers to make up the difference is pretty heinous because it forces you to buy a model with more bells and whistles than you want, just for the ability to charge it in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using for a few weeks and love the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel extra clean ^ fresh.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of toothbrush for several years and my denist keeps telling me that it has kept my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This same toothbrush would have cost be double locally, but I was able to order a new one after I dropped and broke my old one right from the comfort of my own home!</li>
            <li>Seems easy to use, takes up little space and works fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great tooth brush -- cleans really well -- but it&#x27;s so loud it actually wakes my son up in the room next to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend a little bit more money and get the quadpacer!</li>
            <li>I am pleased to spend so little money and so little time twice a day to have a fresh-smelling breath and nice clean teeth and mouth..</li>
            <li>case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleased with Sonicare for very long and will continue to buy their products.  </li>
            <li>This is obviously some Marketing driven scheme to drive people to the higher priced, feature filled tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>I even sent one to my father who, as you might imagine doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the idea that he needs an upgrade in how he needs to brush his teeth much less from someone he taught how to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to clean all the brush parts properly and regularly.</li>
            <li>not just because it makes brushing so easy, but because you simply cannot duplicate the cleaning ability or the correct brushing techniques.  </li>
            <li>It also compacts nicely by splitting in half</li>
            <li>Instead of just stopping, the brush just slowed and got less effective.  </li>
            <li>I had a Philips Sonicare previously and liked it.  </li>
            <li>They came off easily at the cleanings but now my teeth stay shiny and white all of the time.</li>
            <li>just received this product, although haven&#x27;t tried, this product impress me.&lt;br /&gt;Elegant design with travel size bag, every easy for daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oscillating one always seems to get really groty in the mechanism whereas this one is pretty much sealed all around.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d keep an eye on it and check once a month to make sure its dry.  </li>
            <li>My previous brush was a Spinbrush sonic, which sometimes made my mouth sore and was not quite as effective.</li>
            <li>This is the first tooth brush that I have found that really cleans your teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Very simple design and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>This device is quiet and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Sure, the charge on it will last about 2 weeks&#x27; worth of regular usage, but I work abroad regularly for periods longer than 2 weeks and need to be able to work with 220 volts.</li>
            <li>This product is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Set up is relatively easy with simple instructions.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush came in an easy to open packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I think this basic model is qualified for most guys, for its price, but you need to clean the inner once a week,  </li>
            <li>It is easy to charge and holds the charge for several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW what a tremendous price for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I previously had an Oral B that I really liked but died after 5+ years of use.  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to use low pressure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to setup and use and holds a charge for several days if not longer.</li>
            <li>The on/off button is located so that it makes it easy to shut off in the middle of brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>but so far it seems to be adequate.</li>
            <li>My medicine cabinet is made out of metal and since the feet on the brush part are magnetic I stick it to the side or top of my cabinet to let it dry out.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to understand and it doesn&#x27;t need constant charging.</li>
            <li>The heads are also easily replaceable at your local Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li>hope next time can company with some head for exchange easily.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be fixed by even my super handyman Dad.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of adjusting, but the toothbrush works wonders and makes it really easy for you to brush properly.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest you purchase one and see what difference it will make on your next dentist visit.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is also too strong (similar to the Oral B).</li>
            <li>I really like the 2 minute timer which has helped me become more disciplined in how long I brush.</li>
            <li>last a good long time</li>
            <li>Some people might think this is a plus, but in light of the fact that most people do not brush for long enough, keeping on brushing until the signal buzzes and toothbrush shuts down was a nice feature.</li>
            <li>This is super simple to use and does exactly what it advertises!  </li>
            <li>there is no other way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was really having a hard time parting with it as it has been with me for so long and has always done an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want clean teeth, there is no other choice.</li>
            <li>It will work for more than a week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>I had gum disease, and large pockets before...</li>
            <li>you know they run for a certain length cycle then shut off.  </li>
            <li>internet capability smart technology...</li>
            <li>My dentist certainly has taken notice of the lack of tartar build up.</li>
            <li>If you want a toothbrush with timed intervals for certain parts of the mouth look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This product has the &amp;#34;older style&amp;#34; head with the large screw-on brush device.</li>
            <li>I just read it in the directions , but they said it has it in certain models....</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a large savings in my mind.  </li>
            <li>Large akward handle/base part.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;&#x27;m considering buying two more for my families....for my mom and dad....it&#x27;s very useful for lazy people like me to keep the dental health</li>
            <li>Have used this brand for 10 years and needed a new one !!  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, I&#x27;m still using mine, the refills are pretty expensive even if you buy on amazon but in the end I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Small pet peeve on both of them why such a bright d*mn light on the handle to indicate the charge level?</li>
            <li>I am using it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li>I fell in love instantly - in spite of the initial &amp;#34;mouth full of hedge clippers&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare Essence E5300 Power Toothbrush features unique dynamic cleaning action that gently and effectively reaches deep between teeth and along the gumline.</li>
            <li>The new one is a more recent version (has some additional pulsing and staged vibration features) and works well.    </li>
            <li>but if you live near a costco they sell them in a pack for cheap.</li>
            <li>my gums became so healthy the dentist attendant took my previous x-rays and new ones all around the office to show everyone the astonishing difference in my gums and they were completely healed from gingivitis, also no cavities this time or since.</li>
            <li>Is easy to use, does the job, and I much prefer it to a standard, non-electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My previous toothbrush was a Braun Electric Plaque Remover, which had a much gentler but still effective vibration.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clear my tooth completely.</li>
            <li>Better than my previous model and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worked fine until recently.</li>
            <li>The higher grade models allow for a wider range of voltage, so it&#x27;s not as though the technology isn&#x27;t there to make the brush able to function in countries other than the United States and Canada.</li>
            <li>It worked fine but when resetting it back in the charger, water had accumulated underneath  the toothbrush part of the connection and leaked out onto the charger.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works fine, however, it requires disassemblying and cleaning every third use and does the housing have to be so cumbersome?  </li>
            <li>this basic model works fine if you just take the time to use it.</li>
            <li>year old brush would no long hold a charge for more than a day.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it starts out easy and then works up to full power after a several uses.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent, but wish it had interval timers.</li>
            <li>I had an older one that gave up the ghost after about 8 years!  </li>
            <li>One has to get used to the very high frequency in which it operates.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>which is a good thing especially when one is getting older and isn&#x27;t particularly fond of yellow teeth!  </li>
            <li>Little carrying case is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice little pouch too, plus</li>
            <li>The little carrying case is nice.</li>
            <li>Just what my mom wanted and nice to have the little travel bag it comes with.  </li>
            <li>It was fine one day and the next day it started vibrating so fast</li>
            <li>I always get an A at my oral exams and with bridges, the extra fine sonic vibration really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>My first brush left my mouth feeling really clean</li>
            <li>I could hardly wait to try it as I&#x27;ve heard these are great little tools to take better care of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I lost my charger for my first one (had that one since High School...</li>
            <li>Works great, I just wish that the head was a little bit larger.</li>
            <li>It is a little loud but good for you</li>
            <li>This is very convenient and very high</li>
            <li>I had an old one for 10 years, so I was excited to get a new one.</li>
            <li>If you stay in the US/Canada, there really isn&#x27;t a need to go for the more expensive models as this one will do what you want it to do (clean your teeth) and is worth the full cost.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare, but this version is so stripped down that you HAVE to clean it frequently</li>
            <li>this is a very good toothbrush usually my 11 year old son has difficulty brushing his teeth properly but with the use of this brush he doesn&#x27;t first time with a charm</li>
            <li>I was impressed at the price, especially having received it and note very little difference in it and the usual ones I have had that were substantially more than this one.  </li>
            <li>It took a few days to get used to the vibration, but it does an amazing job keeping my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>Fit isn&#x27;t that great, however, as it makes an annoying sound as it jiggles around.</li>
            <li>I was very upset to learn that Sonicare has deleted the Quad-Pacer feature from this model.</li>
            <li>Since getting this,  I decided I much prefer it.  </li>
            <li>This is so much easier than manually brushing my teeth, and they feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really like this Sonicare model.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son who does not brush very well.  </li>
            <li>Expected better cleaning.  </li>
            <li>That is/ not holdimg a charge and never getting to a solid light.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet or really tested the battery life, however.</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>Does just what you want a toothbrush to do, really cleans and refreshes whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare has helped prevent the staining from occurring as much.</li>
            <li>My oral health has been much improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li>+ Cleans really well, proven effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>Looked around for a replacement &amp; found this one reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>But my teeth got much much whiter!!!&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>Gotit fast just as described</li>
            <li>If you want something that really gets after it, this will work</li>
            <li>but if you want something gentle on the gums check out the Cybersonic.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to negotiate around my teeth.  </li>
            <li>You will need to get used to counting 30 seconds at a time, since this toothbrush really encourages you not to brush longer than two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to by bulk replacement brushes on amazon comapred to walmart.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks, they were also much whiter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how mold can be building up as much as in the posted pictures unless they&#x27;re just not bothering with the maintenence.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is hit and miss, so I really miss that feature.</li>
            <li>It was an appreciated gift.</li>
            <li>My dentist is much happier.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another one for myself very soon.  </li>
            <li>and although it works very well there is one&lt;br</li>
            <li>As promised, works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The velocity of the vibration is too much for me.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and comes with the Amazon.com Prime guarantee.  </li>
            <li>The speed of the brush is WAY TOO fast for a child.  </li>
            <li>Two stars because it did a reasonable job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gunk/mold--this issue is real.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>He really wanted a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it might be too cheap and breakdown, however, that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.  </li>
            <li>, I bought a cheap, battery operated electric toothbrush at a local store.  </li>
            <li>It cleans our teeth much beter.</li>
            <li>You can tell it cleans very well</li>
            <li>You spend $49 on the vibrator, battery and charger, but the real payoff for Phillips is the replacement brush.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I could find was that it was available on some products.</li>
            <li>I received the order very promptly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;$20 is the real price, and for that, this baby works well.</li>
            <li>My kids seem to really like these toothbrushes and they are the reason I made the purchase, so they would brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>The whole family now uses these.</li>
            <li>The whole cap needs to be replaced</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is comfortable,powerfull,affordable and works very well.</li>
            <li>I really miss the beeps quarterly to show that you should move to another section.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth well.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it, saying it&#x27;s gentler on the gums, and it really is.  </li>
            <li>Really makes&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>I purchased a 6 pack of replacement heads as the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks P.E.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has the travel bag.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for and spending only $50 for this results in a cheaply made and ill-functioning electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Granted, I routinely brush my teeth twice a day, so there is not any unusual wear and tear.</li>
            <li>so much I bought one for the Girlfriend.</li>
            <li>In fact, she said she had receding gum lines and seeing how much mine had improved, she thought I just might have saved her teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fantastic toothbrush actually removes everything.</li>
            <li>whole package includes a travel pack, the base/battery, the top/bristles, a plastic cover for the bristle area, and the recharge base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does the job very well</li>
            <li>It is very esea to use.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel that it cleans my teeth well.</li>
            <li>Feels much cleaner than manual brushing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon&#x27;s return policy made this relatively painless.</li>
            <li>It really makes my gums feel refreshed and my teeth sparkling.</li>
            <li>It came fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>It does a very thorough job.</li>
            <li>I really like its electronic vibration, which cleans my teeth efficiently.</li>
            <li>I keep the toothbrush in the recharger and it is always ready to use.</li>
            <li>am very looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the purchase of Philips Oral Healthcare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to travel with.</li>
            <li>just something you do while your getting ready.  </li>
            <li>Its very convenient because I used to just start brushing and walking around a bit.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner and my dentist says that it massages the gums to make them stronger as well.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The ones recommended to me were much louder and rattled my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The more expensive versions beep every 30 seconds to let you know when you should change surfaces (Top back to Top Front, etc.)</li>
            <li>Outstanding product as expected.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, is holding up very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they have always been of high quality!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as our old one, but serves its purpose.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts a while, stands straight up on the sink and</li>
            <li>It holds a charge really well</li>
            <li>battery indicator light appears to be working properly.</li>
            <li>What else do you really need from an electric toothbrush?</li>
            <li>I really want to keep all my teeth until the day I die, so I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for years.  </li>
            <li>Philips provides a two year warranty which may have been carefully considered to avoid having to replace too many units that could result if it were just a bit longer.</li>
            <li>The charger works very well and the brush unit holds a charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space on bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the basic Sonicare model because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Furthermore, while brushing it sounds very rattly.</li>
            <li>thanks, guys.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works way better than i expected it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for several years and enjoy the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much cleaner after a brushing</li>
            <li>Does not take up much space, Works well &amp; fits well in hand.</li>
            <li>I really struggle w/ plaque build up</li>
            <li>The phone is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the plastic so much as touches my teeth</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>I knew Sonicare has a reputation for quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect that much from this lower-priced product.</li>
            <li>but I really like the way my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the vibration would tickle too much</li>
            <li>Even after being on charge for whole night it stops within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>The 2 minutes are not broken up into 30 seconds, pause, then continue.</li>
            <li>I have been looking to upgrade to an electric toothbrush for quite some time now but didn&#x27;t feel like spending so much money.  </li>
            <li>and/or how much longer you have until your 2 minutes are up.  </li>
            <li>These things may do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, but they don&#x27;t do much that you can&#x27;t already do manually.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much.</li>
            <li>The Philips sonicare toothbrush works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I could absolutely kick myself for balking at the price.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>you find my review helpful, please give it an up-vote; I really appreciate your feedback!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had always used a manual brush before but really like this now.</li>
            <li>This product cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>and it really makes your teeth feel polished like coming from the dentist</li>
            <li>the vibrations and strength of a Sonicare absolutely blow those away, it&#x27;s not even a comparison.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner with the sonicare compared to a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the consumable is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like rushing when brushing your teeth, you&#x27;d really appreciate this.</li>
            <li>I really like the timer.  </li>
            <li>The brush works very well</li>
            <li>It really cleans the teeth well</li>
            <li>This product was better that expected.</li>
            <li>I believe it has really help my oral hygiene and whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>Bought this toothbrush since my whole family are using it.</li>
            <li>Works very well and brushes your tooth well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have taken it on vacations for  a week at a time and the charge lasts for the whole week.</li>
            <li>It cleans really well and leaved my teeth feeling like they have just been cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my dental hygiene  so much easier to manage,</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not seeing the whitening effects so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Sonicare rechargeable brush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, fantastic brush, and I can not go back to a manual brush again!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, fantastic brush, and I can not go back to a manual brush again!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see the need.  </li>
            <li>my teeth really appreciate this purchase, never felt cleaner and my dentist even saw the difference</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This Product cleans teeth very well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience or knowledge about them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so much I got one for myself.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>This Sonicare will work for all that wants a tooth brush to do the job.</li>
            <li>I shopped around for quite a bit as I really wanted the Sonicare rather than another Braun.  </li>
            <li>Really makes a difference</li>
            <li>The cleaning is much improved over the manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>Really like the bag.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>the blinking light does not go off even if left plugged in for 48 hours</li>
            <li>After we were done, it felt like we just came straight from the dentist.</li>
            <li>So i bought him this style and he really likes it and doesn&#x27;t want to use a manual toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li>have also heard that this type of toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as those with the rotating heads, but for the price you really can&#x27;t  beat this.</li>
            <li>no frills, 2 minute timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li>You just have to gently move it over your teeth and it does all the work.</li>
            <li>This one was purchased as a gift for a very close friend who is a senior citizen in his 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and he reports that he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>After 2 minutes f brushing, you really feel the cleanliness of your teeth</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I find brushing manually very ineffective.</li>
            <li>There was nothing I REALLY needed.  </li>

            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced  would recommend.  </li>
            <li>It turns out it is a much cheaper model that doesn&#x27;t signal each 30 seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li>REALLY???  </li>
            <li>very well.</li>
            <li>It Cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>really like the ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on your teeth also.</li>
            <li>this one I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>works well and is reasonable priced</li>
            <li>No, it is very basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but we really miss it.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>so much I started doing it after meals</li>
            <li>I have had it almost 3 months and the e-series brush head is just about ready for replacement</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space either</li>
            <li>Made my teeth feel really shiny&lt;</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable too, compared to what the Sonicares used to cost.</li>
            <li>works very well , like it.</li>
            <li>no one wants furry teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are feeling the effects every time I brush which is a lot easier thanks to Sonicare</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare works very well on removing plague.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>He loves it so much and would like to give a five stars.</li>
            <li>Purchased after hearing so much about it.  </li>
            <li>It does the cleaning part very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li>I would have to say, I expected more than I got with this product.  </li>
            <li>Really helped my gums.  </li>
            <li>Bristles move incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mount feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The 2-minute timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li>, sometimes it&#x27;s a bit much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do that anymore unless I&#x27;m really sleepy and clumsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Appreciate how this really cleans.  </li>
            <li>My teeth do feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Works really well for a $40 electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It also charges quite fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this tool.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It really made it easier for me to brush my teeth....</li>
            <li>i can do it during work or reading without much effort.</li>
            <li>It makes her teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I used the Essence for about 3 months and then bought the HealthyWhite Platinum and am much happier with it.  </li>
            <li>when I ordered this one, it was just yellowed and really used looking...time to upgrade.</li>
            <li>It really cleans</li>
            <li>Received sonicare in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Is that really in guarantee product???</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m accustomed to it and had no reason to assume it was only available on \\&quot;selected models\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Update - Phillips has very graciously promised to send me another handle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Guess I really should though,</li>
            <li>If you do not believe me about this product defect there is a whole line of products that they sell on Amazon to stop the mold for this tooth brush model.</li>
            <li>My wife thinks it vibrates too much or something.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate my whole face like a Spinbrush does</li>
            <li>Is that too much to ask?</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>Provides a much cleaner mouth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the gums and they even look healthier.</li>
            <li>I now realize how convenient that is, and how much I had accostumed myself to the practical function it performs.</li>
            <li>That is such an important feature to have.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get much crappier than that.</li>
            <li>I  did not purchase them because it was a bit pricey, instead I visited Amazon and found the Philips Sonicare for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>High recommend!</li>
            <li>We only charge it when it needs to be charged, which is when the light starts blinking.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It is also very bulky</li>
            <li>Thanks again..</li>
            <li>For some who&#x27;ve never had an electric, this might be acceptable, especially at the cheap price...  </li>
            <li>and I love the minimal effort it requires.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million.</li>
            <li>Without the quadpacer I had to guess at how much time to spend on each part of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads wore out kinda fast too.</li>
            <li>Not much I can say except there&#x27;s nothing that feels better on my teeth than a sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare is gentler on my teeth and really makes them feel cleaner than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels healther.</li>
            <li>The recharge light blinks constantly and will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend any sonicare products!</li>
            <li>However, it does not have the 30-sec timer notification feature so it just runs for 2-minutes straight.</li>
            <li>really see a difference.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very durable amd comes with all you need.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really help.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to give this 3.5 stars</li>
            <li>I feel like it is really battling the plaque.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I both bought one and it cleans very well and is built well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this</li>
            <li>It works really well and after</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well &amp; the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.  </li>
            <li>The travel case was very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare toothbrush since 1995 and really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>, it tickled too much that I had to switch to my manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It came charged and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care about the travel option</li>
            <li>Even when fully charged it doesn&#x27;t really have the &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have found is the light...</li>
            <li>Mother really likes it.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>but it feels absolutely great/clean after I used it.</li>
            <li>But cleans very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too much work.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>and then someone bought me an Oral B that was twice as much for a gift.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need 24/7 streaming intel on the status of my toothbrush charge.</li>
            <li>It tickles so much</li>
            <li>This is no frills, basic, and cheap for Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t take alot of space, charges up fast.  </li>
            <li>It works better than expected.</li>
            <li>My latest one was a 4 year old Essence 5000 series and I recently smoked the charger while in Europe (I forgot it was not dual voltage).  </li>
            <li>The prices have dropped over the years and this one had the rubber grips on it that my last one lacked, so nice bonus for seemingly the same price point.  </li>
            <li>The weight is kind of heavy too.</li>
            <li>The brush does have a 2 week battery life though, and I usually am able to stretch it that far with regular use.</li>
            <li>while its nice to have this toothbrush for cheaper than it was on the market ten years ago (over 100 for this same</li>
            <li>This is my third Sonicare and this one should last because I now have my own charger instead of sharing.  </li>
            <li>The handle is surprisingly heavy and has a nice sturdy feel to it.</li>
            <li>We needed it to replace one that was about seven or more years old when it finally quit.</li>
            <li>This is a nice change from your everyday toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Tragically I left my old sonicare brush in a hotel room, this was a good replacement for the same basic-ish model.</li>
            <li>missing the dings to alert you on timing by quadrants but seems more powerful.</li>
            <li>Cleaning, however, is at least as good with the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>I charged it to full power the first time and have been using it twice a day for the last month without having to recharge.</li>
            <li>old one had 4 stops so you knew when to switch from front to back and top to bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I recently took apart a worn-out Sonicare to remove the NiCd batteries for disposal (Cadmium is a hazardous metal that should be disposed of properly).  </li>
            <li>I am putting up with it until the thing dies and then investing in one of their more expensive models that from my recollection I had no problems of this kind.</li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare because the battery on my first is not any longer holding a full charge.</li>
            <li>works great  cleans my teeth hundreds of times better than a regular tooth brush- a little hard to clean though</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have to buy a new whole toothbrush.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>The brush head is a curved oval which also doesn&#x27;t feel right and wears out much, much quicker than the old style.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased this device and I found it very useful for my teeth.</li>
            <li>I had a realy old one (like over 10 years, also sonicare) and the new ones are SIGNIFICANTLY stronger than my older one,</li>
            <li>I may try other model from Sonicare in the future but so far this one works great for home use.</li>
            <li>Personally, I feel that the timer is a significant and important part of Sonicare tooth care and not an extra trimming.  </li>
            <li>My new one is very peppy!  </li>
            <li>I tried it a few times to find a way to adjust (and I do think I am a pretty bright and smart individual), but this was a bit out of my league.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s portable , easy to take in a travel bag , and charges for a long time.</li>
            <li>The first day I spent the whole time laughing and spitting toothpaste everywhere, now that I&#x27;m used to it it is fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this model meets all my needs at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I asked my dentists about this, and he said don&#x27;t worry about it too much, as long as you&#x27;re not using a tooth-paste with heavy abrasive, because the combination of abrasive action and strokes can do more harm than good if used frequently and often.</li>
            <li>I really loved my last toothbrush (the elite e7000) which had the \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; (30-second interval timer), but this time I was not willing to pay $100+ to get a toothbrush with the quadpacer feature.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much louder than the original manufacture version and feels just slightly different somehow.  </li>
            <li>this electric tooth brush gets back there very easy  with no problem wish I had tried it even sooner because I don&#x27;t get the complaint from my dentist about no getting that area better anymore.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get use to the large size compared to the older Sonicare that I use to use.</li>
            <li>My first was an Essence e5000 I got for Christmas in 2008, a very early version of the E series.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes clean very well, especially if you tend to have plaque build-up on your teeth like I used to have.</li>
            <li>It works much better than other brands we&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth much better than other toothbrushes I’ve owned.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years, wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li>This brush stays charged for up to two weeks and has more power than the other version.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s an ok brush,  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li>The original basic remains intact.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need a voltage converter to use it in most other countries.</li>
            <li>Had my original for 15 years and it finally wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the brush.</li>
            <li>It fits the existing heads that I just purchased before my other one died, which I had for many years.</li>
            <li>This model seems to be the current version of the original Sonicare brush we had 10-15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It definetly cleans way better than any other electric toothbrush we have tried.</li>
            <li>And I do not want to use the normal toothbrush since then!</li>
            <li>Not exactly the model I was hoping for but OK with it.</li>
            <li>You would be better off with an Oral B or some other model, not Phillips.</li>
            <li>Much better than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever bought...</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the other &amp;#34;electrics&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It saved my gums and prevented more tooth loss (having already lost one tooth due to gum abscesses).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for about 20 years or more, and would not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare vibrations in your mouth take some getting used to, but once familiar, you will never go back to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to replace an original Sonicare toothbrush that I had for eight years or so; the battery on that one finally refused to recharge.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason that Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are the power toothbrush brand that is recommended by dental professionals more than any other.</li>
            <li>I had the original version and wanted to replace it with a similar one.</li>
            <li>I had an old soniccare and it was going on its last charge, so I was able to find it online for less then most stores sold them for.</li>
            <li>This is our second Sonicare toothbrush and it is very good with the exception of not having the feature of beeping every 30 seconds, indicating the time to move onto another area of teeth to be brushed, as our previous one did.</li>
            <li>I have a bridge and my gums are very pink and healthy using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>so I recommend taking a mini-hacksaw and removing the worn brush near the top from the elec toothbrush and one from a new regular toothbrush and epoxying (gluing)</li>
            <li>I NEVER got this clean with a regular brush and elbow</li>
            <li>No matter how I brushed, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean and my gums would sometimes get sore.  </li>
            <li>You have to clean them regularly.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel extra clean after using this toothbrush...</li>
            <li>You have to clean the brush daily!</li>
            <li>I much prefer this older style brush and handle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product with few minor issues.</li>
            <li>The older Essence has a NiCad battery that didn&#x27;t give as much runtime.</li>
            <li>Now my teeth only feel clean when I use this brush.</li>
            <li>u clean the entire toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but it may be worth considering if you tend to be the first one up or the last one to bed and don&#x27;t want to disturb your partner.</li>
            <li>It takes about 20 seconds to clean it, so it no big deal, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean it regularly!</li>
            <li>Long time user, and this one is still just fine.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;ve used similar product before but have never felt so much as clean for my teeth as I am using this sonic care product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an electric toothbrush that didn&#x27;t irritate my gums, left my teeth feeling clean and that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t come apart while brushing</li>
            <li>I would have never believed that a tooth brush could make such a difference in how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush-size does not help to clean wisdom tooth, and you probably need to buy a smaller brushhead too, which I have not used yet.</li>
            <li>I love the long term battery, which so far has lasted around 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I washed my hands to go look into how to properly clean this and did not notice a bit of the gunk which was essentially a mold at that point was still on my finger/finger nail</li>
            <li>Sonicare continues to be the only way to truly clean your teeth</li>
            <li>Simple to use, clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>after my first use of the Sonicare Essence, my teeth really did feel like they&#x27;d just been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>This product is a great investment in cavity prevention&lt;br /&gt;and gum health, especially if used three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;Reduce dental check ups and far less need for annual&lt;br /&gt;teeth cleaning for plaque buildup has also been observed.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using it and the 2 min timer ensures that I am brushing for longer than I did with my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted way longer than the MFR even expects it to, as I called their service when the 1st one stopped working, and the rep was surprised it lasted so much longer than the 3-or-so years they expect the battery to work</li>
            <li>So far it is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little different in appearance and feel than my old one, but it still seems to do the same great job!</li>
            <li>I love that Sonicare has come down in price to a place where it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li>Leaves a fresh clean feeling unlike any other forms of brushing.</li>
            <li>THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>would recommend this brush to anyone who wants a good basic Sonicare toothbrush who doesn&#x27;t need any of the features offered in the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that wants cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I could definitely feel a difference between the clean of this toothbrush and my old spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first few cleans with this brush were immediately better than my older spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was one that didn&#x27;t need to stay on the charger, but it was cheap enough to charge my way and then get a new one.</li>
            <li>Better than the conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My last model was a little more advanced.  </li>
            <li>The other new ones may look fancy, but I don&#x27;t really think you are getting much more for your money.</li>
            <li>The design flaw that lets a minimal amount of residue into a cavity is really negligible as it can be easily rinsed out.</li>
            <li>as good as the previous ones; this one however doesn&#x27;t have the split timer that splits the brushing times in 30 second intervals.</li>
            <li>I previously had a Rotadent that I loved, but the battery would not last.</li>
            <li>and we clean it out gently with a piece of toilet paper so mold or gunk or</li>
            <li>I can pay less and get more with other brands which have gotten better reviews from testers.</li>
            <li>Great for avoiding those moments when you brush so hard that you hit your gums with the head of the brush, in fact going slow allows better cleaning.</li>
            <li>No manual brushing can equal the high level of vibrations this toothbrush can deliver in a two minute cycle, which results in a clean mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy a new model.</li>
            <li>The brush is amazing and gets rid of a lot of plaque but the biggest problem for me is that the brush head is too small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 2 minute timer is fantastic and gives me some insight in how long I should be brushing for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unit really cleans your teeth and the brush bristles are real soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty clear that it does a better job of cleaning than the average, battery-operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The improvement in using this toothbrush has been incredible - no more endless poking and scraping at the 6 month check up</li>
            <li>It is light in weight yet powerful enough to make me feel I am cleaning my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good, and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small head.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a very conservative return policy, so I am SOOO glad I did not buy a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare since it was first developed.  </li>
            <li>The brush supplied was the standard or full size.</li>
            <li>Just used this thing for the first time and all I have to say is WOW.</li>
            <li>After 7 years the battery would only run for just under 2 minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li>For first-time Sonicare users, the Quadrapacer feature helps train them to brush each quadrant of their teeth for 30 full seconds during the total two minute run time.  </li>
            <li>We have had no issues so far so its exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>I personally like the smaller brush head as it is easier to do a good job on the back and sides of your teeth....</li>
            <li>However it sounds pretty loud when its on.</li>
            <li>kinda funny feature but its a known fact that most people dont brush long enough.</li>
            <li>Per the manual, this should be two weeks on a full charge, but since both my wife and I use it, I would assume it should last one week.   </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really notice the difference until you try to use a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the inside is a little bit of a pain because there are hard to reach places, but it is the best electric toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>Was a little disconcerted at first since it was more powerful than the last sonic toothbrush I owned</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, and it cleans your teeth better than any other brush I have found!</li>
            <li>Those tiny little things make the most powerful refrigerator magnets you have ever seen in your life!</li>
            <li>I like my new techie-toothbrush!</li>
            <li>so I had to get a new one ASAP!</li>
            <li>The new models are a vast improvement over the original design.</li>
            <li>its Ok, Its not fun to use, I am not sure as its my first electric brush but its just sitting there and not using any more.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the two-minute timer - forces me to brush for as long as I should!</li>
            <li>I saved money on the older model, can use my new replacement heads, and my teeth are once again feeling Soniclean!</li>
            <li>I really cannot live without my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re never used an electric toothbrush before, prepare for a whole new world.</li>
            <li>I was just ready for a new one.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a new electric tooth brush in a while and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed having one.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, but impossible to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>We had one previously with the timer but forgot to make sure this one had it.</li>
            <li>What I paid for this Sonicare is less than what I paid more than a decade ago for another electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold with wide handle.  </li>
            <li>The head is alot more compact than my previous Sonicare, it comes apart to put into travel</li>
            <li>My previous Sonicare lasted more than three years.</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel they have never felt cleaner and seems I use way less paste which I despise anyway  </li>
            <li>We have been pleased with our purchase and the quality for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;Helen C.</li>
            <li>I am able to use the brushes from the previous model.  </li>
            <li>Get noticeable results and better check-ups in less than a month.</li>
            <li>This one is the older model.</li>
            <li>A steady power stream and use.</li>
            <li>Works well but miss the beep from my older model when it is time to move to another area of my teeth,</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my boyfriend after receiving my own in pink.  </li>
            <li>In addition it is quieter than the older models.  </li>
            <li>Dec 21st came and on Dec 23rd I got an email saying that it was at the local post office (although it was through Fedex) and that it could take up to 2 more business days to be delivered.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to get on but my dental hygienist recommended this particular electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But as I got older I realized&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I use this one mainly when I travel.</li>
            <li>IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN OLDER MODEL - AND IT CHARGED UP OVER NIGHT</li>
            <li>recently got a much better Dazzlepro from our dentist that has just a simple replaceable brush.</li>
            <li>Purchased to place on older one.  </li>
            <li>This usually results in &#x27;love at first try&#x27; or immediate rejection.</li>
            <li>Note sure what the more expensive models are like</li>
            <li>it holds a charge steady.  </li>
            <li>/efficiency of this particular model.</li>
            <li>Purchased in January on the recommendation of my dentist to eliminate some minimal plaque issues on my otherwise healthy 58 year old teeth.  </li>
            <li>Had to replace a 12 year older one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super simple and reliable, which I like.</li>
            <li>I only wish these were available when i was young.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare,my first being a higher end model-more features.</li>
            <li>I was replacing an older model.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I&#x27;ve found is I had to purchase a toothpaste for sensitive teeth because the run of the mill tooth paste was too much with this intense brush.</li>
            <li>Should have ordered two at this one&#x27;s super low price.</li>
            <li>Why spend more on more expensive units?  </li>
            <li>My older Sonicare stopped working &amp; would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In comparison to the older model Sonic with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare  rechargeables for many Years starting when there was only 1 model....</li>
            <li>The well on the handle (underneath the screw cap that is attached to the head) traps water, which quickly turns into a yellow soup of bacterial growth.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve gone back to an authentic (not generic) Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Is a terrific product and I paid more before for this same item that eventually wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery last long.&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a classic and works as well as others twice the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this toothbrush and would definitely recommend it if you are in the market for an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have one of the older ones</li>
            <li>Last fall, I found that I could no longer get  a brush head that fit the Sonicare model I owned, which was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>This is the third or fourth Sonicare I&#x27;ve had over a period of many years.</li>
            <li>, just one thing I don&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
            <li>I had an older Essence model that beeped every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>My son (7 years old) keeps using his, but it is almost too intense: it tickles and vibrates intensely.</li>
            <li>This brush Works better that my previous older model electric brush.</li>
            <li>The Essence has a 2 minute timer that has a tiny pause every 30 seconds, so you can make sure you&#x27;re brushing each part of your mouth for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for beginners but would definitely buy a better version next time.</li>
            <li>My older Philips Sonicare toothbrush I started using on my tomato plants so flowers would set.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t likely use any features beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;The ones with more lights and a smaller handle</li>
            <li>otherwise it gets a build up of slime and grime making it super stinky and rather unsanitary to put back into the mouth.</li>
            <li>Though I did just learn this particular model is being discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I wish it would stay cleaner on the shaft and main battery unit though, always build up &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34; and has to be cleaned thoroughly often.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist loves that I use Sonicare... keeps gum problems at bay for us older folks who want to keep our teeth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find where I could order just an elite model handle because I guess they&#x27;re older.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first Sonicare toothbrush when they first were introduced, several years ago.</li>
            <li>Also, I had an older Sonicare that had died</li>
            <li>When I bought this model, it said that my older brushheads were compatible.  </li>
            <li>Beware older model units</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, not worth the money!</li>
            <li>Tickled my gums a little at first, but that went away very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone wanting the extra measure of brushing without the big costs associated with the more \\&quot;high end\\&quot; models of electric brushes...</li>
            <li>but the head bristles are very soft and it looks like I will need to change it very soon.</li>
            <li>is the single benefit, to us, that we like; It DOES NOT stop vibrating the bristles and sound a buzzer 4-times every brushing &amp;#34;cycle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It has always been highly rated by my dentist which is one of the main reasons why I stayed with it.</li>
            <li>first few uses took a little getting used to because of a funny tickling sensation but once you get used to it your good.  </li>
            <li>My gums actually tickle when I use it, and the very first time, toothpaste splattered on my shirt and on the bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>and I thought a regular brush would be just as good so long as it is used properly</li>
            <li>so far so good, only used it a few times, hope it holds up, (replacing my original one which lasted several years)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need the fancy ones as this one is good enough and has the self timer that tells you how long to brush overall.</li>
            <li>Before I had carpal tunnel surgery on my right hand I decided an electric toothbrush would make it so much easier when I had to brush my teeth with my left hand..</li>
            <li>For years my dentist suggested that I buy one of these, but  I resisted figuring a plain toothbrush was good enough.  </li>
            <li>It would seem that if the problem is in the design, Philips would just buy the company that solved the problem and put a water tight silicon cover over the brush and top of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s certainly better than other handheld or electric brushes- just more bare bones than other models.</li>
            <li>Still, I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>

            <li>So I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone, you will feel the difference after one use</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>recommend this highly.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this as an affordable option to the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise...quite high marks.</li>
            <li>The vibration from it takes a little getting used to, but is well worth it for how clean it makes your teeth</li>
            <li>but they seem to stay clean all day long.  </li>
            <li>Now, I have to count to 30 to keep track of how long to clean each section of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean for as long as they did with my spin brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush improvement and other added features are a nice step up from the basic Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It also has a smart timer (the old one does too)</li>
            <li>If you are shocked at first at how strong the vibration is on your teeth, stick with it for a couple weeks and see - I finally got used to it and it works great.  </li>
            <li>and I have found this cleans a little better than the Oral B. Takes a day or two</li>
            <li>I think one of my favorite features, and it&#x27;s the little things that count</li>
            <li>It took a little while getting used to it, but love it now.</li>
            <li>We used battery toothbrushes for many years, but these are a little different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the little carrying case, too.</li>
            <li>I have had a Sonicare toothbrush in the past and they are simply the best would not trade for any other brand.</li>
            <li>had one before but didn&#x27;t take care of it with a little more knowledge on them now</li>
            <li>Love the little bag that came with it.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money and get the HealthyWhite or the HealthyWhite Platinum.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this online instead of in store because the price including shipping was by far better---about $20 cheaper!!</li>
            <li>Secondly this toothbrush changed my life as far as how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>There are nicer looking models (Diamond Clean) and models with several features that I don&#x27;t need, like settings for sensitive teeth and the like, which I also don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>When my older model Sonicare died on me a few months ago, I purchased this model and I love it.</li>
            <li>It has a small, powerful brush head - your teeth really feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>but after a week of using, I just didn&#x27;t like how strong the vibrations were, though my teeth felt extremely polished</li>
            <li>Rather than drain affluent from the inside of the head chamber, it accumulates and rots and occasionally releases the stinking rotten gunk through the little holes on the side and onto the hand you are holding it with.</li>
            <li>It vibrates very fast, much faster than my last electric brush.  </li>
            <li>Although a little pricey when compared to a regular tooth brush or many of the electric brushes, it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>The travel bag is &amp;#34;non-optimum.&amp;#34; Spring for the hard plastic molded case; it&#x27;s worth it and works better than the soft case included with this set.</li>
            <li>Phillips is devious about making new models that are incompatible with older brushes.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel sparkling clean for a very long time after each use.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush but the replacement heads are expensive.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s weird, but it cleans so great</li>
            <li>Works very well so far.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is soft with the bristles.</li>
            <li>Just as much power as my old one and way cheaper.</li>
            <li>The speed this thing moves is completely faster, and really lives up to the sonic in its name.  </li>
            <li>These batteries hold a charge much longer and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; problems of the old NiCads.  </li>
            <li>Both my 11yr old daughter and I have used it and it really cleans.</li>
            <li>His dentist first recommended it to help with gum problems as well as plaque and general cleaning.</li>
            <li>teeth feel much cleaner, the buildup is completely gone</li>
            <li>Surprised how much I missed the quad pacing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and this toothbrush was gentle to my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>The price for this one was reasonable as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my old one which the replacement brushes are very expenses</li>
            <li>It is a bit noisier than my old one but not that much.  </li>
            <li>Coming from a regular toothbrush though, this thing is quite the upgrade and definitely worth the $40.  </li>
            <li>I have the diamond model but bought this for my gf because she was just transitioning to this from normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love the product and use it everyday sometimes 3 times  a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the same but</li>
            <li>But come on, a Sonicare toothbrush should not break in 1 year and 2 months of normal use.</li>
            <li>but it is so much more harsh on your gums.  </li>
            <li>In my case, I have many replacement brush heads which would have gone to waste</li>
            <li>a few days after receiving the product and the dentist suggested they all use an electric brush for better cleaning and healthier gums.  </li>
            <li>max with normal usage.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was actually kinda grossed out at how much stuff had built up on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I found myself charging it once every 5-6 days with normal use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice replacement but just one complaint...</li>
            <li>The second and third ones still work-we just thought it would be nice to have a spare for the future.  </li>
            <li>It lasted the week with no trouble and the small carry case is really handy for traveling.</li>
            <li>This being my first Sonicare toothbrush, it does take some getting used too at first as I could really feel the vibration on my teeth as it cleaned and polished, but I guess thats to be expected considering the quality of the device.</li>
            <li>but that suggests that one of my issues has probably been not brushing long enough :-)</li>
            <li>This is normal and will subdue after a week of using the brush.</li>
            <li>but it feels so normal now.</li>
            <li>After using for a few weeks, I love the brush.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better for the environment without the waste.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t have one complaint about it</li>
            <li>This one is pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>We have had one for a few years and have better dental check-ups.  </li>
            <li>my teeth felt no cleaner than they felt with a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li>However, some days I just can&#x27;t stand it and revert to my normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment on your future dental bills.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty much your basic Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>At nine years each, I should be dead in two more, age 100 plus.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use a normal toothbrush anymore.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve normally just used a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth with this toothbrush has made brushing fun again, and somewhat addictive!</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t reach with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After 10 days of normal use, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush ok, but I prefer a round head.</li>
            <li>This one seems to splatter a bit more than a round head.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny--your teeth will feel like you just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>That last statement is fortunate because apparently this brush is sold WITHOUT the brush head.</li>
            <li>Before getting this toothbrush I had used other electric toothbrushes, although I thought they worked fine</li>
            <li>It looks cute and the battery last very long.</li>
            <li>Having to hold it at a 45 degree angle every time is odd too, it just felt a huge distraction the whole time.  </li>
            <li>almost all the time -- the shape of the brush head is less blocky, more diamond-y, and the stem is thinner and angled compared to the old model.</li>
            <li>Charges quick and the wife is back in action again.</li>
            <li>After using this mechanical brush for several months, I can easily say I am never going back to a manual brush!</li>
            <li>It has the feel that it is made out of less sturdy materials compared to my old one -- which I&#x27;m sure it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got back to work, didnt charge it, and it worked just as strong as when I left.</li>
            <li>I only charged it once for 24 hours and going strong one week later used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely priced right</li>
            <li>This should help properly dividing brushing time between the 4 sections of your mouth (up/down, right</li>
            <li>This should help properly dividing brushing time between the 4 sections of your mouth (up/down, right</li>
            <li>I just had extensive shoulder repair surgery on my right shoulder and arm.</li>
            <li>This bristles are just the right level of softness and they hold up after several weeks of youth.  </li>
            <li>Comes with 1, smaller brush head, just the right size that I need.</li>
            <li>I went on vacation, but didn&#x27;t take my electric toothbrush and had to buy one of those battery operated kids brushes because I couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth right with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>After going through several packs of batteries, I felt the time was right to &amp;</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that it stops frequently right before I finish brushing; the timer of this electronic toothbrush needs improvement.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts as long as my other one did (six years), I&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li>cleaner and auto shutoff tells me that I am not brushing my teeth too quickly or too long.</li>
            <li>This part can get a bit icky if you don&#x27;t unscrew the top and clean it regular.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice feeling to feel smoothness where I used to feel a plaque buildup long before I was due for an office cleaning.</li>
            <li>The more expensive models don&#x27;t really offer any useful features that you really need.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really brushes your teeth like no other!  </li>
            <li>Fine as a tooth brush but does not have the 30 second / 2 minute vibration that the basic models used to have</li>
            <li>the tooth brush is the same as my last one which I lost on a trip  and the new one works fine</li>
            <li>It works great, and I love how effective it is, but the fact that two different toothbrushes have broken on us within a few months is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Due to that problem the brush made an unwanted screeching sound.</li>
            <li>It fits well in your hand and is gentle on your teeth battery life is great also,have used a few Philips in the past, this one does it well</li>
            <li>vibrations are pretty strong - I learned very quickly not to turn it on until it&#x27;s IN your mouth unless you want toothpaste on the ceiling!</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased in high school did not leak or stink, even though it was a similar design.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>They are selling a new &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; model</li>
            <li>but I also look forward to brushing now, almost like a kid getting a fancy new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels like brand new teeth on this 50+ person and check-ups are validating that.  </li>
            <li>Also heavier than new models if you are traveling&lt;br</li>
            <li>the new sonic</li>
            <li>I have a new chipped tooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When it started to let out some greenish liquid at the bottom while standing in its holder I bought a new one on the Internet from an outlet store.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to upgrade to the brand new model, so</li>
            <li>The new brush does not let the tooth paste get in like</li>
            <li>Live this electric toothbrush it does the job with perfection.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush was new in the box as described.  </li>
            <li>so i had to drder a new one</li>
            <li>just got this new one and have been using it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Also it can lasts severa months without having to buy a new brush head.</li>
            <li>i ordered my new one and could not be happier with it..</li>
            <li>The puppy got a new kennel</li>
            <li>What I bought is new item but the box that came with it</li>
            <li>I can live with this,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe I just needed a new brush had, but replacing the brush head did not help.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my granddaughter she was wanting a new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Worked well for me until my wife upgraded to fancier new version.  </li>
            <li>so we bought him a new one.  </li>
            <li>Recommend everyone buy a new tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Because of work I live between two houses.</li>
            <li>I suspected the battery, but it turned out it&#x27;s the charger, so a new one&#x27;s on the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re a new user the sensation might be unbearable.</li>
            <li>Start helps new users&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Start helps new users&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Mine was not worn out, but he thought I could use a new one.</li>
            <li>The one feature I miss on this new version is the tones.  </li>
            <li>With the new e-series brush heads I did have problems with water collecting inside.  </li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone looking for a new or replacement electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I wanted a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; toothbrush I went with this again because it was cheaper than the new models.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, and uses the brushes I already have rather than the new ones.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone trying out a new brush or looking to get an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the new models.</li>
            <li>I have used the new toothbrush for about three weeks</li>
            <li>The one I replaced was still working but not as well as the new one.</li>
            <li>so had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>new Essex 5600 model advertises NiMh (nickel metal hydride) batteries inside.  </li>
            <li>a new one cause</li>
            <li>I did up grade to a new head</li>
            <li>I had one before and after 7 years stop working, so this is why I had to order a new one</li>
            <li>I have been wanting a Sonicare toothbrush for a while, but never thought they would live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>The battery would no longer charge, so I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new, its amazon exclusive, and it has the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li>I like the new cloth case.</li>
            <li>But I think I can live without it since it does turn off after 2 min which is the recommended time for brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>Needed a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I am new to the Sonicare toothbrush, so this was quite a change for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these for probably about 7 years, had to buy a new one</li>
            <li>Went with a new brand from what I have been using.  </li>
            <li>My husband has one and needed some new brushes.</li>
            <li>however it came with a new one so no worries.</li>
            <li>checked the new charger that came with the unit.</li>
            <li>I like this new design.  </li>
            <li>Arrived new and as described.</li>
            <li>New.  </li>
            <li>How did I live without this thing?  </li>
            <li>My husband is adjusting to the new &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; mode of this tooth brush but says his teeth feel a lot cleaner and for longer after he uses it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a new handle and this is the one I got</li>
            <li>Ordered a new one here.</li>
            <li>to buy new heads every 1-2 months&lt;</li>
            <li>I have used sonicare for years and it was time for a new one</li>
            <li>My oral B died and had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>So, instead of buying new replacement heads for the Oral-B, I opted to give Sonicare a chance again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>new feature recommended you keep it plugged in at all times.</li>
            <li>This thing makes your mouth feel new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new purchase was meant as a gift to another person</li>
            <li>i like the new charger and the bit of color.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I had had my old one for several years and didn&#x27;t realize how the battery was kind of worn down.  </li>
            <li>very sharp, easy and convenient</li>
            <li>I still had some old replacement brushes and the company sent me two new ones that replaced them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a week now, and to be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not TERRIBLY sure what exactly it&#x27;s doing in terms of cleaning teeth, but it could be just I&#x27;m just not used to the way in which it operates, since it seems like it moves super fast back and forth faster than you can tell.</li>
            <li>Works super and holds a charge for a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li>Also I would recommend draining the initial charge on the new battery by normal use and then charging it for the recommended 35 hours on its first time.</li>
            <li>Switched from a vibratory brand that was out of stock, and got one for me and spouse, and both of us agree- leaves teeth feeling clean, not too rough in handling in mouth</li>
            <li>The brush does not turn on, although the green charging light in front is permanently turn on, which is also unusual.</li>
            <li>Had to replace an older model, this performs as well as the old one did.</li>
            <li>We bought this pair of toothbrushes to replace a much older pair that must have been over 10 years old...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want anything crazy fancy with multiple speeds or functions so this toothbrush is perfect!</li>
            <li>My last sonicare was a cheap one (thought this was the same model) but it still beeped at you every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>But thanks Amazon for being responsible and offering to take it back.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old ones either - the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; piece and narrow neck are more prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with this toothbrush, was starting with gum disease and no more problems.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as previous models.</li>
            <li>It was very loud.  </li>
            <li>I have been very surprised on this product.</li>
            <li>This second part doesn&#x27;t wear out very fast and can be reused.  </li>
            <li>It could take up to 2 days for a complete charge, I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When it comes to tooth-brushing, the Essence and the Advance perform very much the same.</li>
            <li>When it comes to tooth-brushing, the Essence and the Advance perform very much the same.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is very loud.  </li>
            <li>It works fine so far, and I expect it to last several years also.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a lower setting for the first several times of use, allowing someone new to this type of brush to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>The battery on my first finally gave out, and so  I bought this new Sonicare Essence.  </li>
            <li>While the toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning teeth it was manufactured poorly and large deposits of BACTERIA must be cleaned out at least twice per week.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a good toothbrush, but I used to use an Oral B and this head seems a little big for my teeth</li>
            <li>Long lasting charge and easy to use.</li>
            <li>works well, batteries last a long time, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>That was an easy way to tell the one that she wasn&#x27;t brushing long enough....</li>
            <li>The first few times you use it, your mouth has to get used to the vibrations, but that quickly passes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now - I purchased it just after a tooth cleaning - and after my first cleaning after purchase my dental hygenist has had to scrape at my teeth a great deal less than in the past.  </li>
            <li>Wish that was stated clearly on the product info!</li>
            <li>Works better than a regular tooth brush and especially if you have bridges in the back of your mouth</li>
            <li>I got my first Philips Sonicare around 1995 and it finally gave out this year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odd that the older version of a product is better then the current one, but this is the case for this sonic care model.</li>
            <li>Interested to know if they come in different &amp;#34;strengths&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>got for significant other who had never used an electric toothbrush ...</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>After the first use, my teeth felt  like I&#x27;d just come back from the dentist.</li>
            <li>The problem with this model is that it does not have the 30 second alert that makes you aware of the time lapsed while brushing each quadrant.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t clear that this model is lacking the pulsing timer, would rather have paid a few bucks more, but wasn&#x27;t clear in description.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to spend the extra money for the improvement in brushing.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was amazed at how different my teeth felt.</li>
            <li>This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve ever written a review on a product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had the Sonicare Intelliclean System brush a while ago, but it became more and more difficult to find the toothpaste refills, so I switched back to my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the 3rd one consistently holds a charge.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, and it takes some time to adjust to not brushing with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is my second sonicare, the first gave up after about 10 years plus.  </li>
            <li>I have this exact same toothbrush I bought 6 years ago</li>
            <li>Essence shares some key features with most other Sonicare products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if I had to pick between the &#x27;basic&#x27; Essence and the more feature-rich and a lot more expensive</li>
            <li>but if I had to pick between the &#x27;basic&#x27; Essence and the more feature-rich and a lot more expensive</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using ours for the past two years and love them.</li>
            <li>No problems a couple months so far with it!</li>
            <li>Pretty gross.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple, but did the trick.  </li>
            <li>it vibrates funny to let you know the battery is running low.  </li>
            <li>This is the most welcomed feature, as the old one would slip out of my hands occasionally when wet and slimy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First one lasted over ten years!  </li>
            <li>It feels like I&amp;#34;m using a professional tool from the Dentist&#x27;s office when I brush with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Boy, was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>The other version had 3 tones that told you when to change from front to back and top to bottom.  </li>
            <li>OMG, my head was practically spinning the first time I used this due to the intense vibration!  </li>
            <li>This replaced our old one, the kids never get cavities anymore!  </li>
            <li>First time I used it I realized it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second incremental beeps.  </li>
            <li>exactly the same as this one does</li>
            <li>pretty much a basic sonic care.</li>
            <li>The only reason for not marking it 5Star was due to not having more features.</li>
            <li>this is my second one, my first one lasted 10 years , I was amazed so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for the past 4 years and love it...</li>
            <li>The old one died after 5 years of usage !</li>
            <li>With the $10 off deal, the toothbrush came to $32 with tax, a much better deal than other online retailers or brick and mortar stores such as Target.</li>
            <li>This was for  my husband and it is soo loud!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted almost 10 years, and only died when dropped on floor.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Be aware these Brush heads are not made by Sonicare and do not work the same.</li>
            <li>As many other reviews mentioned, fluid gets into the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush on Ebay, but it is the exact same toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has the same brushing quality as the higher priced versions.  </li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s watch out, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable until you clatter your teeth with the back of the brush.</li>
            <li>Felt like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Sonicare ten years ago on the advice of my dentist.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Wow, this thing vibrates like it&#x27;s going to take off any minute!  </li>
            <li>I use mine daily and it has never failed me and is always charged.</li>
            <li>Sonicare does have some pretty pricey toothbrushes in it&#x27;s line with bells and whistles that we don&#x27;t necessarily need.</li>
            <li>I wish it had the timer like my previous one, otherwise it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the hardest thing for me to get used to, is that &amp;#34;crazy tingling&amp;#34; early in the morning!</li>
            <li>I bought my first Sonicare from my dentist several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped my old one on concrete and it died (my fault, not the unit&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>The first one only lasted nine years.  </li>
            <li>Returned to get a replacement and the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li>Cousin used it for a year until her dental professional told her to stop!</li>
            <li>Took me about 3 or 4 brushings, but the tickling only was that first</li>
            <li>This is my first and only electric toothbrush brand.  </li>
            <li>Also, it does feel funny when the head of the brush actually touches your teeth - quite a buzz -</li>
            <li>When charged fully, it is powerful and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted about 8 years, with brush head changes regularly.  </li>
            <li>I used the Oral B prior and this toothbrush gets your teeth much cleaner!</li>
            <li>My first was the same model but not rechareable.  </li>
            <li>I am as pleased with this one as with past Sonicare bushes</li>
            <li>feels like i get a professional cleaning every time!</li>
            <li>And it works exactly like my larger version .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste money on this product!</li>
            <li>The only problem was that the toothbrush went on sale at local stores, after we purchased this one on-line and we ended up paying more for it than just buying at a local store.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>, I think it is stronger than my old one that I had for 12 years!</li>
            <li>Mine has the old style charger and case - think I&#x27;ll see if I can get him to trade!  </li>
            <li>I fried out my first when I plugged it into a European socket.</li>
            <li>I use the basic Sonicare: I don&#x27;t need the bells and whistles of the higher priced models.</li>
            <li>So I am stuck with the old brush, and if I want a new brush head, I need to buy an entirely new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit too strong</li>
            <li>I found after using it a few times that I could clean my teeth very well without the programed timing.</li>
            <li>Now, leaving aside what that does or does not say about the desultory nature of my mornings, this thing cleans my teeth with such inhuman thoroughness that my mouth actually tastes clean hours after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more difficult to take apart to clean and re-assemble.  </li>
            <li>But to be fair, I paid less for it than my previous ones.</li>
            <li>My older one finally gave up but this one looks like the real deal again.</li>
            <li>It gets your teeth clean in a way that you simply never could do with a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>No need to buy the expensive models they don&#x27;t clean any better.  </li>
            <li>Before I bought this toothbrush, brushing my teeth was a bit of a chore, but now I actually look forward to how clean my teeth feel after brushing and wish I had a second one at my office to brush after lunch.  </li>
            <li>With the Clean&#x27;n&#x27;White, every time I brushed I felt like I&#x27;d just been to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>The charge light blinks all the time, running down the battery.  </li>
            <li>new one is exactly the same but did not have the rigid carrying case like the old</li>
            <li>After using this, all other toothbrushes don&#x27;t make my mouth feel truly clean.</li>
            <li>The brush barely vibrates to the naked eye, but start brushing, and you&#x27;ll immediately realize how strong it actually is.</li>
            <li>Very few people have that many teeth.</li>
            <li>Think about your mouth&#x27;s surface as having 4 sections, top front, top back (behind), bottom front, and bottom back.</li>
            <li>It looks like the little toothbrush should pop right off for replacement but the entire top third of the unit must be swapped out.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the new version of my old one.  </li>
            <li>I have gone and inspected the new models at stores and all but one model appears to have fixed this gap problem which leads to the trapping of bacteria there.</li>
            <li>I kept my old one going for years with new brushes and duct tape to hold the batteries cover on.</li>
            <li>Go for a newer model, I heard they fixed this issue in the new models.</li>
            <li>We had worn out our old Sonicare, and needed to find a new one.</li>
            <li>This is a new toothbrush for me, since i hadn&#x27;t replaced the old electronic I had in years.</li>
            <li>My two Braun, both new , did not work with my old charger</li>
            <li>This is a huge upgrade from my previous Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It feels weird at first, but once you get to used to it, it does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Was hoping that the unit would fit into our holder and charger from our  previous Sonicare units.  </li>
            <li>Since two of us use this toothbrush, it should last one week on a full charge as opposed to two weeks if only one person were using it.</li>
            <li>Certain meds that I take really make my mouth dry &amp; it seems that the Sonicare is helping reduce the plaque.</li>
            <li>I replaced my very old one from Costco and it was not even close to the old one, so I bought this one</li>
            <li>when you first buy it, the vibrator motor is turned way down for the first 14 uses (to get newbies&#x27; gums acclimated to it, I discovered).  </li>
            <li>It seems fine for the purposes although the vibration is a little unnerving.</li>
            <li>my teeth have never felt cleaner and my dentist gave me positive scores at my last visit.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I even entertained the idea of purchasing an electric toothbrush was because of all of the positive reviews I read on them.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth better than a traditional toothbrush and charges last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I tend to be very thorough with a regular toothbrush and after using this consistently have still felt some plaque on the backs of my front and back teeth..</li>
            <li>The other reviews are true...</li>
            <li>they last about&lt;br /&gt;3-1/2 years, and then you need to buy a new unit; that&#x27;s reasonable service life in my opinion.</li>
            <li>For these 2 reasons alone I strongly recommend that anyone considering a Sonicare toothbrush consider the EasyClean or other higher end models offered, even though they are more expensive.</li>
            <li>The basic design is unchanged from the older model, but it has a different battery and some other welcome improvements from the E series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t know, the Sonicare is an electric toothbrush, but differs from other brushes in one major way.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my previous Sonicare electric toothbrush that finally died after many years.</li>
            <li>Love it this is my 2nd purchase after my previous one lasted over 10 years</li>
            <li>I know I now spend more time brushing my teeth and have found that there is much less scraping during my regular trips to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the less packaging as it seems I&#x27;m just constantly throwing away plastic and packing bags and recycling cardboard.  </li>
            <li>Initial charging took several hours, but since then it seems to recharge quite quickly and has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>, the only problem was that it is supposed to give a 30 second quick pause and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unrelated to the product, but relevant to purchasing this through amazon:  when my toothbrush didn&#x27;t arrive the day following the scheduled delivery date (I have prime, and usually receives my items before the scheduled date), I contacted amazon to see if they had any updated tracking information (mine appeared to be permanently stuck in a transit location), and they went ahead and sent me a replacement with free one day shipping that I received the next day.  </li>
            <li>He gets up very early for work and if he doesnt run the shower and shut the bathroom door the sound will wake me up and im not a light</li>
            <li>have noticed that the Sonicare brush has kept tea stains down significantly -- which is why I purchased it --</li>
            <li>use for two months, nothing happen, but it is really convince for brushing, great for lazy person who are so lazy to moving the brush!</li>
            <li>I have taken this on a few trips both with and with out the charger and it has performed fine.</li>
            <li>I got Sonicare Essence to replace my 10yr old Sonicare Elite and it actually works better than the Elite series which was discontinued years ago; for half the price.</li>
            <li>and in the few weeks we have had it had worked fine.</li>
            <li>but this new toothbrush is a major pain-in-the-butt!</li>
            <li>it is larger than the pro series and therefore - I might guess - it has a large battery.</li>
            <li>but if you are large like me then I would suggest buying larger brush heads.</li>
            <li>No more finding just the right brush with just the right amount of energy applied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Strangely, this design flaw can be alleviated so simply with a rubber boot that fits tight around the brush</li>
            <li>&amp; it is a little hard to get inside with fat fingers but a damp handkerchief works great.</li>
            <li>After all, it is significantly more expensive that my previous toothbrushes, and really, how much better a job can it do?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stubby fat toothbrush stem, we find this new longer-thinner brush-stem design a true improvement, as there is less plastic body to wrap you lips around.</li>
            <li>I decided to not buy the one for $200, which after all seems a little overpriced considering it is all made of cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can clean it by turning it on in the sink (aiming down) with water running over it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially, I&#x27;m glad I got this unit at a mega discount (got some mad coupons before buying), since I won&#x27;t be able to really use it for too long.</li>
            <li>Returned very easily for a second brush, which also had a small scrape in the handle.</li>
            <li>It was less costly than the original one that died.</li>
            <li>I like the action and the ease of cleaning, but find the toothbrush a little too light in weight.  </li>
            <li>It is a little different from what you might expect, and it takes some getting use to, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The travel case is a nice little bonus, just wish is was big enough to tuck the charger in for travel longer than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This is the lowest end model that I&#x27;ve ever bought (I&#x27;ve own Sonicares for around 12 years now) and the velocity seems to be a lot less than other models.  </li>
            <li>Briefly, for a lot less than half the price, the Essence offers the essential benefits of the higher-end Sonicare products and it should be a good buy for both existing Sonicare users who don&#x27;t care about paying a premium for a higher end models&#x27; bells and whistles and for new/undecided users who would like to try out Sonicare without spending a lot in the process.</li>
            <li>and I think they are just as good as the original Sony and certasinly less expensive.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, a little noisy.</li>
            <li>To save a few cents on a product that undoubtedly has a huge profit margin already?&lt;br /&gt;They should start including a replaceable battery, too.</li>
            <li>user, while it takes less time to brush and clean the toothbrush with an oral B old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li>When my husband opened it on Christmas day we realized that the toothbrush head that is clearly stated in the packaging and online was not included.</li>
            <li>Unit is as advertised; very similiar to my old Sonicare which ceased to take a charge after about 10 years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>After I started using this brush, my teeth started to clear up quite visibly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clearly, if you want to whiten your teeth, you should not out your hope on this.</li>
            <li>packaging and instructions were clear.  </li>
            <li>It clearly states a travel case comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clearly they know it&#x27;s a problem</li>
            <li>I can visibly see and feel a noticeable difference between how clean my teeth are immediately after using this as compared my previous, battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t unscrew it and let it air dry or wipe it clean about once a week before you know it open it up</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as my previous Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it already for 3 months and the improvements in my gums are clear.</li>
            <li>It really motivates young teens to brush daily.</li>
            <li>I take the brush off overnight to allow it to dry and have to clean it out several times a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for nearly a decade.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care about all the fancy features, just the basic toothbrush features.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product (so does my dentist!).</li>
            <li>have caps and old teeth.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m looking for a rotating one that is not round.  </li>
            <li>being that it was over a year old</li>
            <li>But a dentist was very eloquent and years later I got around to trying one which happened to be this Sonicare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sonic care offers 2 versions of their brush&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Had to replace after a bunch of years on the old one.</li>
            <li>I had an old model that lasted 15 years.  </li>
            <li>The tooth brush has a soft &amp;#34;washer&amp;#34; that seals the brush from the motorized unit.  </li>
            <li>The trade-off of that is that the batteries aren&#x27;t removable, and the charger is more complex than it should be.</li>
            <li>That being said, the charger is inductive (no physical connection to the toothbrush) and it&#x27;s very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>but he still prefers the old manual.  </li>
            <li>It was considerably cheaper than the model I preferred, but I chose the savings over the upgrade.</li>
            <li>This replaces a 6 yr old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>this was to replace my old one which lasted for years.</li>
            <li>My old one had the quad timer.  </li>
            <li>This one replaced our 5 year old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It was considerably cheaper than the model I preferred, but I chose the savings over the upgrade.</li>
            <li>where the handles completely fell apart.</li>
            <li>Ths was a replacement for my old one that died after five or SX years</li>
            <li>However it does not come close to old skool  brushing.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare had the quadri-pace feature, and this one does not.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s been living on the stand so far.  </li>
            <li>Brush head has so far stood up well.  </li>
            <li>Use it frequently.</li>
            <li>One of these is too loud, but tolerable.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>really would not ever go back to a manual toothbrush after using this.</li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>This really is the same as any of the models.</li>
            <li>They are completely done in 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>but we had the old brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare products for years and when my old toothbrush died on me, I bought this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I reordered another sonicare to replace my old model which lasted me 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Getting one for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it goes as long as my first, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel much cleaner than a regular spin brush.  </li>
            <li>The old toothbrush would no longer hold a charge..</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I tried letting the battery die completely, but it will not turn on.  </li>
            <li>and it measured up completely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a two minute timer, but not the 30-second beep that I&#x27;d come to rely on with my old one.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a Sonicare that was 12 years old.  </li>
            <li>So far.</li>
            <li>and wow, was I wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums were really hurting, puffy, red, bleeding...</li>
            <li>Replaces my old one and works quite well.</li>
            <li>There is a soft one provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a soft one provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the way, I am 85 years old.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner than after brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My old sonicare broke</li>
            <li>Our old Sonicare bit the dust after six years.  </li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>** because my old Sonicare wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>The handle and charger are permanently sealed and completely waterproof.</li>
            <li>action can turn some off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>action can turn some off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like it really gets deep into the crevices and kills all germs.  </li>
            <li>It has been working well for me so far</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want mold coming anywhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li>I plan on putting all my young kids on them as soon as I can.  </li>
            <li>replaced my old worn out one.&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li>30 second timer beep (don&#x27;t really need it,</li>
            <li>The bristles and soft and soothing to the gums.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel much cleaner than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Definitely see an improvement in my teeth and makes brushing so much easier</li>
            <li>When my teeth are sensitive, I can put it on the SENSITIVE setting and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like the stronger setting can.</li>
            <li>This version of the Sonicare was to replace our old one, which is still working</li>
            <li>The stem is MUCH chubbier than standard electric toothbrushes and is unwieldy to hold.</li>
            <li>When my old one quit after 10 years I was in a hurry to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I am well satisfied with the product, which I use at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace my old Sonicare that I had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Seeing as Im adult</li>
            <li>I do like it because it fits the old brush heads I had.</li>
            <li>Then - and this is the rub - put it back in the charger but DON&#x27;T screw on the brush head until you&#x27;re ready to use again.</li>
            <li>So far, this one works just as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I began using this product.</li>
            <li>This has been a life saver for my 11 year old who just got braces.</li>
            <li>The old toothbrush still works-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds like my old one did</li>
            <li>Had an inexpensive electric brush to try which was loud.</li>
            <li>It is too soft.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t really know the degree to which my Sonicare helps me until my next dental appointment in December.</li>
            <li>This is a mid-range electric toothbrush and so far, I haven&#x27;t missed the power windows and moonroof.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare since the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Replaced our 10 year old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Aiming the bristles directly at the junction of teeth and gums with the brush on cleans plaque formation away.  </li>
            <li>After my old Sonicare stopped accepting a charge, I unsuccessfully attempted to change the battery.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare had the quad-timer thing, but I don&#x27;t miss it.</li>
            <li>The only really noticeable difference between my &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; so unless you&#x27;re watching the second hand on a clock, you don&#x27;t know how much time you&#x27;re spending brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>So far the Sonicare has performed well after about two months of use.</li>
            <li>I have had one for years and bought this to replace an old one.  </li>
            <li>and it cleans really well in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace an old Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>That one developed leaks:  </li>
            <li>I had just bought a package of 6 replacement brushes for it - the old E style.</li>
            <li>I prefer the old elbow-grease toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>One use changed my mind completely.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through using this brush, I have noticed (no placebo effect here) that a considerable amount of plaque has been removed.</li>
            <li>Actually replacement brushes cost as much as item.  </li>
            <li>We got this for my 21 year old son.  </li>
            <li>Get the Sonicare Easy Clean instead (that toothbrush is even more expensive than this one, but at least you won&#x27;t be growing a bacterial colony in your toothbrush...).</li>
            <li>It Is not as substantial as my old Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about it, because it is &amp;#34;just a toothbrush&amp;#34; and I have never had a different brand to compare it to!</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t go back to manual brushing after this, and the two minute timer is very helpful</li>
            <li>My 9 year old Sonicare died on me.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the toothbrush works just like my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>B00763LZWQ old manual toothbrush]], to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 66 years young.</li>
            <li>it gave me no trouble.</li>
            <li>Action seems comparable.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or unwieldy.  </li>
            <li>I bought to replace an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>While the timer works to shut off the brush after two minutes of brushing, my old one paused every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>and wow, does my mouth like it.</li>
            <li>Old sonicare quit</li>
            <li>It has lived up to its reviews and is an absolute quality purchase especially in price comparison to others.</li>
            <li>First charge takes a really long time.</li>
            <li>I did experience some sensitivity with initial use, but after about a week my teeth were used to the fast brushing bristles.</li>
            <li>this was gotten to replace an old Philips sonicare elite, which had a failing battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No complaints from the recipient so far.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare tooth brush wore out</li>
            <li>When it came time to change the brush head, I could not remove the old brush, no matter what I did.</li>
            <li>I can tell that helped because it would tickle sometimes early on, but now it just feels natural.</li>
            <li>you use deeply but gently between the teeth and below the gum line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li>Needed this as my old one had expired.</li>
            <li>have to admit I wasn&#x27;t quite convinced by the tv ads, but now after using the Sonic Care, I cannot stand to use my old style manual brush ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Far exceeds brushing manually.</li>
            <li>I gave one to my 13 year old nephew.  </li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Our 12 year old requested one for her b.d.</li>
            <li>and then our 11 year old granddaughter requested one for hers.  </li>
            <li>Item was complete.  </li>
            <li>My teeth (and overall mouth) feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My wife has to hold the brush in to complete brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now in a basket on my bathroom counter, because I can&#x27;t bear the thought of disposing of something that I paid way too much for, only to use a month.</li>
            <li>I found I don&#x27;t really need the extra bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my old one that died.  </li>
            <li>My old one would not hold a charge after 7 years, so I bought this one.</li>
            <li>You must disassemble it completely every time you use it.</li>
            <li>I have become so frustrated with this process that I plan to replace this perfectly functional toothbrush in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I keep the charger from my old unit in my travel bag and always have it when I am on a longer trip.</li>
            <li>Used the old one for along time.  </li>
            <li>But the old one beeped every thirty seconds to show you should be finished with one quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than my old OralB.  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush cleans my teeth so well that they feel like I just had them professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these for my kids (8 &amp; 6 yrs old)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been sat in its charger for nearly 18 hours and it&#x27;s still flashing.</li>
            <li>The first lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>The old model alerted you when a quarter of the session was up.  </li>
            <li>It does just what it is supposed to do with no trouble</li>
            <li>This was bought because the one she had needed to be replaced...too old.</li>
            <li>I bought the Phillips sonicare after much research on various brands.  </li>
            <li>that requires frequent cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling like I just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>my dentist said they weren&#x27;t really any different, b)</li>
            <li>I had to retire my old sonicare (can&#x27;t remember the model) and replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;original Sonicare (over 6 yrs old) has a stronger&lt;br /&gt;brush action .</li>
            <li>My old one died and I bought this to eplace it.</li>
            <li>gave as a gift and it was totally appreciated and used daily.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My old unit started working again after I ordered this one</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised</li>
            <li>It keeps its charge and is not too loud.  </li>
            <li>We purchased two Phillips Sonicare Essence 5600 when our old Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes were not working well.</li>
            <li>Really made a big difference in terms of dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>but it is not going to last much longer.</li>
            <li>sonic action might take some getting accustomed too.  </li>
            <li>There really doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much different about each version.</li>
            <li>An old review said it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This purchase is a replacement of my old one.</li>
            <li>Went from using the old stick and bristles to this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my old Sonicare which I had been using for about 5 years.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants a brush that works well without all the extras of different levels, etc.</li>
            <li>But wow...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not getting old</li>
            <li>It feels like an old model and it is.  </li>
            <li>I contacted them directly from their website with an online chat.   </li>
            <li>It has a soft brush so that you can massage your gums as well as brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this toothbrush compared to a traditional one.</li>
            <li>Frustration free and geny\tle (not too harsh) on the teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a rather long time to charge the first time, but after that it seems to hold the charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my old one which was also a Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush</li>
            <li>My old one just quit on me all at once, but I had it for 3 years</li>
            <li>I was replacing my old one which died when the battery would no longer charge.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush functions just like my old one, sans timer.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 90 year old father.  </li>
            <li>I surprised him by ordering another through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Tried the charger from the old unit.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m stuck with a loud toothbrush that does nothing</li>
            <li>you should really consider the ultimate value of what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li>Bought this Sonicare to replace my old one that lasted 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll think twice before purchasing anything from them ever again that offers a rebate.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my wife&#x27;s old one.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare wore out, and I bought what I thought was a replacement, but this unit does not have the quad-pacer timer like my old unit.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my old Sonicare which we had used for years.  </li>
            <li>This unit works, and my old heads work with it, but</li>
            <li>There were these two spots on the back of my rear molars that I never felt like the dental hygienist really got when I&#x27;d go to get my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li>have not used it as old one somehow began working again???</li>
            <li>But the timer turning the brush off completely after 2 minutes is aggravating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes and this was just a replacement for an old unit.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions for charging and didn&#x27;t do anything unusual, but the battery is shot now 7 months later.</li>
            <li>I will not buy another Philips rechargable device until this problem is fixed.</li>
            <li>My old one broke</li>
            <li>I had recently bought replacement brushes and really didn&#x27;t want to throw them away unused.  </li>
            <li>it was over 15 years old, so it was time for a replacement.</li>
            <li>My old sonicare is dying.</li>
            <li>So far, works and reliable.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it takes up a bit of counter space, but it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li>I had to use my hacksaw to remove the plastic tabs on the side of the old brushhead</li>
            <li>it made really loud noises but the sonic part of it stopped working within 6 months</li>
            <li>This is just like my old</li>
            <li>old that stopped charging.</li>
            <li>However the old one &amp;#34;beeped&amp;#34; at 30 seconds so you knew when to switch</li>
            <li>After the first use my teeth felt cleaner than they had in a long time, and the plaque isn&#x27;t a problem like before.</li>
            <li>She said the mechanics completely died and it&#x27;s a brick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t get this one fast enough.</li>
            <li>i got it to replace my 5 year old soniccare.</li>
            <li>The only thing you really need to do is replace the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>You can really notice the difference between this and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am not using the carry case so far</li>
            <li>I have used the sonic care tooth brushes for at least 5 years and my gums are in much better condition than before.</li>
            <li>I got it as a gift 14 years ago and thought it was a waste of money because I didn&#x27;t expect it to last more than a year or two.  </li>
            <li>It has noticeably turned my teeth back a few shades and with that I&#x27;m more stoked to use it.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush, but it stopped holding a charge after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li>It makes no ecological sense to design a toothbrush so that much more than the actual brush that needs to be replaced (unless that is the business model to make money).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this model to anybody who&#x27;s looking to really up their dental hygiene game and doesn&#x27;t want todrop a mint on the more lux models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush (my wife&#x27;s) was not even close to the quality of my Sonicare toothbrush, which was much more expensive (and worth the price).  </li>
            <li>I would have liked at least a second brush to have been included with this product.</li>
            <li>I left it in my apartment as I went on vacation for a few weeks and noticed on my return that it looked kind of gross</li>
            <li>I can tell with a few more uses it will only get</li>
            <li>Liked the toothbrush but the case is not great for packing and traveling.</li>
            <li>toothbrush does a good job where it fails is in its longevity.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was good but expensive, $130.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this toothbrush before this occurred, so please be wary of customers rating this before using it for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li>So unable to give a good review.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but the box it came in was plan and cheesy looking.</li>
            <li>Even if it fails right out of warranty, having super clean teeth would bring me back for another Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would give 5, but this thing is a royal mess to clean.</li>
            <li>My last one had &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; and made it easier to know when you had brushed each section of your teeth for the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Some other reviewers have said removing the head and rinsing it after every use is &#x27;no big deal&#x27;, but that doesn&#x27;t address the fact that the inside is a breeding ground for mold and bacteria, which could only be avoided, if at all, by making sure the inside &#x27;pocket&#x27; dries out completely after every use.  </li>
            <li>What I expected and priced right.</li>
            <li>i bought this four months ago and have only had to charge the battery once, and my teeth feel dentist clean every single time!</li>
            <li>These things do not seem to be real sanitary and are a bit hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Primarily went with this model for price and had several other replacement brushes I wanted to use</li>
            <li>This is really worth having and it is also cheaper than the ones that other stores offers.  </li>
            <li>I had one of the original Sonicares with the thick straight shaft</li>
            <li>Only thing I find bothersome is having to use a flat head screw driver just to open when needing to replace batteries other than that it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>However I noticed the brush was less effective - less power.</li>
            <li>Maybe my old one was just tired, but this unit seems to vibrate at a faster pace (my husband even commented on the higher pitch sound it makes).  </li>
            <li>I have a VERY small mouth, so I LOVE the size of the brush head...</li>
            <li>I chose this because he said it was what he used at home, and it was somewhat economical compared to the other options he mentioned.</li>
            <li>The price was right as I purchased a brand new one for the same price 2 brush replacements are nothing to loose.</li>
            <li>A previous Sonicare had a better, actually useful hard plastic carry case.  </li>
            <li>Lost when my last electric toothbrush died--thrilled with my new one!</li>
            <li>She got this one and said it was much better than the other, but the real plus to this is that she paid only half of what she paid for the old one, for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To bad, used to have a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>note the replacement heads are pretty pricey in general which adds to long term cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because while it does clean my teeth quite well, I&#x27;ve noticed on a few occasions that it has made my gums bleed.</li>
            <li>And a tip for owners, always unscrew your brush head and clean it out every few days,</li>
            <li>After just a few days of using this toothbrush, my teeth feel as clean as after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>This replaced a much older Sonicare that died after several years of intermittent use, and I find myself using this newer model</li>
            <li>At first I thought I should have bought the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>This is my first sonicare product, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>I am really disappointed that I have to pay more now for an item that I had already purchased but because of the seller&#x27;s mistake I wasn&#x27;t able to give it to my husband on Christmas.</li>
            <li>Really like this toothbrush, ordered it after the battery of my first Philips Sonicare stopped working after I had it quite a few years.</li>
            <li>The first one I owned had a battery issue where after several weeks it would not turn on as if it had a short.  </li>
            <li>Also, the brush heads themselves are more expensive than the ones for the slightly higher end models.</li>
            <li>I am sure I have never brushed for two minutes in the past.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush holds a charge long enough for me to make it home again with a still sparkling smile.</li>
            <li>This model does not have the different speeds that the older one had</li>
            <li>This one looks exactly the same but is programmed differently.  </li>
            <li>however it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second quadrant timer that the older elite model had.</li>
            <li>main thing I have heard is you need to still move the brush back and forth, and hold it at a 45 deg angle to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I won&#x27;t ever go back to a regular toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace an older model that had died, and wanted something simple, for a one-person household.  </li>
            <li>Also, this particular unit does not have the 30 second &amp;#34;quad timer.&amp;#34;  I ordered it not realizing that the timer was an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; feature.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, as my first one finally wore out after over 5 years of use.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version of Sonicare which finally went kaput!</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for an older version of the same toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This unit replaces one of my older ones that finally died.....</li>
            <li>I had been traveling a lot more often than usual and decided to pick up a second Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The sonic aspect is pretty startling at first, but you quickly get used to it.  </li>
            <li>This is second Sonicare toothbrush we purchased - first one, set of 2 purchased at Costco, lasted 4 years with daily use.  </li>
            <li>Overall, seems good value for money - it is hard to see what more an expensive model could provide.</li>
            <li>The manual says that the vibration stutters every thirty seconds so you will know when to move to the next part of mouth, 4 sides, upper left, upper right, lower right and lower left.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Weighing the difference between replacing just the handle and buying this new set I would have to say that the 2 year warranty, the new battery type (with matching charger) plus another brush head make the small difference in price well worth the money.</li>
            <li>You have to be constantly disassembling the device due to the mold that builds up inside and to clean it you need to submerge each component into clorox.  </li>
            <li>and the price was just right after looking on other sites.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good so far the brush seems a little hard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked high and low for the racing stripes on this thing but can&#x27;t seem to find any.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for personal use or as a gift.</li>
            <li>you invest in one, you will save time in the chair, your teeth will slowly become more white and you will really have the overall feeling of having a cleaner mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all I had to do was call them up and describe my problem, and they sent me a new one immediately, along with a prepaid label to ship the old one back.      </li>
            <li>only level of comfort was replacing my Philips with the new Philips and however, my old one did not have the Sonicare feature.</li>
            <li>Since I had recently purchased new brush heads for my old one I wanted a replacement that was compatible.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge like no other!</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is a design issue, but tooth paste seems to get into the handle a little more than the first generation ones did.</li>
            <li>There are so many models of these products that it is nearly impossible to become informed without this type of information available.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if the two minute timer is always accurate or maybe i am not paying attention.</li>
            <li>Shes only been using it for a short time but really likes it so far</li>
            <li>I really wanted a sonicare toothbrush for a long time.</li>
            <li>Works very well, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Have used Philips Sonicare in the past and really enjoy and appreciate the rotation and the way it cleans both teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>only negative thing is that they can get kind of gross under the brush head.</li>
            <li>If you really love it and later decide you would in fact use the extra features of the more expensive models, then upgrade!</li>
            <li>All of a sudden the toothbrush will hold a charge for more than a few days and the low charge warning feature had always been an issue.</li>
            <li>Within a week, my gums were back to normal again.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I expected and did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>The sound is loud, I wish that the rechargeable is universal so it can be carried on travelling to other countries where have different output.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not going back to a normal toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>i dont think i can ever go back to a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It came with a full charge, but the instructions said to charge it for a few days continuously which I did.</li>
            <li>Not hard to open.</li>
            <li>Charging is not hard, simply putting it into the slot and it charges.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t  have much time on your hands to stay and clean, is not a good choice for you</li>
            <li>I had a similar Sonicare for years and when this one arrived it worked fine for a few weeks....</li>
            <li>You can clean them off under running water and they look all clean, but if you start looking in all the nooks and crannies, they get crud growing up in the head and down in the handle, and even in the battery charger (which isn&#x27;t too hard to clean).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish i had spent a little more money and gotten one with the beep feature that tells you to change position.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is easy to use and I don&#x27;t brush too hard on my gums.</li>
            <li>because the battery on my original one would&#x27;t last two minutes anymore, it would die at about a minute and a half and switch off as soon as I pushed the button again.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare toothbrush, and this is a replacement for the one that my daughter bought me five years ago, after I had carpel-tunnel surgery, and was having a hard time maneuvering a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I live in Kentucky where most of the residents are missing one or more teeth due to poor dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>but it did have the 30-second beep reminder to get you to pace yourself while brushing, but that feature isn&#x27;t on this new basic model.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to buy another one that I couldn&#x27;t service with new battery in the future.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying a new charger I decided to change to an EasyClean 500 series for the following reasons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for years, recently had to replace it cause a new puppy decided to use it as a chew toy.</li>
            <li>This new version has a smaller head which I have yet to get used to.</li>
            <li>The new ones might have a slimmer grip, but this one is slim enough.</li>
            <li>They last forever, just get a new head every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my new Sonicare Essence 5600 for several months.</li>
            <li>the new brush-head from the regular toothbrush onto the electric toothbrush shaft.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be better because it is sonic, instead of rotating, but it vibrates your teeth so hard that it feels like they&#x27;re going to fall out!</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is very much like the other one we had about four years.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and it stays charged for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It does the same thing as the more expensive Sonicares, sans some features for more than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing to watch out for is to keep your mouth closed as much as possible or be prepared to clean your mirror</li>
            <li>This is my first review of any product here on amazon and although I have been a member for a long time I finally had to make a review on this product.</li>
            <li>Although this one works the same as the last Sonicare I had, it is much thicker in size.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t get it to go into gentle mode/ too intense for me, waste of money, it&#x27;s sitting in the cabinet unused.</li>
            <li>It indicates that it is charged but brushing is definitely less powerful.</li>
            <li>My last one lasted for at least 10 years maybe more</li>
            <li>For home use, I have the slimmer and more expensive model, but this works very well for after lunch teeth brushing.</li>
            <li>Makes navigating my mouth much easier, especially getting to those back teeth.  </li>
            <li>I received a finger nail infection from this product and will be taking further action with the manufacturer and Amazon to refund me completely.</li>
            <li>But $39 (what I paid) and now $45 (the current price) is all just too much for this very basic model.  </li>
            <li>I purchased several for the whole family and won&#x27;t be looking back again!</li>
            <li>This is my second sonicare, and I always like how much cleaner my teeth get from using a sonciare than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is awesome - I just wrap some blue tape around the base of the head to prevent the dreaded water seepage and gunk accumulation that others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>, this reasonably priced Sonicare does everything the more expensive models do.  </li>
            <li>And it is so thick that when it starts to slide out of my hand, i suddenly find that I&#x27;m gripping the vibrating end of the brush</li>
            <li>one is a little too flimsy, plus the head is not as large as the older models.</li>
            <li>It is quite powerful and can make a bit of a mess on your mirror until u learn to control it</li>
            <li>While I felt that this created a major opportunity for health problems, we did not experience anything</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, there is one major problem with this set which is why I gave it 3 stars rather than</li>
            <li>It cleans like no other product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing the other ones our family uses with the higher level model.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for over 2 months now and it is a major upgrade from the battery toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I thought that seemed a little better than what I have seen other places.  </li>
            <li>The size is a little bulky compared to the other models, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>Firstly, credit where it is due.  </li>
            <li>If you are elderly, disabled or a young child, this might not be the right choice for you.  </li>
            <li>best part is this model is less expensive than the other models Sonicare offers and</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums get so clean with very little work.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean with very little effort at all.</li>
            <li>item is actually an upgrade from my previous Sonicare which lasted a full 6.5 years.</li>
            <li>Like don&#x27;t know if there are any, but I am game to try it and think that it will be just fine!  </li>
            <li>I finally got tired of the whole experience &amp; went back to the Oral B Electric toothbrush which worked out better.</li>
            <li>(right after it cannot be returned) the motor went to about half its speed</li>
            <li>This model accepts the same style of toothbrush heads as my old model, so the package of new heads that I recently bought can still be used.</li>
            <li>But after reading other reviews, everyone said to take it apart once a week to clean it out and let it dry.  </li>
            <li>I have used disposable electric toothbrushes in the past which seem to clean as well and do not need cleaning except for a rinse.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted the super-clean, white teeth results, so I tried using it for a whole month and a half.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of those rich people that brushes their teeth everyday, you may or may not get the same results.</li>
            <li>Also, due to its fairly narrow head, I&#x27;m able to get to my wisdom teeth, which was always a challenge with the Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To compliment the new battery, the toothbrush also has a new feature that gradually increases the intensity of the sonic action to help acclimate you to using it, as it takes a little bit to get used to the sonic action.</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get use to it, because it tickles, but it is well worth it, just keep it up.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much as I tend to put too much pressure and brush too hard.</li>
            <li>Only thing is my husband has one - different model and it has turning brush inside the main brush and this model does not.</li>
            <li>In a last ditch effort to stave off the process, I did extensive research online and particularly here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Strange noise, a high &amp;#34;dentist drill&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The other develops a gross black mold inside the top of the handle where it meets the brush head.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s just electric toothbrushes in general...</li>
            <li>To save on frequency of teeth cleaning and general visits to the dentist, I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I scroll through the comments and try to get a general census of what individuals thought about the product.</li>
            <li>I lost that brush a long time ago, and so when I heard they had a basic version for MUCH cheaper</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clearly cleaner than using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for so long that I really don&#x27;t need the 30 second reminders to know when to move on to another section of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how loud the unit is when on, but that is a minor distraction.  </li>
            <li>My old toothbrush lasted ten years</li>
            <li>I believe the old model was also the basic entry-level</li>
            <li>My old one had the quadrapacer (30 second interval timer)</li>
            <li>The only downside is that this unit doesn&#x27;t give you a notice every 30 seconds like the old one did.  </li>
            <li>my old one finally bit the dust after about 10 years.</li>
            <li>Had to replace my last Sonicare, and this one works just like the old one.</li>
            <li>Does not have the 30 second signal like my old one</li>
            <li>Looking to contact Philips for a replacement being that it&#x27;s only 9 months old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast and rough that it hurts her gums.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve recently had to retire my old brush.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this cleans better than a regular toothbrush however, and have heard mixed reviews from different dentists...</li>
            <li>The only issue that I have is that it is extremely loud.</li>
            <li>fMy old one had the 30 second beep feature</li>
            <li>It uses the same brush heads as the old one.</li>
            <li>Watching a clock for the whole time is a drag.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this back in the early &#x27;90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The only problem that I have with this electric toothbrush is that it is to loud</li>
            <li>the further I got away from my bi-annual cleanings I developed stains.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush head is so tiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>my 12 year old Philips finally bit the dust and wouldn&#x27;t charge any longer.</li>
            <li>I miss my old one that had a 30 second notification.</li>
            <li>The old one finally died.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t enthused since my only experience with an electric toothbrush was the old 1960s version.  </li>
            <li>I only get about 2-3 days out of my old Sonciare now.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really need the 30 sec warnings</li>
            <li>I guess it finally died of old age.</li>
            <li>and charge last four complete days and still had charge on return home.</li>
            <li>and so far haven&#x27;t had to charge it for the last three weeks.</li>
            <li>but I miss the 30 second timer that the old models had</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare toothbrush finally died after about 12 years of use.  </li>
            <li>I would hope in the future Phillips makes it easier to change out old batteries.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my teeth/gums are sensitive, as I floss almost daily without bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>This is my second sonic toothbrush and I felt the need to replace the old one when it cease recharging.</li>
            <li>My old one finally quit working after 15 years of use.</li>
            <li>My last trip to the hygienist got a surprised reaction and no scaling from them.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare finally bit the dust (I&#x27;m not complaining -</li>
            <li>This was a replacement as my old sonic care &amp;#34;bit the dust&amp;#34; after several years.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace my current Sonicare that is 5 or 6 years old.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is loud, buzzes your brains, and splashes everywhere if you brush with your mouth open.  </li>
            <li>I had extra old heads</li>
            <li>Have gone 10 days using twice daily without charging so far.</li>
            <li>My old one finally died and this was a replacement.</li>
            <li>Back to trustworthy old toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I uses the same heads and charges even faster than the old one.</li>
            <li>This problem is so prevalent in these toothbrushes that a third party manufacturer has developed a product to remedy the issue.  </li>
            <li>It served me well, and the battery lasted 7 years, much longer than I had expected.</li>
            <li>The only downside would be the build up of old toothpaste/water/spit that ends up in the area where the brush and charger connect.</li>
            <li>If anyone complains of the noise, it&#x27;s only loud to the user.</li>
            <li>I stand next to my husband while he is brushing his teeth and its not that loud.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how terrific my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee drinker and lately I had been observing more than usual yellowness on my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is similar to my old one but my old one was a step above this model.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t place this box anywhere near my personal belonging.</li>
            <li>am so used to the time it takes to complete a thorough brushing of the teeth that I don&#x27;t have to be prompted when to move to the next quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much money I spent on a toothbrush that I just ended up throwing away after 2 months.</li>
            <li>My old one just stopped one day, perhaps I&#x27;ll try another brand the next time.</li>
            <li>Since my 15 year old pre-philips Sonicare toothbrush finally died I had to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased, I thought it was the same as my old</li>
            <li>This replaced a ten-year old Sonicare that finally died.  </li>
            <li>The action is different so cannot judge myself.  </li>
            <li>I got the same one because the old one had served me well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on giving this one to a relative and purchasing another model off ebay since I am not happy with the manufacturer for this and don&#x27;t want to give them the satisfaction of buying a better model direct.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe Ive used a normal toothbrush for so long.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush heads are kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li>had better,  had worse. ..</li>
            <li>Just doing an effective vibration and started behaving like a drunk hula hooper might.</li>
            <li>Head replacement is kind of expensive</li>
            <li>At Costco, Walmart or bed bath and beyond,  there not cheap but there worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical to buy this since I already had own one before.</li>
            <li>that is lacks the timer that will let you know when it is time to shift the brush around (30 sec here, 30 sec there, etc) to get the full experience.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if Philips would figure out a way to prevent this; it seems to me to be a trait of questionable hygienics.  </li>
            <li>The brush is large without being uncomfortable and the vibration is not to strong to hurt the gums.</li>
            <li>Way better than my previous Oral-B. Replacement heads can be a little pricey.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more on one that doesn&#x27;t get black mold growing in it within weeks.  </li>
            <li>The packaging could have been done a little better and less industrial.</li>
            <li>My dental costs went down after I first started using this product years ago.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had tears streaming down my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I actually hate that I don&#x27;t have a little pocket one to bring to work because my teeth feel so clean in the morning that I want that great feeling after lunch...</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, cleans amazingly well, but the toothbrush is expensive, and the heads are expensive and unwieldy (seriously, you have to buy the whole screw-on part?).</li>
            <li>This one works great and is much much less expensive.</li>
            <li>This is the less expensive version but It preforms great.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, although the price is a little bit high.</li>
            <li>Free 2 day shipping and unbelievable pricing on almost every item they sell!</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that before I brushed with this toothbrush my mouth felt down right fuzzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After spending a long time chatting with Philips and answering questions and given instructions not to put the unit in a dishwasher they agreed to ship me a new handle.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice 2 minute shut off feature that let&#x27;s you know that you&#x27;ve brushed enough... for some that would like to continue to brush, press that little green circle and brush on...</li>
            <li>I had previously owned a Sonicare and was well aware of the excellence of this product.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing my hand in soap and and hot water for half an hour I&#x27;m here to report that I just threw the thing away and will be purchasing another electric toothbrush that won&#x27;t end up killing me through mold grown inside of it.</li>
            <li>Bought first one on Amazon and it broke in less than a month.</li>
            <li>I got it sooner than expected, and it has given me no trouble so far!</li>
            <li>Not sure what the other&#x27;s offer for so much more money</li>
            <li>price is much more affordable compared to the other size I have purchased in the past..</li>
            <li>bY the way it was quick shipping as usual by amazon.</li>
            <li>No problems with cleaning or charging or anything yet, though the heads to wear out quickly if you apply even a small amount of pressure (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway).</li>
            <li>The buzz is a little hard to get used to, but the 2 minute timer is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>My last one finally quit so I ordered a new one, It works as expected, hope it lasts as long as my first one</li>
            <li>Long battery life and cleans as well as my older larger Philips model.</li>
            <li>It allows saliva and toothpaste to slip into a large empty space just above the magnets that cause the brush head to rotate.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>other thing I really like about this toothbrush is the quality of the enclosure.  </li>
            <li>(pro tip!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried about gum and teeth sensitivity due to how fast these things go.</li>
            <li>This unit is hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is very thorough in teeth care; I wouldn&#x27;t have any other brand.</li>
            <li>Only con the brushes are expensive, otherwise I like it better than a normal brush</li>
            <li>It vibrates and cleans just as good as the units that are 5x as expensive!</li>
            <li>I choose it because if its high ratings and past positive experience with Sonicare, but it doesn&#x27;t work properly as the timer doesn&#x27;t function.  </li>
            <li>You have to clean it out at least once a week.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only complaint, primarily that you cannot just replace the brush part.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I clean and dry the handle, by morning the charging stand is stained green.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a different model for about 5 years and it finally died, but it makes me think this one was a refurbished model, so steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li>Always clean and remove the head as this head type allows a small amount of fluid to get into the unit, and if not careful it will rust internally prematurely.  </li>
            <li>After my Oral B toothbrush finally gave up, I went back to the old manual brushes for a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not comfortable to use because of how loud it is and fast vibration it has.</li>
            <li>You will be much happier and will consider the extra $25 well spent.</li>
            <li>Next time I will research one or two models above this to get the timer function my old one had.</li>
            <li>After five years using my old Sonicare toothbrush of the same model, it would only hold a charge for 15 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li>I got this toothbrush to replace my old brush that finally gave out after 5 years daily use.</li>
            <li>When it finally died completely I sawed it open to remove the batteries and found that they were 1-1/2 volt NiCads (2 nickel cadmium batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I owned a Philips Sonicare prior to this one, and my old one had the timer that beeped in 30-second increments so you could switch to a different part of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>The irony is, the toothbrush that this one was to replace became incredibly loud (and only started doing that in the last week of it&#x27;s 2 year life), and that&#x27;s why I was replacing it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare toothbrush for about 9 years, I&#x27;ve always believed that my consistent use has prevented a lot of cavities--especially since I&#x27;m a pretty poor flosser.</li>
            <li>I had the older model that has the 30 sec warnings.</li>
            <li>This is particularly irritating to me, since I work abroad regularly and would like to be able to use my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for approximately seven years until it slowly died, sometimes stopping short of its two-minute clean, sometimes not even able to start it at all.</li>
            <li>and there was a capability of vibration strength, but for me personally I found it unnecessary and like this one better.</li>
            <li>the buzzing noise it makes is a little louder than my first Sonicare</li>
            <li>Takes a little while to get used to it (tickles at first), but it&#x27;s kind-of like going to the dentist but without the exclamations, &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and it takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li>My previous one also beeped every 30 seconds so the full two minute cycle was evenly divided:: lower inside, lower outside, upper inside, upper outside.</li>
            <li>This new on for the price is just great, gets less dirty inside due to new design</li>
            <li>the brushes last pretty long and the batteries on this last really long.</li>
            <li>it tightens my gums and I never have any bleeding when brushing my teeth and even teeth that felt loose are tight again due to the healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>Only downfall I can think of is that you must clean between the handle and brush head frequently, if not it gets a bit grimy and filmy inside after a few brushes.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this particular model is that it does not have the 30 second timer that lets you know how long to brush each of the 4 sections of your teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too hard now that it has reached full capacity.  </li>
            <li>Took some time to get use from it, generally sprayed the mirrors for the first several weeks but have it somewhat down pat now, eventually I will learn how to wipe it off properly so as not to have it stick to the charger, but that&#x27;s for another day</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one because the battery would no longer recharge long enough.  </li>
            <li>I have to take the brush off every other week and clean out the well where toothpaste has dripped down the shaft</li>
            <li>Once you start using them you will notice how much cleaner your mouth feels compared to a conventional brush.</li>
            <li>, I feel like my teeth get much much cleaner than with a conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>That is from the black mold draining out of a small port on the side at the top of the brush</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the rechargeable battery cannot be replaced when it gets old, so you have to buy a whole new brush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth never felt so clean and no more changing batteries!</li>
            <li>He loves it, his old one, our hand me down with a new brush of course, stopped working</li>
            <li>I generally like using the Sonicare, but I sometimes use this once a day and my regular, manual toothbrush once or twice.  </li>
            <li>It was much cheaper on Amazon than in Target or other local</li>
            <li>And unlike other modern electronics, this unit&#x27;s input voltage is not international.</li>
            <li>A reasonable price for the same level of oral care compared to other models.  </li>
            <li>it was the same thing other than the packaging much simpler.</li>
            <li>I have been using these, &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34; for a while and my teeth are so much cleaner than if I used any other regular motor brush.</li>
            <li>Two complaints: one is something that others have mentioned a lot - the way icky stuff builds up under the toothbrush head and smells; and the other is that it&#x27;s not terribly durable.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling tingly and clean in all hard to reach areas including the back of the tongue.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m just rating this 3 stars due to the fact that it collects saliva and water inside, it gets really gross really fast.</li>
            <li>then our old one I wish I would have purchased long ago.</li>
            <li>The only thing different is the old one had 30 second sounds adding up to 2 minutes, but I got accustomed to this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no excuse for any sellers to not deliver the advertised products when paid for.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, I will stop back in five months after my next dentist appointment to edit my review as far as health improvement and product durability.  </li>
            <li>Since using it and doing my daily flossing, I have only had my teeth professionally cleaned 3 times in the last 9 years.  </li>
            <li>The old one still worked but the battery pack did not hold charge over a long term any more.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I had given him the Sonicare product several years ago and the battery apparently gave out.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was just dead batteries at first, so I replaced them.  </li>
            <li>I had one a few years ago and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed it!</li>
            <li>They last for a few months but then end up losing their charge, and stop vibrating the brush thistles as much as is necessary to be useful.</li>
            <li>After the first few uses you no longer even notice it at all.</li>
            <li>a pretty carrying case, I can take it with me everyday when i am in travel.</li>
            <li>My first one died and I did without for a few weeks..</li>
            <li>the brush portion does not fit this new sonic are, comes with one new brush</li>
            <li>This version has a large knob at the bottom of the brush refill which is half of the motor assembly.  </li>
            <li>Particularly because it can&#x27;t possibly cost Phillips a penny to include it - they are are doing it arbitrarily to create an upmodel where none need exist.</li>
            <li>really has come down from where they were originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only drawback is when you first use it, it does tickle a little bit, but that goes away quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare, I guess I am a little biased towards Oral Care as that is the toothbrush I&#x27;ve had the last 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>The Phillips sonicare is far too hard on teeth; the gentle setting (which you can program to use) is fine, but the brush seems to keep switching back to the regular setting, which is way too hard and feels like I have a jackhammer in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The new design also has rubber strips on the side for control when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li>I also floss although you don&#x27;t need to as much due to the high performance of Sonicare products.</li>
            <li>After using it about a month I really feel that this brush gets my teeth cleaner than my old tooth brush which was motorized but was of the 10-20 dollar variety, not exactly top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for this but was disappointed with packaging, especially since it was a Christmas gift!.  </li>
            <li>and I think that it really makes a difference in dental care, but now it has less power.</li>
            <li>Much improved over previous versions...</li>
            <li>does not seem to be as much a quality product as previous versions.</li>
            <li>It really makes brushing my teeth less of a chore.  </li>
            <li>Much easier then manual brushing and seemingly less &amp;#34;mechanical&amp;#34</li>
            <li>We both like how well the product works, but we&#x27;re very reluctant to buy this again with an issue like this presenting itself less than a month after purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>I went to the dentist regularly and brushed like they said, but apparently I wasn&#x27;t brushing that well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing that has surprised me is how long the batteries last.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, it was noticible because the next time I visit my doc noticed the difference and asked me what was I doing differently because she noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>As for age, I have two that are over 6 years old, I think, but the newer ones do not last as long...</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the one I&#x27;d had for a long time, the old one simply stopped working.  </li>
            <li>After telling them repeatedly this is not my first time at the rodeo and giving them my last chat session or case number, then they would concede to no troubleshooting (five minutes waste of time).</li>
            <li>In other to avoid sticky messy goo on the inside, I take it apart and thoroughly clean it after each use.  </li>
            <li>It is a little large for her hand.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a film on teeth after first use and can be painful if the top of the brush hits your upper teeth.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the same model, but discovered too late that it is not; while our old model beeped every 30 seconds to remind you to move the toothbrush, this one does not; for consistent brushing, you need to keep an eye on the clock.</li>
            <li>It has completely corrected my gum problems and kept me from any cavaties or other major dental work since I started using it.</li>
            <li>The product made some beeping noises upon starting up the first few times I brushed and then never was heard from again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because I used to have a sonic toothbrush from a different company that was far superior to this one</li>
            <li>I have an earlier model, and the tooth brush refills were much cheaper and less intrusive to the environment.  </li>
            <li>Delighted to see Sonicare #3 will be significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found them to be considerably  less expensive than the newer models yet in my opinion they do just as good a job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the elongated, narrow brush head, which is similar to that of a standard toothbrush as opposed to the Braun&#x27;s small rounded brush.  </li>
            <li>bigger and noiser than new ones, expected quiter smaller and two heads.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>the brand and type were &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34; by my dentist in-law and while using it the first few times was very strange, that&#x27;s just electric toothbrushes in general...</li>
            <li>I have used this now for several months and my teeth are much cleaner feeling and longer lasting freshness than using a typical toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have used their products previously and bought this one as a replacement for an old one that died after nearly five years of daily no problem service.  </li>
            <li>Other Sonicare products performed very well, and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is very noisy and does not clean well.</li>
            <li>so it is truly I fine product, but alas I cannot use it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>main feature I really like about this particular model is completely ascetic.</li>
            <li>This little baby is charged up and ready to &amp;#34;get</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to if you never used a Sonicare before, but cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>The new user is not aware of this and before you know it you have manufactured a breeding ground for bacteria.</li>
            <li>This product is kind of hard to use, it brushes too hard and sometimes hurts my teeth, I have stop using it now and won&#x27;t buy it anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other cheap ones in the past and didn&#x27;t really think that a Sonicare was worth spending the additional money on, but I admit now I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>I finally gave in and looked up a new electric toothbrush to purchase, after all, who can go back to a plain old regular toothbrush after using an electric one?</li>
            <li>read a few comments where people were complaining that this model brush did not feature the &amp;#34;30 second beep&amp;#34; interval, but a very simple way to counter that is just to use your smart phone as the timer.</li>
            <li>I switched back to my old toothbrush because every time I was done with this teeny little brush, my mouth felt like it could be cleaner by using my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;&#x27;ve learned to put my finger (gently) on the stem to keep some of the vibration down!  </li>
            <li>Have used it for years, and in this day and age of possible HIGH dentals costs, this product does its part to keep tarter build up down and also keeps teeth brighter</li>
            <li>I usually take normal toothbrushes with me whenever I go on vacation, and after coming home and using this toothbrush again, it&#x27;s so clear</li>

            <li> Good Deal</li>
            <li> I think the toothbrush works really good</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to explain how good this product works.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonocare has a good reputation and had the components I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> the price is fair</li>
            <li> This is one good toothbrush .</li>
            <li> The price on this for a Sonicare was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased one before and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good quality as well.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are in good condition because I have been using Sonicare for years.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.  </li>
            <li> It does as good a job with my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is an incredible value at $39.99, as this model used to be more like $100.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare is a product that works well and keeps the teeth and gums in good condition.  </li>
            <li> You do not get the impression that it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> it actually a good feature but</li>
            <li> our dentist always has good reports for us too.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the the that died.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good product for this price.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare makes good products to meet the consumers budget.</li>
            <li> I picked up this edition because of the price and the decently good reviews.</li>
            <li> This brand is good, just not the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 1 and 1/2 years- still working good.</li>
            <li> We have had these before and loved them.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> so i bought this one for a really good promotional price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> you feel good</li>
            <li> Massages gums and does a good job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> When I found this one I wondered if it would be as good.  </li>
            <li> When I went to my dentist for my checkups, he told me, &amp;#34;you have good hygiene&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> You can get a good deal on replacement brush heads at Costco.</li>
            <li> HX5610/30 Essence 5600 is a superior way to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> A good product, we have been using them for years,</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li> It also has a fairly durable carrying bag for travel!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I loved it then because of how well it cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> and I loved that I saved an additional $10 on coupon/deal offered.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing as good of a job.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> So that is good.</li>
            <li> Also good buy</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> .. Holds charge good..</li>

            <li> Wife loved the one I bought for her</li>
            <li> Mine lasted a good 6 years.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li> Everyone loved them.</li>
            <li> I guess it was just good timing.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for one week, good but need a power converter for 220v.</li>
            <li> I loved the price as well.</li>
            <li> I think it works just as good as the 200+ one.</li>
            <li> replacement,&lt;br /&gt;good toothbrush, does the job, good price, comes with case and charger</li>
            <li> This is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> this sonicare good?  </li>
            <li> I had an Oral B electric brush before, and I thought it was a good brush, and must be just as good as these Sonicare brushes, but now I know that I was just kidding myself.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> price with good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it for my mom and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> I have had good dental check-ups since using Sonicare, which I started about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> If you want a good dental report from your dental hygienist buy this brush.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO ANYONE THAT WANTED A GOOD TOOTH BRUSH WITH A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> because you can&#x27;t glob it on, this is a good thing, trust me) and go to town, when you&#x27;re done - it beeps and turns off.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, all good.</li>
            <li> and I was thanked about a hundred times because they just loved it.</li>
            <li> I got a good price on this from Amazon</li>
            <li> A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I have one and just sent another to a good friend, who is also delighted.  </li>
            <li> If  you have used one then you know how good it is.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> I have a good sense of humor.</li>
            <li> Have used it for over six months and the brush head is still good.</li>
            <li> It works great on my teeth and the travel case will be handy on trips.</li>
            <li> Ya this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if it was good or not</li>
            <li> Always loved sonicare...</li>
            <li> Good price...great shipping</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist, and for good reasons.</li>
            <li> If this is not an important feature for you, this brush is awesome!</li>
            <li> Cheap and awesome.</li>
            <li> works good</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job</li>
            <li> A good choice for the price.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare makes a good product, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Good buy and good product.</li>
            <li> As advertised good product cleans my teeth well but does not have the beep function.</li>
            <li> but it was on a really good deal and Phillips Sonicare is a recommended brand by my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I really loved that toothbrush, but my wife convinced me to switch to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for your gums.</li>
            <li> to find a good electric toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;M.J.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is good</li>
            <li> A good choice.</li>
            <li> good regharging capacity and good speed.</li>
            <li> In the end I would give it a good rating.  </li>
            <li> it is a fair product for this price.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this was a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave these as gifts to encourage good dental hygiene, brushes work&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good head size.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable feature of this toothbrush makes it really good.</li>
            <li> Cleans good</li>
            <li> Oh.. and I had an Oral B (also good)</li>
            <li> good price, works well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t leave all that plaque on my teeth and this one does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product.</li>
            <li> and I got it at a good price.</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> I have good checkups.</li>
            <li> this feels good, this toothbrush is a steal.</li>
            <li> My daughter said she loved this tooth brush and so did her Dentist.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality.</li>
            <li> It still does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use this electric toothbrush twice a day for good oral &amp; dental health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush</li>
            <li> Good entry level electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Good product for the price point.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should have an electric toothbrush for superior dental care.  </li>
            <li> Good product, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it and it feels good.</li>
            <li> I  bought one 10 years ago and  loved it....</li>
            <li> not as good as the rotating brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good performer.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well and is a good value.  </li>
            <li> Leaves me with good test in my mouth.</li>
            <li> You can see by the number of reviews for this toothbrush, that this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> We really love these electric brushes they do a great job and the timer is very handy.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my sonicare toothbrush that stopped working (it was the original model from years and years ago.)</li>
            <li> We expect this one to be every bit as excellent as the original one.  </li>
            <li> So, in the end it is a great deal to purchase one of these, as you will save some money on Toothbrushes as well as have a great feeling clean mouth!</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush was awesome, my teeth felt so clean</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean and this feels so wonderful on my gums that I have no problem brushing for the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Perfect clean feeling, however the toothpaste and saliva tend to cake about the power button where the brush-head attaches.</li>
            <li> and I especially love the clean feeling I get after using it.</li>
            <li> The spinning of the toothbrush head is perfect to effectively clean your teeth and remove anything.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush for keeping my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> This is the best way to clean my teeth, at home, that I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he has special needs, the staff said it is great!</li>
            <li> so I could easily return if/when it broke!!</li>
            <li> but i didnt charge it for 14 days and it was still going strong!!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is beautifully and elegantly designed.  </li>
            <li> the best of any brush I have ever had, and the price is not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> and I was super impressed with quality in which it cleans.</li>

            <li> The 2 minute brush timer is also perfect to make sure you clean for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> These sonic brushes clean your teeth wonderfully while keeping your gums healthy and preventing gum damage by brushing.</li>
            <li> very good product as good as the higher priced one</li>
            <li> Great for gum health; the 2 minute timer encourages you to brush for the full amount of time - no cheating here!</li>
            <li> Great tool to make sure your teeth are in great shape and clean.</li>
            <li> Works great but not as easy to find replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> It buzzes in your mouth quite strongly and seems to get the job done great.  </li>
            <li> This device makes teeth cleaning easy and does a great job (just talk to my dental hygienist).  </li>
            <li> The number of cavities greatly diminished when I started using this brush, my teeth feel clean and nice and the hygienist always tells me I have good home</li>
            <li> Works great and is perfectly easy to use.</li>
            <li> I will never use another kind unless they make this one even better!  </li>
            <li> We just needed an easy to pack toothbrush for our trips and this one fit the bill perfectly for us.</li>
            <li> The gum massage is very important to assure good gums after periodontal surgery.</li>
            <li> Great product, packaged well, and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this toothbrush, very happy with this purchase</li>

            <li> This toothbrush works amazing</li>
            <li> There was a free extended warranty for registering on-line, so this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> Changed from a cheap battery operated toothbrush and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> the price here on amazon is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush without all the bells and whistles, just one that did a great job and was comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Amazing toothbrush, and you can&#x27;t argue with the price.</li>
            <li> These sonicare toothbrush are great with their vibration but the brush head are really cheap.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I credit this brush with that amazing feat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing to me the difference between the two, and that&#x27;s why I wanted to share my story and give a review on this.</li>
            <li> The brush would not spin well on its own.</li>
            <li> and it operates effectively.</li>
            <li> Awesome ultrasonic tooth hygiene at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Nice travel case .easy</li>
            <li> Nice slim profile not cluttering the counter.  </li>
            <li> so use your own judgment.</li>
            <li> Even my dental exams are awesome thanks to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is kind of the bottom of the line toothbrush for Philips sonicare</li>
            <li> (The kind that just rotates is circles.)  </li>
            <li> his teeth are much brighter and he says it&#x27;s the best gift I ever gave him!</li>
            <li> The manual brush really isn&#x27;t as effective though, so I bought the Sonicare unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof which is nice</li>
            <li> Nice item, works well and holds a charge</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re using this kind of toothbrush, it requires yet another technique.  </li>
            <li> This brush cleans your teeth just a effectively.</li>
            <li> I liked the featured on the Oral B that buzzed every 30 seconds to let you know when to change quadrants when brushing and</li>
            <li> Carrying case is handy.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have the quadrant timer that pulses every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Everything is nice with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li> We love it and get good check ups since we have been using it.</li>
            <li> and I liked that.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and the carrying case is a perfect size for packing and taking on trips.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> As advertised, fast shipping, VERY pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works really nicely,  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say, it almost doesn&#x27;t even hurt anymore...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The brand stands on its own.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, I charged the device for 12 hours to make sure it had a good charge.</li>
            <li> It is nice</li>
            <li> Kind of Ok&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li> Since we have started using it we have experienced a much cleaner feel and have been receiving great comments from out dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- case is nice to keep everything together&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles and this was the best option for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> though - everything seem is included, but it came in a brown cardboard box instead of the nice packaging in the stores.  </li>
            <li> My husband can travel for a wk w/o taking the charger which is nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the Awesome Price Amazon!</li>
            <li> has it all, and the travel case is nice.</li>
            <li> It was a nice feature to have.</li>
            <li> Gums get a nice workout too.</li>
            <li> I have avoided paying the money for a Sonicare toothbrush, because I thought my re-chargeable Oral B with the spinning head on it had to be just as effective.  </li>
            <li> but it was really nice to know that you had evenly covered brushing all of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I can figure that out on my own....</li>
            <li> It is effective and convenient for use.</li>
            <li> Travel case is nice to have.</li>
            <li> I move around a lot so its nice to have.</li>
            <li> It keeps me honest.</li>
            <li> , Looks nice.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked a way to not have water  leak into bottom of brush from where it meets the removable brush head.</li>
            <li> Came with a nice travel case.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s effectively on the cleanness and freshness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Kind of reluctant for use</li>
            <li> Nice to get away from batteries.</li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer is nice, because I don&#x27;t have too be conscience of brushing time.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does the job and comes with a handy travel case.</li>
            <li> Effective for cleaning.</li>
            <li> and I liked the idea of the travel case that it came with.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t just an electric toothbrush, it&#x27;s in a league of its own.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should own AND use an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It did not come in a nice box like at the store, though.</li>
            <li> NICE HANDLING ALSO</li>
            <li> Just loving it.</li>
            <li> We have used our own Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable electric battery is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It honestly feels like a massage for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> A family can buy one unit and each use his or her own brush head, but we like the convenience of having our own separate units so we don&#x27;t have to keep changing heads.</li>
            <li> I sometimes, ok most of the time, I wait longer than I should to visit the dentist but still have great check-ups.</li>
            <li> i really love this tooth brush and the price was good</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get a nice electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> good job for the money ended up getting deal and coupon love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> this may be a nice christmas gift as well.</li>
            <li> I take mine apart every time I use it and rinse both parts with warm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a morning person &amp; it kind of takes me by surprise ~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too noob for this kind of power</li>
            <li> so loving it.and will recommand to friends.&lt;br /&gt;feeling</li>
            <li> and I liked.  </li>
            <li> WE love our Sonicare toothbrushes and ordered this one thru Amazon as the price was good.  </li>
            <li> The carry case is nice if you are vacation or our for a night or two.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t own anything else.</li>
            <li> The 30-second timer is a nice feature</li>
            <li> is a handy addition.  </li>
            <li> Nice price and works well.</li>
            <li> It is a nice weight and cleans well.</li>
            <li> The dentist insisted that I use this and it has resulted in better check ups and good plaque control.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and in perfect working order</li>
            <li> This model automatically shuts off after two minutes of use, which is nice; however, I wish it beeped every 30 seconds or so to let you know when to switch quadrants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WHat kind of Product it is ???</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and the receiver was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I used (and really liked)</li>
            <li> well I had many Philips products and this is good also.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 2 minute times that pauses every 30 seconds is handy.</li>
            <li> Brushes very well and battery is great!</li>
            <li> It is a great workout for your gums as well as the best overall tooth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I like that it has its own bag to store to keep it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into this kind of oral dental care this brush can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> It could be better than or as good as the Braun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a store bought battery operated toothbrush for some time, the $10 kind .</li>
            <li> It tends to ooze some kind of gooey substance when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m loving the Sonicare tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> This is just my honest opinion, no games, no gimmicks, no tricks.</li>
            <li> I will always own and use a sonicare toothbrush .&lt;br /&gt;telmail</li>
            <li> This was a very affordable electric toothbrush and the price was excellent compared to brick and mortar pricing.  </li>
            <li> Nice ability to split apart for travel, which I have used twice.  </li>
            <li> Got this one for my boyfriend &amp; I already have one of my own.  </li>
            <li> it was a nice feature.</li>
            <li> It has excellent battery life and cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li> but I still am enjoying it and feel that it is good value for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> and so I wanted her to make sure she took good care of her teeth.</li>
            <li> This one is probably superior to most.</li>
            <li> The case is a nice added touch.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, but prefer a more deluxe model</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice travel pack too.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, works perfect!!</li>
            <li> Stores nicely in its dock.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and an excellent value for a reliable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it is just as good:)</li>
            <li> This model does not do this, it does not stop on its own when the 2min are up either.</li>
            <li> Nice grip.</li>
            <li> and a nice guy told me how to bypass that 14-day slow-vibration situation.  </li>

            <li> she tells me I am doing something right, because my gums and teeth are healthy and  look great!!</li>

            <li> This was the best price i found on this, after much research--It works great, and is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> It clean my teeth so good and my checks ups come out so good and not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> The best way to clean teeth and save huge amounts of money at the dentist.........easy to use, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without a Sonicare................</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my original, and for the price it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my original Sonicare</li>
            <li> Had the original model Sonicare for about 10 years and it always did a great job.  </li>
            <li> happy with the original</li>
            <li> Great price, great item, highly suggest.</li>

            <li> awesome ... clean ... sparkly .. smooth feeling in my mouth these days - but the vibration takes some getting used to ... :)</li>
            <li> The power of this sonicare HX5610/30  is great, I feel it really does a good job.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it makes the teeth and gums feel good.</li>
            <li> Works great, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I chose this product for her -- she really does love it.</li>
            <li> Great Price, product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Very easy to use - I like the travel case.  </li>
            <li> Buying the heads r also very easy.</li>
            <li> The vibration is very strong and takes a couple of days to get used to.</li>
            <li> The plug in charge lasts for days and is still very strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very Easy to setup and learn to use.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to handle</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the plaque between the teeth and gums very easily at all.</li>
            <li> That packaging was a pleasure, and recycled very easily.  </li>
            <li> If he&#x27;s pleased, I&#x27;m pleased!  </li>
            <li> Love this Sonicare, use it twice a day and a much better price than in the store!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace it and love it more!</li>
            <li> Loved it so much ordered 4 more for everyone else in my family!!</li>
            <li> it is probably fine and even a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good, fine, neato and well done.</li>
            <li> This one was more than adequate: fit our needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy and the vibration on my top teeth and gums took a bit of getting used to, but my teeth are incredibly clean, great value</li>
            <li> love how these toothbrushes make my teeth and gums clean, and I have been getting great reports from the dentist ever since I switched to them.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants to combat plaque and dental disease with a very good cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> so I think the newer ones are therefore more effective.</li>
            <li> Many people complain and rate it four stars because it does not beep after 30 seconds or have some kind of quarter minute timer.</li>
            <li> However, that is okay with us when it produces these kind of results.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, great product, well worth the money for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this model after retiring a more deluxe version of a Sonicare toothbrush that I had been using for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> So far they work great!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love and HAD to get my own.</li>
            <li> but not as nice as the better model(s)</li>
            <li> The price here at Amazon is by far the best price I could find -- even with a 20% off coupon for Bed, Bath and Beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far it works great!!</li>
            <li> far as function, it works great!</li>
            <li> I can brush my teeth much more effectively and efficiently with this brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is an excellent replacement for the old Sonicare with the dying battery.</li>
            <li> Nice brush better than Braun.</li>
            <li> travel kit was a nice touch that I enjoyed using whenever I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> may find it suitable to their oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> This is a soft rotation which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old one, its not as deluxe but does a good job, I am happy.</li>
            <li> Amazon by far made the best prices.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get caught up in the trendy BS just to spend more money.</li>
            <li> I have the newer style sonicare and love the way my teeth feel when I get done brushing, so he asked me if I liked it and</li>
            <li> IT  IS GREAT WITH THE BUILT IN TIMER AND RARELY NEEDS TO BE CHARGED.</li>
            <li> I spend more time brushing of my own choice.</li>
            <li> just read the instructions for most effective use.  </li>
            <li> Her grandfather has also been using his Sonicare for over 10 years with great success.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so far awesome!  </li>
            <li> says its the best one he has had so far</li>
            <li> Most amazing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> feels great when I brush, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it had more power.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush might be great for a lot of people, but it wasn&#x27;t the right toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great toothbrush the price is right and replacement brushes are affordable.</li>
            <li> It is great for children as well as adults and the price is right on</li>
            <li> Works great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to travel with...with no charger!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate (even though it still tickles!)</li>
            <li> It topples over too easily!  </li>
            <li> and it was delivered very quickly!</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel very clean after using and the two minute timer is a nice perk.</li>
            <li> This is as good as the original product I replaced with the newer model.</li>
            <li> Good quality, simple to handle and very good cleaning results.</li>
            <li> My teeth now look and feel clean, and my gums feel good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product that helps you keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good price &amp; makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> &amp; I feel that it does do a good job in keeping me teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush with great action.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy that my dentist is an honest person who will recommend solutions to me not based on personal gain, but on quality.</li>
            <li> great price and is just as good as my old one</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended and although I was using another brand electric this is really good and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth and gums feel good and clean..  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush is good size, brushes well and leaves mouth and teeth feeling clean like coming from dentist office.</li>
            <li> A Q-tip is a good way to reach inside to clean it if needed.</li>
            <li> My son has been asking me for ages to purchase this for him, and so far so good, it has been working great</li>
            <li> Works great and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it turns off automatically after two minutes of brushing, telling you the optimal time for a good clean.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush makes ya feel clean</li>
            <li> It is a good product that helps you keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> , quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I lost my original one on vacation and could not wait to get a replacement !!!</li>
            <li> , I purchased this one for a very reasonable price and the quality is great.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush arrived very fast and it is great.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> Glad I started with this one instead of the more pricier one that I own and love.</li>
            <li> However, this is not the first time he&#x27;s requested the toothbrush, so I assume he&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> so  have to return the product and try to search for a more suitable one.</li>
            <li> and once you get through the tingling of the first uses it great</li>
            <li> I bought my first one 20 years ago when they were 100.00 bucks so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Works great, as advertised....just be aware that this does not come in retail packaging.......</li>
            <li> Also very satisfied with ease of shopping at Amazon and the accurate delivery information provided by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> There are no frills, but does exactly what is needed &amp; at a great price point.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that cleans so well, my dentist even sells this product though at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> Son is getting married so it made a great gift for his fiance.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush worked great when first received.</li>
            <li> Great the first month</li>
            <li> whenever this toothbrush is no longer suitable I&#x27;ll replace it with another toothbrush I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Its my first experience with an electric toothbrush and although this one is great I&#x27;m looking to upgrade</li>
            <li> it sounds/feels like a wood sander in your mouth (not painful, but surprising).</li>
            <li> and I got a new one of these, a very good electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean and it is so easy to use!!</li>
            <li> It works fine....!</li>
            <li> Works just fine, cleans my teeth well, and I just have to keep track of the time myself!</li>
            <li> but product was fine!</li>
            <li> The brush is very accurate....</li>
            <li> Very smooth and polished.  </li>
            <li> The price is pretty good for a sonicare, and the power is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The heads are easy to find everywhere, and the charger is amazing - no plugs</li>
            <li> Nice travel case and easy to take apart for travel.</li>
            <li> you have not used this before, you should notice an exceptional squeaky clean every time after using this.</li>
            <li> Cleans good and charges quick.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush came in good condition, as mentioned, and quickly.</li>
            <li> , luckily I have good teeth or my dentist would have been mortified.</li>
            <li> This brush works nicely, and is easy to charge and use, but the brush head is already falling apart, separating into two pieces.</li>
            <li> First time you use it you feel the difference very nice.</li>
            <li> With Prime, I got free shipping, so that made the price even better!</li>
            <li> Has a good hand fit and easy to pack travel pack.</li>
            <li> I got a great price (including a $10.00 discount by ordering the Monday after Christmas) and quick free delivery.</li>
            <li> very good upgrade from my old battery-operated model</li>
            <li> I am a rapid tarter producer and this has made a huge difference in my cleaning appointments!</li>
            <li> Awesome in every way, only hassle is cleaning</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on brushing, a habbit reinforced by my awesome genetics where i can basically do nothing and have no tooth issues at all.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush will  help give you the discipline (that most of us do not have) to do a thorough brushing (set to an automatic 2 minute duration) twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has proven it heals and keeps the gums healthy and keeps the cavities away.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to, and now love the job it does.</li>
            <li> keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> However, did not expect how much better the cleaning was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had another electric toothbrush for years, and this one is much better.  </li>
            <li> In addition it has a two minute timer which helps in making sure</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The detachable toothbrush head comes with a tightly fitting plastic cover for travel.</li>
            <li> However, I’ve found that steripods work better.</li>
            <li> I like the tapered bristles and the more compact shape.</li>
            <li> and, therefore, covers more teeth as I brush.  </li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, thank you</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> If you have healthy teeth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a better toothbrush on the market for cleaning</li>
            <li> It works soo much better.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying a fresher brush with each use.</li>
            <li> My gums love the thing too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping works great</li>
            <li> But this is ok</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li> LOVE SONCICARE</li>
            <li> Have used this brand for many years with no complaints.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist and does a much better job than Oral B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so pleased that I&#x27;ve bought one for each member of my family.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sensodyne for many years.</li>
            <li> Over all I a more than satisfied with the product and could recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare e-Series toothbrushes, but they have a flaw for anyone who likes brushing their teeth in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Sure, this is mostly my fault and another consequence of my tragically dysfunctional relationship with gravity, but I do wish their interior moisture resistance was a bit more robust.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> works great - always ready to use.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a timer.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I used it 2Xs a day, most days and it lasted about a month before I had to rechare it.  </li>
            <li> I got mine on sale for $25 love it.</li>
            <li> Also, this latest Essence model does not have Quadpacer.</li>
            <li> They love sunbathing in them  and look so warm and comfortable.</li>
            <li> So much better than my OralB tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Pleased</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Had an oral B this one is better.</li>
            <li> Fully satisfied with the performance, I use it for 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> Hope that it holds up better than he two sonicare products purchased a number of years ago....</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums, but cleans better than all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> This is an interesting toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> had one many years ago, bought this one for my sister, and another one for me.</li>
            <li> After digesting 7-8 models, their features, prices, etc, I decided this cheaper unit would surely do the job.</li>
            <li> Now if I want to repurchase it I have to pay more for it.</li>
            <li> This one was much cheaper and still works great.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love that it shuts off after 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare toothbrushes for many, MANY years.</li>
            <li> :) I love them.</li>
            <li> Always a reliable product, what can I say! :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> I always brush longer than needed because I love how Sonicare makes my mouth feel, so don&#x27;t need timers, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Compared with store price much better.</li>
            <li> Love idea of warrenty as have had</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended getting a Sonicare, but they are much more costly than manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I LOVE the way this one works.  </li>
            <li> This brush works so much better</li>
            <li> does a better job than Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> love it, bought another for downstairs bath</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it shuts itself off after two minutes too.  </li>
            <li> Better dentist visits since I started using this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years, and I think they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to,  cleans your teeth.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this model Sonicare, not all the bells and whistles of the $200 ones in the Phillips line, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Glad to catch the deal on this one.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> Glad I took his advice.</li>

            <li> Maybe some staining from my love of coffee but no plaque.</li>
            <li> I have many crowns, bridges and a couple of implants</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> More words required?</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fresh great product would recommend it over and over and over again thanks</li>
            <li> i love the travel case.</li>
            <li> We love that they came with the travel case too.</li>
            <li> Must be a better way to make it waterproof</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing and was very impressed with the honesty.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand toothbrush for many years, replacing it about every 3 years.  </li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> Works much better than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I love sonicare products and I bought this for a backup because everyone in my family uses one, and none of us want to be without one.  </li>
            <li> I was more reluctant to spend money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like at all, so I got this &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works better then</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone! :)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t brush your tongue with the thing on, it will sling toothpaste all over you AND the sink/mirror/wall, etc :)</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with this way of taking care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> In just a month or so, the dental assistant cleaning my teeth said they looked much better.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> After a week of using it my gums felt better, and are visibly healthier.</li>
            <li> Okay have I satisfied the word requirement...</li>
            <li> This was to replace another electric toothbrush that stopped working after many years.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I have come to love it a lot.</li>
            <li> i am planning to buy more.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the price.</li>
            <li> WRAP - Like most Sonicare models, this one has one at the bottom of the charger to store any excess cord.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> WRAP - Like most Sonicare models, this one has one at the bottom of the charger to store any excess cord.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> I love that the 2 minutes shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid more for one with</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t quite make to &amp;#34;I love It.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works better than Sonicare&#x27;s newer model.  </li>
            <li> This is a genuine Sonicare toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> keeps your teeth feeling fresher than ever :)</li>
            <li> I chose this toothbrush because I&#x27;ve been using it for approx 3 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Elite and Essence toothbrushes for years and love them.</li>
            <li> sure why they bother with a travel case</li>
            <li> Yes I do have better check ups.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonic are, and they are awesome.  </li>
            <li> It is way better than Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> Great product,cleans teeth really well,Good recharging platform.</li>
            <li> works great, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The person who actually uses it is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> And I love the color.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Better than oral b automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But, I love how they work.</li>
            <li> I like the sonic vibe style way more than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the travel case.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I also find that I save more water since I shut it off while im brushing which is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It is heavier, has more battery storage, and vibrates with more power than Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it works better as a cleaning device.</li>
            <li> I love using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare hasn&#x27;t caused any sores or soreness from brushing top of the molars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but it doesn&#x27;t have the timer that pauses at 30-second intervals to let you know that you&#x27;re done with each quadrant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also incompatible with the charger for the better model.</li>
            <li> been using the Sonicare for years and my teeth love it.  </li>
            <li> The device is very noisy but provides a great cleaning to all teeth.</li>
            <li> charger, while it works phenomenally at home, does not travel well.</li>
            <li> , also make sure toothbrush is in mouth.when</li>
            <li> The oscillations work to vibrate water molecules in your mouth that work between your teeth and gums to remove food, plaque and tartar many times better than a manual brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gums were perfectly healthy too.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t replace flossing though, so make sure to floss before brushing (as recommended by my dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been having dental problems, have implants or appliances, or want to take better care of your teeth, get one of these.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been having dental problems, have implants or appliances, or want to take better care of your teeth, get one of these.</li>
            <li> but that is OK.</li>
            <li> good, i like it.it is worth to buy.</li>
            <li> What can I say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Sonicare&amp;#34;  could not have gotten a better price than</li>
            <li> works better than my dentist said</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The head is comfortable, and the way it vibrates seems effective for cleaning.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Overall, great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Anyway, the cycle  keeps getting shorter (most of the time) and has to be restarted.  </li>
            <li> I love it more every day</li>
            <li> I am a retired dentist, and have been using this brush for many years....</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for something that cleans a lot better than a manual toothbrush, get one of the more pricier models.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I found that I love it.</li>
            <li> While I question the efficacy of cleaning your teeth with what seems to be nothing more than a vibrator, my immediate frustration is from a support standpoint.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if it had adjustable speed settings.</li>
            <li> I seem to be able to reach all areas well.  </li>
            <li> I love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> Does not have 2 speed settings or the 30 second interval timer, but if you don&#x27;t want or need those features, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three more units, two for myself and one for my son, none lasted for more than one year.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself wishing that it did anything more than it does.</li>
            <li> It requires more maintenance since you have to unscrew it and drain the water out after each use.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of changes I would love to see, however.</li>
            <li> Excellent- a traditional toothbrush can&#x27;t get under my braces.</li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this sonicare electric touthbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> so it is great for vacation, and it really cleans</li>
            <li> I bought my daughter and my husband one, and they love it</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who likes having healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for many years; I ordered replacement brushes for it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Much better than an oral-B.</li>
            <li> Love my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great quality, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> For 40 dollars you can&#x27;t find a better tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Better than others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they included a travel case, but this model does not have the LED power indicator.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one we&#x27;d had for many years, and still worked, but was falling apart.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love the travel pack this toothbrush comes with.</li>
            <li> I love this pr</li>
            <li> I would gladly exchange it for one that has that feature.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush...doesn&#x27;t have the quadpacer feature</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t really necessary to get the job done and the price is great!  </li>
            <li> Well done Amazon :).</li>
            <li> I swear by them because they took me from the brink of periodontal disease to healthy gums...</li>
            <li> we love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Now if I would just use it more often.</li>
            <li> and I saw that it was a better deal buy it on amazon.</li>
            <li> But this Philips Sonicare Essence 5600 Rechargeable is even better.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the latte seems to work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love the sonic</li>
            <li> Glad we bought it.</li>
            <li> But that is probably my fault for not checking more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love the timing feature that keeps me on track with brushing time</li>
            <li> Pay $20-30 for a better one.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> I love using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , I really do love it.  </li>
            <li> So much more affordable, then the retail stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy two more for the family.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare products and this one did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> sincerely wish you try this item for yourself.  </li>
            <li> or I would say much better</li>
            <li> I only use Sonic toothbrush and am very happy with it</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price</li>
            <li> Teeth feels smooth like when you return from your dentist!</li>
            <li> I needed to detach the top, rinse out the compartment after each brushing.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Even the price has gotten more affordable nowadays.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> love this tootbrush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare continues to provide me with healthy teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time to use electric toothbrush, it is much better than manual one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this item after a coworker suggested it.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for the whole package.  </li>
            <li> yep, i love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> As I was to begin a five week trip, I decided to leave the brush home and take my more dependable electric toothbrush....from a rival company.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After verbally praising this product in my household, my brothers and mother have all purchased one and are equally satisfied.</li>
            <li> the front teeth on top...</li>
            <li> I love the product,</li>
            <li> Brush size was okay for her</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> After buying one, I had to get two more for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> The carrying pouch makes it even more convenient.</li>
            <li> It is still way better for cleaning than a manual brush and even way better than the oral-B version, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> After a couple years I decided I don&#x27;t like the taste of the brown-gray goo, and it probably isn&#x27;t safe to eat while brushing.  </li>
            <li> I still rate it 5 stars because it is much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It motivate me to brush more often</li>
            <li> cleans way better than you would if you were manually brushing.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have an outlet in an appropriate place though.</li>
            <li> I really like toothbrush, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> been using for about a month seams to be cleaning my teeth better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it thanks for selling</li>
            <li> After having about 5 battery operated toothbrushes around, I finally found my perfect rush.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Really works great.</li>
            <li> Expect better Dentist visits.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that so many of my family members did not use electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to get a timer and brush it that way so each quadrant gets an equal time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love them.</li>
            <li> Feels so much better cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> This upgrade is even better.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with all os</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s see if this makes it any better after six months.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, OK.  </li>
            <li> It takes getting used to the tingling of the cleaning, but hopefully will be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it and it was dirt cheap $39!</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years and it had seen its better days.</li>
            <li> and I love the two minute timer.  </li>
            <li> She was impressed with the low level of tartar and plaque, and you know what that means....</li>
            <li> Would love that.</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 minute timer to make sure you brush for the correct dentist recommended length of time.  </li>
            <li> They LOVE them.</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> time and charge much more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been very reliable and provided great dental hygiene over the decade</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I specially love how it had a 2 minutes timer.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Hello,I love my Philips Sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> this one is doing a great job of cleaning my teeth very well...fits my needs.</li>
            <li> Love the travel case</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an identical unit I had had for many years when the non-replaceable battery died.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Sonicare ... what more to say?  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This on is lighter and more compact</li>
            <li> so I was sure to give each section of my mouth 30 seconds of brushing.  </li>
            <li> better than the Philip I used before</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I switched.  </li>
            <li> Only difference is no quad-pacer but otherwise is perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li> so why pay more.</li>
            <li> Came better than described.</li>
            <li> Got as a Christmas gift but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a plug in or cordless</li>
            <li> feel a lot cleaner too:)</li>
            <li> She loves it as much as I love mine.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and delivered so rapidly and safely.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing more to tell you about the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> so I only expect the best.</li>
            <li> I love it -</li>
            <li> I also noticed some of the newer heads vibrate more and massage the gums.  </li>
            <li> After using this for several months, I went to my dentist for my teeth cleaning and he commented on the excellent condition of my teeth (without knowing of my switch to an electronic toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> I had no idea that this newer design would be so much more mouth-friendly.  </li>
            <li> I love this one too.  </li>
            <li> It also pounds mouthwash, peroxide, coconut oil or whatever exotic treatments</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and it was ok...</li>
            <li> Move this toothbrush and glad I converted to Sonicare</li>
            <li> I love it, and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and I like the upgrade much better..</li>
            <li> Way, way better than battery operated drug store toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> And would want to continue enjoying it and maybe even buy another set for my family.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I received this item as a Christmas Gift and it was just what I needed to encourage me to brush my teeth:)</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for many days; it shuts itself off after 2 minutes to make sure the brusher uses it an appropriate length of time.  </li>
            <li> How many times have you heard a teenager say, &amp;#34;look at my teeth, they look and feel great!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> , I love it, my dentist can not stop complementing my teeth....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> , I was glad that I did buy this bursh</li>
            <li> I think it does a better job then the Braun.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Teeth look better with two or three uses.  </li>

            <li> I love the two minute timer on this model.</li>

            <li> I would expect better longevity.  </li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush , feel like my teeth and gums are healthier than they&#x27;ve been in years</li>
            <li> Love it</li>

            <li> For my two-day&#x27;s use, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the timer, but I&#x27;ve found that it is helpful.  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love my Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush when my dental hygienist recommend a sonic toothbrush for better dental health.</li>
            <li> Such a great buy!</li>
            <li> However, this Sonicare was defective and would not tighten when attempting to connect the top and bottom of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Ok... it&#x27;s a toothbrush</li>
            <li> hope to have more promotional activities</li>
            <li> love the 2 min timer&lt;</li>
            <li> We both love ours</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> you enjoying your Sonicare?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love them, but, they do wear out and have to be replaced..</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush and have purchased for all my family.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Glad I took a shot</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, more than 10 years ago, all my dentist has to do is the twice a year cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> I have dental issues and wanted a better electric toothbrush than what I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Also love the timer.  </li>
            <li> winning combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I wondered if I would be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> I will surely buy some more for my husband and daughter.</li>
            <li> I really do think these are great tooth brushes and the price</li>
            <li> I love using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Many years ago it was recommened to me</li>
            <li> It has saved my teeth from more dentist vists.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They actually enjoy brushing their teeth now!</li>
            <li> It must be ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I think it doesn&#x27;t do a better job than my manual toothbrush of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with these until somebody can convince me that there is a better product out there.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Can you believe I was able to get the dentist to see me on a Sunday night???&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If they could fix the design issue I would love it</li>
            <li> Amazon is attempting to fix the problem, but in the meantime make sure you get what your ordered and paid for.  </li>
            <li> For the money, you can not do better than this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I started to love this but about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> ask for a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth a lot more because of this</li>
            <li> My husband and I bought 2 and love them.</li>
            <li> I also love that it goes for 2 minutes then shuts itself off</li>
            <li> Make sure this is what you are intending to order.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this unit.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> but this is the best thing ever for a toothbrush, and the heads last forever.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy it many years ago?</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Been a Sonicare user for better than a decade.  </li>

            <li> It has the timer on it for one thing, so he brushes for a full two minutes, but it is also just a superior clean with this brush.</li>
            <li> I was able to return it and the company was very good about allowing me to send it back.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great product so far</li>
            <li> We are glad these are still available-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to note that replacement head will be needed every ninety days to make the most of the cleaning process.</li>

            <li> (Google &amp;#34;fake reviews&amp;#34; and notice how many reviews for this product fit the bill.)  </li>
            <li> Sure wish they had been available 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> Cannot imagine that the higher priced ones are any more effective.</li>
            <li> So far, this toothbrush is working great.  </li>
            <li> Surely cleans well: leaves teeth and gums feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, complete with an anti-theft strip.</li>
            <li> So far Its working out great.  </li>
            <li> great replacement for a 10 year old sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> My old one died and this was a great price</li>
            <li> Liked the first one and am enjoying this one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure she will enjoy using it as I have been.</li>
            <li> the old one did - otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It really does help get teeth cleaner, and the price on Amazon was a good price.</li>
            <li> It really is that good.</li>
            <li> Good price, no unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fast delivery and good value.</li>
            <li> The price is good and it works very well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> So thanks Philips for the good teeth I have</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work and thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I got the &amp;#34;easy packaging&amp;#34; which was nice, and the travel bag was useful.</li>
            <li> and this is a good price for a very efficient model.</li>
            <li> I guess it is good for what you pay, if I strictly talk about the brush functions, it works really well</li>
            <li> So while this may be a good toothbrush I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Ellite.</li>
            <li> good product fast service</li>
            <li> Loved my so much I bought one for each of my kids and my nephews.</li>
            <li> If you have periodontal disease, this toothbrush can really help keep your mouth in good shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electrical toothbrushes, but the Philips Sonicare is hands down the best you can get for the money.</li>
            <li> The two minute timer is great to make sure you are getting everything super clean, and the ramp up of the amount of vibration through the first 12 times of use made it easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just right said Goldilocks!!</li>
            <li> It certainly does make my teeth feel clean and great on brushing the tongue and palate which is important, too, of course.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would, very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I was using a disposable battery-operated toothbrush, which I loved and which I do still like a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Amazing what this can do with the right toothpaste.</li>
            <li> These do an amazing job and the price is right.</li>
            <li> That said, I do wish the batteries were replaceable, but on one of my units like this they lasted for about 10 years before the batteries gave way and the whole unit had to be replaced, so that&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li> Very happy to have my smooth, clean teeth back.</li>
            <li> I still love this brush, a caveat:  Change the brush head much more often than you&#x27;d think - every 2 months - it works SOOOOO much better with a new brush!!!  </li>
            <li> this is my third one to buy, for myself and two for a cousin, they work great no problem fine!</li>
            <li> Love this - handy but powerful enough to brush teeth great.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality, just need to clean it every time after using.</li>
            <li> It makes me teeth feel very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> the cost is more than what I originally paid for.</li>
            <li> After many years of use, my original P.S. quit on me.</li>
            <li> Yes, just like other ones I have owned, it cleans wonderfully well.</li>
            <li> Product provides the best results of any other product on  the market.......</li>
            <li> We replaced our original Sonic Care of many years duration with this product.  </li>
            <li> We returned the original toothbrush that was defective and Amazon shipped us a new one, which was great.</li>
            <li> new one has been great, it is sleeker and yet more powerful</li>
            <li> Just make sure you clean out</li>

            <li> It does come with an easy to use carrying case, but the case doesn&#x27;t carry the charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like it GREAT, next time buy better one.</li>
            <li> The battery won&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; as easily unlike NiCad cells, so it will stay functional longer.</li>
            <li> and I found that it&#x27;s easy to get replacement heads for it.</li>
            <li> It is the most basic sonicare tooth brush, but it&#x27;s reliable and works great.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product; it is simply amazing.  </li>

            <li> Easy to use，Whitening effect。</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel amazing and super clean.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of options out there with more features, but this basic model works great.</li>
            <li> I often went through the two minute brush time twice trying to make sure I got every part of my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush, always bought those cheaper $8 ones from the store and this thing is like having the dentist clean your teeth every morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy to accidentally turn it off and think that your 2 minutes are over.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean as visiting the dentist for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Now I know when 2 minutes are up and it easy two use</li>
            <li> so I bought this hoping to increase blood flow and clean better along the gum line.  </li>
            <li> charging station makes it rather easy to recharge, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with batteries.</li>
            <li> and I love the feeling of having all my teeth clean</li>
            <li> The unit is easy to use but you have to turn it off after use for it to charge.</li>
            <li> However, the casing and the charger get &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; very quickly even though I rinse the toothbrush every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Its the most affordable of its kind and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> We had the older model of this Sonic Care toothbrush for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Over a month and the battery is still strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old man who doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the notion that I need some kind of upgrade in how I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> This thing is electric and strong.</li>
            <li> 2-minute timer makes me more conscious about giving my teeth and gums a good brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since then, its made me a strong believer</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as my old Sonicare which lasted more than 5 yrs.</li>
            <li> This is a good replacement for my old Sonicare which quit after many years of family use.  </li>
            <li> Always strong brush if you keep it charged.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush gave me many good years of service.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong toothbrush and brushes</li>
            <li> Felt almost too strong.  </li>
            <li> , part of it is genetics, everyone in my family was blessed with strong teeth</li>
            <li> I finally did, and honestly it feels like I have just come from the dentist every time I brush (a good thing).  </li>
            <li> Vibration was too strong.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Not putting those down but for a little more money I now have an excellent toothbrush &amp; the best part</li>
            <li> He has been very happy with his electric toothbrush at more than half the price!</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning, is very easily used, and had a special feature that made it easier for the sensitive gums to adjust.</li>
            <li> It was highly rated and the reviews were quite good.  </li>
            <li> Good product, I would highly recommend the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> that we liked them very much.  </li>
            <li> Once this product had full charge it had strong brushing ability better than another electric toothbrush I used to have.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in the future I will upgrade to a better model, but I am perfectly satisfied with my Essence to do the job it was purchased to do!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfect and not too hard and the wider base/handle suits me as I tend to get a hand cramp from gripping more slender brushes.</li>
            <li> first time using one, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Though the toothbrush contains 2 AA batteries (glued into the unit), the time to a full charge is more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I liked the first one</li>
            <li> Philips will allow you to return the product for a full refund if you are not fully satisfied with your purchase.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> the carrying bag is also pretty nice to have for transport.  </li>
            <li> At first, &amp;#34;yay!&amp;#34;, its a nice step up.  </li>
            <li> The first time was kind of understandable - it fell onto a tile floor.</li>
            <li> so you are more inclined to finish the full two minutes that dentists recommend.</li>
            <li> Charges fast and doesn&#x27;t need charging for many many many uses.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job, but you have to almost take it completely apart and clean it after every use.  </li>
            <li> We have not found anything better for leaving your mouth clean and free of bacteria, even when just brushing with water.</li>
            <li> Feels more substantial than the battery-powered version, charges quickly, and the travel bag makes packing easy.</li>
            <li> Really gets my teeth good and clean.</li>
            <li> Everything looks all good and new except I didn&#x27;t receive the case.</li>
            <li> With these new rechargeable toothbrushes my grandsons are good about brushing their teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li> The new one is just as good, and no day is started without using it .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush to try if you are new to Sonicare or electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Works great last without recharging for the week when I&#x27;m gone, cleans well thanks for the coupon right away was great</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works fine and does what it&#x27;s designed to do</li>

            <li> This one is just fine.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and love the rechargeable feature, no more batteries to buy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to handle, easy to clean.</li>

            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> Need to take off the head and do the best you can cleaning up the black mold inside.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth and does a fine job at it.</li>
            <li> It took a while for my teeth and gums to get used to the vibration, but after 3 days I was fine.  </li>
            <li> It says after 3 months, but the head still seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> My first Soniccare lasted over 10 years (the plastic turned yellow but the brush still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fine.  </li>
            <li> If it is mentioned on the carton it must be in the fine print.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s fine, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The brush works fine.  </li>
            <li> model is economically priced and functions flawlessly to give you a clean you thought only a trip to the dentist could give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself works fine.</li>
            <li> Has been working fine.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It does not have the 30-sec. alert that it&#x27;s time to change quadrant in your mouth, but I do just fine using my watch for that.  </li>
            <li> Trimmed with scissors and it seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fine.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine for an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought the exact same model because it served my purposes wonderfully</li>
            <li> The product is fine, the service was fine.  </li>
            <li> Price is just fine.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need it, it is fine.  </li>
            <li> It appears fine.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has continued to produce a fine product.  </li>
            <li> This is the lowest end model, and does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> my toothbrush is totally fine.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was doing a fine job without one.</li>
            <li> brush seems fine.  </li>
            <li> It does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> It was fine</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and for that I was grateful because mine had stopped working!</li>
            <li> But I quickly became accustomed to it, and now love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy an electric toothbrush, very comfortable to use, very clean brush</li>
            <li> The whole family got one of these for Christmas and they love them!</li>
            <li> Ordering on line was easy and delivery very timely !!!</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s the right price, these tooth brushes are awesome.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and I can feel my teeth are healthier because I made the switch to an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and  mainly because of the good job it does keeping my teeth clean, I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> great cleaning,  easy to use,  stays charged for several days so travels well</li>
            <li> However, the bottom line is that since using the Sonicare my dental hygenist says my plaque buildup is much less and my teeth stay in good condition between cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> It is not as easy to keep all the groves clean and is not as easy to disassemble for travel.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and sits nicely on its charger so it is ready to use at any time.</li>
            <li> , it fits in tight spaces and does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> But, since I could not find an available HX5810, this one will do just fine.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are very strong and at first they tickled my lips before I got use to it.</li>
            <li> Love at first site, will not be without again, this is one of life&#x27;s nesecities !</li>
            <li> Vibration takes a little to get used to, but your teeth feel great after brushing!  </li>
            <li> This really is an excellent little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and the brushes themselves seem improved because although my old ones fit this handle, the new brushes seem to vibrate more giving better cleaning power.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this as a replacement, and am doubly happy that it used the same kind of heads as her old brush!  </li>
            <li> Six months of use made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Who honestly uses traditional toothbrushes anymore after this amazing invention?</li>
            <li> A really huge improvement in electric tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference with my gum health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy enough with the toothbrush, but not these added huge costs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to buy at a cheap price compared to commercial battery-type brushes in the market.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a great price for a valuable product that should last years.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Clean easy charging design</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought one for each of my parents and now my brother.  </li>
            <li> This just goes 2 minutes and off, so the brushing is not as precise.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush did not have to charge for 24 hours before using, it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Indicator light seems to be on at all times despite charging for a day (will keep an eye on that)  </li>
            <li> fantastic toothbrush .. .</li>
            <li> enjoy that it turns off after 3 minutes</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t fit well and rattle around.  </li>
            <li> I am vey enjoy to use it</li>
            <li> Used as primary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> The price on this is extremely reasonable, you can keep it as a backup if you upgrade, or pass the handle off to a family member (they can buy their own brush heads).</li>
            <li> It is efficient and light weight.</li>
            <li> Battery/motor unit is sealed  so is easy to rinse clean.  </li>
            <li> Mine, after fully charged according to the light on the charger, didn&#x27;t beep at all.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it just has a blinking light on the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> but nothing I tried could repair the sound.</li>
            <li> My dentist appt should go much smoothly this time.</li>
            <li> HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush works great, is my second Sonicare and can&#x27;t go anywhere over night without it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, can last for weeks without recharging.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product isn&#x27;t that enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an abuser of my toothbrush, I actually take great care of it.  </li>
            <li> It was such a great deal we bought 2.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and store.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is cheap and cleans teeth well.  </li>
            <li> doesnt sound the timer alarm.</li>
            <li> so each person doesn&#x27;t have to have their own set up - taking up too much room on the bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li> My son and I use the battery operated, cheap toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> My roommate told me this kind of toothbrush would change my whole brushing experience.</li>
            <li> this cheap -</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this to everyone who would enjoy  cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> Over the 10 years the battery life degraded to the point that it would only hold a charge for about 3 days, but up until it died it was a great brush, working dependably.  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and it does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It will also remind you when it&#x27;s time to charge with a blinking light on the power button and a beeper that turns the brush off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fantastic oral health tool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fantastic oral health tool.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since December and its fantastic.  </li>
            <li> this cheap -</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, and I looked online for brands available.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too tall to fit in the medicine cabinet, however we can adjust the shelving.  </li>
            <li> I checked all over online, no one could beat the price, and free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and the brush does clean the teeth as well as whiten them.</li>
            <li> But for the big guy (or gal), the Sonicare is great.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, the only problem is the charging.</li>
            <li> extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is absolutely fantastic for the price!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> is Sonicare&#x27;s most basic model, and, honestly, for most people this is all you&#x27;re gonna need.</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;re supposed to use it 30 seconds each on the insides and outsides of the top/bottom of your teeth, resulting in quadrants that evenly space into the recommended 2 minutes of brushing), which I admit would be a handy feature, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> They r easy to clean, and assemble.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a thinness to the brush that makes it quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> Overall a great electric toothbrush that I do not regret buying.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is happy I switched to this (from regular toothbrush)!</li>
            <li> purchased this Sonicare and told my daughter to get it when she needed a \\&quot;cheap electric toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It has exceeded all my expectations its a great toothbrush especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning back molars.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the one I left at a hotel</li>
            <li> Light won&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just as happy with this one as I was with the last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and fabulous at dental cleaning -- and that&#x27;s what I want.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> More powerful.</li>
            <li> My teeth are cavity prone, so anything that helps keep them healthy is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I used the Crest cheap one before this</li>
            <li> Instructions show that it&#x27;s available on some models, but not this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Explains why this model is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended getting a Sonicare, so I finally picked one up and it works great.</li>
            <li> they now have available -  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know if I could justify spending the money on an electric toothbrush instead of just buying those cheap plastic toothbrushes from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Great, basic, Sonicare Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Most of us are on a budget and this is one tool that is worth the family money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually feel cleaner, and I&#x27;ve always had great teeth (never a cavity).</li>
            <li> Great value at a low price.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush , the dentist recommended .</li>
            <li> registered  online and got free extended warranty.</li>
            <li> she can go back to the manual brush while I continue to get great compliments from the dental hygenist.</li>
            <li> It is just a push in or press fit.</li>
            <li> Mold free for over a year using this method.</li>
            <li> but we have a pack of &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; brushes to use and they aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
            <li> the manual, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> When you look at it like that, then it is well worth spending the money for a competent toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Just ordered extra heads for this brush from Amazon at a great price as well.</li>
            <li> her cleaning my teeth feels so smooth after</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing tartar from my teeth, and my time with the dental hygienist has been been reduced.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m told that you must shine light in your mouth while using it.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a total of 2 of these great toothbrushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the charging light.  </li>
            <li> Dont be fooled by the low price - this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush overall</li>
            <li> Our second Sonicare - it is a great power</li>
            <li> Edit: Confirmed --</li>
            <li> Think it&#x27;s Great Open it up after 2 days of use</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m home during the days,will use it after lunch.&lt;br /&gt;Great product fantastic price.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend, amazon has great service for this product</li>
            <li> Two of them work great, however, within six months, two of them no longer work properly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smooth as if I just went in for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> but it feels cheaply made and has this &amp;#34;going to break soon&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I will bring it out and let it charge for a day once the light starts blinking.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at getting at the back molars</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this as it was so cheap...</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> No blinking light, nothing.</li>
            <li> I reallyu enjoy this and am brushing for the time period they recommend.  </li>
            <li> But, as they say, cheap just buys you cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; for days when off the charger, easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> thing is fantastic, though.  </li>
            <li> Easy to charge, clean and use.  </li>
            <li> Whiter, cleaner, smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li> Nice  and affordable , delivery was fast</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably.  </li>
            <li> The heads do not come cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several months now and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> this is one great toothbrush,its awesome,simple to use,I did notice my teeth cleaner,wont go back to Manuel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush came in the frustration free packaging.  </li>
            <li> Cheap bastards.</li>
            <li> does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> brush does a good job with cleaning, but wow, huge design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Done at Northwestern Dental School, the study says that &amp;#34;Overall, this study demonstrates that long-term use of these two electric toothbrushes improves periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients, and that the Sonicare brush is superior to the Braun [Oral-B] brush in reducing gingival inflammation and probing depth.</li>
            <li> Loved the last one- love this one.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> this is an old style brush and works good</li>
            <li> I liked my old one better.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my old Oral B, which I liked quite well, but the Phillips is even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a spin brush and this one has been good so far.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as my old one.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace a similar Phillips device that cost a good deal more.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> An electric toothbrush is far more effective than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The travel bag is not as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This model seemed to be the closest to my old one, and I have had good luck with it in the month since it arrived.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 13 year old son, who needed to be reminded to brush his teeth twice a day and to do a *good* job.</li>
            <li> I have another brush which is better, but this one&lt;br /&gt;is good for traveling or a second brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not essential, but it&#x27;s a good training tool because most manual brushers don&#x27;t come even close to brushing for two minutes.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good..</li>
            <li> Does a good job, for the basic model you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> its too bulky and noisy, and the bristles are not at all good, its better to brush your teeth with manual/ regular toothbrush rather than this one.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for any adult who a values good dental care.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and need to take good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> This product keeps me from having to visit my dentist more often, it really helps keep your gums healthy too.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought two more for my parents...</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, we are very pleased with this new one.</li>
            <li> Right away I noticed my gums felt better.</li>
            <li> The Essence toothbrush, HX5610/01, helps remove more plaque than a manual toothbrush, because it uses patented sonic technology that will knock plaque right off enamel and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do like that it is supposed to clean in between teeth and be more gentle on gums, and use it mostly for these reasons.</li>
            <li> Our original Sonicare toothbrush finally gave out,  This one works great.  </li>
            <li> I was, however, fortunate to find a highly rated generic brand of replacement heads that work perfectly - Sonimart.</li>
            <li> If you have dental problems, this is a very useful tool.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> Very worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes time to get used to because it&#x27;s very powerful, but when you&#x27;re done brushing you feel like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> This is easier to clean than any I&#x27;ve had before and does the same great job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth have that fresh from the Dentist kind of clean and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It does and excellent job of cleaning,  mean it gets my teeth very very clean.  </li>
            <li> So far it has been great, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> She said that she can tell a huge difference in how clean her teeth feel.</li>
            <li> Keep my teeth clean, works great to clean those back molars.</li>
            <li> First time moving to an electric toothbrush and had a great experience so far.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> HX5610/30 Essence 5600 surely pays for itself in saved trips to the dentist and overall delivery of a very satisfying brushing experience every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might only be good for super healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> Interesting and  full of fun.</li>
            <li> Best little brush you could ever want for travel!</li>
            <li> I personally like the more expensive Sonicare brushes better, but my mom likes the original and it is a great price and works great!</li>
            <li> Teeth feel so much cleaner using the Sonicare, very easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the toothbrush lasted a good 2 weeks before it started showing signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Surely the new design toothbrushes seal better than this one.</li>
            <li> so I needed to find a new sonicare to use the same replacement heads and this one was perfect.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times I&#x27;ve used the manual toothbrush per day it doesn&#x27;t even come close to how well this cleans and the Sonicare isn&#x27;t even operating at full power right now.</li>
            <li> Great item, motor is definitely better than my previous one.</li>
            <li> This is for good regular dental hygiene made easy</li>
            <li> The cost is worth it!</li>
            <li> One year after I started using my original Sonicare</li>
            <li> The timer is great letting you know when its time to switch sides and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush so much!</li>
            <li> It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> worth every dime!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I FEEL SUITABLE SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted many years.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working after having it for many years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my original Sonicare brush that died after ~10 years of service.  </li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and it feels like it does a much better job than a manual brush</li>
            <li> The customer service is worth it alone!</li>
            <li> Travel bag fits perfectly into small cosmetic bag or shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see that they&#x27;re definitely in a class of their own!</li>
            <li> This however is significantly inferior.</li>
            <li> However, when I saw the price dropped to $39.95 I was much more willing to shell out the cash.  </li>
            <li> After 6 years my original gave up so I purchased the Essence 5600.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for many years and always had a higher priced model.</li>
            <li> First time using Sonicare and love it.  </li>
            <li> Seeing this really made me happy and my teeth were indeed more white.</li>
            <li> Did not come in original packaging......</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, though!</li>
            <li> The original one lasted over 3 years before the battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> We originally bought ours because of the recommendation of our dentist.  </li>
            <li> much cleaner, much better, more smile</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> They work great for almost exactly as long as the warranty lasts, then you have to buy another.  </li>
            <li> pouch is an improvement over the bulky plastic case that came with my original Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about eight years, but after this period of time the battery wouldn&#x27;t do more than the first two-minute brushing.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly fresh mouth and breath!</li>
            <li> I can say, after first use itself, I felt my teeth much more cleaner, and</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> And I am pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t fully charged to start</li>
            <li> The original unit I had lasted approx 5 years.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to lazy brushers for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, finding the best angels need skills</li>
            <li> This is worth the price when you see how your dental check ups improve!</li>
            <li> I am not overly excited about it.</li>
            <li> This model is almost identical to my original.  </li>
            <li> This one was the original brown box that sonicare had mailed to amazon (the label was still attatched).</li>
            <li> so I was familiar with it.  </li>
            <li> I love it now but the first time I used it</li>
            <li> This brush kept my teeth and gums pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I use this brush once a day and still using the original brush.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!  </li>
            <li> The vibration speed seems to be higher and it does a better job.</li>
            <li> So far I have been very satisfied with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This replaced my original Sonicare the died after 15 years of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you expect, it works well, is easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> so I have had it for quite some time I highly recommend this!!!!!;)</li>
            <li> there are other, better, more effective electronic</li>
            <li> I ordered this new one from Amazon at an amazing price.  </li>
            <li> A nice to have feature but can easily live without it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A nice to have feature but can easily live without it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> nice to have a new one.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it, so I decided to order a new one.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and my periodontal visits have been very positive!  </li>
            <li> The new brush head seems to vibrate more than the old ones which makes it more effective.</li>
            <li> so clean</li>

            <li> i used to manually brush my teeth before this and since getting this product my teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Teeth and mouth don&#x27;t feel clean if we don&#x27;t use them.</li>

            <li> have never been this clean before, trust me.  </li>
            <li> need to clean it every 3-4 weeks or else</li>
            <li> You do need to take it apart and keep t clean to avoid nastiness</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth like no toothbrush could ever clean.  </li>
            <li> Bought a Sonicare at recommendation of dental hygienist,  It does clean teeth well.  </li>
            <li> In order to keep it clean, you have to dismantle everything and clean</li>
            <li> My teeth also just started to not feel clean even after brushing.</li>
            <li> Compared to a regular toothbrush, this electric brush by Sonicare is exceptional and for the price its well worth it for keeping teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> The charger is very convenient, product is well built, good quality, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The bells and whistles of the higher end models sound great, but I came to the realization that I&#x27;ve been brushing with a good old fashion toothbrush my whole life, and this cheaper unit offers the advantage I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Try and find a single one of this at a great price ..........</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this toothbrush my teeth gleamed and felt so smooth</li>
            <li> ...as long as I just charge it every couple of days, until the light stops flashing...so far, so good!!  </li>
            <li> Unless you believe the earth is flat, and the sun rotates around the earth you should own a Sonicare !</li>
            <li> and I needed an electric toothbrush that would be both gentle and effective and this model if just right for me.</li>
            <li> Also, a quick release top shouldn&#x27;t be a \\&quot;feature\\&quot; of a higher priced model.</li>
            <li> It has been not enough time to really give it a good test drive, but so far its seams great.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, charge, and use right after.</li>
            <li> Thought it came in a simple package and not in the original package, it&#x27;s good for use.</li>
            <li> This one was on special and I bought it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure there is probably a clever way of opening this up and replacing the battery, but I imagine not everyone can be so crafty.</li>
            <li> Though this brush has good power and cleans teeth well, the head needs to be removed daily to clean inside</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high powered and takes some getting used to, but it is great so far.</li>
            <li> It came ahead of schedule, was well packaged, worked right out of the box and is still working fine.</li>
            <li> Not so good, after using it, I find some part of my teeth is very clean, but other part not.</li>
            <li> Works great just what I expected</li>
            <li> The most controversial aspect of Sonicare is the relatively pricey brush heads.</li>
            <li> Great product that performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> Thus far works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and as expected is great.</li>
            <li> The unit brushes perfectly though, just like my old one, and the battery lasts a long time (2 weeks).</li>
            <li> After the first use, it was clear that this thing just does a superior job with cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is just what I expected, and it does a great job on the teeth.</li>
            <li> It is better than the Sonic unit with  replaceable batteries that suck away the $$ fast.  </li>
            <li> my old one had would be nice</li>
            <li> Love the travel case it comes with, makes it so much easier to take my electric toothbrush with me anywhere.</li>
            <li> teeth and gums feel much cleaner and better than using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wish the replacement heads had a more reasonable price tag,..</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fairly light and really powerful.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this product is worthwhile - it was shipped without any brush heads.</li>
            <li> , I got two full years of use.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> My experience with the company has definitely left a good impression on the PHILIPS brand.</li>
            <li> Teeth are super clean and my dentist comments on the lack of plaque.  </li>
            <li> good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I own anything else that is this old and still works.</li>
            <li> The travel pouch is a soft, zippered pouch and does not protect the toothbrush as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> After use, my mouth feels super clean unlike any manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> The included travel pouch is a soft, zippered pouch and does not protect the toothbrush as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it seemed to be such a good on-line bargan</li>
            <li> Good value on this basic, no bells and whistles model.</li>
            <li> If you want your teeth and gums to feel super clean then this is the toothbrush for you to try.  </li>
            <li> Ear plugs just seem to make the experience more intense and compacted.  </li>
            <li> Get the teeth and gums super clean with ease.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, but so far I&#x27;m completely thrilled.</li>
            <li> The handle is bigger circumference wise, but still manageable.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good product to have in your bathroom</li>
            <li> After about 12 brushings, it will increase to full power.</li>
            <li> just one call to Amazon, and they credited the full amount to my account, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> With most devices that have a rechargeable battery, I would advise letting the whole thing die before recharging to converse the half-life of the battery.</li>
            <li> but I am thrilled so far.</li>
            <li> Good price for the replacement battery for the larger head model.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and comfortable brush.  </li>
            <li> Works like charm cool product.</li>
            <li> I just need the patience to figure out how to set the 30 second timer, then i’ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> This one is a good basic unit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to experience full power.</li>
            <li> It keeps a full charge all the time.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to go back and get a good review from my Dentist.</li>
            <li> This cleans my teeth perfectly and with daily flossing has allowed my teeth to remain free of decay and gum breakdown through several hygienist visits.</li>
            <li> Overall good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was recommended my our dentist, and after my last check up he said he never saw my gums and teeth look so good.</li>
            <li> Came fast and was able to give as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The rave reviews for these sonic brushes are true....</li>
            <li> He loves it, and obviously it&#x27;s had a good life span.  </li>
            <li> super clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Currently, I have to count to cover all areas uniformly, time wise.  </li>
            <li> However,as stated above, for the price its a really good product.</li>
            <li> Looks about the same and works just as good.  </li>
            <li> A good size for an average-sized mouth - not too big.</li>
            <li> it was a good deal and that it should last forever.  </li>
            <li> If only someone would make a good bathroom caddy for this.</li>
            <li> It also came with a soft travel case which was nice as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling super clean and your gums invigorated.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend, as it is so much better than a manual toothbrush, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I hope that is true.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare brush for several years with good results.</li>
            <li> Love it but replacement heads cost too much.</li>
            <li> A good buy overall.</li>
            <li> as opposed to using his services - he said it would cost me $500 dollars, then laughed and gave me the 2nd</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to ask for a full refund from Philips.  </li>
            <li> but it does have more modern and up-to date features.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I found surprising is that the vibration causes me to salivate like Niagara Falls every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Overall a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush, and I bought one this year for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Hope this one is just as good as the last.</li>
            <li> This one is an improvement, though I would have liked the 30-second timer the old one had.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had more updated models, but this one performs very well.  </li>
            <li> When I stay true to that, I do not have any excess toothpaste gumming up the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I feel better and believe this will really improve your dental health.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise I find what it actually does for my teeth to be good.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a travel bag because they say it lasts 2 weeks on a full charge.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if Sonicare recognized that and fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> It does a very thorough job better than manually or those battery operated rotating tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought since my dentist recommended it, it was cool</li>
            <li> Smile and enjoy</li>
            <li> Oh yes, it took 3 days to get a full charge.</li>
            <li> It really keeps the gums healthy.</li>
            <li> very well, the Sonicare is even better.</li>
            <li> It took me a bit to get used to having all that power in my mouth but after sticking with it I am finding my whole mouth feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> Seems like the same product brushing wise.</li>
            <li> Teeth are cleaner, which is true for any electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The true test will be whether my dentist tells me in 3 months that my gums are improved.</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> so when I needed to replace it, finally, it seemed like a good idea to order online.  </li>
            <li> truly cleans your teeth and if used properly is also good for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Powerful, smooth, compact.</li>
            <li> This is a tried and true product.</li>
            <li> It has the full timer</li>
            <li> This one tickles a bit more but my teeth feel so much cleaner when I am finished.  </li>
            <li> Overall  a good sonic care toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A good basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> After the 12 cycles the brush runs at full speed.</li>
            <li> Feels like you&#x27;ve had a dentist&#x27;s cleaning if you use it for the full timed period.</li>
            <li> and he is more motivated to brush (wants to brush like mom and dad do).</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s full, I leave the toothbrush inside the bathroom and use it until it&#x27;s run out of battery.  </li>
            <li> My dentist told me and its so true.</li>
            <li> and I found it was a lot more gentle on them than a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Not even 2 full years?  </li>
            <li> Once the brush reached full speed</li>
            <li> Not particularly a bad feature but no warning as you approach the day it shuts off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad price</li>
            <li> The sonicare is a nice product, holds a charge for several days, and the replacement heads are easy to install.  </li>
            <li> The original one was still working, but would no longer hold a charge for more than one brushing, so it was not any good if I needed to be away from home for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Excellent dental visit after using for a few months!!</li>
            <li> The motor also seems to have a problem as it doesn&#x27;t run nearly as strong as it did when I first bought it</li>
            <li> Manual one seems to &#x27;deep clean&#x27; more (better reach).  </li>
            <li> Works better than I expected and better than Oral B!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sure that Sonicare is probably the best or least best know electric toothbrush out there</li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference compared to conventional ways of brushing your teeth,  feels great on your gums and cheeks :)</li>
            <li> Now I have to count each time I brush my teeth to make sure I am getting complete &amp;amp; adequate coverage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with how clean the Sonicare makes my teeth feel (it was initially recommended by the woman who cleans my teeth) and how it helps keep plaque under control.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> It works great, just as expected!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare times your brushing to let you know when you&#x27;re done, and it leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.  </li>
            <li> It works great, and unlike that other brand, it will never get clogged up with gunk.  </li>
            <li> A great investment for my teeth and gums, I think this electric toothbrush works extremely well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very small and is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> other than that great product.</li>
            <li> This works great as expected!  </li>
            <li> For the price and how long it last, a good good buy.</li>
            <li> is pretty big and the head does not pop off easy, so having multiple heads for each person in your house is optimistic at best (for the price, you can buy a unit for each person).</li>
            <li> Love my new Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums always feel fresh and clean after brushing my teeth with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> First power toothbrush - works fine I assume.  </li>
            <li> clean and fresh everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it and makes my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and my mouth felt so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Clean teeth are worth the costs.</li>
            <li> My first one was still working fine</li>
            <li> My mouth would always feel clean and fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li> After the first use it was fine though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a decent toothbrush</li>
            <li> Although this is the older model, I love it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a super deal on this toothbrush - not</li>
            <li> The solution to this is after brushing your teeth and rinsing the brush I turn it on again so that the brush shakes off the water and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Item received quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> A beep or a quick on/off/</li>
            <li> The second one took me more than a year to order hoping the experience would be better except this time I noticed that water gets in the compartment where the brush head screws on and off and spawns mold.  </li>
            <li> Loyal Sonicare lover here.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Works awesome, like the last one that worked over TEN YRS!  </li>
            <li> super speedy.</li>
            <li> and I used a Sonicare toothbrush before that which should qualify me as both a &#x27;loyal customer&#x27; and, hopefully, a knowledgeable reviewer for the Essence.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not beat the price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My first sonic toothbrush arrived the first of 2013 and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this brand since it does a super job.</li>
            <li> For me, this sensation is fun and enlivening, though I imagine it would be too intense for many people.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as hoped for, quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted for many many years.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t the mold it can build up in there is truly revolting, it&#x27;s one of my main negatives of owning most electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself and loved it so much that I bought one for everyone in my family including my 7 year old grandson.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly when it does need charging.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Does a super job.</li>
            <li> The more you pay the more bells-n-whistles you get, whether you actually need/use them or not.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> This was quickly shipped to me with no issues.</li>
            <li> The well collects water and quickly develops to mold.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly.</li>
            <li> My dentist has assured me that it has helped with my dental care tremendously.  </li>
            <li> this unit becomes moldy, which it most likely will, I will toss it and look for a better product or start using the manual brushes that my dentist gives to me.</li>
            <li> Ordered, shipped and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> so they would better brush their teeth and know when they needed to move to top, bottom, back &amp; front</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> They are well constructed, easy to use and clean and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love it and amazed at how much better it is than my last one which was an Oral B Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The travel case is nice, but doesn&#x27;t fit the actual charger in it.</li>
            <li> Pro: super job for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Time saving product completely worthy every penny</li>
            <li> I am 77 years old ant the old choppers are in great shape.</li>
            <li> Costco quickly with no questions.</li>
            <li> They worn out so quickly and to replace it</li>
            <li> My most recent cleaning at the dentist was noticeably better.  </li>
            <li> the timer doesn&#x27;t line up with how quickly I am cleaning my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these things and my dentist wishes he could do more deep teeth cleaning....</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss in this model (excellent price, by the way) is the beep every 30 seconds to let you know it is time to move on to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m loyal to this brand since it&#x27;s worked well for</li>
            <li> charges fast easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Enjoy product very much.  </li>
            <li> Love everything about this and highly recommend picking this up if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this, it&#x27;s not an electric brush, it&#x27;s much more like a dental tool.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model based on the high ratings, but am now baffled as to how it got so many.  </li>
            <li> Two minutes can seem like a long time, but it&#x27;s worth the smooth and shiny bright smile.</li>
            <li> High tesh product, will recommend to many people!&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> Really gets your teeth sparkling clean!  </li>
            <li> Special price 39.99 is worth.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it right there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scalding hot water, used Q-tips to clean in the crevices and still - it won&#x27;t stay clean and gives me the creeps to think that this is going into my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for less than 1 week, I am very pleased with the sonicare toothbrush and the results are visible and outstanding.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean right up to 6 month cleanings.</li>
            <li> It actually makes brushing more fun, as well as providing more efficient cleaning.</li>
            <li> chose this rechargeable one instead of the battery operated lower-end model because, with my cheap electric toothbrush I got first</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied, hope my dentist is on my next visit.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Sonic Toothbrushes that are much more effective than this one.  </li>
            <li> It cleans so much better than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but this is my very first review.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> We are aware that for the 2-minute &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; brushing time, some (also adults), prefer and seemingly enjoy the brush quitting, burping out a ding, and then continuing...as a reminder to move-da-brush.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends a small 1/4 inch dab of toothpaste is the ideal amount.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied &amp; wud definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> this is truly an amazing product...much much better than some of the other ones I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush since they first became available through my dentist- around 1994.</li>
            <li> Just checked and the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush which costs 2 bucks more has \\&quot;Quadpacer with 30 second interval timer\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush I&#x27;m sure it cleans just as well as the more expensive versions.</li>
            <li> And - very, very fast Prime delivery!</li>
            <li> This is my very first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; battery-operated toothbrush (replacing my rather abrasive Arm &amp; Hammer).</li>
            <li> long battery life between charges making it good for travel.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money and as with all Sonicare products lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> If it holds up for a good long time I will be ecstatic.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and keeps a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Good product, works well and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> Set up was easy and it works well for him, the handle is a bit large for me</li>
            <li> clean it off daily, but I keep a bottle of peroxide handy and hose it off with it every couple of days</li>
            <li> Amazing feeling!Its like a clean up from the dentist on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare since they first came out, and they make a large contribution to keeping a healthy mouth and gums.</li>
            <li> Such an awesome toothbrush that I&#x27;m ordering a second right now for my Mum.</li>
            <li> She said,  \\&quot;Sonicare&#x27;s clean so thoroughly that it&#x27;s easy for me to tell.\\&quot;  I highly recommend Sonicare</li>
            <li> This is a high quality toothbrush that is easy to clean with.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> i love my new sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this new one more than a month by now, peefect aleays.</li>
            <li> Between this and my new water pik my dental hygene is so much better.</li>
            <li> When I went to pick a new one I didn&#x27;t expect so many choices.  </li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> My kids love their new Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love my new sonic.  </li>
            <li> The new Sonicare cost a lot more for one than we paid for both.</li>
            <li> I had this product for many years and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> As I was looking for a new one I read the reviews of Oral B toothbrushes and decided to give it a try to see if it might be even better.</li>
            <li> I have had one for many years and bought this new one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s an older model I was able to buy the right charger to go with the 2 heads I had.</li>
            <li> This is an great toothbrush, and my dentist has said he seens an improvement in my teeth with less tartar.  </li>
            <li> It works great and is quieter than my previous rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works great, was less money</li>
            <li> This one is just as great as the previous models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really missed that feature which was on my first purchase some many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Works fast, easy to charge, does not hurt my gums, but does massage those well and reduces irritation and bleeding.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really noisy, and it cleans and stores easily.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and is just as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li> EASY TO USE, AND IT CLEANS YOU TEETH VERY</li>
            <li> Luckily I found a deal, but this toothbrush is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li> A minor drawback, though, to an otherwise great electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> gentle thorough toobrush- easy to assemble and charge</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth seemed whiter even after the first couple uses as well!  </li>
            <li> I sure hope it lasts longer than the old one!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Phillips Sonicare--I love it!  </li>
            <li> The effectiveness of the cleaning and the gum stimulation made me a fan with the first brushing session!  </li>
            <li> Makes brushing your teeth so much easier!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for like 4 years and it still works just as well as when I first got it!</li>
            <li> First impression: Wowzers!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are very costly!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a battery charger for my son&#x27;s sonicare (the model escapes me at the moment), but this actually costed a tad bit more than just a battery charger!</li>
            <li> I had to have one exactly like it!</li>
            <li> The new one is so far so good after one month.</li>
            <li> More effective than typical battery-powered toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> and actually I brush more often since it is so easy.  </li>
            <li> The vibration is strong enough to blow (most) of my plaque away AND embarrass me at the airport when picking up my luggage.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and the handle is comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I love that this was the easy open option.</li>
            <li> Better price and an easy open box.</li>
            <li> Those not accustomed to electric brushes might be surprised by the intensity of the vibration, however most people adapt quickly.</li>
            <li> I know I paid many times more for my first Sonicare and definitely got my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> The Oral B toothbrush is very comfortable &amp; it is not harsh.  </li>
            <li> This replaced my old Philips Sonicare toothbrush and I am sold on Sonicare because they last a long time and really do a good job of cleaning my teeth and exercising my gums, which is all-important for great dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Had to replace one that was very old, happy to have it back</li>
            <li> but I like the tooth brush - lasts a long time - my other one lasted years - easy to use, easy to clean - great product</li>
            <li> After my first time I was amazed how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says...gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The Phillips brush vibrates at a much higher speed and leaves my teeth feeling incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> You do need to remove the head and clean these pretty well between each use because the head of the brush can collect stuff in it.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, it came in two days, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> This one is fine and seems to have a much faster charge rate.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to but great  </li>
            <li> Great little tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it can make my teeth very clean and white easily.</li>
            <li> I finally got a very good electric toothbrush that actually works.</li>
            <li> Hoping the battery lasts and I can find replacement brushes easily because this little device is helping me with better oracare and my teeth feel so clean!  </li>
            <li> The power of the brush is great and you don&#x27;t need to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> But instead of rotating or moving much, these bristles vibrate, sort-of buzz and the sound reminds me of a electric hair-clippers (getting a buzz-cut).  </li>
            <li> I also notice that I also notice that my gum sensitivity is no longer an issue as it cleans them very well and the increased brushing of the Philips sonicare HX5610 essence is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and it worked great until it just quit working a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> So cheap and works very well.</li>
            <li> this works great 3 people using it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> It really does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Wife would have liked a more narrow handle.  </li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth amazingly and in a very short time.</li>
            <li> After just one time my teeth felt so much cleaner and smooth.  </li>
            <li> using this everyday, feels great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just an amazing toothbrush, totally unlike any of the powered toothbrushes you buy at the pharmacy or grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its amazing and quiet.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I had an old sonicare for a while and this one seems better.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the cleaning action and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I rarely have dental problems.</li>
            <li> My dentist bills prove the Sonicare is worth owning.</li>
            <li> He kept telling me that I needed to get my own as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and does the job.</li>
            <li> What a difference in my smile , you can feel the improvement</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of it, but after only a couple of months, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore.  </li>
            <li> Another set of fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li> Powerful with a kick.</li>
            <li> Our old one broke after many years.  </li>
            <li> Cleans teeth much better than my old toothbrush</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Much better brushing action than I could ever do with a manual toothbrush...do miss the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; in this model, when it&#x27;s time to switch to another section of teeth during brushing.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> fresh and convenient</li>
            <li> this is definitely worth the price...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li> The noise can bother some, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush definitely is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> It does feel like a really powerful teeth cleaning comparable to that of a dentist.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> and whenever I use it, it gets powerful to help beginners learn how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is way better that my old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the choppers fresh.</li>
            <li> I would have liked an extra charger though.</li>
            <li> much better cleaning than my old Oral B electric.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, toothpaste splattering everywhere</li>
            <li> That means you have to have a clock handy, and remember to look at it,  in order to get all your teeth brushed before it automatically turns off in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Is this worth $40?</li>
            <li> It is worth to buy for price offer.</li>
            <li> I recommend it.way better than my old oral B</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I&#x27;d say this product is well worth the money, and then some.</li>
            <li> This cheaper model is good as, or even better than, then more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Way better than the old fashion toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this recently and has really liked using it.</li>
            <li> My old electric toothbrush stopped working after many years of use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and useful for my needs.</li>
            <li> It charges via the stand which is pretty cool</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it until it become completely unresponsive after about a month.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The old one lasted several years and I have great hopes for this one.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> As far improved an electric is over a manual, this is even more improved over an electric.  </li>
            <li> This has been my favorite electric toothbrush thus far.</li>
            <li> then the old one.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I punched one for my wife, see loves hers also.</li>
            <li> in my opinion, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a brush as powerful as this one before.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have one too and for the cost it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but pretty cool if it does.</li>
            <li> This cleans better than the old Braun toothbrush I used to have.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s actually fun and somehow...ritualistic?</li>
            <li> For the price I paid it is well worth it .</li>
            <li> My wife bought me one of these, and I liked it enough that when hers died I bought her one too.</li>
            <li> gets them nice and white again.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Wow lol yes it functions as an electric toothbrush but the design actually inflicted pain on me...</li>
            <li> Good product as expected.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Sonicare for taking such good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s so powerful that i&#x27;m a bit worried i&#x27;m dehydrating my teeth, that&#x27;s my concern</li>
            <li> but like my old one better.</li>
            <li> I have a sonic toothbrush of the same kind</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s useful for brushing at the gum line.</li>
            <li> When I started getting up and doing the things I needed to do, especially self care, I ordered this toothbrush because to be honest my oral hygiene has been non existent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonic toothbrush for many years, and it was time to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s all still worth it.</li>
            <li> After using it for many years, my old one stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I noticed with my old tooth brushes that it was easy to miss parts of my teeth when brushing, but I&#x27;ve noticed with this toothbrush that my teeth get really clean with 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> It does not have as many functions as my old sonicare</li>
            <li> I always thought &amp;#34;that fresh from the dentist feel&amp;#34; was just marketing BS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a buy but the replacement heads are costly.</li>
            <li> and so far they love it to.</li>
            <li> sure to take the head off and rinse out the inside frequently</li>
            <li> or it will get kind of gross.</li>
            <li> This is completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have to wait until next visit to dentist to see how effective it is.</li>
            <li> felt I had better brushing with my old one.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> My old sonicare the Advance had that feature and it kept by brushing time more on point.</li>
            <li> online price was also far better than in-store.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Well worth it,</li>
            <li> Makes brushing your teeth fun.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and easy on your gums, but still keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be a lot nicer and useful if it were a bit heavier</li>
            <li> I liked the price and that this has a standard shape toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I hate that because that&#x27;s what I loved the best about the sonicare.</li>
            <li> Get all the power of Philips Power Toothbrush and get a brighter smile and fresher breath.</li>
            <li> I just like the performance of this one far better.</li>
            <li> , I liked the toothbrush, so I ordered the same model.  </li>
            <li> I initially gave this Sonicare toothbrush 3 stars because my experience with it was rather ticklish, plus I found that \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; with it is kind of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> i think the old design is more robust.</li>
            <li> A positive brushing stroke produced sonically to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> highly recommended and easy to use.</li>
            <li> With the right toothbrush end, this brush is more powerful than my old one.  </li>
            <li> - works good and hold battery for pretty long time!</li>
            <li> Because I am right handed, I had difficulty in attempting to retrain my left hand to effectively brush my teeth....</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush purchase and so far I am completely satisfied, nice product and this one appears to be easier top clean up than the last one as well.</li>
            <li> One tip, when buying replacement heads do not get the generic replacements from CVS or other outlets; those are much louder on the vibration and the head doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well or as comfortably; that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like an earthquake in my mouth&amp;#34; but it cleans my teeth very well, and the timer is very useful.</li>
            <li> But, overall the toothbrush works great and it has a two year warranty, more than any other manufacturer out there.</li>
            <li> The various brushes have pretty minuscule cleaning advantages/disadvantages, but I was able to find an academic article that made me more confident in choosing the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bouth it for my son and he brushes his tooth more now due to the fact he likes it better.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is much better than the e-toothbrush I got from other brand.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good one I am sure but it would not fit the brushes that I have from an older model.  </li>
            <li> After the USPS lost the first order, Amazon quickly sent out another.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that Amazon offered a single, and the price was lower than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> I totally enjoy my brushing experience, my teeth feel clean and look professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> My wisdom teeth are in, and they don&#x27;t need to come out, but it&#x27;s critical to keep them clean and my Sonicare is able to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you decide to buy one be aware that you M-U-S-T clean that portion of the head after E-A-C-H use with hot water.</li>
            <li> this is the second one that I bought and I absolutely love how it makes my teeth feel clean and my dentist noticed the difference too.</li>
            <li> This particular unit is one of the more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It keeps the teeth clean and makes him feel better than the traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had an older model and after several years of good service</li>
            <li> I had an older model Sonicare toothbrush which gave me good service for several years.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this replacement for my older model Sonicare that finally refused to recharge.  </li>
            <li> It does get gross if you don&#x27;t clean it very often, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> it basically because of the price and the other good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you turn it on other wise</li>
            <li> like it almost as much as the original.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare, but I doubt that any other type of electric toothbrush could be as good.  </li>
            <li> We have used sonicare for more than 25 years and found their products to be good quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful value as the toothbrush is easy to use--cleans as well as the larger more expensive models and can be used for travel.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much but would be nice to have the 30 second timer.  </li>
            <li> right you are beyond all reason.</li>
            <li> Even though I brush right after each meal, I have had staining that occurs where my gums are recessed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe nobody can do it right.  </li>
            <li> Hygienist noticed right away.</li>
            <li> Bought this right after my insurance rates went up dramatically and had to drop my dental coverage.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> I got it out and used it right a way.</li>
            <li> Also the price was right.</li>
            <li> The price was right compared to buying anew at the store.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but the automatic built in break in period is just about right.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it does everything it says it does.</li>
            <li> Right priced.</li>
            <li> Worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li> This was the right item and well priced.</li>
            <li> I charged it right away and the charge has lasted for weeks.  </li>
            <li> have MS and my right hand (dominate hand)</li>
            <li> This product was priced right</li>
            <li> I was right and now that my right hand is well I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Mechanical toothbrush needed while right arm is in a sling.  </li>
            <li> It will take stains right off your teeth and leaves the enamel intact.</li>
            <li> , pricing was just right for me.</li>
            <li> It came in the right amount of time and was what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> right now it does the job,and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Seems like I started noticing whiter teeth right away.</li>
            <li> The quality is there and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Although Sonicare brushes have served us well for years, I discovered after purchase that it does not have the &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; feature to help get the right coverage of each of the 4 tooth surface areas.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and battery lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t be the right ones for my older sonicare, but they fit and work well.</li>
            <li> I must laugh at this purchase, although it was shipped quickly, priced right, and arrived in great condition, the person I bought it for said it was just confusing for him to use to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to get an older version of this product, but it wasn&#x27;t available anywhere I searched.  </li>
            <li> I think these toothbrushes really make your mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it tickles and makes my mouth really itchy, but my teeth do feel really clean after.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brush works very well and teeth feel clean when done.  </li>
            <li> Getting ready to go the dentist, but my teeth feel so clean after brushing with sonicare.</li>
            <li> This brush makes it so much easier to clean</li>
            <li> Clean very well head worn quic</li>
            <li> so I was really struck by how clean (un slimey)</li>
            <li> ~$30, this toothbrush really helped me maintain a clean oral hygiene routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really makes your mouth feel clean after you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats Sonicare for really getting your teeth REALLY clean.</li>
            <li> It makes your whole mouth feel clean and doesn&#x27;t hurt like some others do.</li>
            <li> Love this model as the toothbrush head is really a great size for me (smaller than previous models I have used).  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done, no matter how much chocolate and caramel I have wedged in my teeth.</li>
            <li> It can clean my tooth very well.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone who wants clean.</li>
            <li> whole process makes me mouth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s the best thirty bucks I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really gets them clean and helps with plaque.</li>
            <li> Its ok of a tooth brush, not as good as the more expensive ones but better than a standard brush</li>
            <li> It is not shaky at all but is wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li> They make your teeth feel so clean and are very durable.  </li>
            <li> whole idea is to let the ultrasonic waves do most of the cleaning, not hard brushing.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am a major fan.  </li>
            <li> Ever since i purchased my 1st sonicare toothbrush, no other brand will do, really love the product.</li>
            <li> The feed back I got on this product, is the recipient simply loves it and is very happy to receive such a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li> This new model is much lighter and seems to be more efficient...as efficient as an electric toothbrush can be.  </li>
            <li> + ago) and decided to just get a whole new set, since it was on sale for about $10 more than just the charger.</li>
            <li> so ordered this one loved the new blue color line !</li>
            <li> When they are relatively new, say a year or two old, they will go a week without having to recharge them - handy for not needing to pack the recharger when on vacation.  </li>
            <li> It was a great price around black Friday, but I really wish I had purchased this from another vendor instead.</li>
            <li> However,  this latest one is an improvement over the previous ones in that the brush oscillations are much more vigorous, with a longer stroke.  </li>
            <li> I love that this one is lighter weight and more maneuverable than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I have alwasy liked the Phillips toothbrushes, but I ordered this one too quick and did not realize that it did have the feature that have interval (30 sec) signals that tells you to move to another quardrant of your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonic--they are incredible at keeping tartar down and your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> This was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift since my husband had been using the manual version his whole life previously.</li>
            <li> Definitely scrubs away plaque much better than a manual toothbrush leaving your teeth feeling super clean/smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great, but this is our second one, because the battery (NiMH) eventually will not hold a charge for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> pretty powerful, works well</li>
            <li> Costs a bit more than the old reliable toothbrush, but you really do get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> My old tooth brush was on its last-leg and was dead on arrival, too many choices online to choose from but this item is a good replacement.</li>
            <li> -often to keep your mouth from becoming overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It works great, as usual, but I miss the timer, as it keeps me on track.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tooth bush and an improvement over past models on all counts save one.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning action is excellent and the two minute timed cleaning cycle has actually trained me to use it for the entire time until it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li> you want great results, white shiners and fresh smelling breath look no further than this bargai!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads are very good,I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it made my teeth feel any more clean or look any more white than my Colgate Optic White toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I buy generic replacement heads at a lower price and they work and fit fine.</li>
            <li> and it really was impressively clean at first brush</li>
            <li> I have made a point to clean this area every month using intense hot water and dishsoap, then drying it.</li>
            <li> The original older model like this one lasted for 4 yrs.</li>
            <li> I liked the hard case that I had before better.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed, I filled out a return on amazon so that we could get a new one.</li>
            <li> readily available new heads.</li>
            <li> time with the new \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; on which the charging light stays on 24/7 after 2 weeks of ownership.</li>
            <li> so it would fit in the new handle.  </li>
            <li> We bought this on the recommendation of our dentist &amp; it certainly has proven that they know what they are talking about!</li>
            <li> If is your first time with Electric Toothbrush this is the right product.</li>
            <li> Simple packaging, for such a great toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I changed back and this is solid and it works great.</li>
            <li> A good product but water builds up inside and turns black.</li>
            <li> It came super fast.</li>
            <li> today I&#x27;d definitely go with the more affordable Essence and use the savings to buy my a couple of years worth of brush heads.eth.</li>
            <li> today I&#x27;d definitely go with the more affordable Essence and use the savings to buy my a couple of years worth of brush heads.</li>
            <li> seem good, used half one month</li>
            <li> I have only had this for 3 days, and can not tell you enough how great this brush is.  </li>
            <li> However, the device is loud and top bristles oscillates so fast, it looks like its gon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and love that it comes with a portable bag for my future travels.</li>
            <li> Great service, arrived in couple days &amp; price was same as the lowest prices advertised in local stores.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes really help with periodontal disease, my dental hygienist recommended it, and it has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer my old WaterPic, (better head, quieter) but will wait till this one quits to replace it.</li>
            <li> But it works as advertised, and does a great job if used daily as recommended, along with flossing!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> , I used this a few times and got some nice smooth teeth.</li>
            <li> My last one worked great for years, I hope this does the same.</li>
            <li> Plus they had super fast delivery</li>
            <li> He says my last check-up was great and asked me what I had done different.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how expensive these still are, but good for Philips that they own this franchise</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is great but this one makes changing brushes more difficult.  </li>
            <li> it works as it shall be, like a old pal without handsome  words but always ready to help you in need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the previous oral b</li>
            <li> The pulsating/sonic action is extremely strong and jarring for anyone not use to it (i.e. me).  </li>
            <li> looked everywhere for an extra toothbrush for traveling, this was such a great deal I bought 2 to have one for a gift.</li>
            <li> THere are better models (Braun) that seem to clean to tongue better than this one does, but I am not dissatisfied in the least.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m happy with the price, since most of Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> Even this lowest priced one does essentially the same great job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is a very basic Sonicare model, but it definitely does a great job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend buying the Sonicare HX6511 Easy Clean, which is designed differently.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my old Sonicare that broke after several years of good service.</li>
            <li> My previous one had two speeds, this one has one, but I still like it and this is a good price</li>
            <li> a great value compared to more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> It took me three days to clean it using hydrogen peroxide and blasting the interior with high pressure from my Water Pic.</li>
            <li> The top and bottom of the toothbrush screw together, but not tightly, and it giggles apart a bit, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem.  </li>
            <li> I know his mom paid about $80 for his, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I found such a great deal on the exact same model on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with the first one i bought that i bought the same one for the 2nd house.</li>
            <li> In the past 6 months I&#x27;ve made it my goal (with the help of my dentist) to have the healthiest, cleanest and whitest smile possible in preparation for my best friend&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that  I bought a second for the bathroom on the first floor,</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean and I finally brush for a full two minutes (goes by quicker than I thought).</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re on a tight budget and want a replacement for a manual toothbrush this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the same on this site, at a much more reasonable price than the local stores.  </li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this all the time and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Like it very much.  </li>
            <li> The price of this replacement was very reasonable and&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li> She seems to like it very much.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> thank you very much ,</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Really surpassed expectations, very different (and much more effective) compared to a traditional brush.</li>
            <li> My old one was great only reason purchased new the batteries died after 15years.</li>
            <li> This model did not have the 30 second timer in it, but it is OK as the clock in my head is pretty much right.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get used to it, but it works just fine so far.</li>
            <li> The old model was velcro and worked fine...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;working fine for about a week so far.  </li>
            <li> Even after drinking a cup of coffee, I run my tongue across my teeth and there is nothing, no food particles, no scum; just a clean feeling like you get after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> You could brush for an hour with a normal toothbrush and not be as clean as this device makes them in 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Good for people who brush too hard makes your teeth feel like they are getting clean even without scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I was pleased, it was sent quickly and I have owned one before but really like the next model.  </li>
            <li> It came with 2 new heads, charges right up and is full of speed.</li>
            <li> Better clean than a standard toothbrush, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth so smooth and clean, it feels like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> The old one worked fine, but when I packed it to take it on a trip (first time it had been out of the charger for any length of time)</li>
            <li> I guess my main gripe is that eventually crud gets into the cavity inside the replaceable brush modules and gets kind of gross.  </li>
            <li> even if u clean it use hot water to clean it pop it loose to clean where the battery is also every three months</li>
            <li> and I use a little warm water and s cap full of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> At first my teeth were sensitive because I wasn&#x27;t used to such high force of a vibration from a tooth brush, but it is nice!</li>
            <li> I has a two-minute timer, but it does NOT have the 30-second intervals to remind you to switch to a new section to clean in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I imagine new ones are easier to clean.</li>
            <li> So I returned it and bought a different model that works better.</li>
            <li> And this is my first electric toothbrush, so maybe it&#x27;s with this toothbrush or maybe electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try something else, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> This one has no bells and whistles but cleans my teeth just as well because I didn&#x27;t have time in my life to use the bells and whistles in the first place.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement one and just love it and have no doubts it will last for years to come.</li>
            <li> Over time, I’m sure that the battery life will degrade; currently it lasts 2-3 weeks before it needs recharged.</li>
            <li> I abosolutely love them after using them you can&#x27;t go back to using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> the first Sonicare</li>
            <li> and I see no change in functionality since I first bought.</li>
            <li> With the first elec.</li>
            <li> Performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted ~20 years with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had before</li>
            <li> Love it, I couldn&#x27;t go back to reg toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My first one quit after 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I am not sorry for product</li>
            <li> This results in improved teeth cleaning in my opinion, although it takes some getting used to and may leave you with sore gums for the first week or so.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not the case.</li>
            <li> This thing really works!</li>
            <li> I feel like it really gets to the core and cleans my teeth well!</li>
            <li> Will update later once I&#x27;ve had the chance to use it more</li>
            <li> works great, have been using one since the late 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> First off let me start by adding that this products does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> We purchased the \\&quot;hassle free\\&quot; packaging...don&#x27;t know what that means, exactly, but the product wasn&#x27;t encased in hard-to-get-into plastic.  </li>
            <li> not even better than a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li> And on top of that I only paid 16$ for it!</li>
            <li> like he had just been to the dentist and he was brushing his teeth for the first time at home.</li>
            <li> and it claimed to be an upgrade from the first model</li>
            <li> I wanted my husband to be able to open it on Christmas</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted me 8 years.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush, so for me it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Not so much!  </li>
            <li> It tickled a bit at first</li>
            <li> Love this product especially when there are coupons for discounts!</li>
            <li> It has a built in feature that allows you to &amp;#34;get used&amp;#34; to the vibration over the first 12 times you use it.</li>
            <li> The first time I went to this dentist, he suggested I switch from Oral B to this Sonicare Electric toothbrush, so I did.</li>
            <li> At first I did not use it consistently, but now I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is supposed to beep twice when it is in the lower speed mode, and once in the higher.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because we love sonicare and suddenly stopped to work.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is timed and will turn off after a minute of deep teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> It looked like my first one but instead of having a gauge to check the battery</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for many years but recently bought this model with charger and carry case.</li>
            <li> Be patient when you first charge the unit.</li>
            <li> I recently had to put my first one to rest after more than a decade.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Philips sonicare I purchase</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted for about 8 years, it was a champ.</li>
            <li> This is my second electric tooth brush and the essence 5600 is ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all of the dentists out there would scoff at my not flossing, but with this toothbrush, it&#x27;s just not necessary.</li>
            <li> very wasteful design!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the first one of these I have received.  </li>
            <li> this my second one,  the first one lasted for 10 years,  what could be better?????????????  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The product is exactly like the one it is replacing.  </li>
            <li> Even my dentist said, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t bother with all the fancy add-ons; get the most basic model,&amp;#34;  so I did.  </li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> All-in-all, love this toothbrush and have purchased for the entire family.</li>
            <li> I had the same one for many years  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find the same brush which I have been using for 15 years.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I wish I had one when I was younger, it would have prevented more cavities.</li>
            <li> , I had my first post-Sonicare teeth cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Another year, and two more teeth cleanings later</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is is supposed to do</li>
            <li> I do brush my teeth twice a day, but I never seen able to properly scrub everything off.</li>
            <li> I think this device is partly responsible for that!</li>
            <li> and the instructions do say it will tickle the mouth at first -- which it does.</li>
            <li> It tickles at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m getting a better cleaning than my regular tooth brush with it.</li>
            <li> It was instant love for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing but not as protective as the Advance&#x27;s solid plastic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing but not as protective as the Advance&#x27;s solid plastic</li>
            <li> I have lower teeth that were worn and yellow across the top</li>
            <li> No need for the higher end one in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is well made and seems to work well better than a similar product I have used</li>
            <li> Love the power of this toothbrush and charge last for weeks.</li>
            <li> My first 2 lasted @</li>
            <li> The first one lasted over 3 years.</li>
            <li> This was my first Sonic brush.  </li>
            <li> Must first charge for 24 hours, as instructed,the</li>
            <li> My teeth were visibly whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I recommend Philips Sonicare to anyone who is interested in maintaining and keeping their teeth.  </li>
            <li> The younger you start, the better</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s the second one I have owned</li>
            <li> Cleans much better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for 5 years now and will never be able to go back.  </li>
            <li> This is such a crummy throw-in item, they&#x27;d have been better off not including it at all.  </li>
            <li> and i know it works better then the traditional brushing methods.</li>
            <li> Works well, better than using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This one will definitely last longer, and hold a charge better.</li>
            <li> I went almost 2-1/2 years without going to the dentist, and went I finally was able to go in, they said my teeth were spotless-</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I used manual toothbrushes and more recently, several battery-operated brushes.</li>
            <li> These our first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is his first one.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I wish I had done this years ago.  </li>
            <li> Not knowing this I bought him his first one and he also likes it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact head for the smaller size and can do a better job cleaning.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to find, but the Essence series Sonicare toothbrushes are excellent for cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there&#x27;s a higher quality alternative to Philips on the market...</li>
            <li> this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve had a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare replaces another similar one which we had for many years that stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> plus the 80 dollar one has a different industrial design which is cleaner, thinner, and therefore, better.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how much cleaner this brush gets your teeth!  </li>
            <li> its then that you really can tell and it makes you wish you had taken the time to pack your electric one!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> One word of warning: the first 2-3 times you use it, the vibration tickles the inside of your mouth a bit and takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Will see at next dental exam if better results</li>
            <li> This is my first electric brush.  </li>
            <li> If, as they say, this is the &amp;#34;gentler version&amp;#34; during the first two weeks of use to prepare you for the real-deal mode of teeth cleaning, I am a bit nervous.</li>
            <li> I lost the first one in a hotel while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had the first one for over 2 years and it would probably have gone longer if I had not lost it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to operate exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It finally died (it did not recharge any more).  </li>
            <li> the motor really kicks butt!  </li>
            <li> First one still worked</li>
            <li> It was the first time she&#x27;s ever said that to me.</li>
            <li> Have had several Sonicare toothbrushes over the years and love them.  </li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This most recent Sonicare works well for us, as we expect it to.  </li>
            <li> better than regular tootbrush.</li>
            <li> This is one of many Sonicares I have purchased for my entire family.</li>
            <li> i noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> The battery on the first unit stopped charging after 10 years.</li>
            <li> It also reaches the back teeth better than an manual.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to buy the more basic Essence 5600 Rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> yeah, its definitely worth the money as your teeth will be so much</li>
            <li> the back of teeth on top.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for three years now and have had zero problems for the first time in my life after averaging about a cavity a year.</li>
            <li> sleeper!&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work ok but not sure if its really better than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are pretty pricey though running about $12.00 each</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t believe this is healthy and personally think Sonicare should discontinue this model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; tooth brush</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it any higher, and just bought one for my partner too.</li>
            <li> I had a more expensive one before that was better, but it was around 25% more.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Reliable, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and well priced</li>
            <li> Water leaked into the battery compartment upon first use.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted and came as advertised.</li>
            <li> By the way, this is the first mechanical brush I have owned</li>
            <li> you first use this brush, and if it&#x27;s your first time using a battery-powered brush, you&#x27;re going to feel a lot of noise in your mouth, traveling up to your head.</li>
            <li> At this point, I can&#x27;t exactly recall what that feels like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During a standard cleaning of the top battery water entered the brush and destroyed it.</li>
            <li> Purchased several more.</li>
            <li> But it brushes very well!  </li>
            <li> This being my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> First Philips lasted five years.  </li>
            <li> I like the rechargeable battery much better than having to replace regular batteries</li>
            <li> the top doesn&#x27;t connect proper and gets  toothpaste inside having to clean&lt;br /&gt;every</li>
            <li> The first step was to upgrade my toothbrush from my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to use this product for exactly 2 minutes,</li>
            <li> but it is my first Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have now upgraded to the higher priced version.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the Healthy White Plus model --</li>
            <li> The first (non-Sonicare) lasted a couple years.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare - most of a decade.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my Sonicare essence 5600 and the 2 extra brushes I purchased.  </li>
            <li> After I first used this I said to myself</li>
            <li> I could literally see the difference after the first time I used the brush.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery &#x3D; THANKS!  </li>
            <li> Comes with charger and travel pouch, in generic, frustration free packaging, Yay!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about four years before the power button collapsed.</li>
            <li> Tomorrow I have my first appointment since I started using this brush and look forward to her response.</li>
            <li> These can be expensive and this was the best value I found.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted 5 yrs no problems.</li>
            <li> No issues at all, all working parts and instructions, yet MUCH cheaper than purchasing in store!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and had one when I was younger....</li>
            <li> The most recent purchase was for my wife.  </li>
            <li> It works well and after a full day of a blinking light, it finally fully charged.  </li>
            <li> At first this will train your gums and teeth at a slower speed then increase gradually.</li>
            <li> I like how it eases you into using it by increasing the intensity throughout the first 12 uses or so.</li>
            <li> Your charge lasts a long time, probably around 1 month without needing to recharge and the extra carrying case is great for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It does tingle in the beginning if it is your first time using a Sonic toothbrush,</li>
            <li> It is his first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that did not come with the feature that lets you know when to move the toothbrush to another area.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought got rujined</li>
            <li> it first came on the market I bought it through the Canadian Shopping Channel&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had had this product earlier I would have been able to save the lost tooth as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really efficient! :</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using a regular toothbrush any more.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time, and do a great job.  </li>
            <li> It works with internal magnets that somehow produce sonic waves rather than mechanical abrasion like manual toothbrushes and most electric brushes that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has been using cheaper battery components since I first used their electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> My first toothbrush took 6 years before it lost the capacity to fully charge a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It vibrated so much at first</li>
            <li> Charges fast!</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li> Make sure you only brush for the allotted time.</li>
            <li> My first brush lasted 7 years before it stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> This replaces my first Sonicare toothbrush, which helped my gum health, according to my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> It really works well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say more after my next dental checkup.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted for years</li>
            <li> My first sonicare was given to me as a gift over 15+ years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smooth, minimal seams design means they don&#x27;t build up anywhere near as much grunge as my old one - the wireless charging is a great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got my first Sonicare Essence (5300) rechargeable electric toothbrush as a perk from my health insurance company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in the ionic toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Does not have the 4 short pauses indicating when to change sides, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in to charge - that first charge did take about 30 hours to fully charge the unit up -</li>
            <li> Love it, this last forever.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, this is my second one</li>
            <li> My first one quit working after about 6 years.  </li>
            <li> The was the first sonicare I owned before I upgraded to the healthy white model.</li>
            <li> Also the brush head is a pretty big assembly that screws onto the top.</li>
            <li> I actually DID get a better checkup at the dentist because I was using the Sonicare, so I bought another one for a family member and my daughter bought one too.  </li>
            <li> The zipper split the first time I used it, and since then it doesn&#x27;t zip at all.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush purchase</li>
            <li> This one is much different and works much better.  </li>
            <li> Two minute timer ensures a consistent brush every time.  </li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth better than a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ll start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was first recommended to me by my dentist</li>
            <li> and I recall my dental hygienist&#x27;s comment on my first check-up after using my Sonicare for six months.  </li>
            <li> My family has 4, so obviously we&#x27;re quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Why so many, I have property in different places and keep a unit at each location!!!  </li>
            <li> After using the Oral-B brush for years, and feeling like the brush was pretty aggressive on my teeth, I did not worry about it until my dentist pointed out that the brush needs to be softer or it damages gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush - this is my second one.  </li>
            <li> I would give this brush 5 stars, except that while it has a 2 minute timer, it does not beep every 30 seconds so you can be sure to brush all your teeth equally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend it and do not look further:-)</li>
            <li> Our first Sonicare lasted years and years and years.  </li>
            <li> As expected, this Sonicare product is just as effective as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> Bought to try this at first since it was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> Of great importance, the unit holds a charge for a long time, several days-five days easily-and then I charge it so that it never runs out.  </li>
            <li> But this one is a bit better than the last one that I had in that problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for 10+ years and this one is every bit as efficient as the first one.  </li>
            <li> This is my first powered toothbrush and I was sold after the first use.</li>
            <li> Tingles at first until you get used to it</li>
            <li> Lastly, I should be able to switch out the brush at will, not the entire top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will feel the same as she gets used to using her Essence.</li>
            <li> It feels funny at first brushing with this</li>
            <li> As my heading states, with the two-minute auto-cut-off, it makes sure you do brush your teeth &amp;#34;long enough&amp;#34;, i.e. properly.</li>
            <li> Though this is the simpler version of what has many different kinds and features now, it still does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> As a user of a Sonicare toothbrush for many years I am pleased to report that you do not need all of the bells and whistles that the more expensive Sonicare models have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but you gotta buy a more recent model, I think.</li>
            <li> My OralB electric died after 9 years so I decided to purchase this unit based on infomercials when product first came into the market years ago.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what my periodontist wanted me to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this simple toothbrush</li>
            <li> When I first got my e series</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> and I have replaced it twice since then - says much for the longevity!..</li>
            <li> For the price of it, it does exactly what you need an electric toothbrush to do.</li>
            <li> The written ad content should be more specific in providing information as to which models have that added feature.</li>
            <li> Ive had this toothbrush for about 2 years and it works great the battery stays charged for at least a month still.</li>
            <li> OLD MAN WITH FREE CHECK UP TWICE A YEAR</li>
            <li> After a recommendation from my dentist to go with Sonicare over the Oral-B, not only did I save money, but I love my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> is very costly!</li>
            <li> Am thoroughly pleased with this product for ease of use, battery longevity, and low cost.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Cheap, works just like my old one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my old charger</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will purchase something better in the future.</li>
            <li> #34;step-up&amp;#34; to a higher level.  </li>
            <li> The comparison chart here on Amazon was helpful as well for a first time re-chargeable Sonicare brush buyer like me.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li> Finally wore out my first Sonicare brush after many years.........</li>
            <li> First time trying one of these &#x27;sonic&#x27; tooth brushes.. I have to say, it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling</li>
            <li> Amazed at how well this product really works!  </li>
            <li> just got done using it for the first time, and</li>
            <li> This replaces similar models with more that five years use.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 11 years before battery died.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it worked the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a number of years now and my dentist says my teeth are in much better shape than they were when I used a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> what they use to tell you to do when first tb came out on the market and have just kept on doing</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service more than 5 times and they have not gotten back to me.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than before!</li>
            <li> I should have done more homework before I bought this model, but I would also give Philips feedback that this is a basic feature that should be included on all models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Philips Essence toothbrushes and love them.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to replace the exact model, after 3 years.  </li>
            <li> and it stayed revved up the whole time!</li>
            <li> I turned it on for the first time and I was like &amp;#34;yoooo</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times that I used it</li>
            <li> This works well in that it automatically stops at exactly two minutes.</li>
            <li> first  Sonicare</li>
            <li> The price certainly was right</li>
            <li> Thie toothbrush replaces a similar one purchased many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Glad to come back to this, plus my dentist is happy.l</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 18 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this model for more than 5 years and it finally broke.  </li>
            <li> This is a really food preventative maintenance tool!</li>
            <li> First Sonicare purchase.</li>
            <li> It operated  exactly as described</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t love the experience, but I do like it, especially the results!  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Bought the first one because my dentist recommended it and had a brochure on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I would pay more for a brush that keeps everything the same but eliminates those two problems.</li>
            <li> So I thought for christmas I would spend a few dollars on him a good one.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, regret did not have to buy a few brush head</li>
            <li> The new, smaller travel bag is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought one with a sensitive brush head because this tooth brush is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> It arrived fast and was priced fairly ( a bit less than the reatil stores).</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is much more effective than both regular and the other cheaper electric ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> My mean dentist said that I was doing a great job brushing.</li>
            <li> Our original Sonicare was more that ten years old.  </li>
            <li> My mother in law bought the whole family sonicare tooth brushes right after they came out.</li>
            <li> The modes of the other units (tongue cleaning, gum care, etc) are cool, but the reality is most people won&#x27;t use those features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not fully satisfied with is that it isn&#x27;t completely sealed and gets a bit yucky inside if you don&#x27;t maticulously clean it after each use.</li>
            <li> it shakes so intensely that you feel only a need to press very lightly.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are feeling very clean and look white.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty good, but when it wears out, I&#x27;m going back to the Oral B.</li>
            <li> The brush has a mind of its own; sometimes the charge lasts for a while other times it shuts off on you while you&#x27;re brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked that feature and was not aware that the one I purchased did not have it.  </li>
            <li> I love the timer on it which makes sure I brush for long enough.  </li>
            <li> Loud, but you get used to it- also totally worth it for the whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> first reaction was WOW, this is so much better than my old Sonicare ever was.</li>
            <li> When the Advance died on Tuesday of this past week I ordered this from Amazon and was sure glad for the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Man this thing can clean teeth like your favorite hygienist, only no sharp hook!</li>
            <li> I really love this product, make brush teeth fun and easy to reach the area that are hard to reach</li>
            <li> I tell you what, my mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this fresh from just using a new toothbrush before!</li>
            <li> Battery works a long time and the brush heads are very comfortable on gums</li>
            <li> Really the first true upgrade to brushing, can&#x27;t wait to show off my new gums to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This unit is great, the stem is narrow, easy to reach for those back teeth, the stand is lighter and easier to dock the hand unit.. if you are looking for a new brush, get this one..</li>
            <li> Wow, this is such an amazing deal.  </li>
            <li> Better clean in half the time.</li>
            <li> I more or less guess when it&#x27;s time to move parts of my mouth and my teeth feel squeaky clean afterward.</li>
            <li> my dentist always mentions that it&#x27;s clear I keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clean nearly as well as this one with the vibration.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still surprised every time I brush at just how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> They do come clean (as far in as I can see...)</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller brushheads to be sure i get to my back teeth easily, per dentist suggestion.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel as clean as after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel as clean as they do after professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Yes I replace on charger immediately and clean the machine frequently....</li>
            <li> This is the older model but it&#x27;s price is worth it.</li>
            <li> What we both noticed the most was how obvious the spots we missed were - making easy to go back and get those pesky spots.</li>
            <li> I clean it out frequently and there is no stopping the problem.</li>
            <li> You have to unscrew the head, clean the insides out with  a Q-tip and old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel dentist visit clean after using it just like the old one.  </li>
            <li> charge has worked well so far and my teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li> When it was also leaking just the same I returned and bought again the same product, now from Amazon trusting it will not be faulty building on my good experience with the company.  </li>
            <li> The newer size of the brush is far better than my old head.</li>
            <li> I understand that for people who have used more expensive version, this toothbrush did not get good reviews.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a good value, there is a noticeable difference in how it operates compared to more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li> The soft case is more convenient than the plastic case that was part of the old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoying this item everyday and thank you for a good price and fast delivery...Will do business again and again..</li>
            <li> Not cheap to replace that much stuff that still looks good.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, and my teeth feel so much cleaner than using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap, but the results make it worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> good price and works just as well as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for several years and can&#x27;t say enough good about them.  </li>
            <li> This brush works very well, and I&#x27;m pleased with the actual product.</li>
            <li> The sonicare Essence is a good toothbrush especially if you are short on cash.  </li>
            <li> Wow, even more vigorous cleaning action.</li>
            <li> I was glad to get it again at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have the nicer sonicare unit that has a smaller handle part and significantly more intense &amp;#34;vibration&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And this one does just as good of a job as their more expensive models.</li>
            <li> In fact, I brushed much longer than the two minutes because I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Packing seems to be not-so-great as the first brush I received had a large slice into the handle (plastic wrapping was sliced as well, but the shipping box was undamaged).</li>
            <li> After the first month, I removed the toothbrush head and found a large accumulation of toothpaste and moisture.  </li>
            <li> The main benefit to this kind of toothbrush is that I used to get about one cavity every two years or so, and I literally have not had a single one since I started using Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much - my teeth feel so much cleaner than when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I barely have to put any action into my brushing movements and it leaves my teeth wonderfully smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> on the power--the brush is powerful, but it ramps up the speed over your first week to get your gums used to the new movement.&lt;br /&gt;Sleek charging stand&lt;br /&gt;Dishwasher</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after brushing, I love the built in 2 minute timer and the charge lasts for over a week at least (I can attest to that).</li>
            <li> Good value.&lt;br /&gt;Had replacement brushes which only fit a few models.</li>
            <li> I was using a manual toothbrush, and have not been satisfied with it in a long time.  </li>
            <li> If it tickles your gums too much when you first use it, you can solve this by using an oral irrigator for a while before you use the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would tickle too much</li>
            <li> Happily, I had used my last Sonicare long enough to have my own timer internally now.</li>
            <li> It continues to perform very well and holds a charge just as well as it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> After just one brush, my teeth felt better than they have in a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought a Sonicare FlexCare Plus which is a higher end model costing four times as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the upgrade to a better version and one that has the intervals to tell you when to switch to cleaning other areas of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The long, slender brush seems to allow me to gain better access to the harder-to-reach areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Can happily say I&#x27;m never going back to other toothbrush brands again.</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t come with a timer of flat screen TV on the handle, but I don&#x27;t really need those anyway.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare brushes but it is definitely worth it to upgrade to a model that uses the other style of brush head.  </li>
            <li> but I must say I really do see a noticeable difference in the cleanliness of my teeth even after just the first use.  </li>
            <li> At first he had to get used to the vibrations, but now he says he really likes the way it cleans his teeth.  </li>
            <li> They pretty much blew me off and said that was the way they are now..</li>
            <li> The slower gentler cycle that you initially experience is great especially because the brush is a soft brush</li>
            <li> I love the product, though I am wondering just HOW LONG it takes to charge up?  </li>
            <li> First time I used it, it tickled so much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are all pretty much alike when it comes to cleaning them.  </li>
            <li> it was not until I got my first Sonicare that I saw a real improvement in cleaning.</li>
            <li> really like the Sonicare line and think it should be considered first by anyone looking to get an electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I should preface this review that this is the first real re-chargeable electric toothbrush I have owned.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s pretty much all</li>
            <li> Love it that I can go on a week long business trip and not have to worry about charging it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this toothbrush and think it does a great job of cleaning my teeth, I will, however, echo the cons of some other reviewers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Philips Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;d had for the past five years which I loved.</li>
            <li> If you used Sonicare in the past and loved the Quadpacer  feature -- don&#x27;t expect this model to have it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes in the past but none as good as this.  </li>
            <li> You can usually get good deals on multi-packs of the heads.  </li>
            <li> I realize that I should have done a bit more research before buying (my fault); however, I think the fact that it ONLY works on certain voltages and you can&#x27;t even use transformers to make up the difference is pretty heinous because it forces you to buy a model with more bells and whistles than you want, just for the ability to charge it in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks and love the clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel extra clean ^ fresh.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of toothbrush for several years and my denist keeps telling me that it has kept my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This same toothbrush would have cost be double locally, but I was able to order a new one after I dropped and broke my old one right from the comfort of my own home!</li>
            <li> Seems easy to use, takes up little space and works fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush -- cleans really well -- but it&#x27;s so loud it actually wakes my son up in the room next to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a little bit more money and get the quadpacer!</li>
            <li> I am pleased to spend so little money and so little time twice a day to have a fresh-smelling breath and nice clean teeth and mouth..</li>
            <li> case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleased with Sonicare for very long and will continue to buy their products.  </li>
            <li> This is obviously some Marketing driven scheme to drive people to the higher priced, feature filled tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I even sent one to my father who, as you might imagine doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the idea that he needs an upgrade in how he needs to brush his teeth much less from someone he taught how to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to clean all the brush parts properly and regularly.</li>
            <li> not just because it makes brushing so easy, but because you simply cannot duplicate the cleaning ability or the correct brushing techniques.  </li>
            <li> It also compacts nicely by splitting in half</li>
            <li> Instead of just stopping, the brush just slowed and got less effective.  </li>
            <li> I had a Philips Sonicare previously and liked it.  </li>
            <li> They came off easily at the cleanings but now my teeth stay shiny and white all of the time.</li>
            <li> just received this product, although haven&#x27;t tried, this product impress me.&lt;br /&gt;Elegant design with travel size bag, every easy for daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oscillating one always seems to get really groty in the mechanism whereas this one is pretty much sealed all around.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d keep an eye on it and check once a month to make sure its dry.  </li>
            <li> My previous brush was a Spinbrush sonic, which sometimes made my mouth sore and was not quite as effective.</li>
            <li> This is the first tooth brush that I have found that really cleans your teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Very simple design and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> This device is quiet and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Sure, the charge on it will last about 2 weeks&#x27; worth of regular usage, but I work abroad regularly for periods longer than 2 weeks and need to be able to work with 220 volts.</li>
            <li> This product is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Set up is relatively easy with simple instructions.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush came in an easy to open packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I think this basic model is qualified for most guys, for its price, but you need to clean the inner once a week,  </li>
            <li> It is easy to charge and holds the charge for several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW what a tremendous price for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I previously had an Oral B that I really liked but died after 5+ years of use.  </li>
            <li> Makes it easy to use low pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to setup and use and holds a charge for several days if not longer.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is located so that it makes it easy to shut off in the middle of brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> but so far it seems to be adequate.</li>
            <li> My medicine cabinet is made out of metal and since the feet on the brush part are magnetic I stick it to the side or top of my cabinet to let it dry out.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to understand and it doesn&#x27;t need constant charging.</li>
            <li> The heads are also easily replaceable at your local Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li> hope next time can company with some head for exchange easily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be fixed by even my super handyman Dad.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of adjusting, but the toothbrush works wonders and makes it really easy for you to brush properly.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest you purchase one and see what difference it will make on your next dentist visit.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is also too strong (similar to the Oral B).</li>
            <li> I really like the 2 minute timer which has helped me become more disciplined in how long I brush.</li>
            <li> last a good long time</li>
            <li> Some people might think this is a plus, but in light of the fact that most people do not brush for long enough, keeping on brushing until the signal buzzes and toothbrush shuts down was a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This is super simple to use and does exactly what it advertises!  </li>
            <li> there is no other way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was really having a hard time parting with it as it has been with me for so long and has always done an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want clean teeth, there is no other choice.</li>
            <li> It will work for more than a week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I had gum disease, and large pockets before...</li>
            <li> you know they run for a certain length cycle then shut off.  </li>
            <li> internet capability smart technology...</li>
            <li> My dentist certainly has taken notice of the lack of tartar build up.</li>
            <li> If you want a toothbrush with timed intervals for certain parts of the mouth look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This product has the &amp;#34;older style&amp;#34; head with the large screw-on brush device.</li>
            <li> I just read it in the directions , but they said it has it in certain models....</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a large savings in my mind.  </li>
            <li> Large akward handle/base part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m considering buying two more for my families....for my mom and dad....it&#x27;s very useful for lazy people like me to keep the dental health</li>
            <li> Have used this brand for 10 years and needed a new one !!  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I&#x27;m still using mine, the refills are pretty expensive even if you buy on amazon but in the end I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Small pet peeve on both of them why such a bright d*mn light on the handle to indicate the charge level?</li>
            <li> I am using it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> I fell in love instantly - in spite of the initial &amp;#34;mouth full of hedge clippers&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Essence E5300 Power Toothbrush features unique dynamic cleaning action that gently and effectively reaches deep between teeth and along the gumline.</li>
            <li> The new one is a more recent version (has some additional pulsing and staged vibration features) and works well.    </li>
            <li> but if you live near a costco they sell them in a pack for cheap.</li>
            <li> my gums became so healthy the dentist attendant took my previous x-rays and new ones all around the office to show everyone the astonishing difference in my gums and they were completely healed from gingivitis, also no cavities this time or since.</li>
            <li> Is easy to use, does the job, and I much prefer it to a standard, non-electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My previous toothbrush was a Braun Electric Plaque Remover, which had a much gentler but still effective vibration.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clear my tooth completely.</li>
            <li> Better than my previous model and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worked fine until recently.</li>
            <li> The higher grade models allow for a wider range of voltage, so it&#x27;s not as though the technology isn&#x27;t there to make the brush able to function in countries other than the United States and Canada.</li>
            <li> It worked fine but when resetting it back in the charger, water had accumulated underneath  the toothbrush part of the connection and leaked out onto the charger.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works fine, however, it requires disassemblying and cleaning every third use and does the housing have to be so cumbersome?  </li>
            <li> this basic model works fine if you just take the time to use it.</li>
            <li> year old brush would no long hold a charge for more than a day.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it starts out easy and then works up to full power after a several uses.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, but wish it had interval timers.</li>
            <li> I had an older one that gave up the ghost after about 8 years!  </li>
            <li> One has to get used to the very high frequency in which it operates.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> which is a good thing especially when one is getting older and isn&#x27;t particularly fond of yellow teeth!  </li>
            <li> Little carrying case is nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice little pouch too, plus</li>
            <li> The little carrying case is nice.</li>
            <li> Just what my mom wanted and nice to have the little travel bag it comes with.  </li>
            <li> It was fine one day and the next day it started vibrating so fast</li>
            <li> I always get an A at my oral exams and with bridges, the extra fine sonic vibration really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> My first brush left my mouth feeling really clean</li>
            <li> I could hardly wait to try it as I&#x27;ve heard these are great little tools to take better care of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I lost my charger for my first one (had that one since High School...</li>
            <li> Works great, I just wish that the head was a little bit larger.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud but good for you</li>
            <li> This is very convenient and very high</li>
            <li> I had an old one for 10 years, so I was excited to get a new one.</li>
            <li> If you stay in the US/Canada, there really isn&#x27;t a need to go for the more expensive models as this one will do what you want it to do (clean your teeth) and is worth the full cost.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare, but this version is so stripped down that you HAVE to clean it frequently</li>
            <li> this is a very good toothbrush usually my 11 year old son has difficulty brushing his teeth properly but with the use of this brush he doesn&#x27;t first time with a charm</li>
            <li> I was impressed at the price, especially having received it and note very little difference in it and the usual ones I have had that were substantially more than this one.  </li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to the vibration, but it does an amazing job keeping my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> Fit isn&#x27;t that great, however, as it makes an annoying sound as it jiggles around.</li>
            <li> I was very upset to learn that Sonicare has deleted the Quad-Pacer feature from this model.</li>
            <li> Since getting this,  I decided I much prefer it.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier than manually brushing my teeth, and they feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like this Sonicare model.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who does not brush very well.  </li>
            <li> Expected better cleaning.  </li>
            <li> That is/ not holdimg a charge and never getting to a solid light.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet or really tested the battery life, however.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> Does just what you want a toothbrush to do, really cleans and refreshes whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare has helped prevent the staining from occurring as much.</li>
            <li> My oral health has been much improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li> + Cleans really well, proven effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> Looked around for a replacement &amp; found this one reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> But my teeth got much much whiter!!!&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Gotit fast just as described</li>
            <li> If you want something that really gets after it, this will work</li>
            <li> but if you want something gentle on the gums check out the Cybersonic.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to negotiate around my teeth.  </li>
            <li> You will need to get used to counting 30 seconds at a time, since this toothbrush really encourages you not to brush longer than two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to by bulk replacement brushes on amazon comapred to walmart.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, they were also much whiter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how mold can be building up as much as in the posted pictures unless they&#x27;re just not bothering with the maintenence.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is hit and miss, so I really miss that feature.</li>
            <li> It was an appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> My dentist is much happier.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another one for myself very soon.  </li>
            <li> and although it works very well there is one&lt;br</li>
            <li> As promised, works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The velocity of the vibration is too much for me.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and comes with the Amazon.com Prime guarantee.  </li>
            <li> The speed of the brush is WAY TOO fast for a child.  </li>
            <li> Two stars because it did a reasonable job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gunk/mold--this issue is real.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> He really wanted a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it might be too cheap and breakdown, however, that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.  </li>
            <li> , I bought a cheap, battery operated electric toothbrush at a local store.  </li>
            <li> It cleans our teeth much beter.</li>
            <li> You can tell it cleans very well</li>
            <li> You spend $49 on the vibrator, battery and charger, but the real payoff for Phillips is the replacement brush.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I could find was that it was available on some products.</li>
            <li> I received the order very promptly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;$20 is the real price, and for that, this baby works well.</li>
            <li> My kids seem to really like these toothbrushes and they are the reason I made the purchase, so they would brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> The whole family now uses these.</li>
            <li> The whole cap needs to be replaced</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is comfortable,powerfull,affordable and works very well.</li>
            <li> I really miss the beeps quarterly to show that you should move to another section.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans your teeth well.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it, saying it&#x27;s gentler on the gums, and it really is.  </li>
            <li> Really makes&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I purchased a 6 pack of replacement heads as the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks P.E.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has the travel bag.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for and spending only $50 for this results in a cheaply made and ill-functioning electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Granted, I routinely brush my teeth twice a day, so there is not any unusual wear and tear.</li>
            <li> so much I bought one for the Girlfriend.</li>
            <li> In fact, she said she had receding gum lines and seeing how much mine had improved, she thought I just might have saved her teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This fantastic toothbrush actually removes everything.</li>
            <li> whole package includes a travel pack, the base/battery, the top/bristles, a plastic cover for the bristle area, and the recharge base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does the job very well</li>
            <li> It is very esea to use.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel that it cleans my teeth well.</li>
            <li> Feels much cleaner than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon&#x27;s return policy made this relatively painless.</li>
            <li> It really makes my gums feel refreshed and my teeth sparkling.</li>
            <li> It came fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> It does a very thorough job.</li>
            <li> I really like its electronic vibration, which cleans my teeth efficiently.</li>
            <li> I keep the toothbrush in the recharger and it is always ready to use.</li>
            <li> am very looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the purchase of Philips Oral Healthcare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> just something you do while your getting ready.  </li>
            <li> Its very convenient because I used to just start brushing and walking around a bit.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner and my dentist says that it massages the gums to make them stronger as well.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The ones recommended to me were much louder and rattled my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The more expensive versions beep every 30 seconds to let you know when you should change surfaces (Top back to Top Front, etc.)</li>
            <li> Outstanding product as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, is holding up very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they have always been of high quality!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as our old one, but serves its purpose.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a while, stands straight up on the sink and</li>
            <li> It holds a charge really well</li>
            <li> battery indicator light appears to be working properly.</li>
            <li> What else do you really need from an electric toothbrush?</li>
            <li> I really want to keep all my teeth until the day I die, so I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for years.  </li>
            <li> Philips provides a two year warranty which may have been carefully considered to avoid having to replace too many units that could result if it were just a bit longer.</li>
            <li> The charger works very well and the brush unit holds a charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much space on bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the basic Sonicare model because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Furthermore, while brushing it sounds very rattly.</li>
            <li> thanks, guys.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works way better than i expected it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for several years and enjoy the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much cleaner after a brushing</li>
            <li> Does not take up much space, Works well &amp; fits well in hand.</li>
            <li> I really struggle w/ plaque build up</li>
            <li> The phone is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the plastic so much as touches my teeth</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> I knew Sonicare has a reputation for quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect that much from this lower-priced product.</li>
            <li> but I really like the way my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the vibration would tickle too much</li>
            <li> Even after being on charge for whole night it stops within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> The 2 minutes are not broken up into 30 seconds, pause, then continue.</li>
            <li> I have been looking to upgrade to an electric toothbrush for quite some time now but didn&#x27;t feel like spending so much money.  </li>
            <li> and/or how much longer you have until your 2 minutes are up.  </li>
            <li> These things may do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, but they don&#x27;t do much that you can&#x27;t already do manually.  </li>
            <li> Thanks much.</li>
            <li> The Philips sonicare toothbrush works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I could absolutely kick myself for balking at the price.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> you find my review helpful, please give it an up-vote; I really appreciate your feedback!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Had always used a manual brush before but really like this now.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> and it really makes your teeth feel polished like coming from the dentist</li>
            <li> the vibrations and strength of a Sonicare absolutely blow those away, it&#x27;s not even a comparison.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner with the sonicare compared to a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the consumable is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like rushing when brushing your teeth, you&#x27;d really appreciate this.</li>
            <li> I really like the timer.  </li>
            <li> The brush works very well</li>
            <li> It really cleans the teeth well</li>
            <li> This product was better that expected.</li>
            <li> I believe it has really help my oral hygiene and whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush since my whole family are using it.</li>
            <li> Works very well and brushes your tooth well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have taken it on vacations for  a week at a time and the charge lasts for the whole week.</li>
            <li> It cleans really well and leaved my teeth feeling like they have just been cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my dental hygiene  so much easier to manage,</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not seeing the whitening effects so much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sonicare rechargeable brush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, fantastic brush, and I can not go back to a manual brush again!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, fantastic brush, and I can not go back to a manual brush again!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see the need.  </li>
            <li> my teeth really appreciate this purchase, never felt cleaner and my dentist even saw the difference</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This Product cleans teeth very well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience or knowledge about them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so much I got one for myself.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> This Sonicare will work for all that wants a tooth brush to do the job.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for quite a bit as I really wanted the Sonicare rather than another Braun.  </li>
            <li> Really makes a difference</li>
            <li> The cleaning is much improved over the manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> Really like the bag.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> the blinking light does not go off even if left plugged in for 48 hours</li>
            <li> After we were done, it felt like we just came straight from the dentist.</li>
            <li> So i bought him this style and he really likes it and doesn&#x27;t want to use a manual toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li> have also heard that this type of toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as those with the rotating heads, but for the price you really can&#x27;t  beat this.</li>
            <li> no frills, 2 minute timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li> You just have to gently move it over your teeth and it does all the work.</li>
            <li> This one was purchased as a gift for a very close friend who is a senior citizen in his 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and he reports that he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> After 2 minutes f brushing, you really feel the cleanliness of your teeth</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I find brushing manually very ineffective.</li>
            <li> There was nothing I REALLY needed.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush really works very well</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced  would recommend.  </li>
            <li> It turns out it is a much cheaper model that doesn&#x27;t signal each 30 seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li> REALLY???  </li>
            <li> very well.</li>
            <li> It Cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> really like the ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on your teeth also.</li>
            <li> this one I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> works well and is reasonable priced</li>
            <li> No, it is very basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but we really miss it.  </li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> so much I started doing it after meals</li>
            <li> I have had it almost 3 months and the e-series brush head is just about ready for replacement</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space either</li>
            <li> Made my teeth feel really shiny&lt;</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable too, compared to what the Sonicares used to cost.</li>
            <li> works very well , like it.</li>
            <li> no one wants furry teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are feeling the effects every time I brush which is a lot easier thanks to Sonicare</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare works very well on removing plague.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> He loves it so much and would like to give a five stars.</li>
            <li> Purchased after hearing so much about it.  </li>
            <li> It does the cleaning part very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li> I would have to say, I expected more than I got with this product.  </li>
            <li> Really helped my gums.  </li>
            <li> Bristles move incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mount feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The 2-minute timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li> , sometimes it&#x27;s a bit much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do that anymore unless I&#x27;m really sleepy and clumsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Appreciate how this really cleans.  </li>
            <li> My teeth do feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Works really well for a $40 electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It also charges quite fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this tool.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It really made it easier for me to brush my teeth....</li>
            <li> i can do it during work or reading without much effort.</li>
            <li> It makes her teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I used the Essence for about 3 months and then bought the HealthyWhite Platinum and am much happier with it.  </li>
            <li> when I ordered this one, it was just yellowed and really used looking...time to upgrade.</li>
            <li> It really cleans</li>
            <li> Received sonicare in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Is that really in guarantee product???</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m accustomed to it and had no reason to assume it was only available on \\&quot;selected models\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Update - Phillips has very graciously promised to send me another handle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Guess I really should though,</li>
            <li> If you do not believe me about this product defect there is a whole line of products that they sell on Amazon to stop the mold for this tooth brush model.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it vibrates too much or something.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate my whole face like a Spinbrush does</li>
            <li> Is that too much to ask?</li>
            <li> Priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> Provides a much cleaner mouth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the gums and they even look healthier.</li>
            <li> I now realize how convenient that is, and how much I had accostumed myself to the practical function it performs.</li>
            <li> That is such an important feature to have.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get much crappier than that.</li>
            <li> I  did not purchase them because it was a bit pricey, instead I visited Amazon and found the Philips Sonicare for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> High recommend!</li>
            <li> We only charge it when it needs to be charged, which is when the light starts blinking.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It is also very bulky</li>
            <li> Thanks again..</li>
            <li> For some who&#x27;ve never had an electric, this might be acceptable, especially at the cheap price...  </li>
            <li> and I love the minimal effort it requires.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> Without the quadpacer I had to guess at how much time to spend on each part of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads wore out kinda fast too.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say except there&#x27;s nothing that feels better on my teeth than a sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare is gentler on my teeth and really makes them feel cleaner than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels healther.</li>
            <li> The recharge light blinks constantly and will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any sonicare products!</li>
            <li> However, it does not have the 30-sec timer notification feature so it just runs for 2-minutes straight.</li>
            <li> really see a difference.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Very durable amd comes with all you need.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really help.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to give this 3.5 stars</li>
            <li> I feel like it is really battling the plaque.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I both bought one and it cleans very well and is built well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this</li>
            <li> It works really well and after</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well &amp; the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.  </li>
            <li> The travel case was very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare toothbrush since 1995 and really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> , it tickled too much that I had to switch to my manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It came charged and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care about the travel option</li>
            <li> Even when fully charged it doesn&#x27;t really have the &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have found is the light...</li>
            <li> Mother really likes it.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> but it feels absolutely great/clean after I used it.</li>
            <li> But cleans very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too much work.  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> and then someone bought me an Oral B that was twice as much for a gift.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need 24/7 streaming intel on the status of my toothbrush charge.</li>
            <li> It tickles so much</li>
            <li> This is no frills, basic, and cheap for Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t take alot of space, charges up fast.  </li>
            <li> It works better than expected.</li>
            <li> My latest one was a 4 year old Essence 5000 series and I recently smoked the charger while in Europe (I forgot it was not dual voltage).  </li>
            <li> The prices have dropped over the years and this one had the rubber grips on it that my last one lacked, so nice bonus for seemingly the same price point.  </li>
            <li> The weight is kind of heavy too.</li>
            <li> The brush does have a 2 week battery life though, and I usually am able to stretch it that far with regular use.</li>
            <li> while its nice to have this toothbrush for cheaper than it was on the market ten years ago (over 100 for this same</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare and this one should last because I now have my own charger instead of sharing.  </li>
            <li> The handle is surprisingly heavy and has a nice sturdy feel to it.</li>
            <li> We needed it to replace one that was about seven or more years old when it finally quit.</li>
            <li> This is a nice change from your everyday toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Tragically I left my old sonicare brush in a hotel room, this was a good replacement for the same basic-ish model.</li>
            <li> missing the dings to alert you on timing by quadrants but seems more powerful.</li>
            <li> Cleaning, however, is at least as good with the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I charged it to full power the first time and have been using it twice a day for the last month without having to recharge.</li>
            <li> old one had 4 stops so you knew when to switch from front to back and top to bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I recently took apart a worn-out Sonicare to remove the NiCd batteries for disposal (Cadmium is a hazardous metal that should be disposed of properly).  </li>
            <li> I am putting up with it until the thing dies and then investing in one of their more expensive models that from my recollection I had no problems of this kind.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare because the battery on my first is not any longer holding a full charge.</li>
            <li> works great  cleans my teeth hundreds of times better than a regular tooth brush- a little hard to clean though</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have to buy a new whole toothbrush.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> The brush head is a curved oval which also doesn&#x27;t feel right and wears out much, much quicker than the old style.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this device and I found it very useful for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had a realy old one (like over 10 years, also sonicare) and the new ones are SIGNIFICANTLY stronger than my older one,</li>
            <li> I may try other model from Sonicare in the future but so far this one works great for home use.</li>
            <li> Personally, I feel that the timer is a significant and important part of Sonicare tooth care and not an extra trimming.  </li>
            <li> My new one is very peppy!  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times to find a way to adjust (and I do think I am a pretty bright and smart individual), but this was a bit out of my league.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s portable , easy to take in a travel bag , and charges for a long time.</li>
            <li> The first day I spent the whole time laughing and spitting toothpaste everywhere, now that I&#x27;m used to it it is fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this model meets all my needs at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I asked my dentists about this, and he said don&#x27;t worry about it too much, as long as you&#x27;re not using a tooth-paste with heavy abrasive, because the combination of abrasive action and strokes can do more harm than good if used frequently and often.</li>
            <li> I really loved my last toothbrush (the elite e7000) which had the \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; (30-second interval timer), but this time I was not willing to pay $100+ to get a toothbrush with the quadpacer feature.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much louder than the original manufacture version and feels just slightly different somehow.  </li>
            <li> this electric tooth brush gets back there very easy  with no problem wish I had tried it even sooner because I don&#x27;t get the complaint from my dentist about no getting that area better anymore.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get use to the large size compared to the older Sonicare that I use to use.</li>
            <li> My first was an Essence e5000 I got for Christmas in 2008, a very early version of the E series.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes clean very well, especially if you tend to have plaque build-up on your teeth like I used to have.</li>
            <li> It works much better than other brands we&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth much better than other toothbrushes I’ve owned.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years, wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> This brush stays charged for up to two weeks and has more power than the other version.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s an ok brush,  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> The original basic remains intact.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need a voltage converter to use it in most other countries.</li>
            <li> Had my original for 15 years and it finally wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the brush.</li>
            <li> It fits the existing heads that I just purchased before my other one died, which I had for many years.</li>
            <li> This model seems to be the current version of the original Sonicare brush we had 10-15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It definetly cleans way better than any other electric toothbrush we have tried.</li>
            <li> And I do not want to use the normal toothbrush since then!</li>
            <li> Not exactly the model I was hoping for but OK with it.</li>
            <li> You would be better off with an Oral B or some other model, not Phillips.</li>
            <li> Much better than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever bought...</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the other &amp;#34;electrics&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It saved my gums and prevented more tooth loss (having already lost one tooth due to gum abscesses).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about 20 years or more, and would not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare vibrations in your mouth take some getting used to, but once familiar, you will never go back to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an original Sonicare toothbrush that I had for eight years or so; the battery on that one finally refused to recharge.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason that Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are the power toothbrush brand that is recommended by dental professionals more than any other.</li>
            <li> I had the original version and wanted to replace it with a similar one.</li>
            <li> I had an old soniccare and it was going on its last charge, so I was able to find it online for less then most stores sold them for.</li>
            <li> This is our second Sonicare toothbrush and it is very good with the exception of not having the feature of beeping every 30 seconds, indicating the time to move onto another area of teeth to be brushed, as our previous one did.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge and my gums are very pink and healthy using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> so I recommend taking a mini-hacksaw and removing the worn brush near the top from the elec toothbrush and one from a new regular toothbrush and epoxying (gluing)</li>
            <li> I NEVER got this clean with a regular brush and elbow</li>
            <li> No matter how I brushed, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean and my gums would sometimes get sore.  </li>
            <li> You have to clean them regularly.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel extra clean after using this toothbrush...</li>
            <li> You have to clean the brush daily!</li>
            <li> I much prefer this older style brush and handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product with few minor issues.</li>
            <li> The older Essence has a NiCad battery that didn&#x27;t give as much runtime.</li>
            <li> Now my teeth only feel clean when I use this brush.</li>
            <li> u clean the entire toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but it may be worth considering if you tend to be the first one up or the last one to bed and don&#x27;t want to disturb your partner.</li>
            <li> It takes about 20 seconds to clean it, so it no big deal, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean it regularly!</li>
            <li> Long time user, and this one is still just fine.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;ve used similar product before but have never felt so much as clean for my teeth as I am using this sonic care product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric toothbrush that didn&#x27;t irritate my gums, left my teeth feeling clean and that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t come apart while brushing</li>
            <li> I would have never believed that a tooth brush could make such a difference in how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush-size does not help to clean wisdom tooth, and you probably need to buy a smaller brushhead too, which I have not used yet.</li>
            <li> I love the long term battery, which so far has lasted around 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I washed my hands to go look into how to properly clean this and did not notice a bit of the gunk which was essentially a mold at that point was still on my finger/finger nail</li>
            <li> Sonicare continues to be the only way to truly clean your teeth</li>
            <li> Simple to use, clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> after my first use of the Sonicare Essence, my teeth really did feel like they&#x27;d just been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> This product is a great investment in cavity prevention&lt;br /&gt;and gum health, especially if used three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;Reduce dental check ups and far less need for annual&lt;br /&gt;teeth cleaning for plaque buildup has also been observed.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using it and the 2 min timer ensures that I am brushing for longer than I did with my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted way longer than the MFR even expects it to, as I called their service when the 1st one stopped working, and the rep was surprised it lasted so much longer than the 3-or-so years they expect the battery to work</li>
            <li> So far it is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different in appearance and feel than my old one, but it still seems to do the same great job!</li>
            <li> I love that Sonicare has come down in price to a place where it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> Leaves a fresh clean feeling unlike any other forms of brushing.</li>
            <li> THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> would recommend this brush to anyone who wants a good basic Sonicare toothbrush who doesn&#x27;t need any of the features offered in the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that wants cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I could definitely feel a difference between the clean of this toothbrush and my old spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first few cleans with this brush were immediately better than my older spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was one that didn&#x27;t need to stay on the charger, but it was cheap enough to charge my way and then get a new one.</li>
            <li> Better than the conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My last model was a little more advanced.  </li>
            <li> The other new ones may look fancy, but I don&#x27;t really think you are getting much more for your money.</li>
            <li> The design flaw that lets a minimal amount of residue into a cavity is really negligible as it can be easily rinsed out.</li>
            <li> as good as the previous ones; this one however doesn&#x27;t have the split timer that splits the brushing times in 30 second intervals.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Rotadent that I loved, but the battery would not last.</li>
            <li> and we clean it out gently with a piece of toilet paper so mold or gunk or</li>
            <li> I can pay less and get more with other brands which have gotten better reviews from testers.</li>
            <li> Great for avoiding those moments when you brush so hard that you hit your gums with the head of the brush, in fact going slow allows better cleaning.</li>
            <li> No manual brushing can equal the high level of vibrations this toothbrush can deliver in a two minute cycle, which results in a clean mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly buy a new model.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing and gets rid of a lot of plaque but the biggest problem for me is that the brush head is too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 2 minute timer is fantastic and gives me some insight in how long I should be brushing for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit really cleans your teeth and the brush bristles are real soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty clear that it does a better job of cleaning than the average, battery-operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The improvement in using this toothbrush has been incredible - no more endless poking and scraping at the 6 month check up</li>
            <li> It is light in weight yet powerful enough to make me feel I am cleaning my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good, and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small head.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a very conservative return policy, so I am SOOO glad I did not buy a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare since it was first developed.  </li>
            <li> The brush supplied was the standard or full size.</li>
            <li> Just used this thing for the first time and all I have to say is WOW.</li>
            <li> After 7 years the battery would only run for just under 2 minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li> For first-time Sonicare users, the Quadrapacer feature helps train them to brush each quadrant of their teeth for 30 full seconds during the total two minute run time.  </li>
            <li> We have had no issues so far so its exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> I personally like the smaller brush head as it is easier to do a good job on the back and sides of your teeth....</li>
            <li> However it sounds pretty loud when its on.</li>
            <li> kinda funny feature but its a known fact that most people dont brush long enough.</li>
            <li> Per the manual, this should be two weeks on a full charge, but since both my wife and I use it, I would assume it should last one week.   </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really notice the difference until you try to use a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the inside is a little bit of a pain because there are hard to reach places, but it is the best electric toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> Was a little disconcerted at first since it was more powerful than the last sonic toothbrush I owned</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, and it cleans your teeth better than any other brush I have found!</li>
            <li> Those tiny little things make the most powerful refrigerator magnets you have ever seen in your life!</li>
            <li> I like my new techie-toothbrush!</li>
            <li> so I had to get a new one ASAP!</li>
            <li> The new models are a vast improvement over the original design.</li>
            <li> its Ok, Its not fun to use, I am not sure as its my first electric brush but its just sitting there and not using any more.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the two-minute timer - forces me to brush for as long as I should!</li>
            <li> I saved money on the older model, can use my new replacement heads, and my teeth are once again feeling Soniclean!</li>
            <li> I really cannot live without my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re never used an electric toothbrush before, prepare for a whole new world.</li>
            <li> I was just ready for a new one.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a new electric tooth brush in a while and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed having one.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but impossible to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> We had one previously with the timer but forgot to make sure this one had it.</li>
            <li> What I paid for this Sonicare is less than what I paid more than a decade ago for another electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold with wide handle.  </li>
            <li> The head is alot more compact than my previous Sonicare, it comes apart to put into travel</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted more than three years.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel they have never felt cleaner and seems I use way less paste which I despise anyway  </li>
            <li> We have been pleased with our purchase and the quality for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;Helen C.</li>
            <li> I am able to use the brushes from the previous model.  </li>
            <li> Get noticeable results and better check-ups in less than a month.</li>
            <li> This one is the older model.</li>
            <li> A steady power stream and use.</li>
            <li> Works well but miss the beep from my older model when it is time to move to another area of my teeth,</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my boyfriend after receiving my own in pink.  </li>
            <li> In addition it is quieter than the older models.  </li>
            <li> Dec 21st came and on Dec 23rd I got an email saying that it was at the local post office (although it was through Fedex) and that it could take up to 2 more business days to be delivered.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get on but my dental hygienist recommended this particular electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But as I got older I realized&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I use this one mainly when I travel.</li>
            <li> IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN OLDER MODEL - AND IT CHARGED UP OVER NIGHT</li>
            <li> recently got a much better Dazzlepro from our dentist that has just a simple replaceable brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased to place on older one.  </li>
            <li> This usually results in &#x27;love at first try&#x27; or immediate rejection.</li>
            <li> Note sure what the more expensive models are like</li>
            <li> it holds a charge steady.  </li>
            <li> /efficiency of this particular model.</li>
            <li> Purchased in January on the recommendation of my dentist to eliminate some minimal plaque issues on my otherwise healthy 58 year old teeth.  </li>
            <li> Had to replace a 12 year older one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super simple and reliable, which I like.</li>
            <li> I only wish these were available when i was young.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare,my first being a higher end model-more features.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an older model.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I&#x27;ve found is I had to purchase a toothpaste for sensitive teeth because the run of the mill tooth paste was too much with this intense brush.</li>
            <li> Should have ordered two at this one&#x27;s super low price.</li>
            <li> Why spend more on more expensive units?  </li>
            <li> My older Sonicare stopped working &amp; would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison to the older model Sonic with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare  rechargeables for many Years starting when there was only 1 model....</li>
            <li> The well on the handle (underneath the screw cap that is attached to the head) traps water, which quickly turns into a yellow soup of bacterial growth.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve gone back to an authentic (not generic) Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Is a terrific product and I paid more before for this same item that eventually wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery last long.&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a classic and works as well as others twice the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this toothbrush and would definitely recommend it if you are in the market for an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have one of the older ones</li>
            <li> Last fall, I found that I could no longer get  a brush head that fit the Sonicare model I owned, which was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> This is the third or fourth Sonicare I&#x27;ve had over a period of many years.</li>
            <li> , just one thing I don&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
            <li> I had an older Essence model that beeped every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> My son (7 years old) keeps using his, but it is almost too intense: it tickles and vibrates intensely.</li>
            <li> This brush Works better that my previous older model electric brush.</li>
            <li> The Essence has a 2 minute timer that has a tiny pause every 30 seconds, so you can make sure you&#x27;re brushing each part of your mouth for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product for beginners but would definitely buy a better version next time.</li>
            <li> My older Philips Sonicare toothbrush I started using on my tomato plants so flowers would set.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t likely use any features beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;The ones with more lights and a smaller handle</li>
            <li> otherwise it gets a build up of slime and grime making it super stinky and rather unsanitary to put back into the mouth.</li>
            <li> Though I did just learn this particular model is being discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I wish it would stay cleaner on the shaft and main battery unit though, always build up &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34; and has to be cleaned thoroughly often.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist loves that I use Sonicare... keeps gum problems at bay for us older folks who want to keep our teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find where I could order just an elite model handle because I guess they&#x27;re older.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first Sonicare toothbrush when they first were introduced, several years ago.</li>
            <li> Also, I had an older Sonicare that had died</li>
            <li> When I bought this model, it said that my older brushheads were compatible.  </li>
            <li> Beware older model units</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Tickled my gums a little at first, but that went away very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone wanting the extra measure of brushing without the big costs associated with the more \\&quot;high end\\&quot; models of electric brushes...</li>
            <li> but the head bristles are very soft and it looks like I will need to change it very soon.</li>
            <li> is the single benefit, to us, that we like; It DOES NOT stop vibrating the bristles and sound a buzzer 4-times every brushing &amp;#34;cycle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It has always been highly rated by my dentist which is one of the main reasons why I stayed with it.</li>
            <li> first few uses took a little getting used to because of a funny tickling sensation but once you get used to it your good.  </li>
            <li> My gums actually tickle when I use it, and the very first time, toothpaste splattered on my shirt and on the bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> and I thought a regular brush would be just as good so long as it is used properly</li>
            <li> so far so good, only used it a few times, hope it holds up, (replacing my original one which lasted several years)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need the fancy ones as this one is good enough and has the self timer that tells you how long to brush overall.</li>
            <li> Before I had carpal tunnel surgery on my right hand I decided an electric toothbrush would make it so much easier when I had to brush my teeth with my left hand..</li>
            <li> For years my dentist suggested that I buy one of these, but  I resisted figuring a plain toothbrush was good enough.  </li>
            <li> It would seem that if the problem is in the design, Philips would just buy the company that solved the problem and put a water tight silicon cover over the brush and top of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s certainly better than other handheld or electric brushes- just more bare bones than other models.</li>
            <li> Still, I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend to anyone wanting to move from a manual brush to an electric brush.</li>
            <li> I went looking for a high quality, no-frills electric toothbrush and the Sonicare</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this brand.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> recommend this highly.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this as an affordable option to the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise...quite high marks.</li>
            <li> The vibration from it takes a little getting used to, but is well worth it for how clean it makes your teeth</li>
            <li> but they seem to stay clean all day long.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have to count to 30 to keep track of how long to clean each section of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean for as long as they did with my spin brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush improvement and other added features are a nice step up from the basic Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It also has a smart timer (the old one does too)</li>
            <li> If you are shocked at first at how strong the vibration is on your teeth, stick with it for a couple weeks and see - I finally got used to it and it works great.  </li>
            <li> and I have found this cleans a little better than the Oral B. Takes a day or two</li>
            <li> I think one of my favorite features, and it&#x27;s the little things that count</li>
            <li> It took a little while getting used to it, but love it now.</li>
            <li> We used battery toothbrushes for many years, but these are a little different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the little carrying case, too.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare toothbrush in the past and they are simply the best would not trade for any other brand.</li>
            <li> had one before but didn&#x27;t take care of it with a little more knowledge on them now</li>
            <li> Love the little bag that came with it.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money and get the HealthyWhite or the HealthyWhite Platinum.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this online instead of in store because the price including shipping was by far better---about $20 cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Secondly this toothbrush changed my life as far as how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> There are nicer looking models (Diamond Clean) and models with several features that I don&#x27;t need, like settings for sensitive teeth and the like, which I also don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> When my older model Sonicare died on me a few months ago, I purchased this model and I love it.</li>
            <li> It has a small, powerful brush head - your teeth really feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> but after a week of using, I just didn&#x27;t like how strong the vibrations were, though my teeth felt extremely polished</li>
            <li> Rather than drain affluent from the inside of the head chamber, it accumulates and rots and occasionally releases the stinking rotten gunk through the little holes on the side and onto the hand you are holding it with.</li>
            <li> It vibrates very fast, much faster than my last electric brush.  </li>
            <li> Although a little pricey when compared to a regular tooth brush or many of the electric brushes, it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> The travel bag is &amp;#34;non-optimum.&amp;#34; Spring for the hard plastic molded case; it&#x27;s worth it and works better than the soft case included with this set.</li>
            <li> Phillips is devious about making new models that are incompatible with older brushes.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel sparkling clean for a very long time after each use.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but the replacement heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s weird, but it cleans so great</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is soft with the bristles.</li>
            <li> Just as much power as my old one and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> The speed this thing moves is completely faster, and really lives up to the sonic in its name.  </li>
            <li> These batteries hold a charge much longer and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; problems of the old NiCads.  </li>
            <li> Both my 11yr old daughter and I have used it and it really cleans.</li>
            <li> His dentist first recommended it to help with gum problems as well as plaque and general cleaning.</li>
            <li> teeth feel much cleaner, the buildup is completely gone</li>
            <li> Surprised how much I missed the quad pacing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this toothbrush was gentle to my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> The price for this one was reasonable as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old one which the replacement brushes are very expenses</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisier than my old one but not that much.  </li>
            <li> Coming from a regular toothbrush though, this thing is quite the upgrade and definitely worth the $40.  </li>
            <li> I have the diamond model but bought this for my gf because she was just transitioning to this from normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the product and use it everyday sometimes 3 times  a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the same but</li>
            <li> But come on, a Sonicare toothbrush should not break in 1 year and 2 months of normal use.</li>
            <li> but it is so much more harsh on your gums.  </li>
            <li> In my case, I have many replacement brush heads which would have gone to waste</li>
            <li> a few days after receiving the product and the dentist suggested they all use an electric brush for better cleaning and healthier gums.  </li>
            <li> max with normal usage.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was actually kinda grossed out at how much stuff had built up on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I found myself charging it once every 5-6 days with normal use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice replacement but just one complaint...</li>
            <li> The second and third ones still work-we just thought it would be nice to have a spare for the future.  </li>
            <li> It lasted the week with no trouble and the small carry case is really handy for traveling.</li>
            <li> This being my first Sonicare toothbrush, it does take some getting used too at first as I could really feel the vibration on my teeth as it cleaned and polished, but I guess thats to be expected considering the quality of the device.</li>
            <li> but that suggests that one of my issues has probably been not brushing long enough :-)</li>
            <li> This is normal and will subdue after a week of using the brush.</li>
            <li> but it feels so normal now.</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks, I love the brush.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better for the environment without the waste.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have one complaint about it</li>
            <li> This one is pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> We have had one for a few years and have better dental check-ups.  </li>
            <li> my teeth felt no cleaner than they felt with a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> However, some days I just can&#x27;t stand it and revert to my normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment on your future dental bills.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty much your basic Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> At nine years each, I should be dead in two more, age 100 plus.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a normal toothbrush anymore.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve normally just used a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth with this toothbrush has made brushing fun again, and somewhat addictive!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t reach with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After 10 days of normal use, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush ok, but I prefer a round head.</li>
            <li> This one seems to splatter a bit more than a round head.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny--your teeth will feel like you just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> That last statement is fortunate because apparently this brush is sold WITHOUT the brush head.</li>
            <li> Before getting this toothbrush I had used other electric toothbrushes, although I thought they worked fine</li>
            <li> It looks cute and the battery last very long.</li>
            <li> Having to hold it at a 45 degree angle every time is odd too, it just felt a huge distraction the whole time.  </li>
            <li> almost all the time -- the shape of the brush head is less blocky, more diamond-y, and the stem is thinner and angled compared to the old model.</li>
            <li> Charges quick and the wife is back in action again.</li>
            <li> After using this mechanical brush for several months, I can easily say I am never going back to a manual brush!</li>
            <li> It has the feel that it is made out of less sturdy materials compared to my old one -- which I&#x27;m sure it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got back to work, didnt charge it, and it worked just as strong as when I left.</li>
            <li> I only charged it once for 24 hours and going strong one week later used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely priced right</li>
            <li> This should help properly dividing brushing time between the 4 sections of your mouth (up/down, right</li>
            <li> This should help properly dividing brushing time between the 4 sections of your mouth (up/down, right</li>
            <li> I just had extensive shoulder repair surgery on my right shoulder and arm.</li>
            <li> This bristles are just the right level of softness and they hold up after several weeks of youth.  </li>
            <li> Comes with 1, smaller brush head, just the right size that I need.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation, but didn&#x27;t take my electric toothbrush and had to buy one of those battery operated kids brushes because I couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth right with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> After going through several packs of batteries, I felt the time was right to &amp;</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it stops frequently right before I finish brushing; the timer of this electronic toothbrush needs improvement.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts as long as my other one did (six years), I&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> cleaner and auto shutoff tells me that I am not brushing my teeth too quickly or too long.</li>
            <li> This part can get a bit icky if you don&#x27;t unscrew the top and clean it regular.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice feeling to feel smoothness where I used to feel a plaque buildup long before I was due for an office cleaning.</li>
            <li> The more expensive models don&#x27;t really offer any useful features that you really need.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really brushes your teeth like no other!  </li>
            <li> Fine as a tooth brush but does not have the 30 second / 2 minute vibration that the basic models used to have</li>
            <li> the tooth brush is the same as my last one which I lost on a trip  and the new one works fine</li>
            <li> It works great, and I love how effective it is, but the fact that two different toothbrushes have broken on us within a few months is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Due to that problem the brush made an unwanted screeching sound.</li>
            <li> It fits well in your hand and is gentle on your teeth battery life is great also,have used a few Philips in the past, this one does it well</li>
            <li> vibrations are pretty strong - I learned very quickly not to turn it on until it&#x27;s IN your mouth unless you want toothpaste on the ceiling!</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased in high school did not leak or stink, even though it was a similar design.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> They are selling a new &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; model</li>
            <li> but I also look forward to brushing now, almost like a kid getting a fancy new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels like brand new teeth on this 50+ person and check-ups are validating that.  </li>
            <li> Also heavier than new models if you are traveling&lt;br</li>
            <li> the new sonic</li>
            <li> I have a new chipped tooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When it started to let out some greenish liquid at the bottom while standing in its holder I bought a new one on the Internet from an outlet store.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to upgrade to the brand new model, so</li>
            <li> The new brush does not let the tooth paste get in like</li>
            <li> Live this electric toothbrush it does the job with perfection.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was new in the box as described.  </li>
            <li> so i had to drder a new one</li>
            <li> just got this new one and have been using it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Also it can lasts severa months without having to buy a new brush head.</li>
            <li> i ordered my new one and could not be happier with it..</li>
            <li> The puppy got a new kennel</li>
            <li> What I bought is new item but the box that came with it</li>
            <li> I can live with this,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe I just needed a new brush had, but replacing the brush head did not help.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughter she was wanting a new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Worked well for me until my wife upgraded to fancier new version.  </li>
            <li> so we bought him a new one.  </li>
            <li> Recommend everyone buy a new tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Because of work I live between two houses.</li>
            <li> I suspected the battery, but it turned out it&#x27;s the charger, so a new one&#x27;s on the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re a new user the sensation might be unbearable.</li>
            <li> Start helps new users&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Start helps new users&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Mine was not worn out, but he thought I could use a new one.</li>
            <li> The one feature I miss on this new version is the tones.  </li>
            <li> With the new e-series brush heads I did have problems with water collecting inside.  </li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone looking for a new or replacement electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I wanted a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; toothbrush I went with this again because it was cheaper than the new models.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, and uses the brushes I already have rather than the new ones.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone trying out a new brush or looking to get an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the new models.</li>
            <li> I have used the new toothbrush for about three weeks</li>
            <li> The one I replaced was still working but not as well as the new one.</li>
            <li> so had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> new Essex 5600 model advertises NiMh (nickel metal hydride) batteries inside.  </li>
            <li> a new one cause</li>
            <li> I did up grade to a new head</li>
            <li> I had one before and after 7 years stop working, so this is why I had to order a new one</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Sonicare toothbrush for a while, but never thought they would live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> The battery would no longer charge, so I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new, its amazon exclusive, and it has the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> I like the new cloth case.</li>
            <li> But I think I can live without it since it does turn off after 2 min which is the recommended time for brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Needed a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I am new to the Sonicare toothbrush, so this was quite a change for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for probably about 7 years, had to buy a new one</li>
            <li> Went with a new brand from what I have been using.  </li>
            <li> My husband has one and needed some new brushes.</li>
            <li> however it came with a new one so no worries.</li>
            <li> checked the new charger that came with the unit.</li>
            <li> I like this new design.  </li>
            <li> Arrived new and as described.</li>
            <li> New.  </li>
            <li> How did I live without this thing?  </li>
            <li> My husband is adjusting to the new &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; mode of this tooth brush but says his teeth feel a lot cleaner and for longer after he uses it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new handle and this is the one I got</li>
            <li> Ordered a new one here.</li>
            <li> to buy new heads every 1-2 months&lt;</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare for years and it was time for a new one</li>
            <li> My oral B died and had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> So, instead of buying new replacement heads for the Oral-B, I opted to give Sonicare a chance again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> new feature recommended you keep it plugged in at all times.</li>
            <li> This thing makes your mouth feel new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new purchase was meant as a gift to another person</li>
            <li> i like the new charger and the bit of color.  </li>
            <li> So I thought I buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I had had my old one for several years and didn&#x27;t realize how the battery was kind of worn down.  </li>
            <li> very sharp, easy and convenient</li>
            <li> I still had some old replacement brushes and the company sent me two new ones that replaced them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a week now, and to be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not TERRIBLY sure what exactly it&#x27;s doing in terms of cleaning teeth, but it could be just I&#x27;m just not used to the way in which it operates, since it seems like it moves super fast back and forth faster than you can tell.</li>
            <li> Works super and holds a charge for a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li> Also I would recommend draining the initial charge on the new battery by normal use and then charging it for the recommended 35 hours on its first time.</li>
            <li> Switched from a vibratory brand that was out of stock, and got one for me and spouse, and both of us agree- leaves teeth feeling clean, not too rough in handling in mouth</li>
            <li> The brush does not turn on, although the green charging light in front is permanently turn on, which is also unusual.</li>
            <li> Had to replace an older model, this performs as well as the old one did.</li>
            <li> We bought this pair of toothbrushes to replace a much older pair that must have been over 10 years old...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything crazy fancy with multiple speeds or functions so this toothbrush is perfect!</li>
            <li> My last sonicare was a cheap one (thought this was the same model) but it still beeped at you every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> But thanks Amazon for being responsible and offering to take it back.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old ones either - the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; piece and narrow neck are more prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with this toothbrush, was starting with gum disease and no more problems.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as previous models.</li>
            <li> It was very loud.  </li>
            <li> I have been very surprised on this product.</li>
            <li> This second part doesn&#x27;t wear out very fast and can be reused.  </li>
            <li> It could take up to 2 days for a complete charge, I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When it comes to tooth-brushing, the Essence and the Advance perform very much the same.</li>
            <li> When it comes to tooth-brushing, the Essence and the Advance perform very much the same.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is very loud.  </li>
            <li> It works fine so far, and I expect it to last several years also.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a lower setting for the first several times of use, allowing someone new to this type of brush to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> The battery on my first finally gave out, and so  I bought this new Sonicare Essence.  </li>
            <li> While the toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning teeth it was manufactured poorly and large deposits of BACTERIA must be cleaned out at least twice per week.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a good toothbrush, but I used to use an Oral B and this head seems a little big for my teeth</li>
            <li> Long lasting charge and easy to use.</li>
            <li> works well, batteries last a long time, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> That was an easy way to tell the one that she wasn&#x27;t brushing long enough....</li>
            <li> The first few times you use it, your mouth has to get used to the vibrations, but that quickly passes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now - I purchased it just after a tooth cleaning - and after my first cleaning after purchase my dental hygenist has had to scrape at my teeth a great deal less than in the past.  </li>
            <li> Wish that was stated clearly on the product info!</li>
            <li> Works better than a regular tooth brush and especially if you have bridges in the back of your mouth</li>
            <li> I got my first Philips Sonicare around 1995 and it finally gave out this year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd that the older version of a product is better then the current one, but this is the case for this sonic care model.</li>
            <li> Interested to know if they come in different &amp;#34;strengths&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> got for significant other who had never used an electric toothbrush ...</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> After the first use, my teeth felt  like I&#x27;d just come back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> The problem with this model is that it does not have the 30 second alert that makes you aware of the time lapsed while brushing each quadrant.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t clear that this model is lacking the pulsing timer, would rather have paid a few bucks more, but wasn&#x27;t clear in description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to spend the extra money for the improvement in brushing.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was amazed at how different my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve ever written a review on a product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had the Sonicare Intelliclean System brush a while ago, but it became more and more difficult to find the toothpaste refills, so I switched back to my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the 3rd one consistently holds a charge.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, and it takes some time to adjust to not brushing with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare, the first gave up after about 10 years plus.  </li>
            <li> I have this exact same toothbrush I bought 6 years ago</li>
            <li> Essence shares some key features with most other Sonicare products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if I had to pick between the &#x27;basic&#x27; Essence and the more feature-rich and a lot more expensive</li>
            <li> but if I had to pick between the &#x27;basic&#x27; Essence and the more feature-rich and a lot more expensive</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using ours for the past two years and love them.</li>
            <li> No problems a couple months so far with it!</li>
            <li> Pretty gross.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple, but did the trick.  </li>
            <li> it vibrates funny to let you know the battery is running low.  </li>
            <li> This is the most welcomed feature, as the old one would slip out of my hands occasionally when wet and slimy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First one lasted over ten years!  </li>
            <li> It feels like I&amp;#34;m using a professional tool from the Dentist&#x27;s office when I brush with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Boy, was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> The other version had 3 tones that told you when to change from front to back and top to bottom.  </li>
            <li> OMG, my head was practically spinning the first time I used this due to the intense vibration!  </li>
            <li> This replaced our old one, the kids never get cavities anymore!  </li>
            <li> First time I used it I realized it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second incremental beeps.  </li>
            <li> exactly the same as this one does</li>
            <li> pretty much a basic sonic care.</li>
            <li> The only reason for not marking it 5Star was due to not having more features.</li>
            <li> this is my second one, my first one lasted 10 years , I was amazed so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for the past 4 years and love it...</li>
            <li> The old one died after 5 years of usage !</li>
            <li> With the $10 off deal, the toothbrush came to $32 with tax, a much better deal than other online retailers or brick and mortar stores such as Target.</li>
            <li> This was for  my husband and it is soo loud!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted almost 10 years, and only died when dropped on floor.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Be aware these Brush heads are not made by Sonicare and do not work the same.</li>
            <li> As many other reviews mentioned, fluid gets into the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush on Ebay, but it is the exact same toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has the same brushing quality as the higher priced versions.  </li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s watch out, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable until you clatter your teeth with the back of the brush.</li>
            <li> Felt like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Sonicare ten years ago on the advice of my dentist.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Wow, this thing vibrates like it&#x27;s going to take off any minute!  </li>
            <li> I use mine daily and it has never failed me and is always charged.</li>
            <li> Sonicare does have some pretty pricey toothbrushes in it&#x27;s line with bells and whistles that we don&#x27;t necessarily need.</li>
            <li> I wish it had the timer like my previous one, otherwise it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the hardest thing for me to get used to, is that &amp;#34;crazy tingling&amp;#34; early in the morning!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Sonicare from my dentist several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped my old one on concrete and it died (my fault, not the unit&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> The first one only lasted nine years.  </li>
            <li> Returned to get a replacement and the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li> Cousin used it for a year until her dental professional told her to stop!</li>
            <li> Took me about 3 or 4 brushings, but the tickling only was that first</li>
            <li> This is my first and only electric toothbrush brand.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does feel funny when the head of the brush actually touches your teeth - quite a buzz -</li>
            <li> When charged fully, it is powerful and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted about 8 years, with brush head changes regularly.  </li>
            <li> I used the Oral B prior and this toothbrush gets your teeth much cleaner!</li>
            <li> My first was the same model but not rechareable.  </li>
            <li> I am as pleased with this one as with past Sonicare bushes</li>
            <li> feels like i get a professional cleaning every time!</li>
            <li> And it works exactly like my larger version .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste money on this product!</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the toothbrush went on sale at local stores, after we purchased this one on-line and we ended up paying more for it than just buying at a local store.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> , I think it is stronger than my old one that I had for 12 years!</li>
            <li> Mine has the old style charger and case - think I&#x27;ll see if I can get him to trade!  </li>
            <li> I fried out my first when I plugged it into a European socket.</li>
            <li> I use the basic Sonicare: I don&#x27;t need the bells and whistles of the higher priced models.</li>
            <li> So I am stuck with the old brush, and if I want a new brush head, I need to buy an entirely new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit too strong</li>
            <li> I found after using it a few times that I could clean my teeth very well without the programed timing.</li>
            <li> Now, leaving aside what that does or does not say about the desultory nature of my mornings, this thing cleans my teeth with such inhuman thoroughness that my mouth actually tastes clean hours after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more difficult to take apart to clean and re-assemble.  </li>
            <li> But to be fair, I paid less for it than my previous ones.</li>
            <li> My older one finally gave up but this one looks like the real deal again.</li>
            <li> It gets your teeth clean in a way that you simply never could do with a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> No need to buy the expensive models they don&#x27;t clean any better.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this toothbrush, brushing my teeth was a bit of a chore, but now I actually look forward to how clean my teeth feel after brushing and wish I had a second one at my office to brush after lunch.  </li>
            <li> With the Clean&#x27;n&#x27;White, every time I brushed I felt like I&#x27;d just been to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> The charge light blinks all the time, running down the battery.  </li>
            <li> new one is exactly the same but did not have the rigid carrying case like the old</li>
            <li> After using this, all other toothbrushes don&#x27;t make my mouth feel truly clean.</li>
            <li> The brush barely vibrates to the naked eye, but start brushing, and you&#x27;ll immediately realize how strong it actually is.</li>
            <li> Very few people have that many teeth.</li>
            <li> Think about your mouth&#x27;s surface as having 4 sections, top front, top back (behind), bottom front, and bottom back.</li>
            <li> It looks like the little toothbrush should pop right off for replacement but the entire top third of the unit must be swapped out.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the new version of my old one.  </li>
            <li> I have gone and inspected the new models at stores and all but one model appears to have fixed this gap problem which leads to the trapping of bacteria there.</li>
            <li> I kept my old one going for years with new brushes and duct tape to hold the batteries cover on.</li>
            <li> Go for a newer model, I heard they fixed this issue in the new models.</li>
            <li> We had worn out our old Sonicare, and needed to find a new one.</li>
            <li> This is a new toothbrush for me, since i hadn&#x27;t replaced the old electronic I had in years.</li>
            <li> My two Braun, both new , did not work with my old charger</li>
            <li> This is a huge upgrade from my previous Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It feels weird at first, but once you get to used to it, it does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Was hoping that the unit would fit into our holder and charger from our  previous Sonicare units.  </li>
            <li> Since two of us use this toothbrush, it should last one week on a full charge as opposed to two weeks if only one person were using it.</li>
            <li> Certain meds that I take really make my mouth dry &amp; it seems that the Sonicare is helping reduce the plaque.</li>
            <li> I replaced my very old one from Costco and it was not even close to the old one, so I bought this one</li>
            <li> when you first buy it, the vibrator motor is turned way down for the first 14 uses (to get newbies&#x27; gums acclimated to it, I discovered).  </li>
            <li> It seems fine for the purposes although the vibration is a little unnerving.</li>
            <li> my teeth have never felt cleaner and my dentist gave me positive scores at my last visit.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I even entertained the idea of purchasing an electric toothbrush was because of all of the positive reviews I read on them.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth better than a traditional toothbrush and charges last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be very thorough with a regular toothbrush and after using this consistently have still felt some plaque on the backs of my front and back teeth..</li>
            <li> The other reviews are true...</li>
            <li> they last about&lt;br /&gt;3-1/2 years, and then you need to buy a new unit; that&#x27;s reasonable service life in my opinion.</li>
            <li> For these 2 reasons alone I strongly recommend that anyone considering a Sonicare toothbrush consider the EasyClean or other higher end models offered, even though they are more expensive.</li>
            <li> The basic design is unchanged from the older model, but it has a different battery and some other welcome improvements from the E series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t know, the Sonicare is an electric toothbrush, but differs from other brushes in one major way.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my previous Sonicare electric toothbrush that finally died after many years.</li>
            <li> Love it this is my 2nd purchase after my previous one lasted over 10 years</li>
            <li> I know I now spend more time brushing my teeth and have found that there is much less scraping during my regular trips to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the less packaging as it seems I&#x27;m just constantly throwing away plastic and packing bags and recycling cardboard.  </li>
            <li> Initial charging took several hours, but since then it seems to recharge quite quickly and has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li> , the only problem was that it is supposed to give a 30 second quick pause and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unrelated to the product, but relevant to purchasing this through amazon:  when my toothbrush didn&#x27;t arrive the day following the scheduled delivery date (I have prime, and usually receives my items before the scheduled date), I contacted amazon to see if they had any updated tracking information (mine appeared to be permanently stuck in a transit location), and they went ahead and sent me a replacement with free one day shipping that I received the next day.  </li>
            <li> He gets up very early for work and if he doesnt run the shower and shut the bathroom door the sound will wake me up and im not a light</li>
            <li> have noticed that the Sonicare brush has kept tea stains down significantly -- which is why I purchased it --</li>
            <li> use for two months, nothing happen, but it is really convince for brushing, great for lazy person who are so lazy to moving the brush!</li>
            <li> I have taken this on a few trips both with and with out the charger and it has performed fine.</li>
            <li> I got Sonicare Essence to replace my 10yr old Sonicare Elite and it actually works better than the Elite series which was discontinued years ago; for half the price.</li>
            <li> and in the few weeks we have had it had worked fine.</li>
            <li> but this new toothbrush is a major pain-in-the-butt!</li>
            <li> it is larger than the pro series and therefore - I might guess - it has a large battery.</li>
            <li> but if you are large like me then I would suggest buying larger brush heads.</li>
            <li> No more finding just the right brush with just the right amount of energy applied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Strangely, this design flaw can be alleviated so simply with a rubber boot that fits tight around the brush</li>
            <li> &amp; it is a little hard to get inside with fat fingers but a damp handkerchief works great.</li>
            <li> After all, it is significantly more expensive that my previous toothbrushes, and really, how much better a job can it do?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stubby fat toothbrush stem, we find this new longer-thinner brush-stem design a true improvement, as there is less plastic body to wrap you lips around.</li>
            <li> I decided to not buy the one for $200, which after all seems a little overpriced considering it is all made of cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can clean it by turning it on in the sink (aiming down) with water running over it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, I&#x27;m glad I got this unit at a mega discount (got some mad coupons before buying), since I won&#x27;t be able to really use it for too long.</li>
            <li> Returned very easily for a second brush, which also had a small scrape in the handle.</li>
            <li> It was less costly than the original one that died.</li>
            <li> I like the action and the ease of cleaning, but find the toothbrush a little too light in weight.  </li>
            <li> It is a little different from what you might expect, and it takes some getting use to, but I love it.</li>
            <li> The travel case is a nice little bonus, just wish is was big enough to tuck the charger in for travel longer than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is the lowest end model that I&#x27;ve ever bought (I&#x27;ve own Sonicares for around 12 years now) and the velocity seems to be a lot less than other models.  </li>
            <li> Briefly, for a lot less than half the price, the Essence offers the essential benefits of the higher-end Sonicare products and it should be a good buy for both existing Sonicare users who don&#x27;t care about paying a premium for a higher end models&#x27; bells and whistles and for new/undecided users who would like to try out Sonicare without spending a lot in the process.</li>
            <li> and I think they are just as good as the original Sony and certasinly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, a little noisy.</li>
            <li> To save a few cents on a product that undoubtedly has a huge profit margin already?&lt;br /&gt;They should start including a replaceable battery, too.</li>
            <li> user, while it takes less time to brush and clean the toothbrush with an oral B old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li> When my husband opened it on Christmas day we realized that the toothbrush head that is clearly stated in the packaging and online was not included.</li>
            <li> Unit is as advertised; very similiar to my old Sonicare which ceased to take a charge after about 10 years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> After I started using this brush, my teeth started to clear up quite visibly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clearly, if you want to whiten your teeth, you should not out your hope on this.</li>
            <li> packaging and instructions were clear.  </li>
            <li> It clearly states a travel case comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clearly they know it&#x27;s a problem</li>
            <li> I can visibly see and feel a noticeable difference between how clean my teeth are immediately after using this as compared my previous, battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t unscrew it and let it air dry or wipe it clean about once a week before you know it open it up</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as my previous Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it already for 3 months and the improvements in my gums are clear.</li>
            <li> It really motivates young teens to brush daily.</li>
            <li> I take the brush off overnight to allow it to dry and have to clean it out several times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for nearly a decade.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care about all the fancy features, just the basic toothbrush features.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product (so does my dentist!).</li>
            <li> have caps and old teeth.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m looking for a rotating one that is not round.  </li>
            <li> being that it was over a year old</li>
            <li> But a dentist was very eloquent and years later I got around to trying one which happened to be this Sonicare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sonic care offers 2 versions of their brush&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Had to replace after a bunch of years on the old one.</li>
            <li> I had an old model that lasted 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The tooth brush has a soft &amp;#34;washer&amp;#34; that seals the brush from the motorized unit.  </li>
            <li> The trade-off of that is that the batteries aren&#x27;t removable, and the charger is more complex than it should be.</li>
            <li> That being said, the charger is inductive (no physical connection to the toothbrush) and it&#x27;s very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> but he still prefers the old manual.  </li>
            <li> It was considerably cheaper than the model I preferred, but I chose the savings over the upgrade.</li>
            <li> This replaces a 6 yr old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> this was to replace my old one which lasted for years.</li>
            <li> My old one had the quad timer.  </li>
            <li> This one replaced our 5 year old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It was considerably cheaper than the model I preferred, but I chose the savings over the upgrade.</li>
            <li> where the handles completely fell apart.</li>
            <li> Ths was a replacement for my old one that died after five or SX years</li>
            <li> However it does not come close to old skool  brushing.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare had the quadri-pace feature, and this one does not.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s been living on the stand so far.  </li>
            <li> Brush head has so far stood up well.  </li>
            <li> Use it frequently.</li>
            <li> One of these is too loud, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Wow..</li>
            <li> really would not ever go back to a manual toothbrush after using this.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> This really is the same as any of the models.</li>
            <li> They are completely done in 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> but we had the old brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare products for years and when my old toothbrush died on me, I bought this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I reordered another sonicare to replace my old model which lasted me 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Getting one for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it goes as long as my first, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel much cleaner than a regular spin brush.  </li>
            <li> The old toothbrush would no longer hold a charge..</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I tried letting the battery die completely, but it will not turn on.  </li>
            <li> and it measured up completely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a two minute timer, but not the 30-second beep that I&#x27;d come to rely on with my old one.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a Sonicare that was 12 years old.  </li>
            <li> So far.</li>
            <li> and wow, was I wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums were really hurting, puffy, red, bleeding...</li>
            <li> Replaces my old one and works quite well.</li>
            <li> There is a soft one provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a soft one provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, I am 85 years old.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner than after brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My old sonicare broke</li>
            <li> Our old Sonicare bit the dust after six years.  </li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> ** because my old Sonicare wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> The handle and charger are permanently sealed and completely waterproof.</li>
            <li> action can turn some off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> action can turn some off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like it really gets deep into the crevices and kills all germs.  </li>
            <li> It has been working well for me so far</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want mold coming anywhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li> I plan on putting all my young kids on them as soon as I can.  </li>
            <li> replaced my old worn out one.&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li> 30 second timer beep (don&#x27;t really need it,</li>
            <li> The bristles and soft and soothing to the gums.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel much cleaner than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Definitely see an improvement in my teeth and makes brushing so much easier</li>
            <li> When my teeth are sensitive, I can put it on the SENSITIVE setting and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like the stronger setting can.</li>
            <li> This version of the Sonicare was to replace our old one, which is still working</li>
            <li> The stem is MUCH chubbier than standard electric toothbrushes and is unwieldy to hold.</li>
            <li> When my old one quit after 10 years I was in a hurry to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I am well satisfied with the product, which I use at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Sonicare that I had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Seeing as Im adult</li>
            <li> I do like it because it fits the old brush heads I had.</li>
            <li> Then - and this is the rub - put it back in the charger but DON&#x27;T screw on the brush head until you&#x27;re ready to use again.</li>
            <li> So far, this one works just as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I began using this product.</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for my 11 year old who just got braces.</li>
            <li> The old toothbrush still works-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds like my old one did</li>
            <li> Had an inexpensive electric brush to try which was loud.</li>
            <li> It is too soft.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t really know the degree to which my Sonicare helps me until my next dental appointment in December.</li>
            <li> This is a mid-range electric toothbrush and so far, I haven&#x27;t missed the power windows and moonroof.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare since the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Replaced our 10 year old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Aiming the bristles directly at the junction of teeth and gums with the brush on cleans plaque formation away.  </li>
            <li> After my old Sonicare stopped accepting a charge, I unsuccessfully attempted to change the battery.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare had the quad-timer thing, but I don&#x27;t miss it.</li>
            <li> The only really noticeable difference between my &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; so unless you&#x27;re watching the second hand on a clock, you don&#x27;t know how much time you&#x27;re spending brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> So far the Sonicare has performed well after about two months of use.</li>
            <li> I have had one for years and bought this to replace an old one.  </li>
            <li> and it cleans really well in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an old Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> That one developed leaks:  </li>
            <li> I had just bought a package of 6 replacement brushes for it - the old E style.</li>
            <li> I prefer the old elbow-grease toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> One use changed my mind completely.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through using this brush, I have noticed (no placebo effect here) that a considerable amount of plaque has been removed.</li>
            <li> Actually replacement brushes cost as much as item.  </li>
            <li> We got this for my 21 year old son.  </li>
            <li> Get the Sonicare Easy Clean instead (that toothbrush is even more expensive than this one, but at least you won&#x27;t be growing a bacterial colony in your toothbrush...).</li>
            <li> It Is not as substantial as my old Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about it, because it is &amp;#34;just a toothbrush&amp;#34; and I have never had a different brand to compare it to!</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go back to manual brushing after this, and the two minute timer is very helpful</li>
            <li> My 9 year old Sonicare died on me.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the toothbrush works just like my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> B00763LZWQ old manual toothbrush]], to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 66 years young.</li>
            <li> it gave me no trouble.</li>
            <li> Action seems comparable.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> I bought to replace an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While the timer works to shut off the brush after two minutes of brushing, my old one paused every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> and wow, does my mouth like it.</li>
            <li> Old sonicare quit</li>
            <li> It has lived up to its reviews and is an absolute quality purchase especially in price comparison to others.</li>
            <li> First charge takes a really long time.</li>
            <li> I did experience some sensitivity with initial use, but after about a week my teeth were used to the fast brushing bristles.</li>
            <li> this was gotten to replace an old Philips sonicare elite, which had a failing battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No complaints from the recipient so far.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare tooth brush wore out</li>
            <li> When it came time to change the brush head, I could not remove the old brush, no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I can tell that helped because it would tickle sometimes early on, but now it just feels natural.</li>
            <li> you use deeply but gently between the teeth and below the gum line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li> Needed this as my old one had expired.</li>
            <li> have to admit I wasn&#x27;t quite convinced by the tv ads, but now after using the Sonic Care, I cannot stand to use my old style manual brush ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Far exceeds brushing manually.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my 13 year old nephew.  </li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Our 12 year old requested one for her b.d.</li>
            <li> and then our 11 year old granddaughter requested one for hers.  </li>
            <li> Item was complete.  </li>
            <li> My teeth (and overall mouth) feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My wife has to hold the brush in to complete brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now in a basket on my bathroom counter, because I can&#x27;t bear the thought of disposing of something that I paid way too much for, only to use a month.</li>
            <li> I found I don&#x27;t really need the extra bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old one that died.  </li>
            <li> My old one would not hold a charge after 7 years, so I bought this one.</li>
            <li> You must disassemble it completely every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I have become so frustrated with this process that I plan to replace this perfectly functional toothbrush in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I keep the charger from my old unit in my travel bag and always have it when I am on a longer trip.</li>
            <li> Used the old one for along time.  </li>
            <li> But the old one beeped every thirty seconds to show you should be finished with one quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my old OralB.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush cleans my teeth so well that they feel like I just had them professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for my kids (8 &amp; 6 yrs old)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been sat in its charger for nearly 18 hours and it&#x27;s still flashing.</li>
            <li> The first lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> The old model alerted you when a quarter of the session was up.  </li>
            <li> It does just what it is supposed to do with no trouble</li>
            <li> This was bought because the one she had needed to be replaced...too old.</li>
            <li> I bought the Phillips sonicare after much research on various brands.  </li>
            <li> that requires frequent cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling like I just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> my dentist said they weren&#x27;t really any different, b)</li>
            <li> I had to retire my old sonicare (can&#x27;t remember the model) and replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;original Sonicare (over 6 yrs old) has a stronger&lt;br /&gt;brush action .</li>
            <li> My old one died and I bought this to eplace it.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift and it was totally appreciated and used daily.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My old unit started working again after I ordered this one</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised</li>
            <li> It keeps its charge and is not too loud.  </li>
            <li> We purchased two Phillips Sonicare Essence 5600 when our old Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes were not working well.</li>
            <li> Really made a big difference in terms of dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> but it is not going to last much longer.</li>
            <li> sonic action might take some getting accustomed too.  </li>
            <li> There really doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much different about each version.</li>
            <li> An old review said it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This purchase is a replacement of my old one.</li>
            <li> Went from using the old stick and bristles to this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Sonicare which I had been using for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants a brush that works well without all the extras of different levels, etc.</li>
            <li> But wow...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not getting old</li>
            <li> It feels like an old model and it is.  </li>
            <li> I contacted them directly from their website with an online chat.   </li>
            <li> It has a soft brush so that you can massage your gums as well as brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this toothbrush compared to a traditional one.</li>
            <li> Frustration free and geny\tle (not too harsh) on the teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a rather long time to charge the first time, but after that it seems to hold the charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my old one which was also a Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush</li>
            <li> My old one just quit on me all at once, but I had it for 3 years</li>
            <li> I was replacing my old one which died when the battery would no longer charge.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush functions just like my old one, sans timer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 90 year old father.  </li>
            <li> I surprised him by ordering another through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Tried the charger from the old unit.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m stuck with a loud toothbrush that does nothing</li>
            <li> you should really consider the ultimate value of what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> Bought this Sonicare to replace my old one that lasted 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll think twice before purchasing anything from them ever again that offers a rebate.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my wife&#x27;s old one.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare wore out, and I bought what I thought was a replacement, but this unit does not have the quad-pacer timer like my old unit.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old Sonicare which we had used for years.  </li>
            <li> This unit works, and my old heads work with it, but</li>
            <li> There were these two spots on the back of my rear molars that I never felt like the dental hygienist really got when I&#x27;d go to get my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> have not used it as old one somehow began working again???</li>
            <li> But the timer turning the brush off completely after 2 minutes is aggravating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes and this was just a replacement for an old unit.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions for charging and didn&#x27;t do anything unusual, but the battery is shot now 7 months later.</li>
            <li> I will not buy another Philips rechargable device until this problem is fixed.</li>
            <li> My old one broke</li>
            <li> I had recently bought replacement brushes and really didn&#x27;t want to throw them away unused.  </li>
            <li> it was over 15 years old, so it was time for a replacement.</li>
            <li> My old sonicare is dying.</li>
            <li> So far, works and reliable.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it takes up a bit of counter space, but it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li> I had to use my hacksaw to remove the plastic tabs on the side of the old brushhead</li>
            <li> it made really loud noises but the sonic part of it stopped working within 6 months</li>
            <li> This is just like my old</li>
            <li> old that stopped charging.</li>
            <li> However the old one &amp;#34;beeped&amp;#34; at 30 seconds so you knew when to switch</li>
            <li> After the first use my teeth felt cleaner than they had in a long time, and the plaque isn&#x27;t a problem like before.</li>
            <li> She said the mechanics completely died and it&#x27;s a brick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t get this one fast enough.</li>
            <li> i got it to replace my 5 year old soniccare.</li>
            <li> The only thing you really need to do is replace the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> You can really notice the difference between this and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am not using the carry case so far</li>
            <li> I have used the sonic care tooth brushes for at least 5 years and my gums are in much better condition than before.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift 14 years ago and thought it was a waste of money because I didn&#x27;t expect it to last more than a year or two.  </li>
            <li> It has noticeably turned my teeth back a few shades and with that I&#x27;m more stoked to use it.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush, but it stopped holding a charge after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> It makes no ecological sense to design a toothbrush so that much more than the actual brush that needs to be replaced (unless that is the business model to make money).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this model to anybody who&#x27;s looking to really up their dental hygiene game and doesn&#x27;t want todrop a mint on the more lux models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush (my wife&#x27;s) was not even close to the quality of my Sonicare toothbrush, which was much more expensive (and worth the price).  </li>
            <li> I would have liked at least a second brush to have been included with this product.</li>
            <li> I left it in my apartment as I went on vacation for a few weeks and noticed on my return that it looked kind of gross</li>
            <li> I can tell with a few more uses it will only get</li>
            <li> Liked the toothbrush but the case is not great for packing and traveling.</li>
            <li> toothbrush does a good job where it fails is in its longevity.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was good but expensive, $130.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this toothbrush before this occurred, so please be wary of customers rating this before using it for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> So unable to give a good review.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the box it came in was plan and cheesy looking.</li>
            <li> Even if it fails right out of warranty, having super clean teeth would bring me back for another Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would give 5, but this thing is a royal mess to clean.</li>
            <li> My last one had &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; and made it easier to know when you had brushed each section of your teeth for the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have said removing the head and rinsing it after every use is &#x27;no big deal&#x27;, but that doesn&#x27;t address the fact that the inside is a breeding ground for mold and bacteria, which could only be avoided, if at all, by making sure the inside &#x27;pocket&#x27; dries out completely after every use.  </li>
            <li> What I expected and priced right.</li>
            <li> i bought this four months ago and have only had to charge the battery once, and my teeth feel dentist clean every single time!</li>
            <li> These things do not seem to be real sanitary and are a bit hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Primarily went with this model for price and had several other replacement brushes I wanted to use</li>
            <li> This is really worth having and it is also cheaper than the ones that other stores offers.  </li>
            <li> I had one of the original Sonicares with the thick straight shaft</li>
            <li> Only thing I find bothersome is having to use a flat head screw driver just to open when needing to replace batteries other than that it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> However I noticed the brush was less effective - less power.</li>
            <li> Maybe my old one was just tired, but this unit seems to vibrate at a faster pace (my husband even commented on the higher pitch sound it makes).  </li>
            <li> I have a VERY small mouth, so I LOVE the size of the brush head...</li>
            <li> I chose this because he said it was what he used at home, and it was somewhat economical compared to the other options he mentioned.</li>
            <li> The price was right as I purchased a brand new one for the same price 2 brush replacements are nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> A previous Sonicare had a better, actually useful hard plastic carry case.  </li>
            <li> Lost when my last electric toothbrush died--thrilled with my new one!</li>
            <li> She got this one and said it was much better than the other, but the real plus to this is that she paid only half of what she paid for the old one, for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To bad, used to have a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> note the replacement heads are pretty pricey in general which adds to long term cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because while it does clean my teeth quite well, I&#x27;ve noticed on a few occasions that it has made my gums bleed.</li>
            <li> And a tip for owners, always unscrew your brush head and clean it out every few days,</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this toothbrush, my teeth feel as clean as after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This replaced a much older Sonicare that died after several years of intermittent use, and I find myself using this newer model</li>
            <li> At first I thought I should have bought the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> This is my first sonicare product, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that I have to pay more now for an item that I had already purchased but because of the seller&#x27;s mistake I wasn&#x27;t able to give it to my husband on Christmas.</li>
            <li> Really like this toothbrush, ordered it after the battery of my first Philips Sonicare stopped working after I had it quite a few years.</li>
            <li> The first one I owned had a battery issue where after several weeks it would not turn on as if it had a short.  </li>
            <li> Also, the brush heads themselves are more expensive than the ones for the slightly higher end models.</li>
            <li> I am sure I have never brushed for two minutes in the past.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush holds a charge long enough for me to make it home again with a still sparkling smile.</li>
            <li> This model does not have the different speeds that the older one had</li>
            <li> This one looks exactly the same but is programmed differently.  </li>
            <li> however it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second quadrant timer that the older elite model had.</li>
            <li> main thing I have heard is you need to still move the brush back and forth, and hold it at a 45 deg angle to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I won&#x27;t ever go back to a regular toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an older model that had died, and wanted something simple, for a one-person household.  </li>
            <li> Also, this particular unit does not have the 30 second &amp;#34;quad timer.&amp;#34;  I ordered it not realizing that the timer was an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; feature.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, as my first one finally wore out after over 5 years of use.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version of Sonicare which finally went kaput!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an older version of the same toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This unit replaces one of my older ones that finally died.....</li>
            <li> I had been traveling a lot more often than usual and decided to pick up a second Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The sonic aspect is pretty startling at first, but you quickly get used to it.  </li>
            <li> This is second Sonicare toothbrush we purchased - first one, set of 2 purchased at Costco, lasted 4 years with daily use.  </li>
            <li> Overall, seems good value for money - it is hard to see what more an expensive model could provide.</li>
            <li> The manual says that the vibration stutters every thirty seconds so you will know when to move to the next part of mouth, 4 sides, upper left, upper right, lower right and lower left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Weighing the difference between replacing just the handle and buying this new set I would have to say that the 2 year warranty, the new battery type (with matching charger) plus another brush head make the small difference in price well worth the money.</li>
            <li> You have to be constantly disassembling the device due to the mold that builds up inside and to clean it you need to submerge each component into clorox.  </li>
            <li> and the price was just right after looking on other sites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good so far the brush seems a little hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked high and low for the racing stripes on this thing but can&#x27;t seem to find any.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for personal use or as a gift.</li>
            <li> you invest in one, you will save time in the chair, your teeth will slowly become more white and you will really have the overall feeling of having a cleaner mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all I had to do was call them up and describe my problem, and they sent me a new one immediately, along with a prepaid label to ship the old one back.      </li>
            <li> only level of comfort was replacing my Philips with the new Philips and however, my old one did not have the Sonicare feature.</li>
            <li> Since I had recently purchased new brush heads for my old one I wanted a replacement that was compatible.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge like no other!</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is a design issue, but tooth paste seems to get into the handle a little more than the first generation ones did.</li>
            <li> There are so many models of these products that it is nearly impossible to become informed without this type of information available.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the two minute timer is always accurate or maybe i am not paying attention.</li>
            <li> Shes only been using it for a short time but really likes it so far</li>
            <li> I really wanted a sonicare toothbrush for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works very well, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Have used Philips Sonicare in the past and really enjoy and appreciate the rotation and the way it cleans both teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> only negative thing is that they can get kind of gross under the brush head.</li>
            <li> If you really love it and later decide you would in fact use the extra features of the more expensive models, then upgrade!</li>
            <li> All of a sudden the toothbrush will hold a charge for more than a few days and the low charge warning feature had always been an issue.</li>
            <li> Within a week, my gums were back to normal again.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I expected and did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> The sound is loud, I wish that the rechargeable is universal so it can be carried on travelling to other countries where have different output.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not going back to a normal toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> i dont think i can ever go back to a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It came with a full charge, but the instructions said to charge it for a few days continuously which I did.</li>
            <li> Not hard to open.</li>
            <li> Charging is not hard, simply putting it into the slot and it charges.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t  have much time on your hands to stay and clean, is not a good choice for you</li>
            <li> I had a similar Sonicare for years and when this one arrived it worked fine for a few weeks....</li>
            <li> You can clean them off under running water and they look all clean, but if you start looking in all the nooks and crannies, they get crud growing up in the head and down in the handle, and even in the battery charger (which isn&#x27;t too hard to clean).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish i had spent a little more money and gotten one with the beep feature that tells you to change position.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is easy to use and I don&#x27;t brush too hard on my gums.</li>
            <li> because the battery on my original one would&#x27;t last two minutes anymore, it would die at about a minute and a half and switch off as soon as I pushed the button again.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush, and this is a replacement for the one that my daughter bought me five years ago, after I had carpel-tunnel surgery, and was having a hard time maneuvering a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I live in Kentucky where most of the residents are missing one or more teeth due to poor dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> but it did have the 30-second beep reminder to get you to pace yourself while brushing, but that feature isn&#x27;t on this new basic model.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to buy another one that I couldn&#x27;t service with new battery in the future.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying a new charger I decided to change to an EasyClean 500 series for the following reasons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for years, recently had to replace it cause a new puppy decided to use it as a chew toy.</li>
            <li> This new version has a smaller head which I have yet to get used to.</li>
            <li> The new ones might have a slimmer grip, but this one is slim enough.</li>
            <li> They last forever, just get a new head every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my new Sonicare Essence 5600 for several months.</li>
            <li> the new brush-head from the regular toothbrush onto the electric toothbrush shaft.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be better because it is sonic, instead of rotating, but it vibrates your teeth so hard that it feels like they&#x27;re going to fall out!</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is very much like the other one we had about four years.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and it stays charged for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It does the same thing as the more expensive Sonicares, sans some features for more than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing to watch out for is to keep your mouth closed as much as possible or be prepared to clean your mirror</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any product here on amazon and although I have been a member for a long time I finally had to make a review on this product.</li>
            <li> Although this one works the same as the last Sonicare I had, it is much thicker in size.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get it to go into gentle mode/ too intense for me, waste of money, it&#x27;s sitting in the cabinet unused.</li>
            <li> It indicates that it is charged but brushing is definitely less powerful.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted for at least 10 years maybe more</li>
            <li> For home use, I have the slimmer and more expensive model, but this works very well for after lunch teeth brushing.</li>
            <li> Makes navigating my mouth much easier, especially getting to those back teeth.  </li>
            <li> I received a finger nail infection from this product and will be taking further action with the manufacturer and Amazon to refund me completely.</li>
            <li> But $39 (what I paid) and now $45 (the current price) is all just too much for this very basic model.  </li>
            <li> I purchased several for the whole family and won&#x27;t be looking back again!</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare, and I always like how much cleaner my teeth get from using a sonciare than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome - I just wrap some blue tape around the base of the head to prevent the dreaded water seepage and gunk accumulation that others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> , this reasonably priced Sonicare does everything the more expensive models do.  </li>
            <li> And it is so thick that when it starts to slide out of my hand, i suddenly find that I&#x27;m gripping the vibrating end of the brush</li>
            <li> one is a little too flimsy, plus the head is not as large as the older models.</li>
            <li> It is quite powerful and can make a bit of a mess on your mirror until u learn to control it</li>
            <li> While I felt that this created a major opportunity for health problems, we did not experience anything</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, there is one major problem with this set which is why I gave it 3 stars rather than</li>
            <li> It cleans like no other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing the other ones our family uses with the higher level model.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for over 2 months now and it is a major upgrade from the battery toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I thought that seemed a little better than what I have seen other places.  </li>
            <li> The size is a little bulky compared to the other models, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> Firstly, credit where it is due.  </li>
            <li> If you are elderly, disabled or a young child, this might not be the right choice for you.  </li>
            <li> best part is this model is less expensive than the other models Sonicare offers and</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums get so clean with very little work.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean with very little effort at all.</li>
            <li> item is actually an upgrade from my previous Sonicare which lasted a full 6.5 years.</li>
            <li> Like don&#x27;t know if there are any, but I am game to try it and think that it will be just fine!  </li>
            <li> I finally got tired of the whole experience &amp; went back to the Oral B Electric toothbrush which worked out better.</li>
            <li> (right after it cannot be returned) the motor went to about half its speed</li>
            <li> This model accepts the same style of toothbrush heads as my old model, so the package of new heads that I recently bought can still be used.</li>
            <li> But after reading other reviews, everyone said to take it apart once a week to clean it out and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used disposable electric toothbrushes in the past which seem to clean as well and do not need cleaning except for a rinse.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted the super-clean, white teeth results, so I tried using it for a whole month and a half.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those rich people that brushes their teeth everyday, you may or may not get the same results.</li>
            <li> Also, due to its fairly narrow head, I&#x27;m able to get to my wisdom teeth, which was always a challenge with the Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compliment the new battery, the toothbrush also has a new feature that gradually increases the intensity of the sonic action to help acclimate you to using it, as it takes a little bit to get used to the sonic action.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get use to it, because it tickles, but it is well worth it, just keep it up.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much as I tend to put too much pressure and brush too hard.</li>
            <li> Only thing is my husband has one - different model and it has turning brush inside the main brush and this model does not.</li>
            <li> In a last ditch effort to stave off the process, I did extensive research online and particularly here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Strange noise, a high &amp;#34;dentist drill&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The other develops a gross black mold inside the top of the handle where it meets the brush head.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s just electric toothbrushes in general...</li>
            <li> To save on frequency of teeth cleaning and general visits to the dentist, I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I scroll through the comments and try to get a general census of what individuals thought about the product.</li>
            <li> I lost that brush a long time ago, and so when I heard they had a basic version for MUCH cheaper</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clearly cleaner than using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for so long that I really don&#x27;t need the 30 second reminders to know when to move on to another section of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how loud the unit is when on, but that is a minor distraction.  </li>
            <li> My old toothbrush lasted ten years</li>
            <li> I believe the old model was also the basic entry-level</li>
            <li> My old one had the quadrapacer (30 second interval timer)</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this unit doesn&#x27;t give you a notice every 30 seconds like the old one did.  </li>
            <li> my old one finally bit the dust after about 10 years.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my last Sonicare, and this one works just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Does not have the 30 second signal like my old one</li>
            <li> Looking to contact Philips for a replacement being that it&#x27;s only 9 months old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fast and rough that it hurts her gums.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recently had to retire my old brush.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this cleans better than a regular toothbrush however, and have heard mixed reviews from different dentists...</li>
            <li> The only issue that I have is that it is extremely loud.</li>
            <li> fMy old one had the 30 second beep feature</li>
            <li> It uses the same brush heads as the old one.</li>
            <li> Watching a clock for the whole time is a drag.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this back in the early &#x27;90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have with this electric toothbrush is that it is to loud</li>
            <li> the further I got away from my bi-annual cleanings I developed stains.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush head is so tiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> my 12 year old Philips finally bit the dust and wouldn&#x27;t charge any longer.</li>
            <li> I miss my old one that had a 30 second notification.</li>
            <li> The old one finally died.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t enthused since my only experience with an electric toothbrush was the old 1960s version.  </li>
            <li> I only get about 2-3 days out of my old Sonciare now.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really need the 30 sec warnings</li>
            <li> I guess it finally died of old age.</li>
            <li> and charge last four complete days and still had charge on return home.</li>
            <li> and so far haven&#x27;t had to charge it for the last three weeks.</li>
            <li> but I miss the 30 second timer that the old models had</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush finally died after about 12 years of use.  </li>
            <li> I would hope in the future Phillips makes it easier to change out old batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth/gums are sensitive, as I floss almost daily without bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonic toothbrush and I felt the need to replace the old one when it cease recharging.</li>
            <li> My old one finally quit working after 15 years of use.</li>
            <li> My last trip to the hygienist got a surprised reaction and no scaling from them.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare finally bit the dust (I&#x27;m not complaining -</li>
            <li> This was a replacement as my old sonic care &amp;#34;bit the dust&amp;#34; after several years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my current Sonicare that is 5 or 6 years old.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is loud, buzzes your brains, and splashes everywhere if you brush with your mouth open.  </li>
            <li> I had extra old heads</li>
            <li> Have gone 10 days using twice daily without charging so far.</li>
            <li> My old one finally died and this was a replacement.</li>
            <li> Back to trustworthy old toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I uses the same heads and charges even faster than the old one.</li>
            <li> This problem is so prevalent in these toothbrushes that a third party manufacturer has developed a product to remedy the issue.  </li>
            <li> It served me well, and the battery lasted 7 years, much longer than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The only downside would be the build up of old toothpaste/water/spit that ends up in the area where the brush and charger connect.</li>
            <li> If anyone complains of the noise, it&#x27;s only loud to the user.</li>
            <li> I stand next to my husband while he is brushing his teeth and its not that loud.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how terrific my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee drinker and lately I had been observing more than usual yellowness on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is similar to my old one but my old one was a step above this model.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t place this box anywhere near my personal belonging.</li>
            <li> am so used to the time it takes to complete a thorough brushing of the teeth that I don&#x27;t have to be prompted when to move to the next quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much money I spent on a toothbrush that I just ended up throwing away after 2 months.</li>
            <li> My old one just stopped one day, perhaps I&#x27;ll try another brand the next time.</li>
            <li> Since my 15 year old pre-philips Sonicare toothbrush finally died I had to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased, I thought it was the same as my old</li>
            <li> This replaced a ten-year old Sonicare that finally died.  </li>
            <li> The action is different so cannot judge myself.  </li>
            <li> I got the same one because the old one had served me well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on giving this one to a relative and purchasing another model off ebay since I am not happy with the manufacturer for this and don&#x27;t want to give them the satisfaction of buying a better model direct.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Ive used a normal toothbrush for so long.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush heads are kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li> had better,  had worse. ..</li>
            <li> Just doing an effective vibration and started behaving like a drunk hula hooper might.</li>
            <li> Head replacement is kind of expensive</li>
            <li> At Costco, Walmart or bed bath and beyond,  there not cheap but there worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this since I already had own one before.</li>
            <li> that is lacks the timer that will let you know when it is time to shift the brush around (30 sec here, 30 sec there, etc) to get the full experience.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if Philips would figure out a way to prevent this; it seems to me to be a trait of questionable hygienics.  </li>
            <li> The brush is large without being uncomfortable and the vibration is not to strong to hurt the gums.</li>
            <li> Way better than my previous Oral-B. Replacement heads can be a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more on one that doesn&#x27;t get black mold growing in it within weeks.  </li>
            <li> The packaging could have been done a little better and less industrial.</li>
            <li> My dental costs went down after I first started using this product years ago.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had tears streaming down my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I actually hate that I don&#x27;t have a little pocket one to bring to work because my teeth feel so clean in the morning that I want that great feeling after lunch...</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, cleans amazingly well, but the toothbrush is expensive, and the heads are expensive and unwieldy (seriously, you have to buy the whole screw-on part?).</li>
            <li> This one works great and is much much less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the less expensive version but It preforms great.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, although the price is a little bit high.</li>
            <li> Free 2 day shipping and unbelievable pricing on almost every item they sell!</li>
            <li> but I can tell you that before I brushed with this toothbrush my mouth felt down right fuzzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After spending a long time chatting with Philips and answering questions and given instructions not to put the unit in a dishwasher they agreed to ship me a new handle.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice 2 minute shut off feature that let&#x27;s you know that you&#x27;ve brushed enough... for some that would like to continue to brush, press that little green circle and brush on...</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Sonicare and was well aware of the excellence of this product.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing my hand in soap and and hot water for half an hour I&#x27;m here to report that I just threw the thing away and will be purchasing another electric toothbrush that won&#x27;t end up killing me through mold grown inside of it.</li>
            <li> Bought first one on Amazon and it broke in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I got it sooner than expected, and it has given me no trouble so far!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other&#x27;s offer for so much more money</li>
            <li> price is much more affordable compared to the other size I have purchased in the past..</li>
            <li> bY the way it was quick shipping as usual by amazon.</li>
            <li> No problems with cleaning or charging or anything yet, though the heads to wear out quickly if you apply even a small amount of pressure (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway).</li>
            <li> The buzz is a little hard to get used to, but the 2 minute timer is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> My last one finally quit so I ordered a new one, It works as expected, hope it lasts as long as my first one</li>
            <li> Long battery life and cleans as well as my older larger Philips model.</li>
            <li> It allows saliva and toothpaste to slip into a large empty space just above the magnets that cause the brush head to rotate.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> other thing I really like about this toothbrush is the quality of the enclosure.  </li>
            <li> (pro tip!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried about gum and teeth sensitivity due to how fast these things go.</li>
            <li> This unit is hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is very thorough in teeth care; I wouldn&#x27;t have any other brand.</li>
            <li> Only con the brushes are expensive, otherwise I like it better than a normal brush</li>
            <li> It vibrates and cleans just as good as the units that are 5x as expensive!</li>
            <li> I choose it because if its high ratings and past positive experience with Sonicare, but it doesn&#x27;t work properly as the timer doesn&#x27;t function.  </li>
            <li> You have to clean it out at least once a week.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint, primarily that you cannot just replace the brush part.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I clean and dry the handle, by morning the charging stand is stained green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a different model for about 5 years and it finally died, but it makes me think this one was a refurbished model, so steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li> Always clean and remove the head as this head type allows a small amount of fluid to get into the unit, and if not careful it will rust internally prematurely.  </li>
            <li> After my Oral B toothbrush finally gave up, I went back to the old manual brushes for a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not comfortable to use because of how loud it is and fast vibration it has.</li>
            <li> You will be much happier and will consider the extra $25 well spent.</li>
            <li> Next time I will research one or two models above this to get the timer function my old one had.</li>
            <li> After five years using my old Sonicare toothbrush of the same model, it would only hold a charge for 15 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush to replace my old brush that finally gave out after 5 years daily use.</li>
            <li> When it finally died completely I sawed it open to remove the batteries and found that they were 1-1/2 volt NiCads (2 nickel cadmium batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I owned a Philips Sonicare prior to this one, and my old one had the timer that beeped in 30-second increments so you could switch to a different part of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> The irony is, the toothbrush that this one was to replace became incredibly loud (and only started doing that in the last week of it&#x27;s 2 year life), and that&#x27;s why I was replacing it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare toothbrush for about 9 years, I&#x27;ve always believed that my consistent use has prevented a lot of cavities--especially since I&#x27;m a pretty poor flosser.</li>
            <li> I had the older model that has the 30 sec warnings.</li>
            <li> This is particularly irritating to me, since I work abroad regularly and would like to be able to use my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for approximately seven years until it slowly died, sometimes stopping short of its two-minute clean, sometimes not even able to start it at all.</li>
            <li> and there was a capability of vibration strength, but for me personally I found it unnecessary and like this one better.</li>
            <li> the buzzing noise it makes is a little louder than my first Sonicare</li>
            <li> Takes a little while to get used to it (tickles at first), but it&#x27;s kind-of like going to the dentist but without the exclamations, &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> My previous one also beeped every 30 seconds so the full two minute cycle was evenly divided:: lower inside, lower outside, upper inside, upper outside.</li>
            <li> This new on for the price is just great, gets less dirty inside due to new design</li>
            <li> the brushes last pretty long and the batteries on this last really long.</li>
            <li> it tightens my gums and I never have any bleeding when brushing my teeth and even teeth that felt loose are tight again due to the healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> Only downfall I can think of is that you must clean between the handle and brush head frequently, if not it gets a bit grimy and filmy inside after a few brushes.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this particular model is that it does not have the 30 second timer that lets you know how long to brush each of the 4 sections of your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard now that it has reached full capacity.  </li>
            <li> Took some time to get use from it, generally sprayed the mirrors for the first several weeks but have it somewhat down pat now, eventually I will learn how to wipe it off properly so as not to have it stick to the charger, but that&#x27;s for another day</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one because the battery would no longer recharge long enough.  </li>
            <li> I have to take the brush off every other week and clean out the well where toothpaste has dripped down the shaft</li>
            <li> Once you start using them you will notice how much cleaner your mouth feels compared to a conventional brush.</li>
            <li> , I feel like my teeth get much much cleaner than with a conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> That is from the black mold draining out of a small port on the side at the top of the brush</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the rechargeable battery cannot be replaced when it gets old, so you have to buy a whole new brush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth never felt so clean and no more changing batteries!</li>
            <li> He loves it, his old one, our hand me down with a new brush of course, stopped working</li>
            <li> I generally like using the Sonicare, but I sometimes use this once a day and my regular, manual toothbrush once or twice.  </li>
            <li> It was much cheaper on Amazon than in Target or other local</li>
            <li> And unlike other modern electronics, this unit&#x27;s input voltage is not international.</li>
            <li> A reasonable price for the same level of oral care compared to other models.  </li>
            <li> it was the same thing other than the packaging much simpler.</li>
            <li> I have been using these, &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34; for a while and my teeth are so much cleaner than if I used any other regular motor brush.</li>
            <li> Two complaints: one is something that others have mentioned a lot - the way icky stuff builds up under the toothbrush head and smells; and the other is that it&#x27;s not terribly durable.</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling tingly and clean in all hard to reach areas including the back of the tongue.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m just rating this 3 stars due to the fact that it collects saliva and water inside, it gets really gross really fast.</li>
            <li> then our old one I wish I would have purchased long ago.</li>
            <li> The only thing different is the old one had 30 second sounds adding up to 2 minutes, but I got accustomed to this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no excuse for any sellers to not deliver the advertised products when paid for.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, I will stop back in five months after my next dentist appointment to edit my review as far as health improvement and product durability.  </li>
            <li> Since using it and doing my daily flossing, I have only had my teeth professionally cleaned 3 times in the last 9 years.  </li>
            <li> The old one still worked but the battery pack did not hold charge over a long term any more.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I had given him the Sonicare product several years ago and the battery apparently gave out.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was just dead batteries at first, so I replaced them.  </li>
            <li> I had one a few years ago and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed it!</li>
            <li> They last for a few months but then end up losing their charge, and stop vibrating the brush thistles as much as is necessary to be useful.</li>
            <li> After the first few uses you no longer even notice it at all.</li>
            <li> a pretty carrying case, I can take it with me everyday when i am in travel.</li>
            <li> My first one died and I did without for a few weeks..</li>
            <li> the brush portion does not fit this new sonic are, comes with one new brush</li>
            <li> This version has a large knob at the bottom of the brush refill which is half of the motor assembly.  </li>
            <li> Particularly because it can&#x27;t possibly cost Phillips a penny to include it - they are are doing it arbitrarily to create an upmodel where none need exist.</li>
            <li> really has come down from where they were originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only drawback is when you first use it, it does tickle a little bit, but that goes away quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare, I guess I am a little biased towards Oral Care as that is the toothbrush I&#x27;ve had the last 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> The Phillips sonicare is far too hard on teeth; the gentle setting (which you can program to use) is fine, but the brush seems to keep switching back to the regular setting, which is way too hard and feels like I have a jackhammer in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The new design also has rubber strips on the side for control when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I also floss although you don&#x27;t need to as much due to the high performance of Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> After using it about a month I really feel that this brush gets my teeth cleaner than my old tooth brush which was motorized but was of the 10-20 dollar variety, not exactly top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price for this but was disappointed with packaging, especially since it was a Christmas gift!.  </li>
            <li> and I think that it really makes a difference in dental care, but now it has less power.</li>
            <li> Much improved over previous versions...</li>
            <li> does not seem to be as much a quality product as previous versions.</li>
            <li> It really makes brushing my teeth less of a chore.  </li>
            <li> Much easier then manual brushing and seemingly less &amp;#34;mechanical&amp;#34</li>
            <li> We both like how well the product works, but we&#x27;re very reluctant to buy this again with an issue like this presenting itself less than a month after purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> I went to the dentist regularly and brushed like they said, but apparently I wasn&#x27;t brushing that well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing that has surprised me is how long the batteries last.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, it was noticible because the next time I visit my doc noticed the difference and asked me what was I doing differently because she noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> As for age, I have two that are over 6 years old, I think, but the newer ones do not last as long...</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the one I&#x27;d had for a long time, the old one simply stopped working.  </li>
            <li> After telling them repeatedly this is not my first time at the rodeo and giving them my last chat session or case number, then they would concede to no troubleshooting (five minutes waste of time).</li>
            <li> In other to avoid sticky messy goo on the inside, I take it apart and thoroughly clean it after each use.  </li>
            <li> It is a little large for her hand.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a film on teeth after first use and can be painful if the top of the brush hits your upper teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the same model, but discovered too late that it is not; while our old model beeped every 30 seconds to remind you to move the toothbrush, this one does not; for consistent brushing, you need to keep an eye on the clock.</li>
            <li> It has completely corrected my gum problems and kept me from any cavaties or other major dental work since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The product made some beeping noises upon starting up the first few times I brushed and then never was heard from again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I used to have a sonic toothbrush from a different company that was far superior to this one</li>
            <li> I have an earlier model, and the tooth brush refills were much cheaper and less intrusive to the environment.  </li>
            <li> Delighted to see Sonicare #3 will be significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them to be considerably  less expensive than the newer models yet in my opinion they do just as good a job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the elongated, narrow brush head, which is similar to that of a standard toothbrush as opposed to the Braun&#x27;s small rounded brush.  </li>
            <li> bigger and noiser than new ones, expected quiter smaller and two heads.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> the brand and type were &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34; by my dentist in-law and while using it the first few times was very strange, that&#x27;s just electric toothbrushes in general...</li>
            <li> I have used this now for several months and my teeth are much cleaner feeling and longer lasting freshness than using a typical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used their products previously and bought this one as a replacement for an old one that died after nearly five years of daily no problem service.  </li>
            <li> Other Sonicare products performed very well, and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is very noisy and does not clean well.</li>
            <li> so it is truly I fine product, but alas I cannot use it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> main feature I really like about this particular model is completely ascetic.</li>
            <li> This little baby is charged up and ready to &amp;#34;get</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to if you never used a Sonicare before, but cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> The new user is not aware of this and before you know it you have manufactured a breeding ground for bacteria.</li>
            <li> This product is kind of hard to use, it brushes too hard and sometimes hurts my teeth, I have stop using it now and won&#x27;t buy it anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other cheap ones in the past and didn&#x27;t really think that a Sonicare was worth spending the additional money on, but I admit now I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I finally gave in and looked up a new electric toothbrush to purchase, after all, who can go back to a plain old regular toothbrush after using an electric one?</li>
            <li> read a few comments where people were complaining that this model brush did not feature the &amp;#34;30 second beep&amp;#34; interval, but a very simple way to counter that is just to use your smart phone as the timer.</li>
            <li> I switched back to my old toothbrush because every time I was done with this teeny little brush, my mouth felt like it could be cleaner by using my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;ve learned to put my finger (gently) on the stem to keep some of the vibration down!  </li>
            <li> Have used it for years, and in this day and age of possible HIGH dentals costs, this product does its part to keep tarter build up down and also keeps teeth brighter</li>
            <li> I usually take normal toothbrushes with me whenever I go on vacation, and after coming home and using this toothbrush again, it&#x27;s so clear</li>
            <li> This brush will leave your teeth feeling VERY clean but it tends to work a little hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush has cut that down to the normal 2 times a year.</li>
            <li> It is just irreponsible of Philips to make doing the right thing so hard.  </li>
            <li> the brand and type were &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34;, and while using it the first few times was very strange</li>
            <li> Luckily, its not a huge deal, and not worth taking a star off.</li>
            <li> They only last 3 months (4-6 months is possible but anything beyond that is not recommended) and they are not cheap whether you use a high end or a low end</li>
            <li> AS MY OLDER (NOW DEAD) MORE EXPENSIVE BRUSH.</li>
            <li> interval brush action &amp;#34;stutter&amp;#34; present on other Sonicares to tell you</li>
            <li> The other one (without blue stripes on the handle that my wife uses that&#x27;s about six months old doesn&#x27;t keep on flashing when it&#x27;s taken out of the charger).</li>
            <li> I bought this one on Cyber Monday for less than the normal cost, but will not hesitate when it comes time to replace it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend lots of money on different electric toothbrushes over the last few years because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $80 on a high end model.</li>
            <li> The travel case is a decent little case to help keep your brush and head together while you are on the go.  </li>
            <li> The space between the main frame and detachable brush head is huge and molds like crazy.</li>
            <li> However, it is poorly designed for cleaning as it gets water into places and produces mildew even when you try to clean it with anything that will reach the tiny areas.</li>
            <li> This valuable feature is missing from this particular low end model.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, small head for tight places, and did not take long to get used to at all.</li>
            <li> I may stop getting professional dental cleanings every 6 months because the hygienist never finds any plaque or other problems.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> worked only a short time, it was such a disappontmnt haven&#x27;t had it long, and now it has stopped working.</li>
            <li> The need to track my brushing time is a hassle which I could live with if in addition I didn&#x27;t also have to change the brush head in less than two months to keep up the power of the brushing.  </li>
            <li> Both with a new head for less than $100 for both.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a major gripe, and I only miss the feature when I&#x27;m just waking up and am too groggy to count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I contacted Philips and explained that this is the second defective toothbrush we&#x27;ve gone through in only a few months, and they said since I&#x27;m still under the two year warranty that they will send me a new one</li>
            <li> The wand units don&#x27;t seem to last very long - this was our third replacement over ten years.  </li>
            <li> He was tired of his not getting his teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me at least 7 years, so I&#x27;m looking for the same quality here.</li>
            <li> I know you need to use a soft toothbrush, but this is beyond the soft ones I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am such a creature of convenience (&#x3D;read: lazy) that this is actually very encouraging.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, of course you have to replace the heads regularly.</li>
            <li> I only hope it lasts as long as the last one did.</li>
            <li> and I can say it&#x27;s a few steps forward from the classic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I first turned this toothbrush on, it was so loud, I thought it might be broken.  </li>
            <li> My original one finally died and this one was less expensive but works very well.</li>
            <li> Yes the brush is small and not tough enough to brush hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I note that some other reviewers have complained about needing to clean the inside.</li>
            <li> I choose it because it was cheap, and said it brushes the same as the more expensive ones, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> But for an adult who knows how to brush their own teeth properly, FORCING a 2 MINUTE SHUTOFF is ludicrous and annoying enough to me to justify a one-star rating.  </li>
            <li> I wore out a previous Sonicare, really Old!</li>
            <li> wish I can replace with small round brush once a while for some people don&#x27;t hare big mouth to clean</li>
            <li> I had seen this item for a much higher price, and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it was the same as my husband&#x27;s toothbrush; it was, and I paid less than half what he paid.  </li>
            <li> The company replaced the handle and the new handle only lasted a few days before it stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> : After a little over a month of daily use, this Sonicare toothbrush is behaving erratically -- the cycle does not reliably last 2 minutes but instead stops early, and the strength of the vibration has diminished.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happier if the toothbrush fit into the base a little better.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement, as my previous purchase was a couple of years old and the battery finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one is super loud.  </li>
            <li> I  am certain that very few people will go the effort I did to dispose of the batteries correctly.</li>
            <li> Soon the batteries in that model were too weak to hold a charge long enough for travel even though it still worked adequately at home.  </li>
            <li> At that time, Sonicare offered only limited variations of their unit; it was prior to Philips purchasing the company and expanding the product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious though if using this high speed sonic technology 2-3 Times daily will wear down my gumline.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because the head is so small you can&#x27;t use as much tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Long lasting batteries</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this one to last as long but, for this price, there is no downside.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> The timer is a bit too short, should be 1.5x as long.</li>
            <li> I have the same one, I use it for long time.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t beep at 30 seconds intervals, so you have to determine how long to spend on the four quadrants of teeth during the two minutes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the off brand replacements as they don&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> hold a long charge quiet, work as described.</li>
            <li> The heads are skinny and long, so you can reach way back into your mouth to get all your teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought they all had that, but apparently not.  </li>
            <li> I still cannot believe my last Sonicare Elite lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll keep replacing them with the same as long as they keep holding up</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my husbands more expensive one that had died, he seriously likes this one much more as the head can reach in and get to all those hard to teach spots.</li>
            <li> Hope this last as long.</li>
            <li> I don not believew that it will last as long.</li>
            <li> I think the maybe the way around both issues is to take the brush head off after each use, and lay both sides in the carrying case, laying flat.</li>
            <li> The brushes last a long time and the battery does not need charging often.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t think I was brushing long enough before!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if that is an issue.  </li>
            <li> My charge lasted long enough for an 8 day trip.</li>
            <li> Has a flat side</li>
            <li> It does work well as long as you take the time to go the entire two minutes, instead of just rushing it.</li>
            <li> I lost one of these couple of weeks back and felt as if I didn&#x27;t brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> My second one has lasted over 5 years and the batteries were now not holding a charge for long.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no way to avoid it, so I usually have to disassemble it and clean it every other day or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the heads are sorta expensive, apparently dentist&#x27;s recommend these because they can clean in the smallest of areas.</li>
            <li> Now, twice, I will be getting rid of electronics that work just fine, except for small things like no more brushes or frustration with the lack of a timer.  </li>
            <li> great,,,,long lasting charge,,,,,,but small head,,,,than older models</li>
            <li> Before, with regular toothbrushes, I frequently had little cavity spots to take care of, maybe once a year.</li>
            <li> the first one I left behind on a trip, 2nd one I&#x27;m still using, and this one is a back up.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, and I hit my teeth with the hard part of the brush when I first tried, but it didn&#x27;t take long to adapt.  </li>
            <li> Not a major detriment, but this may turn some off to it.</li>
            <li> Not a major detriment, but this may turn some off to it.</li>
            <li> I have no major complaints except for the 2 minute timeout.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare for quite a few years, and received a new one from my husband.</li>
            <li> They also last a very long time - you just need to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I figured the toothbrush itself has a very flat box.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as loud as my previous electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Take the head apart and wash/rinse every crevice and let dry before putting it back together.</li>
            <li> sent me the wrong model when i was informed it would fit several brushes I had,</li>
            <li> Previously, I owned an Oral B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars is because it has a negative point: it&#x27;s really noisy.</li>
            <li> every couple days ( I unscrew mine every morning) to let the liquid inside dry out, otherwise you can develop a petri dish inside the internal workings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My gums are a bit angry, so go easy if you&#x27;re not used to an electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I expected this product to have the 30 second interval timer as did my former Sonicare product -  </li>
            <li> Holds a solid charge for 2 weeks and re-charges in a few hours completely.</li>
            <li> Also, the vibrations is strong and might shock your teeth if you take a wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shocked if things haven&#x27;t gotten better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some last for a very long time&#x27; others not so long...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty wobbly in this base and easily gets knocked over on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> and it typically lasts at least 1 full week before needing another charge.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second alert that my other one had, but it&#x27;s not a major deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to clean it and the tooth brush ir too small for adult to use.&lt;br /&gt;The carrying bag is too soft, not good for traveller to carry it.</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t realize is that it doesn&#x27;t give 30 second signals before the 2 minutes are up like some other models.</li>
            <li> &gt; The other double set we ordered is reviewed elsewhere - it&#x27;s just terrific.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, I would never go back to a traditional toothbrush, and my gums, in less than 12 months have stop receding and some have grown back!</li>
            <li> the only thing I don&#x27;t like is when the back of the brush head touches any of your other teeth</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that this toothbrush has a small head.  </li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for 2 years and at various times, it has produced a high-pitched very loud whine as I brush, and lately it occurred to me that this could possibly damage my hearing.  </li>
            <li> Also it seems to get less dirty than the old ones, which pretty much just accumulated dirt in all the cracks.</li>
            <li> Before I used Sonicare, I usually had many calcium deposits on the back bottom teeth, but after using Sonicare daily, my dental caretaker has less work to do removing the few and little calcium deposits that the brush can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> However the unit is a little loud.</li>
            <li> A little loud but leaves my teethe feeling</li>
            <li> my big complaint is that this model doesn&#x27;t let you know to change quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds like the older model did.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s super, super annoying.  </li>
            <li> having this new one sputter after such a short time reduces my confidence in Philips -- is there a quality control failure?</li>
            <li> I have the older version of this one for the past few years, so it was just time to retire the old one.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans in the spots that are hard to reach.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates so hard that it really bothers the arthritis in my hand.</li>
            <li> The first few days it took a little getting use to.  </li>
            <li> how much does it cost to have a little cavity fixed?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and using everyday twice a day (I use a regular toothbrush for after lunch)</li>
            <li> Once you use it, it&#x27;s hard to go back to a normal brush.</li>
            <li> This may sound silly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> It really helps when I brush teeth, at least I will remember to do it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is quite loud to the point that I can&#x27;t use it in the morning if my husband is trying to sleep later than me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It sounds like a hive of bees in your mouth, and it takes a few times to get used to the sensation of the sonic action.  </li>
            <li> This took a few times of using to get used to the &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; and tickle in your mouth, but wow you feel like you just had a dentist&#x27;s cleaning every time you brush.  </li>
            <li> My toothbrush has lasted for years with only changing out the head which is expected.</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re ever dropped, the seams open just enough, almost imperceptibly, to allow enough moisture into the case to kill them.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how long 2 minutes of brushing is until the timer sets off.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one like it that I have had for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sonicare for a long time</li>
            <li> and you know how long to brush because it has an automatic timer.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, battery lasts long</li>
            <li> It eventually just wouldn&#x27;t turn on one day but it served me well for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life is long too.</li>
            <li> Keeps charge for a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I expected something different I guess</li>
            <li> Holds long charge.</li>
            <li> he has wanted one for a long time..</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to my Dentist and bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this one has long term durability</li>
            <li> Cleaned off a bunch of long term stains within a couple days of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one for a long time.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> -can&#x27;t remember how long.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no scraping needed aty regular dental cleaning, no no cavitiys,</li>
            <li> Unless you have the money sitting around, there&#x27;s really no need to drop the extra cash on a fancier Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I only gave this item a two rating because it gets wet inside and leaks a colored substance on the charger stand.  </li>
            <li> The brush handle contains a rechargeable NiMh battery that lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Philips recommends replacing them every 2-3 months, but I&#x27;ve stretched mine out to a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> nearly no plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Lasts</li>
            <li> a long time&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Lasts</li>
            <li> a long time&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
            <li> the battery life is long.</li>
            <li> Holds a battery charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It is minor, but it is something I miss.</li>
            <li> Was a replacement for one I have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> if you travel abroad frequently, do NOT buy this model.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to try these?  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe I went this long without this product in my life.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I experimented to see how long I could go without accumulating plaque.</li>
            <li> I have not had it too long.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts so long.</li>
            <li> so you know how long to brush.</li>
            <li> The 30 second pause was designed to know that you spent that amount of time on each segment of your teeth cleaning...</li>
            <li> My fault I suppose for not reading the specs carefully, but I assumed all Sonicare toothbrushes had the 30 second timer.</li>
            <li> Once I read through the manual and taught myself the proper way to angle the brush on the teeth (and to keep my lips closed - lest the toothpaste spatter everywhere)</li>
            <li> Hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone this long without having a quality toothbrush like this in my life.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have spent the extra $$ on the model that beeps every 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as the Sonicare it replaced -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lose a star for that minor inconvenience in my eye still.</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> The head is small and reaches areas normal brushes miss.  </li>
            <li> Long time user of Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> My dentist insisted for a long time that I should use the Sonicare toothbrush, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> But I wish I had noticed that this model doesn&#x27;t have a timer like my old (but dead) one did.</li>
            <li> They hold up well with a reasonably long life.</li>
            <li> so it lasted as long as was suggested.  </li>
            <li> I never much paid attention to the 30 second beep and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a long time.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this Philip Sonic toothbrush for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Holds charge long.</li>
            <li> This one is rechargeable and keeps the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time; I&#x27;ve traveled with no charger, and it didn&#x27;t die at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss is that this one doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 sec so that you know to move to another quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The feature that stops the toothbrush 2 minutes after start gives you an alert as to how long it should take to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Wish I changed to it long time ago.</li>
            <li> I dont know how long</li>
            <li> I used to have one that tells you how long to brush each part of you mouth</li>
            <li> I hope this unit lasts as long if not longer than my OralB.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush lasts a long time after one charge.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my old Sonicare (2+yrs) with a dead battery.  </li>
            <li> I went to the dentist not to long before I bought this</li>
            <li> I think he spent two minutes cleaning only two areas with calcification (</li>
            <li> I had an old battery toothbrush for years and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I purchased the Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> We have used Sonicare electric tooth brushes for over 20 years This one replaced one that I have had for so long</li>
            <li> Works well and charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The timer is neat as it shows you just how long you should brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Hold charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> One thing missing from this version versus the old one we had: the two-minute timer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I have resisted this for so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for a long time and mine wore out</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Long battery charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this item a long time ago</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my first one, which I have used regularly for approximately 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the fresh way my mouth feels after using it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little bit of maintenance, but the whole thing takes less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> i down graded from the more expensive model that i had for 3 1/2 year....</li>
            <li> And even though I purchased it recently, it&#x27;s already starting to break down.  </li>
            <li> Biggest down side is that bristles only last for about 3 weeks, i brush twice a day, and in my opinion those refills are way too over priced.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t recommend about this toothbrush is the replacement head price (~$30 USD), but it seems that coupons float around often enough to bring that down some.  </li>
            <li> I love the sonicare and this less expensive version doesn&#x27;t seem inferior to a more expensive one I had a few years back.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a test-tube brush (very small, at a dollar store) a few months ago, and about once a week, I clean inside the head using that brush.</li>
            <li> Charging base is more compact, and there is less plastic housing around the brush stem, so that means less to clean up but also</li>
            <li> Just make sure you realize that they updated the shape, so you need the new charger to go with this base.</li>
            <li> Previously, I used the more expensive Philips Sonicare model for 5 years and when it broke I did not have over $165 to buy another one</li>
            <li> The price was the same as the 2013 Black Friday deals at all the big box stores.</li>
            <li> The previous one lasted several years but finally wouldn&#x27;t accept a charge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every time, generally 1x a day or less, but it still makes a difference.</li>
            <li> im talking about with the &#x27;beeping&#x27; than you&#x27;re seriously looking into this - and therefore would direct you to spend an extra 40$ because this toothbrush will last you a while.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never gotten this clean even after using my usual hard bristle brush.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am just now retiring my old one that is still working after five years of use.&lt;br /&gt;the battery in my old one was getting weak and not holding a charge very long..</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other similarly priced electric brushes (including those made by Sonicare) that don&#x27;t have the problematic dome style head.</li>
            <li> do wish the replacement heads were not so expensive, but I found that they are pretty expensive for any of the better electric toothbrushes, so this one is not out of line with those.  </li>
            <li> I wish, however, that it had the incremental buzz to signify each 30 second mark like other models have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go back to using a manual toothbrush while I consider other options.  </li>
            <li> Other toothbrushes have had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d find a different powered tooth brush where it&#x27;s either all one piece, or there&#x27;s no room for bacteria and other gunk to build up.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel like you’ve just been to the hygienist, and with regular brushing (I brush my teeth twice a day), the Sonicare has removed a lot of the stains on my teeth that had built up while I used the other brushes.</li>
            <li> In other words, brush one quadrant for 30 seconds, then switch to the next, etc.</li>
            <li> never realized how long 2 minutes can be!</li>
            <li> Unless you need a water flosser or some other &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; features, this compact unit does all you&#x27;ll likely need...at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I tried brushing with a regular toothbrush the other day</li>
            <li> It feels different from other brand toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> long battery life!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have pauses during the two minutes for when to switch sections in your mouth (usually, the vibrations would pause for a split second to tell you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth).  </li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time - like the compact feature!</li>
            <li> The other will only hold a charge for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I just use a regular tooth brush at other times.</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than I thought it&#x27;d be but no big deal.</li>
            <li> and now we have a backup toothbrush as well, because his other sonicare fits in the same charger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great value compared to any other big box store offer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always brushed too hard with a manual soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is a little on the small side, great for teeth brushing but tounge brushing is a little tedious because of the brush size.  </li>
            <li> I will not purchase another Philips Sonicare product for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Very, very strange if you ask me.</li>
            <li> major problem is that water and toothpaste just keep leaking into the space between the top part and bottom part through the stick and developed a bad odor there and is somewhat hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is virtually impossible to clean completely.</li>
            <li> I use this 2x a day and store the brush separately to air dry.</li>
            <li> As soon as im done using it, i disassemble and leave it separated to dry.  </li>
            <li> Then dry with a piece of tissue, and use the damp tissue to wipe out the inside of the handle.</li>
            <li> And once a week after the brush head is dry I irrigate the interior with hydrogen peroxide to keep that area from another bacterial build up.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself works great, but it gets disgusting before the blue like in the brush head wears out signifying it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li> matter how dry I think I get the brush and handle</li>
            <li> Some reviews mention how it&#x27;s difficult to keep clean, but I am not having that issue at all.  </li>
            <li> we kept it dry</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me to use it because I have dry mouth and resultant plaque build up.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel exceptionally clean after brushing, and my dental checkups are merely teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it can be quite loud when in use.</li>
            <li> To some extent this issue is universal to all brushes, but a gap where the brush head screws into the handle allows water to be trapped inside and get extra</li>
            <li> My last one finally died so I was without it for a few days until I replaced it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the most durable, least irritating electric toothbrush out there.</li>
            <li> so not new to this.  </li>
            <li> I miss that feature a little bit, but I have adjusted to it and have no regrets about buying this model.  </li>
            <li> The major cost is replacing the heads every few months.</li>
            <li> I felt the difference after a single brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, in the case of travelling overseas - when fully charged, you&#x27;ll get about 20 uses on a single charge...</li>
            <li> However, that would reduce the run time on a single charge which is 14 days.  </li>
            <li> There is just one single 2 minute interval.  </li>
            <li> A vast improvement on conventional manual brush.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel like they do after the dentist cleans them, every single day.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that isn&#x27;t a problem so much as a slight inconvenience is there is no indication how long you&#x27;ve been brushing</li>
            <li> Has replaceable batteries and uses the same brushes as the package I bought for the old Sonicare that broke because the on of switch membrane tore allowinfg water to enter causing a failure with the electronics.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted for a number of years, so I replaced it with this same model when the original finally failed.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for the 4 stars is that the replacement heads are super expensive compared to other brands/models.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean and rechargeable life is nearly 2 weeks if unplugging the base.  </li>
            <li> Stick to the old toothbrush, don&#x27;t be lazy like I was.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is loud and buzzy with a small head.</li>
            <li> Not as slick or refined as my Braun, and Chinese instead of German, but reviews seem to say the lifespan is as long.</li>
            <li> For those wondering (I see it in the questions a lot), it has a small head on it with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> That said, for them to remove a feature that has always been there is pretty poor customer relations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one was worse than the first.</li>
            <li> The battery of the first one was broken some time ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was happily surprised when I tried this device to find that it was not at all rough on my poor old gums, as I had feared (no bleeding, no soreness, no problems at all).</li>
            <li> The first one was broken after 3year usage.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush lasted 1 month before I was unable to get a full charge capacity (Purchased December 11, 2012, lost capacity January 9, 2013).  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to brush normally with them, just turn on the brush and slowly move it over and around your teeth.</li>
            <li> In fact, the vibration starts out on a very gentle setting tit slowly (12 steps) gets a little bit stronger each time you use it, so you have lots of time to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this brush especially if you find you have a tough time getting a decent clean or your mouth and breath still feel dirty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s loose or</li>
            <li> At times the head will vibrates itself loose.</li>
            <li> Buy replacement heads in a bundle if you can - seems like they loose their mojo after about 45 days.</li>
            <li> When I have to take a manual tooth brush when I travel it drives me crazy because I miss that extra clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has been recommending Sonicare for a while now, and I finally broke down and bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried thoroughly cleaning all the threads, screwing down as tightly as possible.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is when the brush bumps against my teeth when it is on.</li>
            <li> Must be leaking down the middle.</li>
            <li> My dentist has recommended I get a electric toothbrush forever because I was brushing too hard...wish I would have listened a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> did I know it would be so difficult to figure out a comparable Sonicare, especially since I had recently purchased several brush heads for the old one.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take my hygienists very long at all to do my cleaning!  </li>
            <li> I have used one for at least 20 years and it just died, so I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Take it apart once a week, and dry it out!</li>
            <li> less protection for the part that actually vibrates.</li>
            <li> my previous model was the lack of a 30 second timer...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i have seen it several places for less than i paid</li>
            <li> I bought similar one a few years ago (I can&#x27;t remember for how long).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual or even my previous Oral-B.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenistfffdfnoted less plaque using this instead of a traditional tooth brush and no cavities either!</li>
            <li> I take care of it, I dry it off after using it, but there&#x27;s no reason a product meant to get wet should have this problem.</li>
            <li> If I would have known of the short return time frame I would have sent it back sooner, now it&#x27;s past the return policy time frame.</li>
            <li> the price I paid, I could have gotten cheaper on Black Friday with an extra brush head too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it for a full brushing (unless you are cutting it short.)  </li>
            <li> and I can typically brush my teeth thoroughly enough not to need this feature,</li>
            <li> Also, if my teeth slightly touch the back of the brush head while cleaning, it clatters quite a bit on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Philips makes more expensive models, but they have a bunch of features that I am not sure I&#x27;d use.</li>
            <li> The entire space turned black and emitted a foul smell.</li>
            <li> In the last 4 months, black mold spots have started to develop underneath where the toothbrush head snaps on.</li>
            <li> (It was also half the price of what I paid previously for essentially the same model).</li>
            <li> Battery only worked 2-3 days on previous brush...</li>
            <li> I had an OralB previously that lasted for several years</li>
            <li> The first unit sent to me failed on the 2nd day of use......</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the brand name except the cost a lot less as is often the case for generic products.</li>
            <li> I previously used a generic store brand Crest Spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> not sure what the more expensive one&#x27;s do</li>
            <li> This is an upgrade to a previous model I had for years that finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> And I actually paid less for this than the Oral-</li>
            <li> Works well, however, I had a previous model that would buzz to alert you of when to switch to the next section of the mouth.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are expensive to replace and wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Brush seems a little soft and not sure it will last 3 months as advertised.</li>
            <li> Just careful to wipe down the stem before placing it back in the charger.</li>
            <li> I have owned this model for several months and while it functions well, I only recently looked closely at the base of the brush head after removing it to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long as the other.</li>
            <li> My other Sonicare lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also makes a big mess as paste sprays out everywhere.</li>
            <li> , did she mean she needed new brush heads?  </li>
            <li> It feels different, but not in a bad way, and I like the charging system they have, so it&#x27;s easy to tell when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> Feels like you just stepped out of the dentist every single time you brush!  </li>
            <li> used 3 times and this is very hard ,to much vibration</li>
            <li> The off brand replacement heads don&#x27;t fit as well and transfer some of the vibration into an annoying (and very loud) buzzing noise while in use.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for the same brush series it does not clean as well</li>
            <li> It is quite functional, however it is heavy and more difficult to manipulate than my previous electric brush</li>
            <li> I had quit using Sonic brand due to poor experiences after my first Sonic that lasted 5-years.</li>
            <li> I have had electric brushes in the past (other brands) and the noise doesn&#x27;t even compare with those, it&#x27;s way too loud.</li>
            <li> The provided cover fits too tightly, so my toothbrush stays wet (gross!).</li>
            <li> little to big for insight</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend a little to save you teeth for the future, unless you want dentures.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little pricey but after the two minute brush, I feel like I just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> where it gives a little signal at 30 second intervals to let you know to change quadrants on your teeth.</li>
            <li> The vibrations took a little bit of getting used to, but after awhile, I actually started to like it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little noisy and wish it had come with extra brush head.</li>
            <li> But my dentist recommended this toothbrush if I had a little extra to spend.  </li>
            <li> It works like the others, but lacks that little 30 second reminder I use to remind me to switch positions.</li>
            <li> , this is a simple, robust little device.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little peeved that they&#x27;ve stripped the 30 second interval timer from the cheaper models (they do throw in a travel bag...which I tossed...).</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get this rechargeable electric toothbrush to deal with plaque, possibly due to dry mouth.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be too hard for my sensitive gums</li>
            <li> Great but very disappointed that it does not have the 30 second interval timer like my previous one!</li>
            <li> The product partly fails to remove all residue on teeth, not with very good efficiency, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is a little bit big and heavy.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to brush properly with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go back to a regular toothbrush once you try these electric things.</li>
            <li> A product that is used to clean your mouth should be clean not prone to mold due to a horrible design flaw.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I inherited bad teeth and have had many cavities despite careful tooth care.</li>
            <li> crap, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> , only negative was that battery finally died after about 5 years</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the brush head broke after only 2 months of use.  </li>
            <li> There is no good way to get the mold out of this compartment, nor do I think that it should be a normal step to have to do as a consumer.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for at least 2-3 months and have had to charge it only once or twice since it&#x27;s initial charge (I use it once a day).</li>
            <li> However the brush itself has a cavity underneath which keeps an incredible amount of disgusting goo just after a few uses.</li>
            <li> At least as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> no, we do not own stock or work for the company.&lt;br /&gt;The old way of brushing</li>
            <li> teeth/gum feel a lot cleaner, not sure about long term health of gum as some dentists don&#x27;t recommend such products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s every thing I expected.</li>
            <li> This was everything I expected and paid for.</li>
            <li> This one has the benefit of the shape of a regular toothbrush (which I prefer) instead of the round one.  </li>
            <li> performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Because of this extra expense and in my opinion waste, I docked a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feature it is missing  and that is after a minute there used to  be a very brief pause</li>
            <li> It is not something you I often look at because I only see it every few months when I change the head.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> The brush head was so big &amp; felt harsh to me.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Does a thorough job cleaning with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received one of these as a Christmas present a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Only had this a few months and wishing I&#x27;d opted for another design.</li>
            <li> be careful which replacement  </li>
            <li> This model lacks the 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I am considering returning it so that I can try another brush to see if it also gets wet.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very simple to use, all u have to do is press the green</li>
            <li> I try not to get the handle wet.</li>
            <li> But it was not what I saw or expected.</li>
            <li> Trusted name in dental care and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using it for roughly a week.</li>
            <li> But watch out, keep your mouth quasi closed while using otherwise the toothpaste shoots out everywhere.  </li>
            <li> works well, but my daughter says it is too powerful and it is uncomfortable on her gums.</li>
            <li> and she loves it, she&#x27;s been using it for almost a year now and regrets not making the switch to a premium electric toothbrush sooner.</li>
            <li> But if you like it harder, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> like it, just not very convenient to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush sends out a few beeps when the power is low which was at 12 days.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money for a durable electric toothbrush that has an expensive look.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Because of the gap between the toothbrush head and the handle, bacteria regularly gets trapped here.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It is everything that she wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Beyond what i expected</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t heed the warnings posted by others - I neglected to empty</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Everything works as expected.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have 30 sec timer to tell you when to switch to another quadrant in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It was shipped on time and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Its not what I expected</li>
            <li> The additional brushes are a bit expensive, but really worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried one with the extra bells and whistles, so maybe I&#x27;m missing something.  </li>
            <li> No real reason to replace it --</li>
            <li> I can brush for only a few seconds</li>
            <li> Works just like expected.  </li>
            <li> Just as I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> item Must be cleaned and dried daily</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but gets wet &amp; moldy under the head.</li>
            <li> Brush has a timer and would only run a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This is money well spent.</li>
            <li> When I bought it I got the cheaper one and did not realize it does not have the 30 sec.</li>
            <li> only have a few complaints: I wish there was a compact design.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I do miss the 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only a few days, having just received it, but my teeth look whiter and it is even reaching plaque in places</li>
            <li> and it had a lot of trouble staying charged and finally broke after just a year of use.</li>
            <li> I am not as vigilent as I would like, but this compensates for the forgetful brusher.  </li>
            <li> die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not expected from Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> Except for the 30 second warning for each quadrant of the month is missing</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to the vibrations since I had been using a manual toothbrush prior to this.</li>
            <li> They were always kinda rough like</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works just like I expected.</li>
            <li> This thing is really heavy to hold compared to my prior Oral B brush.  </li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> simple matter of a few lines of code in the microcontroller.</li>
            <li> This means the teeth and gums get a stronger brushing action, but it can be irritating, especially on the inside gums.</li>
            <li> The box says that it can hold a charge for two weeks without needing to be back on the base, but I&#x27;m not so sure I believe that when it takes almost an hour to restore a charge when I used it for 3 minutes....</li>
            <li> The travel case fits nicely and the base</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I figured electric toothbrushes were the same as they always were, up and down up and down.  </li>
            <li> You get the same experience for less!</li>
            <li> Also, the this toothbrush comes with the little bag for traveling instead of a hard case like my older model does.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little bulkier than other models, but I don&#x27;t find this a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have not used the toothbrush, I am not sure it is new, and it did not sound like it was working correct, but</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a plain toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> The bristle is stiff and smaller, the cleaning cycle which beeps 4 times does not work.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested this model while using plain Colgate Total toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fail me, the vibration is just right.</li>
            <li> Decent (and cheap) electric toothbrush ruined by awful, potentially harmful brush head design.</li>
            <li> I had my previous Sonicare for a long time</li>
            <li> Tried it in other outlets thinking maybe it was a dead outlet but was definitely the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get used to the feel due to the vibrations per second.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long as my previous 2 models.  </li>
            <li> I was careful in wiping it down the first week, but I got a little lax after that and quickly had gunk buildup around the brush head and on the charging base.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and the rechargeable base is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It should also come with an option to have a round head instead of the oval shape it comes in which makes it really difficult to clean the inside of your teeth.</li>
            <li> The instructions with the Sonicare say to do this every other week or so, but, really, it&#x27;s not going to cramp your style to do it after each use and an ounce of prevention is a pound of cure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lite,easy to use,holds charge when traveling,cleans teeth with little effort,relatively inexpensive,can replace brush as required,compact with small footprint,indicates when charging,cord adjusts to required length,auto shutoff when cleaning complete</li>
            <li> Be careful however on not hitting your other teeth with it.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Because the insides allows for water to fill it and is inconvenient to clean, mold began to grow.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a bit awkward at first using it</li>
            <li> but I like how it comes with a charging base and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Every few days pop the plastic sleeve to wipe down, although I have never found that to be necessary.  </li>
            <li> At the beginning I even thought that it was broken, but after a quick search for reviews I noticed that it&#x27;s a fairly common complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands.</li>
            <li> tooth brush , other brand</li>
            <li> I charged it for a day, and did not use if for over a month due to vacation at work.</li>
            <li> My other Sonicare had interval pauses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got the other version that has just a brush as a refill.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B was pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product but Sonicare</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I guess at the time I need to move to the other areas when I brush.</li>
            <li> the other one did so</li>
            <li> two other brand electric toothbrushes die.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> i have had sevral other sonicare tooth brushes and my one i had before this one i lost</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes and until I found this deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent two to three times the money on!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any reminder beeps or any other bells and whistles</li>
            <li> Dentist didn&#x27;t give me a sharp talking to this time .</li>
            <li> I will never switch to any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews, and decided that since I&#x27;m not used to the 30-second alarm that some of the reviewers were quite fond of, I wouldn&#x27;t miss it.  </li>
            <li> Gives you that slick feeling like you actually got a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> (wouldn&#x27;t work with other models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> The Advance and other models give the user a signal every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> The Advance and other models give the user a signal every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It stops abruptly.</li>
            <li> I have tried those other spinbrush pros and they just don&#x27;t stand up to the quality of this one.  </li>
            <li> But just like other Sonicare models it does a gangbuster job of cleaning and polishing your teeth and massaging gums.</li>
            <li> Does the trick and costs 1/3 of the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe other Sonicare models come with this feature, but I wish mine did.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and bring it to work in the grey pouch.  </li>
            <li> but I never used those other speeds.  </li>
            <li> As for cleaning your teeth, it cleans your teeth extremely well without using excessive force like traditional tooth brushes do.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the design allows water infiltration into the cavity between the brush head and the motor,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into Oral B and other toothbrushes instead.</li>
            <li> all the other versions of sonicare&lt;br /&gt;work</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other electric toothbrush aside from the crest spinbrush, but I do not care for the vibrating sensation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other models are quieter</li>
            <li> It finally could not hold a charge past a day.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> All SonicCare brushes get my teeth noticeably cleaner than any other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The automatic timer makes you actually brush for 2 minutes, so no more half-a.. teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> The other one lasted about 2 years</li>
            <li> Just small enough to get in all the areas where bacteria can get in.  </li>
            <li> but you can purchase other sizes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other users.</li>
            <li> I bought 12 total this past Christmas for family members and friends.</li>
            <li> I do this every time I brush my teeth and the brush and timer are always spot on of each other.</li>
            <li> Other than that, my teeth have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> It was difficult when I first got it as I continued to scrub and not let the brush do the work.  </li>
            <li> I had the other one 13 years.  </li>
            <li> It was money well spent!</li>
            <li> I have been using a battery operated toothbrush for years and found it an extreme improvement over a manual tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the issues, and if you have one, don&#x27;t be shy to call sonicare customer service.</li>
            <li> Other than  </li>
            <li> ago for myself after using other brands.  </li>
            <li> , i just charge it every other week to be save.  </li>
            <li> It was weird the first couple days using it</li>
            <li> I have no experience with any other brushes like this, but I am sold on this one for it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I have not used other brands</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> She threw all her other toothbrushes away</li>
            <li> So when I started experiencing problems with my other one...</li>
            <li> I just got the thumbs up from my dentist the other day.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is the brush is a bit small</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve owned for many years, so I already knew I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I truly did not care for this product, it could just be me due the fact that I have never used one.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can return to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before picking this product and was warned about the unit not staying charged</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fancy as other models I looked at</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m an uninformed consumer, but I did not see this other model when I was looking and felt no need to be concerned.  </li>
            <li> (that is what happened to my other one).  </li>
            <li> I refuse to go to the dentist, for no reason other than I&#x27;m stubborn</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as aggressive as other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> This might not be like the other toothbrushes with all the fancy lights and stuff, but this toothbrush does the job and some.</li>
            <li> The difference using a Sonicare after using other toothbrushes is like night and day. .</li>
            <li> It is a compact version of the regular size I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other electric toothbrush requires screwing and unscrewing but this one can be charged even after you used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent this year!</li>
            <li> We have been using the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for over 10 years now and wouldn&#x27;t use any other brush again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> bought this one for my husband since other one died after 3+ years of having.</li>
            <li> My other wasn&#x27;t working anymore and needed to replace.</li>
            <li> For the cost of box of white strips you can get a toothbrush that will whiten your teeth everyday!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> However, a little preventative maintenance once and a while keeping it dry would stop this.</li>
            <li> It works well to clean teeth, but it gets pretty disgusting on the inside.</li>
            <li> One; the handle is a little too large and hard to grip for my small hands.</li>
            <li> When I go to the dentist for cleaning, the scraping for plaque removal is very minimal.</li>
            <li> BUT once your past that phase, the full power jack hammer speed is uncomfortable &amp; concerns me that it will losen caps and bridge work from the power of the brushing.</li>
            <li> Sonicare I previously owned pulsed every 30 sec.</li>
            <li> note about the design: I advise simply unscrewing the brush-head after every few uses and cleaning it with peroxide or just plain H2O.  </li>
            <li> Phillips should provide this dual voltage base as the standard charger or at least make it readily available through the same merchants that sell their toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in addition, it sits very precariously in the small base and if not just right, does not charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never right</li>
            <li> Switched to this from a conventional toothbrush, my youngest has not had a cavity since.</li>
            <li> Makes it a little harder to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I received a dirty Amazon box with all the shipping labels on it; which would be standard and normal in any other case.</li>
            <li> Check the base cavity each time you change out a brush and clean if necessary.</li>
            <li> It is a fraction of the cost of other sonic brushes, and after using some of them previously I would buy this one again.</li>
            <li> HARD CASE - see above.</li>
            <li> HARD CASE - see above.</li>
            <li> Remember not to push too hard, it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product at first</li>
            <li> It has no bells and whistles, like the 2 minute timer in 30 second increments that I had been used to, but at this price, it&#x27;s hard to complain.</li>
            <li> my dad has essential tremmor and has a hard time brushing his teeth, with this it is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the case is a little small even for toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the only thing i didnt like is it doesnt turn off if you push to hard liket</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to keep your mouth/lips closed on the brush &amp;#34;stem&amp;#34; and thus make less of a mess while moving the brush around.</li>
            <li> I tended to brush too hard with the ordinary toothbrush, but when I use the Sonicare it leaves my teeth feeling like I just got a professional cleaning at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Impossible to keep clean</li>
            <li> But its not worth taking off a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that I was technically past warranty as well (by a few months), but they didn&#x27;t make a big deal about it.  </li>
            <li> With this feature there is no more guessing how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter much, but it&#x27;s weird now not to have it.</li>
            <li> On line registration gets the warranty extended to 2.5 years, so I figure it will last at least three years.</li>
            <li> Big sonicare fan for a long time, bought this one in late april and two months later one of the metal &amp;#34;Blades&amp;#34; in the head has broken.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about paying so much money for a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Dies not have quad timer - not worth buying</li>
            <li> Solid recommendation for anyone with delicate gum lines.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second mini timer anymore.  </li>
            <li> only negative is the price of the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I wish it stayed lit instead of blinking, but that is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is Philips should fix this issue or supply the sonic seals.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the two minute timer where it auto shuts off cant be turned off.</li>
            <li> The Brush is also very expensive, it&#x27;s same price as a whole set when they&#x27;re onsale.</li>
            <li> When I used it the first time I hated it; it felt too much like a trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> This is at least my third Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> In our opinion, fancier models are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> After careful research and heavy deliberation I settled on this brush.  </li>
            <li> When it works love it, but this intermittent working is annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate that feature and am glad it&#x27;s not part of</li>
            <li> I also wish the base would accommodate one more unit (not charging, just hold it).</li>
            <li> In addition to the noise, the base/ handle is so wide, it&#x27;s really not comfortable for a woman&#x27;s hands to get around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to clean, change heads, and the battery life is not exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Just pick up the toothbrush, use it, then put it down and it will charge.</li>
            <li> na take down everything on its way.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> All the toothpaste runs down and gets into all the creases.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the yuck factor yet in the head, but I would lay it down after use, and I&#x27;ll bet that solves that.</li>
            <li> so I broke down and ordered this newer model.</li>
            <li> Also has problems charging sometimes even after you reset it (hold down power button while in the charging station for about three seconds to reset).</li>
            <li> i wish there was a setting to turn down this machine</li>
            <li> Consequently, fluids can leak out slowly down the handle, making it slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I unscrew the brush head from the handle and wipe it down after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> word of warning though, the rubber gasket between the brush and the mount to the battery handle can let water or other fluids get down in the little reservoir of the handle.  </li>
            <li> and I would never buy any other toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as other brands I&#x27;ve had and don&#x27;t like the way you change toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out our other was until I got this one!</li>
            <li> all other electric toothbrushes ive used!</li>
            <li> Any other way of brushing is barbaric!</li>
            <li> who would ever read a 4 star review among 100 other ones?!</li>
            <li> Seal between brush top and base is not water tight which leads to the rest of my review :  </li>
            <li> It was pretty disgusting when I finally unscrewed the old head for its replacement.</li>
            <li> but my other electric toothbrush died so I was stuck using a non-electric for a few months.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t want an expensive toothbrush but was due up for a new electric one.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought a new one was because the replacement brush heads were getting to be hard to find and expensive.  </li>
            <li> My dental cleanings will be taking half the time</li>
            <li> and I expect less gum disease, and cavities with the use of it.  </li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted for years, so</li>
            <li> I was told there was a issue with a defective handle twice, so three defective handles in less than a year...</li>
            <li> however it works just as well as top-of-the-line models from Philips sonicare that I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> Previous tooth brush was oral care.  </li>
            <li> Price was half the cost of the ones at Walmart</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it, my teeth feel cleaner than they did with my previous toothbrush, which was the entry-level Oral-B Braun.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I went to replace the head after a couple months of usage and saw BLACK MOLD inside.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to previous toothbrushes</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had three previous versions of this toothbrush that all beeped every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well as my previous one.  </li>
            <li> Cannot charge after less than 3 months...</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare to replace the previous that I had used for over two years.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Sonicare previously and it lasted for 10 years before the battery weakened substantially.  </li>
            <li> was certainly not lucky.</li>
            <li> and so I decided to try this somewhat simpler, somewhat less pricey model and bought it here on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare had a &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My wife had put this on her Christmas list and after reading the previous reviews I could not pass it up.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my previous one that I had for years.  </li>
            <li> The Advance body is slightly slimmer and shorter but I&#x27;m comparing today&#x27;s Essence with the Advance of over 4 years ago</li>
            <li> The Advance body is slightly slimmer and shorter but I&#x27;m comparing today&#x27;s Essence with the Advance of over 4 years ago</li>
            <li> I had a previous incarnation that lasted me about eight years.</li>
            <li> Compared with previous electric toothbrushes I have used, the Philips Sonicare HX5610 packs a punch.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare had a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; built in every 30 seconds to notify me when to change the area of tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> My kids are complaining about the odd sensation</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Sonicare for approx.</li>
            <li> My previous sonic toothbrush (from another manufacturer) had 30-second notifications while brushing.</li>
            <li> This replaces a previous sonicare that wore out, This one shuts off after the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> After using the Philips Sonicare less than a week the plaque was gone.</li>
            <li> The brush head is a tad longer, and narrower than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people rate this product less than five stars.  </li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare tooth brush previously</li>
            <li> had one previously and like it alot.</li>
            <li> Lasted me less than a year.</li>
            <li> I had an HX5810 that died after about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> It makes brushing your teeth so much less of a hassle</li>
            <li> This cleans my teeth as well as the Philips Sonicare FlexCare that I have had in previous years,  Since I had to keep replacing the Philips Sonicare FlexCare  because of its faulty design I decided to give this a try since it was a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> but I do miss the slight interruption every 30 seconds to let me know when to switch sides.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my son for his birthday, the price was about half of what they retail and the store when it came</li>
            <li> If anything, it feels like a slight massage on the gums.</li>
            <li> also cost less as a plane-jane model, but still doing the work of the $$ ones.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement from my previous Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning process takes less than a min</li>
            <li> As it was starting to fail, I began web &amp; physical price shopping.</li>
            <li> Cooked the charger while in Europe on the previous one.</li>
            <li> Folks complaining about it getting gummed up with excess toothpaste, should consider using less of it.  </li>
            <li> My previous brush had this feature, so I wish I had known this before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Cost is half what you would pay at a store.</li>
            <li> It was also a LOT less expensive than my last one by the same company.  </li>
            <li> The cost of this one was less than buying the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my previous Sonicare rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I paid slightly less for each iteration but</li>
            <li> if the models that lets yoy know your brushing time after 30 seconds my previous brush had that feature</li>
            <li> I prefer my previous Sonicare toothbrush that signaled every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Search for Philips and black mold and</li>
            <li> During and after you brush your teeth water, and who knows what else, gets inside the head because it is not adequately sealed against moisture.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive for a toothbrush that&#x27;ll only last 2 months.</li>
            <li> Black mold.  </li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d read reviews before purchasing as I see this problem mentioned over and over by those who have previously purchased.</li>
            <li> but I did have a previous hand-me-down.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it, so I decided to look at Amazon to find it for less.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous model that sucked batteries and gave up on it.</li>
            <li> cleaner and less time consuming</li>
            <li> My only experience is a Sonicare, so this may be an unfair review if all brands work the same and need to be cleaned after each use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go to dentist to see if there is less plaque.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the replaceable heads were not more expensive than the whole unit, like at the stores!</li>
            <li> I have used Philips Sonicare for 4 years, just replace brush head every half year (it was recommended to replace every 3 months).  </li>
            <li> but when I went to change the toothbrush head there was what appeared to be black mold in the brush.</li>
            <li> My dentist who was a friend had previously bought me a $300 sonicare</li>
            <li> The brush head vibrates faster than previously used electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Battery stopped holding a charge in less than 6 months..</li>
            <li> Using a Sonicare compared to all previous electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried are like you&#x27;re now driving a Ferrari after driving an Ford Pinto before.</li>
            <li> However, we&#x27;ve had this for less than a month and already it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> We then have to charge it all day, and at night when we go to brush our teeth, it is still blinking in the charger, whereas it previously would charge in less than 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has noticed much less plaque over the years since I started using Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bought the identical, previous version, about 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li> The handle of this model is enough bigger around that it is difficult for me to hold.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use the generic brush heads, they&#x27;re terrible.</li>
            <li> This unit was purchased after my previous unit&#x27;s batteries would no longer hold a charge, after 8 years of use.</li>
            <li> Plus they have a rebate typically.</li>
            <li> This replaces a previous model I had.</li>
            <li> This is a typical Sonicare tooth brush, it&#x27;s built and functions well, and will for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It works as well as the e-750 at one half the cost.</li>
            <li> Purchased this when my previous one died.</li>
            <li> The battery in this one lasted less than two months.</li>
            <li> I have experience with this product with a previous purchase</li>
            <li> With a typical non-motorized toothbrush I&#x27;m fond of wandering about when I brush.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an older battery-powered Sonicare with this because after a point, the batteries became somewhat difficult to maintain contact.  </li>
            <li> These are meant to remain on the base, but for some reason I see it left in the bathroom &#x27;off&#x27; the base and apparently the battery life is really good.  </li>
            <li> The batteries go bad after five or six years but that&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The brush is too small, it doesn&#x27;t have the 15 sec.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> (Probably is not true but I feel like it)</li>
            <li> The last Sonicare I used (about six years ago) could never keep a charge and was not a good brush.</li>
            <li> the brush-head cover; keeps it safe from those nasty toilet particles floating in the air.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> After a few days, the puffiness died down.</li>
            <li> I had to weigh it down with a heavy planter as it will not stay in place if it gets a bit</li>
            <li> As others have noted, the seal isn&#x27;t tight.</li>
            <li> This design requires you to screw the brush head onto the handle, but it is not water tight.</li>
            <li> ; mechanism that replaces the toothbrush has a chamber that is not water tight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed.34;learning curve&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re a new user the sensation might be unbearable.</li>
            <li> , It also feels a little &amp;#34;looser,&amp;#34; not as tight by way of how the parts are holding together.</li>
            <li> In the interim, I felt my teeth were never really clean with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Base is sturdy,  Brush unscrews and comes apart for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush heads are disposable and really expensive (about $12 each, cheaper if you buy them in volume), but thankfully last a long time.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, you may notice that the surface of the charger develops a black crust on it.  </li>
            <li> I could not use it since it did not fit my pack and half of brushes that I purchased some time ago.  </li>
            <li> The timer can get annoying if you usually brush your teeth for more than 2 minutes, but I can see why they implemented it.</li>
            <li> My newer Sonicare started to buzz and not clean well.</li>
            <li> It happened within weeks, so there&#x27;s no way the designers missed that little problem.  </li>
            <li> but this little guy does the job just as well.</li>
            <li> said it took a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We have had them a little over 6 months</li>
            <li> little travel bag with this</li>
            <li> A little bit of maintenance to keep the gunk issue at bay</li>
            <li> A little bit of maintenance to keep the gunk issue at bay</li>
            <li> I have used other electric toothbruses in the past, but not of htis sonic variety.  </li>
            <li> Turning it off takes a little dexterity while holding the toothbrush still in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Still, I find myself wincing a little when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey though</li>
            <li> They can be a little pricy in the stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy</li>
            <li> There was a little friction in my mouth in the beginning, but that has gone away.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of time to get used to, but</li>
            <li> With a little practice, and in fact NOT putting your head in the sink, we can brush the two minutes without dribbling..</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth, but I was displeased with their head-replacement incompatibilities that were not clearly marketed despite being from the same brand, meaning I wasted money buying the wrong heads.</li>
            <li> I have owned this toothbrush for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> helps the little peeps along</li>
            <li> My dentist always comments how little plaque I have at my 6 month check-</li>
            <li> have to give this 5 stars because I had a problem with breath being not s fresh and bought every mouthwash I could find, this worked after one day!  </li>
            <li> would prefer it to be a little slimer and easier to hold.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> So I got online and ordered little unit.</li>
            <li> It will fall out if you give it a little bump.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get accustomed to the sonic aspect.  </li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> Would prefer that it have a little room, even for charger.</li>
            <li> A little thing,</li>
            <li> I got a little over-zealous and now my gums are a little swollen, so I can tell it will take a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other one started running out of a charge after small amounts of time (without using the charger, like when on vacation), which was my clue that it was &amp;#34;going&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey</li>
            <li> Hurts my teeth a little.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little quieter.</li>
            <li> This one was actually less expensive than the old one.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to tell from the description and the photos if this was the same brush I was trying to replace or the model my wife had which is the one I was seeking.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the cord for the charger is very stiff.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to keep this model clean - nasty stuff builds up quickly inside tiny difficult-to-reach crevices.</li>
            <li> It gets gross inside the toothbrush even tough</li>
            <li> Sonicare has not let me down for years!</li>
            <li> Takes longer to reach me as it has to be brought down to Mexico!</li>
            <li> I have tried mine the other day, and it vibrates so much making it impossible to use .&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the stock brush is quite hard, tends to irritate my some parts of my gumline.</li>
            <li> Wife has tried a couple of other, less expensive, brands but keeps stealing the power unit out of my bathroom (just wish she&#x27;d bring it back when she&#x27;s through with it)</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time reaching my back teeth, but the small head on the Sonicare fits</li>
            <li> cleaning power wasn&#x27;t much different from a common toothbrush, at least I couldn&#x27;t tell, my teeth are not whiter...</li>
            <li> it just stops and you&#x27;re left with this awkward feeling of having a cotton ball of a toothbrush in your mouth while you struggle to turn in back on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for use at work to replace a cheap and nasty battery-powered toothbrush I bought earlier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a few days.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to point out something  people seem to be missing with regards to the mold build-up Instructions</li>
            <li> My gums have never been healthier since I started using Sonicare a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This could just be because I brush my teeth in a &#x27;messy&#x27; way</li>
            <li> I was a heavy soda drinker &amp;</li>
            <li> It dead this month.</li>
            <li> I replaced the brush head a few weeks ago, but still have the problem.  </li>
            <li> I have one with a round head for travel</li>
            <li> I bought the toothbrush on June 10th and let me tell you I did not use everyday and today is August 7th</li>
            <li> We have succeeded in cleaning the brush by soaking in bleach and cleaning with a q-tip, but this has to be done every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> charge it once a few weeks..</li>
            <li> and it never gave me this much trouble.</li>
            <li> It is not available in retail stores.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is narrow, it should be wider as it hits my teeth while brushing</li>
            <li> After a few days, it starts to smell.  </li>
            <li> , these are the features that the Essence is missing when compared with the Advance which may or may not matter, depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> , these are the features that the Essence is missing when compared with the Advance which may or may not matter, depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> She said she likes it and is using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because I had just bought a packet of toothbrushes for my old sonicare which was quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few days.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this item for anyone looking at an electric toothbrush or those with poor gum quality like I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, not too heavy and the stand isn&#x27;t bulky at all.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you buy one learn the return policy before you waste for money.</li>
            <li> 2 Brush head (will grow mold if not taken off and dried correctly each time</li>
            <li> My college son wanted an electric toothbrush after seeing a few friends have them.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up to replace a sonicare with a dead battery....</li>
            <li> once you use it a few times.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use, i noticed the difference in the brightness of my teeth and combating tartar and plaque build up.  </li>
            <li> These hold a charge for a few a week or 2.</li>
            <li> I thought my last one was broken.</li>
            <li> It works as well as the newer ones - just a few missing bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Please take my advice and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> stopped working a fter a few months</li>
            <li> Sonicare also tightens up my gums so they cling closer to my teeth, and whenever I have a sore spot on my teeth or gums, I apply the Sonicare for a few minutes twice a day, and the problems clears up.  </li>
            <li> Completely dead.</li>
            <li> Pieces of thin plastic were mixed in with my toothpaste .  </li>
            <li> ; Sonicare and the Essence is that the 2 minute brushing cycle isn&#x27;t broken into 30 second audible increments.</li>
            <li> It seems a waste before the motor has worn out</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my sonicare that I bought at Costco a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Depending on the battery, it could be a few years before this happens</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels like i just got a cleaning from the dentist everyday.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it, and uses it twice everyday.</li>
            <li> They take a few days to get used to.  </li>
            <li> will provide input in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on recommendation from my dentist because I am increasingly disabled in hand and arm control.  </li>
            <li> I have toothache few months ago.</li>
            <li> But, you dont even notice the sensation after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I have a few models of these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> They are of such poor quality</li>
            <li> Having used the Sonicare Essence 5600 for a few weeks it has met my expectations and the recommendations of my hygienist....</li>
            <li> The brush and the speed make brushing too harsh.</li>
            <li> , the toothbrush now just lasts a few days and then needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> Came to my home within a few days</li>
            <li> way too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and my mouth feels like I just walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office, after a thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The nylon brush head had strings of uneven lengths sticking out in a few places.  </li>
            <li> But, it is heavy somehow.</li>
            <li> I have moderate gum recession, and this toothbrush, unlike the Oral B, makes it worse</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a few tips don&#x27;t use baking soda for some reason it will stop working over time</li>
            <li> : too harsh for teeth, I got sensitivity teeth after 2 use.</li>
            <li> To combat this I used a lighter touch; and over a few days, it was easier to accept/use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few battery ones and what not</li>
            <li> use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It can be a pain when you&#x27;ve just put toothpaste on the brush and realize the batteries are dead.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it since I had trouble with my gums.</li>
            <li> I no longer have trouble since using this product.  </li>
            <li> This Sonicare brush is missing the timer feature - the one after every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been missing until you try a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a Sonicare E-Series a few years ago and suggested she get one herself.</li>
            <li> The head will need to be replaced every so often depending on use (I have used mine for a few months at least.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was missing the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> but since I can&#x27;t do that it&#x27;s going to get 4 as 3 is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> also makes a recharging base that is 110v AC only, one that is sold in Europe that is 220v AC only, and one that is 110/220v AC which can be used anywhere in the world with only a plug adapter.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a few months and I like it.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to the feel of this toothbrush</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> A Sonicare toothbrush gives you a dentist level of cleaning everyday.</li>
            <li> recommend taking off the head and cleaning inside occasionally, not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> A few times I opened it and it was black and mildewy inside!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to clean out and it stinks.</li>
            <li> charging base is small and easy to store out of the way</li>
            <li> Really no better than my crest spinbrush costing 70% less</li>
            <li> less time in the dentist&#x27;s chair!  </li>
            <li> It doesnt really lay flat, and can cause the charger base and toothbrush to fall over.</li>
            <li> The other brand I had a plastic cover that was hard to put on.</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t take care to clean it regularly it get really nasty on the inside.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that complained of this too.</li>
            <li> There is just something wrong with the time cycle electronics and to me it is not worth the trouble sending it back.  </li>
            <li> THE TOOTHBRUSH CAME IN A PLAIN BOX WITH NO OPERATING OR WARRANTY INFORMATION.</li>
            <li> There was no manual with the toothbrush, it didn&#x27;t come in Phillips box, rather a plain cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but plain unit which is what I purchased.</li>
            <li> And is you are too stupid to clean it</li>
            <li> All the power and clean teeth without the stupid bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> The quality seemed worse than similar brushes I bought in the past at Sam&#x27;s Club or Walmart</li>
            <li> I doubt anyone who isn&#x27;t an obsessive germ freak is going to unscrew and clean the head and base after every usage.</li>
            <li> Wow, at first it is a shocking feeling.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is a little too small for my liking.</li>
            <li> The new base is a lot smaller and doesn&#x27;t hold the brush as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sensation as the brush touches your gums is a little different from my old toothbrush - almost tickly - almost annoying, but wears off after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I replaced mine (after about 5 years) with the Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush which I prefer because it&#x27;s much smaller to hold, and travel with (holds about a 2 week charge), and brush replacements less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Works like the last one and was $25 less expensive</li>
            <li> perceive it to be somewhat studier and less likely to fail.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I should switch to electric because I scrub my teeth so hard my gums were wearing down.  </li>
            <li> but if you have gotten used to it, not having it sucks, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning it.  </li>
            <li> I usually travel for work and sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to pack it up and just use my manual toothbrush for those few days,</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and have trouble getting to my molars.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my gums are receding and it made my back teeth so sensitive that I am unable to use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> In the past few years I had my share of dental work done including an implant and a root canal.  </li>
            <li> the black mold is present, it is almost impossible to get rid of it because of the tiny crevices and hard to get to edges inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The zippered travel case is also an improvement over the hard carrying case that came with my previous brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the annoying noise and mess, but I guess I&#x27;ll find out.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I get this electric toothbrush -- and I was reluctant at first because of a bad past experience with a water-pik</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the nylon head is poor quality.  </li>
            <li> use it at least 3x a day, and resulting in every dental cleaning taking less then 15 minutes, no tarter buildup.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Mold (thick black mold) will grow within the head.</li>
            <li> I had to buy the 110/220v charger base directly from Phillips for an extra $45 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the charger itself is so expensive that for an extra few dollars, you can purchase the entire set.</li>
            <li> BIG disappointment as I used the other one for years.</li>
            <li> The manual seems a little confusing to me.</li>
            <li> Plaque has gone packing and flossing finds very little between my teeth after I finish brushing.</li>
            <li> Why would you use any other type of tooth brush, this thing rocks!!!</li>
            <li> Please be careful of your gums!!!!</li>
            <li> Buy other electric toothbrush then save money!!!</li>
            <li> After this new one began to fail I realized the outlet it was plugged into was intermittently working!</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the charger is only 110 V.  </li>
            <li> Respectfully,  not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> I have used the battery powered version of this brush over the past year or two but kept having to replace the batteries.  </li>
            <li> Ill probably buy some bigger separate ones though</li>
            <li> I order this brush as a replacement, but was disappointed to find that it does not have the 30 second timer alerting you to shift to a different quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the replacement brushes can be a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> then about a month later starts working again randomly.  </li>
            <li> It even comes with a small carrying bag.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> With the coupons provided by Phillips,I purchased small brushes for mine.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and all buyers of this Sonicare should be made aware.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I thought I was ordering a brush that gave a signal when to move to a different quarter of my teeth--like the last one I had.</li>
            <li> This is obviously a second, or perhaps a fake from the folks in China.  </li>
            <li> Product works well enough except that it has a flawed design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to do that or what</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Sonicare for the past 3 or 4 years after having it recommended to us by our son.  </li>
            <li> For $49 you get the SAME cleaning power as the expensive Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Really not much more to say</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for the past 10 plus years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why rust forms between the charger and the brush....everyday.</li>
            <li> You may think that once you get past umpteen thousand strokes per minute, you might not notice, but you do.  </li>
            <li> this thing removes plaque, it is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> A third chat attempt tonight ended with, &amp;#34;I am so sorry</li>
            <li> but the system is under maintance [sic] and I am not able to locate the desired information.</li>
            <li> the past two years</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a small tooth brush she could take with her on trips.</li>
            <li> This has happened with the past 2 sonicares I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare that failed in about a year&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds lazy</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 sec timer my old sonicare had.  </li>
            <li> I even take it camping as I have gotten lazy about moving my brush.</li>
            <li> I was outta there sooner than usual.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I hadn&#x27;t had enough time with the brush to realize that it traps dirt in all of the crevices and spirals that interlock the brush head to the handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B in the past and I sorely regret changing brands.</li>
            <li> timer, the handle is too small, and no matter how I wipe it off after brushing, it has toothpaste on the charger after sitting a while.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m 60 and have no dental insurance, I consider this a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I used to have an expensive Sonicare brush and wanted something cheaper with the same brushing power.</li>
            <li> I think this was flawed, but I didn&#x27;t send it back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> It did make my teeth feel cleaner although I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Essentially, this toothbrush is a Loss Leader to get you into buying the REMARKABLY EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say</li>
            <li> The head itself is a small profile and can reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> not sure why they changed.</li>
            <li> It is past the timeframe to return it.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the replacement heads can be expensive.</li>
            <li> The travel case is small and packs well when traveling.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with the past brushes was the rubber protection cover over on and off button.</li>
            <li> if I can only get 1 minute of brushing it renders the purchase useless.  </li>
            <li> No more cavities, fresher breath, no more bleeding,</li>
            <li> I was not sure that he would like using it because of the movement, but this has not been a problem.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it has a small profile and</li>
            <li> , not sure this problem would not have occurred.</li>
            <li> in crevices too small to reach, even with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have had two others, and both have stopped moving the brush after a few months!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to get into the back corners of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was scared and skeptical at the same time about using an electric brush.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week, I only wondered how sorry</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the replacement brushes are expensive.  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference between this and the Philips Sonicare Essence (usually sells for about $70 on Amazon)</li>
            <li> This unit does not have that which may seem like a small thing.  </li>
            <li> I usually put the charger away for a month at a time (this is with using the brush twice a day).</li>
            <li> I like the small head</li>
            <li> Ill probably send this one back because I do not want to brush my teeth and count in my head or look at my watch while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I usually brush my teeth for longer than that period, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the cost is now</li>
            <li> Having been a smoker for the past 4 years, and having forgotten to brush my teeth on all those drunken college nights, I decided to change my oral health care routine.</li>
            <li> No more guessing about time.</li>
            <li> Definitely not more than a toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit bulky to travel with, even with the small travel case</li>
            <li> I ordered one for myself and one for my mom, and recieved them within a few days!</li>
            <li> no more battery&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used the Oral B for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> (It is in the manual - small type somewhere ion pg 14 or something - but who reads all that stuff when it&#x27;s just a toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> and it will be filled with some nasty black mold/slime.</li>
            <li> Philips does a VERY POOR job of describing the features on their products, and unless you know what you are looking for, you might miss the fact that they saved 30 cents by not including the beep every 30 seconds to signal moving on to the next quadrant while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Works well and is less expensive than other models because it has fewer features - nothing fancy</li>
            <li> This is not a major hardship, but it strikes me as being a silly marketing move on Philips&#x27; part.  </li>
            <li> I hate when I have to resort back to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the replacement brush heads are quite expensive.</li>
            <li> The batteries were weak when they arrived and lasted less than a month.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time finding the compact size in the stores</li>
            <li> Since my wife and I both have sonicare tooth brushes it is sometimes hard to tell the difference (just a small circle of color on the bottom of the head.)</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s not easy pleasing him!</li>
            <li> I had gotten used to this feature and was disappointed it was missing from my new model.</li>
            <li> It works well and may be less expensive than other brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the small circle brushes but I am slowly getting used to this brush.</li>
            <li> The charge usually lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> As one who had used the previous E-Series model for about 15 years, and am accustomed to it pausing every 30 seconds to tell me to change &amp;#34;quadrants&amp;#34; - I find this extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li> unfortunately thechild that inintend to give this to does not live in china.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, and very little patience</li>
            <li> and I was having to floss every single day without fail to keep up with it.</li>
            <li> (my parents are just finding this out the hard way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I do think that these toothbrushes make a difference; they keep you from brushing too hard and help you to brush for the recommended amount of time (2 minutes, I</li>
            <li> and so hard it literally hurt my mouth.</li>
            <li> but vibration is so hard</li>
            <li> &amp; I was brushing my teeth too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the force of the motion on my teeth that feels too hard.  </li>
            <li> This device cleans the mouth SO thoroughly, it&#x27;s scary; the junk I spat out after the first use was truly frightening!  </li>
            <li> For $39.00, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> After a year of using this toothbrush, I never did get use to the way it felt when the hard plastic head accidentally vibrated against my teeth</li>
            <li> But be warned, even in the beginning, it brushes quite hard.</li>
            <li> I feel like it gets my teeth cleaner without brushing so hard.</li>
            <li> I received a gift certificate from my family for my brother and was having a hard time deciding what to get.</li>
            <li> we have been using the sonicare but found it hard to find.</li>
            <li> I was brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> In fact, I may purchase additional Sonicare toothbrushes as presents for my hard to buy for relatives.</li>
            <li> they hardly need any attention at the dental office...</li>
            <li> and she was amazed that I hardly had any plaque.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to it</li>
            <li> Get this: before I got the Sonicare, my dentist warned me not to brush so hard, as it was hastening the recession of my gums.</li>
            <li> But unaccountably, the replaceable brush is expensive, very complex, and gets very dirty with a black growth that is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> The handle is too thick and makes it hard to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Too late to return.</li>
            <li> The negative comments about water contaminating the hand unit is no longer an issue.  </li>
            <li> the brush at least ONCE PER WEEK, including under the removaleable nut&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;sonicare handle is dishwasher safe&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Some customers complained about the cleaning.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about this toothbrush not holding a charge</li>
            <li> However, come late January or February</li>
            <li> that was my thinking at least...</li>
            <li> I always have my $10 electric toothbrush on standby for when my Sonicare toothbrush loses its power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will buy some heads late.</li>
            <li> how did i never own this toothbrush before?</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a hollow area in the head and handle where dirty toothpaste runs into and gets trapped.</li>
            <li> I was unable to return it, as it had been given as a gift and my window to return it had closed.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a Philips and quit working in the late Summer.  </li>
            <li> bristles for it... or at least I couldn&#x27;t find any.</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I have not had a problem with mold, icky fluids, or anything else in the handle because I try to rinse it out with every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this for a while now I cannot find a negative thing to write about.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it can get icky sometimes</li>
            <li> and so brush my teeth very frequently, at least 4 times a day.  </li>
            <li> That kinda sucks.  </li>
            <li> I have had this brand of toothbrush since the late 1990&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> that is the negative.</li>
            <li> No need to go crazy and spend the 200 dollars on the next level of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was late to the electric toothbrush party, but now have bought one for everyone in my family.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting, and I assume it was filled with bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Lately, it beeps after one of us brushes our teeth.</li>
            <li> i complained to the company that shipped it - they told me it cannot be returned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had used a  sonicare toothbrush since the late 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> At least the enclosed a $4 off coupon to buy REPLACEMENT heads.</li>
            <li> If I had to offer up a complaint, it would be the replacement brush heads are on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> I see no reason to waste money for unnecessary features.</li>
            <li> It starts slowly</li>
            <li> They work very well and we prefer the head that screws into the base.</li>
            <li> The battery has lasted well i believe because I do not leave it plugged in all the time, just when it starts running slow.  </li>
            <li> I had used the less expensive Oral B brushes in the past, but didn&#x27;t like them because they hurt my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive then the Sonicare I usually buy.</li>
            <li> it is small to reach hard to get places!  </li>
            <li> This one has a differently shaped base than the other one I had</li>
            <li> eh you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> There is no better way to brush your teeth!</li>
            <li> no more complaints!</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest one, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it lacks in cleaning power in any way.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve had an electric toothbrush before and know quality, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  </li>
            <li> big bulky, awkward to hold while brushing, feels weird, not very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they changed the configuration of the base, unless it was to keep people from using the old charger for the newer model brush.  </li>
            <li> I dislike the new sonicare model with proseries.. when you are brushing and press a bit hard - it makes an annoying &amp;#34;brrrap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Am I the only person who finds using these a really unpleasant experience?</li>
            <li> I had one of the very expensive models for about 6 years and it finally died.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have the automatic brushing time feature like my old one, so I was disappointed when it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Brush is too small, Sonic speed is irritating.</li>
            <li> Once you rely on an electric toothbrush, it is nearly impossible to go back to manual brushing....</li>
            <li> I know they should be replaced every 3 or 4 months, but that was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush if you have a serious gag reflex.</li>
            <li> Seriously healed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who doesn&#x27;t need the quadpacer feature could save some serious money by going with this less expensive model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who doesn&#x27;t need the quadpacer feature could save some serious money by going with this less expensive model.</li>
            <li> The cable can not be nicely stored under the base becasue of how the cable comes out of the base.  </li>
            <li> This thing seriously vibrates.</li>
            <li> seriously....</li>
            <li> Also, swish (don&#x27;t swallow) about a teaspoon of 3% H2O2 (peroxide) with your toothpaste for a ridiculous clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Refills can be expensive but less than a dentist</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m seriously concerned.</li>
            <li> This is a serious design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Seriously feels like I went to the dentist after brushing.</li>
            <li> Mold is a serious health hazard.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m used to a subtle  reminder to change quadrants.</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the heads for it are bulky and a little difficult to store.</li>
            <li> It can be a little weird getting use to its power.</li>
            <li> Was afraid it would shake loose a crown!  </li>
            <li> This is my second one--too bad the battery cannot be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Only thing bad is that I don&#x27;t understand the led indicator.</li>
            <li> and I think that is because there is not a good seal.</li>
            <li> I am frustrated that the time frame of the return policy for a lot of Amazon items is so short.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a disappointment when a company tries to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; on what is already a rock-solid idea.</li>
            <li> Ughh!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a good design.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve accidentally plugged it into a wrong voltage outlet and killed the charger.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted the money for it.</li>
            <li> and it has held a charge so far without needing to be put on the base.</li>
            <li> My old one got ruined in a power surge which ruined the base.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have taken the base, but my old, 5?6?</li>
            <li> Also I find that toothpaste and all drips inside the head housing and after a few uses it is an ugly mess.</li>
            <li> Other models we have had were sealed so this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disappointment compared to the other model.  </li>
            <li> My son is having a hard time with this concept!  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a completely closed design that makes it impossible for the internals to get wet or dirty.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I do not have the 30 second timer that I had in my other sonicare.</li>
            <li> I hated it when the toothbrush completely dead when I am in a middle of brushing!  </li>
            <li> I have brush for years using a conventional toothbrush and it always felt as if I still had a dirty mouth after cleaning.</li>
            <li> I suggested that it might be a bad charger but was told as long as it has power, it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is the toothbrush can get pretty nasty if you don&#x27;t take it apart periodically to clean/wipe off all the gunk that accumulates.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> no more excuses for poor brushing...must brush until timer runs out!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when my last Sonicare quit working.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed to find this model does not have the 30 second pause on the timer.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the battery connections are a weak point in the design.</li>
            <li> However, the inner parts of this toothbrush get extremely nasty if they aren&#x27;t cleaned out every other day or so.  </li>
            <li> It tickles some, but I can get used to that, and you don&#x27;t have to scrub very hard with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush very hard and have some wearing of my tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t given the battery life a tough test yet</li>
            <li> We unscrewed our toothbrushes everyday after use to help with the build up of the black crap</li>
            <li> It is the 24th of May and nothing has come, no explaination, no package and no acknowledgement that it is very late.  </li>
            <li> As usual another Ace product by Philips Sonicare!!</li>
            <li> The rechareable electric portion of the toothbrush is also a little awkward to hold, and I ended up losing my grip and spraying toothpaste on my face after I had already applied my makeup.</li>
            <li> It is hard to go wrong with any sonicare</li>
            <li> /&gt;The key to keeping the toothbrush maintained is to wipe off the brush stem attachment to prevent water from draining into base insertion cavity.  </li>
            <li> Addicted.</li>
            <li> so I opted for the least expensive model..</li>
            <li> By Nov 2013 it stopped charging (intermittently) even after re-seating the base on the charger several times.</li>
            <li> I would buy again if lost or broken...</li>
            <li> Not happy with the brush though.</li>
            <li> Not happy that Phillips makes a product that can&#x27;t be repaired.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed though not surprised since this was the bottom of the line version.  </li>
            <li> This device lasted approximately 8 weeks and then quit working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, the toothbrush appears poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> the charge remains plenty for short travel without the base.</li>
            <li> I hate going to the dentist so after six years I finally went</li>
            <li> Poor form from the seller.</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t leave it off the base, but it looks like it can take it.  </li>
            <li> Travel case holds toothbrush only; not the base.</li>
            <li> If you bump it against a tooth with the plastic it gets worse.</li>
            <li> and I can return the broken one.</li>
            <li> Also, the on/off switch is poorly placed.</li>
            <li> Just not happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely poor one.  </li>
            <li> However, it is poorly designed because water gets in to grow mold.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this model.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has never used an electric toothbrush, it took me approximately 2-3 cleanings to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> what a piece of crap this toothbrush didn&#x27;t even last a year</li>
            <li> It is really unsanitary and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Amazon falsely advertised this toothbrush as having the quadpacer feature and it does not.</li>
            <li> TAKES CARE OF ANY CLEANING AND HAVE 5 FALSE TEETH</li>
            <li> After a little over a year the battery quit charging rendering this tooth brush useless !</li>
            <li> Compared to the newer models:&lt;br /&gt;positives - cheaper&lt;br /&gt;negatives - very difficult to get the mold that collects inside the cap area including a rubber piece that&#x27;s permanently molded, replacement heads are pricier, bulkier, slightly heavier&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not recommended with this gizmo, since I&#x27;ve found it impossible to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; without foam dribbling down my chin</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, the whole brush needs to be replaced because it&#x27;s annoying to maintain, making this a very expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed to find that the 30 sec interval timer is no longer on this model of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed to find out that this model does not have the 30 sec.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought the replacement heads already - maybe I&#x27;m too rough :(</li>
            <li> Works fine until you screw the head off and realize that due to the terrible design, water leaks in causing disgusting build up.</li>
            <li> After 5 months of use, terrible, supposed to be new.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel like they have just been cleaned and my dental cleanings are a lot less painful.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it did not have the quad timing as my other Sonicare brush did.  </li>
            <li> I had other sonic toothbrushes, and I was disappointed when I came to this one.</li>
            <li> This is due to the poor (nonexistent) seal from the rubber boot at the base of the brush stem.</li>
            <li> I opened the shipping packaging to discover that the toothbrush and the other contents don&#x27;t get shipped in a normal factory box from Sony, but rather the Amazon packaging which is absolutely filthy and disgusting.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush itself but was a little disappointed that the head of the toothbrush was broken when I received.</li>
            <li> Extremely loud and very painful to use!</li>
            <li> It is annoying that the replacement heads are so expensive, but I figure I will use the heads a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a 30sec timer like my previous ones but still shuts off after 2 mins.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted 5 weeks and shuts itself off in less than one mine and then runs for 5 seconds:(</li>
            <li> This is a replacement because the base of my other one &amp;#34;disappeared&amp;#34; during a road trip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this toothbrush because it doesn&#x27;t have the automatic four segment timer for brushing the four quadrants of your teeth.</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed to discover that it does not have the &amp;#34;quadpacer timer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing since my previous toothbrush lasted over 5 years.</li>
            <li> It then leaks down overnight onto the base.</li>
            <li> The screw on dome style heads aren&#x27;t water tight so water drips into the spacious cavity between the head and base, which is a breeding ground for bacteria and mold.</li>
            <li> Hard to explain, but its a bad design.  </li>
            <li> The base is a little difficult, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s honestly not that bad.</li>
            <li> I bought the expensive one for my wife and this one for me.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Expensive toothbrush replacement.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I had the battery one and it failed draining the batteries after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> This has failed three times since I got it.</li>
            <li> Would fail to turn on or fail to turn off.  </li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with sonicare</li>
            <li> The Essence has internal cavities in the brush heads that collect all kinds of nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this model does not have</li>
            <li> The reviews are all wrong on this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a couple of months and it start buzzing weirdly every time I use it, like the head</li>
            <li> I felt the Sonicare brand was too expensive.</li>
            <li> Though finding replacing heads is difficult unless you go for generics</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> nasty buzzing is not pleasing to the mouth, would not recommend it especially for those who have the seal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed with this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Which is weird because this was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are expensive though.</li>
            <li> Gums stopped bleeding within a couple of weeks of use and dental appointments are no longer scary.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately like all of these the brush heads are stupidly expensive (like $8 a piece in bulk)</li>
            <li> this is one of those buys where you can&#x27;t go wrong .</li>
            <li> , it just tickled my gums which made it uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> you want to buy an expensive ET, id recommend try with this one.</li>
            <li> heads are expensive</li>
            <li> heads are expensive</li>
            <li> But expensive heads</li>
            <li> My expensive programmable Sonicare died the day before my surgery and rehab.</li>
            <li> After 23 months, mine failed.</li>
            <li> Replacement head are expensive thou</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning to non-electric toothbrushes because these are just too expensive.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was skeptical about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If it fails prematurely or if my warranty is not honored, I will update this post.</li>
            <li> At forty bux how can you go wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive as the technology requires some complexity.</li>
            <li> Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> But that is what went wrong on it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one downside: it&#x27;s still difficult to get the backs of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the value of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was sorry that I didn&#x27;t know that</li>
            <li> the replacement toothbrush was expensive though...will try OEM replacement instead</li>
            <li> However it is rather expensive, hence the 4-star rating.</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I did read the directions and it is not that difficult to understand.  </li>
            <li> But once I tired the Sonicare, I was hooked!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong at this price..</li>
            <li> These are the biggest piece of crap I have ever wasted my money on.  </li>
            <li> Man was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to get use to</li>
            <li> But useless without brushes.  </li>
            <li> and it was weird.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> At this price, plus $7-10 a head every three months, that&#x27;s a really, really expensive toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> BUT sadly this tooth brush does NOT do that.  </li>
            <li> unable to fill out warranty.</li>
            <li> This is getting expensive.  </li>
            <li> to have an expensive brush than expensive dentist bills.</li>
            <li> not overly complicated.</li>
            <li> bought this because I was unable to find a Braun comparable to the one I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Is not for the faint of heart (mouth?), as it is truly sonic: will resonate with everything your head has to offer.</li>
            <li> But, eventually, ALL rechargeable batteries fail.  </li>
            <li> And will continue to do so, when they fail, until they plant us.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever accidentally grab the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Customer Service FAIL.</li>
            <li> I also opted for the Amazon packaging, which meant a custom made Amazon cardboard box, without the horrible, difficult to open plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift (he&#x27;s obsessed with my sonicare toothbrush).</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> the heads are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> What is wrong with this made in China junk?</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> When I read reviews on this toothbrush I read a few times that the timer on this toothbrush is annoying, get the one that beeps etc..  </li>
            <li> The brush head replacement are extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> This unit lasted about 6 months and is now useless.  </li>
            <li> i just wish the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so dang expensive though.     </li>
            <li> Batteries are to expensive.</li>
            <li> With this one he doesn&#x27;t get sick or gag which is music to my ears if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how serious that  vibration was.</li>
            <li> This product was very poorly made and broke almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> The charger base is small and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothbrush screws onto the base which, unlike the snap on models, doesn&#x27;t leave room for toothpaste to creep into the mechanism and slow it</li>
            <li> But like other reviews stated there is a lot of nasty gunk that gets inside.</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s nothing like having a bunch of nasty black mold on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but then we noticed disgusting black mold all over the inside and around the edges.  </li>
            <li> Toothpaste and saliva seeps into magnetic area where it sits and forms a horrible stinky mess.</li>
            <li> It gets dirty in there.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with this one and was so unhappy.</li>
            <li> son says it brushes his teeth well, but his lips and cheeks are numb by the time he finishes cleaning around all his braces.</li>
            <li> Like crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> The angle makes it so that you have to hold your arm in an awkward angle.  </li>
            <li> mine go some dirty smell on it, i try cleaning it</li>
            <li> I was shocked and disgusted to see that there is mold on the inside, which is hollow and inaccessible for purposes of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I cannot even use cold water afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was unhappy with the one she was using.</li>
            <li> Collected saliva inside the brush like crazy.</li>
            <li> It molds and stinks inside.</li>
            <li> and I have an awkward time repositioning my hand around the body of the brush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking to buy another base because I&#x27;m tired of having to wait for my kids to finish with them.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a real game changer.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase and for having wasted my money on a  product that seems to have been defective and lasted me just three weeks!</li>
            <li> To avoid the nasty mold issue, I take off the brush head and leave the base air dry.</li>
            <li> (while I like how small it is) has a terrible design for the cable management.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Talk about a needless throw away!  </li>
            <li> It just Broken for just using Two Month and which cannnot be return!!</li>
            <li> The filing would have failed eventually, but it does vibrate rather violently.</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive version of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> However, it tickles in a very uncomfortable way.  </li>
            <li> Very sad, this product has already stopped working.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable if it touches teeth.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult.  </li>
            <li> If you do not remove the brush head every time it&#x27;s used awful gunk collects between the head and the handle and runs down onto the charger base.</li>
            <li> ; button is invisible from mirror, and almost impossible to find with your finger.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to remove all.</li>
            <li> This is a bad habbit to have as it will catch up to you some day</li>
            <li> MAYBE it went bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger/bulkier than the newer units, but not as bad as I thought it would be based on photos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> The charger was bad or something inside the toothbrush quit working..</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with this product.</li>
            <li> bad news is about this brush is the battery is sealed in the unit.</li>
            <li> It vibrates badly in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the brush part just starts wobbling so badly</li>
            <li> and he didnt even know I had been neglecting my teeth so badly</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was bad customer service compounded by poor product replacement, and terrible manager follow up.</li>
            <li> It is really bad in Quantity.</li>
            <li> so that wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I fiance had an electric toothbrush that she got from her dentist, but that one went bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years after my dentist pointed out that I had really bad plaque.</li>
            <li> The battery went bad and it had to be discarded.  </li>
            <li> So after a week of use, I was shocked to find mildew inside the brush bottom (rubbery flexible part).</li>
            <li> or it will get ugly.</li>
            <li> I just got frustrated to have no 30 seconds timer as I said before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Growing up, dental cleanings have always been painful for me.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> On my teeth it was extremely painful.</li>
            <li> and then it becomes painful.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I was going to be sick.  </li>
            <li> he will  get sick and gag .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the performance; if this was a kitchen appliance or shop tool, it would make me hesitate before buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in level of vibration.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed with the maintainance issues.</li>
            <li> Will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I am sorely disappointed in the quality degradation.</li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> Am disappointed that my sonic does not buzz after 30 seconds 3 times.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have the 30-second timer.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the fact that this model doesn&#x27;t have the feature that beeps every 30 seconds to help you organize your brushing...</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> and we are disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I opened the package when it arrived and was disappointed that the packaging was all cardboard.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it to me and I have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disappointed, comparing the two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The battery has failed a couple of times and they have replaced it under warranty no questions asked!!  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I find this incredibly stupid.</li>
            <li> the inside (where the brush and the base connect every once in awhile as mold can grow if you don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> This newer model is almost identical, except for a redesigned charging base.</li>
            <li> My biggest pet peeve about this toothbrush is that water gets into compartment where you remove the head of the brush and the base.</li>
            <li> Charging when place on charging base without a cord.</li>
            <li> After use, remnants of toothpaste collects in the base and onto the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t screw on all the way, so the base fills up with water and the toothpaste foam from your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Charging base</li>
            <li> There is a gap between the brush head and the screw-top base that like to accumulate A TON of toothpaste and spit.</li>
            <li> I would hate to think that someone at Philips would recycle a toothbrush, but you never know.</li>
            <li> i hate how sonicare just took the beeping function off</li>
            <li> like that it has this neat charging base that it sits in instead of having to plug in.</li>
            <li> In the four months, I kept the brush in the charging base as the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> but it collect tons of crap under the screw on cap.</li>
            <li> Just a tip though don&#x27;t leave the head on the base.  </li>
            <li> Also, the travel bag provided was worthless.  </li>
            <li> It can travel without the base for up to two weeks before needing to be charged.</li>
            <li> Cord stores in base</li>
            <li> That way I could buy just another base and switch out when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> and I hate it.  </li>
            <li> One thing I would recommend though, is unscrewing the brush from the base</li>
            <li> The head does not seal well to the base and it gets FILTHY inside.  </li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dissapointed that Sonicare removed this feature from their base model.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, I hated using it.</li>
            <li> Except for the nasty gunk that collects in the base of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated mine.  </li>
            <li> Hated the way mold/mildew grew inside of the head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out it did not have a feature called Quadpacer!</li>
            <li> Get one: you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Very, very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It is a disgusting and time consuming process.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting and unless you like to brush with mold or tear the toothbrust every week</li>
            <li> Nasty!  </li>
            <li> DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is the floating head.</li>
            <li> They get disgusting.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> The brush vibrates horribly and falls out while using.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It has no contacts for a charger base, but Philips Chat swears it is, and they can&#x27;t help me!</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, just the base model!  </li>
            <li> The WORST part is that this was supposed to be a gift which I was planning to wrap, but now I have NO CLUE how to make this all work on time.</li>
            <li> and that broken!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is Really Bad in Quantity.!!!</li>
            <li> companies are awful at rebate and fight you tooth and nail to give you what they promised.</li>
            <li> This one was horrible.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is horrible!  </li>
            <li> It looked awfully chea[!</li>
            <li> It is the worst thing that I buy</li>
            <li> My son used to hate to brush his teeth, now he loves it because this brush massages his gums!</li>
            <li> I was so shocked at the difference!!</li>

            <li> You have to be constantly disassembling the device due to the mold that builds up inside and to clean it you need to submerge each component into clorox.  It is a disgusting and time consuming process.</li>
            <li> Best power toothbrush I have used</li>
            <li> Will no longer charger I left it on the charger for 2 days and it is not charging. Now I have to buy another one</li>
            <li> bought for a gift but I use the Philips sonicare and feel it is sufficient for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works well. Just a little bit too strong and I hope it would not damage my gum or teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for nearly a decade.  My old toothbrush lasted ten years so I purchased another one.  The Essence 5600 is a good price and is very effective.  It vibrates and brushes away plaque on teeth with ease.  It only needs to be charged every couple of weeks.  It even comes with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleased with Sonicare for very long and will continue to buy their products.  Don&#x27;t spend a lot of money.  Buy the $40 one and it will serve you well.</li>
            <li> The dentist and hygienists who treat my wife and me think we are daily flossers when we show up for six month cleaning. These won&#x27;t replace flossing, but they come close. Definitely worth the cost. Bought them for our grown sons as well.</li>
            <li> Fine as a tooth brush but does not have the 30 second / 2 minute vibration that the basic models used to have</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the same  Essence Sonicare I had before.  It works fine so far, and I expect it to last several years also.</li>
            <li> Awesome in every way, only hassle is cleaning</li>
            <li> 3 minutes with this tooth gets my teeth so clean it&#x27;s like getting a cleaning from the dentist.  My dentist actually reccomended this tooth brush to my parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on brushing, a habbit reinforced by my awesome genetics where i can basically do nothing and have no tooth issues at all.  This is a bad habbit to have as it will catch up to you some day (my parents are just finding this out the hard way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take the plunge and buy this and am happy I did. I can get my teeth dentist-level clean in just about 3 minutes. I NEVER got this clean with a regular brush and elbow grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> As described!  This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> best toothbrush ever !!!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush will  help give you the discipline (that most of us do not have) to do a thorough brushing (set to an automatic 2 minute duration) twice a day. The cost is worth it! It is better than the Sonic unit with  replaceable batteries that suck away the $$ fast.  I recommend it and I am not a dentist!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;I used 3 times and this is very hard ,to much vibration</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same style of toothbrush for several years. When the battery gave out, I ordered this one. Works well and keeps the tartar off the teeth. Recommend it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Good price for this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy an electric toothbrush, very comfortable to use, very clean brush</li>
            <li> Works better than a regular tooth brush and especially if you have bridges in the back of your mouth this electric tooth brush gets back there very easy  with no problem wish I had tried it even sooner because I don&#x27;t get the complaint from my dentist about no getting that area better anymore.</li>
            <li> It works fine. The beep every 30 seconds my old one had would be nice but this is still good. It just runs for two minutes and then shuts off.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush cleans great but it molds up on the inside unless you take it apart each time you use it.  I called customer support and was told that it was my personal hygiene issue because I do not take it apart every time I use it.  They are selling a new &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; model but it&#x27;s still not their problem!!!</li>
            <li> Did not realize when I bought it that it did not have the 30 second timer for each section of brushing.  Would not buy this model again.</li>
            <li> great price for a great product</li>
            <li> works like I expect Phillips Sonicare should work.&lt;br /&gt;Very excellent investment.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years. I don&#x27;t really care about all the fancy features, just the basic toothbrush features. This has always included what they call Quad-Pacer. This simply breaks the 2 minute cycle into 30 second intervals which makes it easier to get the proper amount of time in each area of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these which replace earlier &amp;#34;Essence&amp;#34; toothbrushes. I was very upset to learn that Sonicare has deleted the Quad-Pacer feature from this model. This is obviously some Marketing driven scheme to drive people to the higher priced, feature filled tooth brushes. I admit, I didn&#x27;t study the list of features. That said, for them to remove a feature that has always been there is pretty poor customer relations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these batteries no longer hold a charge I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush lasted for two months and quit. Amazon would not replace because it was over 30 days.</li>
            <li> I was trying to get an older version of this product, but it wasn&#x27;t available anywhere I searched.  Since getting this,  I decided I much prefer it.  I still had some old replacement brushes and the company sent me two new ones that replaced them!</li>
            <li> I bought this for its ratings. The brush would not spin well on its own. So I returned it and bought a different model that works better.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than manually brushing my teeth, and they feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am not so into this electric toothbrush after several months of use. And this is my first electric toothbrush, so maybe it&#x27;s with this toothbrush or maybe electric toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t suit me so well.&lt;br /&gt;The major problem is that water and toothpaste just keep leaking into the space between the top part and bottom part through the stick and developed a bad odor there and is somewhat hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning power wasn&#x27;t much different from a common toothbrush, at least I couldn&#x27;t tell, my teeth are not whiter...&lt;br /&gt;Also I am having a toothache which I didn&#x27;t have before though it may be just coincidence.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Sonicare electric toothbrush for my grandson&#x27;s birthday.  It is similar to the one I use and it operates effectively.</li>
            <li> I was using a manual toothbrush, and have not been satisfied with it in a long time.  No matter how I brushed, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean and my gums would sometimes get sore.  I finally decided to try something else, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.  My teeth now look and feel clean, and my gums feel good. This may sound silly but I also look forward to brushing now, almost like a kid getting a fancy new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like a hive of bees in your mouth, and it takes a few times to get used to the sensation of the sonic action.  I got used to the new method of brushing quickly and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After about a month of use I took this product apart and discovered mold/mildew growing inside the cavity between the battery part and the brush. It was disgusting and unless you like to brush with mold or tear the toothbrust every week I don&#x27;t recommend using this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. She kept saying she was going to buy one, so I ordered it for her. Shes only been using it for a short time but really likes it so far</li>
            <li> I called philips and asked about the motors and they said the motors are the same  in all models.  I bought the expensive one for my wife and this one for me.  They seeem to work the same.  I had a realy old one (like over 10 years, also sonicare) and the new ones are SIGNIFICANTLY stronger than my older one, so I think the newer ones are therefore more effective.</li>
            <li> My dentist says that the Sonic is the best electric tooth brush of them all. I agree.</li>
            <li> I really like this Sonicare model.I had one of the very expensive models for about 6 years and it finally died. This one has no bells and whistles but cleans my teeth just as well because I didn&#x27;t have time in my life to use the bells and whistles in the first place. Plus when this one dies I won&#x27;t cry over the cost. Awesome ultrasonic tooth hygiene at a reasonable price. And is you are too stupid to clean it right you are beyond all reason.</li>
            <li> I got my first Philips Sonicare around 1995 and it finally gave out this year. I had replaced the toothbrush heads but the handle and recharger held up with no problems, ever. I ordered this replacement one and just love it and have no doubts it will last for years to come. One year after I started using my original Sonicare my gums became so healthy the dentist attendant took my previous x-rays and new ones all around the office to show everyone the astonishing difference in my gums and they were completely healed from gingivitis, also no cavities this time or since. I always had bleeding gums until Sonicare cleared up the gingivitis and I haven&#x27;t had bleeding gums since. I will never use another toothbrush. Sonicare has proven it heals and keeps the gums healthy and keeps the cavities away. My teeth and gums always feel fresh and clean after brushing my teeth with my Sonicare. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product and especially if you have kids, get them started with the Sonicare to keep their gums and teeth healthy and fewer dental bills for mom and pop. A great product!</li>
            <li> Write up stated a timer, which is what I wanted. However, I wanted the timer that indicates every 30 seconds, not just have it running for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who does not brush very well.  It turns itself off after 2 minutes, so I tell him to brush until the toothbrush stops.  It works much better than other brands we&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> Had this toothbrush for about a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong. The power of the brush is great and you don&#x27;t need to charge it everyday. Brush heads do need to be replaced about every 3 or so months. Overall, does what&#x27;s it&#x27;s suppose to do and is durable. Just make sure you clean out the inside (where the brush and the base connect every once in awhile as mold can grow if you don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> It worked just fine as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I got it sooner than expected, and it has given me no trouble so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s every thing I expected.</li>
            <li> This took a few times of using to get used to the &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; and tickle in your mouth, but wow you feel like you just had a dentist&#x27;s cleaning every time you brush.  I noticed my teeth seemed whiter even after the first couple uses as well!  My dental cleanings will be taking half the time and I expect less gum disease, and cavities with the use of it.  It was dentist recommended and I think it will be a good investment!</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist had been trying to get me to use an electric toothbrush for some time. Finally convinced me that my gums would thank me. Took some getting used to, and now love the job it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a tooth brush like this for years.....keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Sonic electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to beep every 30 seconds when in use. It doesn&#x27;t. I have to keep one eye on the clock while brushing. The booklet that comes with it says it will beep but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> does a great brushing job. long battery life between charges making it good for travel. Nice travel case .easy to find replacement heads</li>
            <li> Bought this specific item at our DDS&#x27;s request.  Expected better cleaning.  It did.  However, did not expect how much better the cleaning was.  Feels like brand new teeth on this 50+ person and check-ups are validating that.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I had the sonicare rechargeable toothbrush and loved it so I bought this one for my husband.  My toothbrush has lasted for years with only changing out the head which is expected. The timer is great letting you know when its time to switch sides and the charge lasts a long time.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt cleaner.  I&#x27;ve had another electric toothbrush for years, and this one is much better.  I also like the auto turn-off at two minutes.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works amazing! Love the travel case it comes with, makes it so much easier to take my electric toothbrush with me anywhere.</li>
            <li> Oldsalt1963&lt;br /&gt;Love this tooth brush. My dentist recommended I get it. It was much cheaper on Amazon than in Target or other local retailers.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth and gums feel much cleaner and better than using a manual toothbrush. In addition it has a two minute timer which helps in making sure you spend enough time brushing and cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great device for both teeth &amp; gums!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and I am very happy. I would like to get a waterpik soon. I NEED REPLACEMENT BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> it seems that the battery is doing the same as the one it replaced.  That is/ not holdimg a charge and never getting to a solid light. Once I switched receptacles I found the change was working well!</li>
            <li> Replacement so I knew I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li> The leaky design allows for mold to grow in the chamber above the battery, the threads, and up into the head.  Nasty!  It happened within weeks, so there&#x27;s no way the designers missed that little problem.  I leave the head off when it&#x27;s not in use, and mold still finds a way to grow in there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does a good job with cleaning, but wow, huge design flaw.  Spend a little more on one that doesn&#x27;t get black mold growing in it within weeks.  Bleh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and the replacement heads are highway robbery.  Buy generic, there&#x27;s no difference outside of the price..</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.  I think the one I received was faulty.  It was very loud.  Also heavier than new models if you are traveling&lt;br /&gt;Amazon returned it no problem.</li>
            <li> This replaced a much older Sonicare that died after several years of intermittent use, and I find myself using this newer model almost all the time -- the shape of the brush head is less blocky, more diamond-y, and the stem is thinner and angled compared to the old model. I believe the old model was also the basic entry-level but it did have the 30-second beep reminder to get you to pace yourself while brushing, but that feature isn&#x27;t on this new basic model. Charging base is more compact, and there is less plastic housing around the brush stem, so that means less to clean up but also less protection for the part that actually vibrates. If you&#x27;re not worried about bumps and falls, then this model should work well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update: After a little over a month of daily use, this Sonicare toothbrush is behaving erratically -- the cycle does not reliably last 2 minutes but instead stops early, and the strength of the vibration has diminished. My previous Sonicare lasted for years, so having this new one sputter after such a short time reduces my confidence in Philips -- is there a quality control failure? I&#x27;m disappointed with the performance; if this was a kitchen appliance or shop tool, it would make me hesitate before buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare toothbursh lasted for 13 years!  I&#x27;m hoping this one will too.  I appreciate the grip strips on this newer model.  My old one had the quadrapacer (30 second interval timer) but I chose to skip that this time and save myself $30.  Don&#x27;t miss it at all.  Maybe my old one was just tired, but this unit seems to vibrate at a faster pace (my husband even commented on the higher pitch sound it makes).  The angled head and smaller brush does help reaching to the back of my mouth. The travel case is a nice little bonus, just wish is was big enough to tuck the charger in for travel longer than 2 weeks.  I feel like this is a great price for a valuable product that should last years.  I know I paid many times more for my first Sonicare and definitely got my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Like most others, I’m quite happy with this product! I purchased the product after it was recommended by my dentist. The power of the Sonicare toothbrush is amazing. It cleans my teeth much better than other toothbrushes I’ve owned. The unit is rechargeable. Over time, I’m sure that the battery life will degrade; currently it lasts 2-3 weeks before it needs recharged. The detachable toothbrush head comes with a tightly fitting plastic cover for travel. However, I’ve found that steripods work better. The provided cover fits too tightly, so my toothbrush stays wet (gross!). Overall, I highly recommend this product (so does my dentist!).</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth real good!</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for the same brush series it does not clean as well it seems like there is not the same amount of power</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush and this one lives up to its reputation .</li>
            <li> I have been using Phillips SONICARE for several years, and Dentist raves over my results.  I bought a SONICARE for each member of my family because there is no doubt &amp;#34; PHILLIPS SONICARE ESSENCE IS SUPERIOR TO EVERYTHING ELSE.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time that we have bought a sonicare toothbursh.  I abosolutely love them after using them you can&#x27;t go back to using a manual toothbrush.  They make your teeth and gums feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> We had the older model of this Sonic Care toothbrush for years and loved it.  The batteries started to die out on them though so the time had come to reorder and this was the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; version that was advertised on Amazon to replace the ones we had.  They still work great and seem to do the job but my big complaint is that this model doesn&#x27;t let you know to change quadrants in your mouth every thirty seconds like the older model did.  It was so convenient to have that feature.  Now I just guess when to change.  It&#x27;s never right but I think all my teeth get the same amount of coverage.  I don&#x27;t have a watch or a clock on the wall with a seconds hand so it was a bummer when that function disappeared.  It&#x27;s odd that the older version of a product is better then the current one, but this is the case for this sonic care model.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my previous Sonicare electric toothbrush that finally died after many years. This newer model is almost identical, except for a redesigned charging base. The new base is a lot smaller and doesn&#x27;t hold the brush as well. It&#x27;s pretty wobbly in this base and easily gets knocked over on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This was everything I expected and paid for. I had an old sonicare for a while and this one seems better. I like the tapered bristles and the more compact shape. I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet or really tested the battery life, however. Also it seems to get less dirty than the old ones, which pretty much just accumulated dirt in all the cracks.</li>
            <li> This is my second one--too bad the battery cannot be replaced.  It is the best.  Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  It works great.  The charge last about 2 weeks and my mouth feels so fresh and clean.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have the automatic brushing time feature like my old one, so I was disappointed when it didn&#x27;t.  I found after using it a few times that I could clean my teeth very well without the programed timing.</li>
            <li> Does just what you want a toothbrush to do, really cleans and refreshes whole mouth.  Wish the replacement heads had a more reasonable price tag,..</li>
            <li> I expected this product to have the 30 second interval timer as did my former Sonicare product -  use it 2x/daily</li>
            <li> This is my second Phillips Sonicare and it was received within&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few days.  I was impressed.  I&#x27;m also impressed with the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare.  The brush on this one is bigger than the last Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had and, therefore, covers more teeth as I brush.  My dentist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended the first Sonicare so I continued on with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said my teeth are very clean, thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Had a Sonic for 15 Yrs It died, so got this one. Would recommend it. Cleans well, mouth feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have used forever, it works well and I see no change in functionality since I first bought.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Sonicare. My last one was the high-end version for $150 but this little guy does the job just as well. I see no reason to waste money for unnecessary features.</li>
            <li> good brush.  No frills.</li>
            <li> one of the brushes in the 2 pack broke after 2 months.  Too late to return. It would no longer take a charge.  The quality seemed worse than similar brushes I bought in the past at Sam&#x27;s Club or Walmart</li>
            <li> great brush. change heads after three months.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush. I tell you what, my mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this fresh from just using a new toothbrush before! The toothbrush is fairly light and really powerful. The included charger is quite convenient as it can be easily tucked away and easy access. Honestly, the toothbrush lasted a good 2 weeks before it started showing signs of slowing down. The replacement heads for the toothbrush cost around 30$ for a pack of 4 on Amazon. So, in the end it is a great deal to purchase one of these, as you will save some money on Toothbrushes as well as have a great feeling clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, thank you</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this.  Nice slim profile not cluttering the counter.  Works great.  I&#x27;m happy, my dentist is happy.</li>
            <li> my teeth and dentist love it!</li>
            <li> Took a while to get used to but I love it.</li>
            <li> I seem to be the minority so use your own judgment. If you have healthy teeth it is probably fine and even a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I have caps and old teeth. With the first elec. tooth brush , other brand, I lost a cap.&lt;br /&gt;With the new sonic I have a new chipped tooth.&lt;br /&gt;I am really upset at the money I have wasted and am back to regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Love it this is my 2nd purchase after my previous one lasted over 10 years</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this product is worthwhile - it was shipped without any brush heads. The text explicitly states it comes with the brush. Back it goes.</li>
            <li> So, I was hoping for a toothbrush that had rotating bristles.  This one has the benefit of the shape of a regular toothbrush (which I prefer) instead of the round one.  But instead of rotating or moving much, these bristles vibrate, sort-of buzz and the sound reminds me of a electric hair-clippers (getting a buzz-cut).  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a decent toothbrush, it&#x27;s just a matter of preferences.  I prefer something that rotates instead of buzzes.  But I&#x27;m looking for a rotating one that is not round.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product. Performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and in mint condition.  This is my first Sonicare and I am very pleased with it as is my dentist.  Even though I brush right after each meal, I have had staining that occurs where my gums are recessed.  The Sonicare has helped prevent the staining from occurring as much.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted about 4 years so I replaced it with an identical one.  My oral health has been much improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
            <li> This was not the Sonicare I thought I was ordering and had to send it back. This one is the older model.</li>
            <li> + Cleans really well, proven effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;+ Long lasting batteries, I got two full years of use.&lt;br /&gt;+ Clean easy charging design&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive toothbrush replacement.&lt;br /&gt;- Needs periodic cleaning under the brush.</li>
            <li> Works like the more expensive model but has no thirty second timer that cues you to switch brushing area.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have since it is on a two minute timer.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t beat Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Good, but it may make up the display for the truth, but a great experience and you need a bit of adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Like how it makes my teeth feel - Still use regular Tooth Brush too .</li>
            <li> This is my second similar Philips Sonicare toothbrush. The first one lasted ~20 years with no problems.  I brush a minimum of 3 times/day with it.  It is simply a great toothbrush that brushes your teeth and massages your gums.  I don&#x27;t think there is a better toothbrush on the market for cleaning teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to keeping the toothbrush maintained is to wipe off the brush stem attachment to prevent water from draining into base insertion cavity.  Check the base cavity each time you change out a brush and clean if necessary.</li>
            <li> I had the battery one and it failed draining the batteries after 2 uses. being that it was over a year old MAYBE it went bad. So I decided to get this rechargeable one. It works soo much better. A steady power stream and use. its also lighter and saves on batteries when I need to recharge.</li>
            <li> This has failed three times since I got it. Under warranty and replaced twice but I am giving up on this brand. I was told there was a issue with a defective handle twice, so three defective handles in less than a year...no i cant accept that.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends sonicare and I do too! Works fine and does what it&#x27;s designed to do</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Philips Sonicare products for over ten years and I would never buy any other toothbrush! Even my dental exams are awesome thanks to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Simple packaging, for such a great toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our second Sonicare. I bought this for work, since I spend a couple days a time there. It works great, just as expected! I charged it for a day, and did not use if for over a month due to vacation at work. I got back to work, didnt charge it, and it worked just as strong as when I left. Over a month and the battery is still strong. Pretty cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the cord for the charger is very stiff. It doesnt really lay flat, and can cause the charger base and toothbrush to fall over. But its not worth taking off a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and it cleans your teeth better than any other brush I have found!</li>
            <li> Will be buying more for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying a fresher brush with each use. Getting that seemingly, fresh from the dentist chair cleaning is great!</li>
            <li> It has and continues to improve my teeth</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, very pleased. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These are the bomb. My receding as actually IMPROVED over the years from using this.</li>
            <li> Worked well for one year, then started having problems.  Would fail to turn on or fail to turn off.  It is now unfunctional.    /edit    I&#x27;m editing this review because PHILIPS had excellent customer service ... all I had to do was call them up and describe my problem, and they sent me a new one immediately, along with a prepaid label to ship the old one back.      I believe that I was technically past warranty as well (by a few months), but they didn&#x27;t make a big deal about it.  The customer service was so great that I&#x27;m giving this 5/5 stars.    The new one is a more recent version (has some additional pulsing and staged vibration features) and works well.    Good job Philips, and keep up the good work.  My experience with the company has definitely left a good impression on the PHILIPS brand.</li>
            <li> This is great! I can finally tell my hygenist to &amp;#34;shut up&amp;#34; about my teeth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had before and I am so happy with my new one.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, MOUTH HAS NEVER FELT SO CLEAN!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and loved it.  I have had it for about a year.  Teeth are super clean and my dentist comments on the lack of plaque.  I liked it so much I bought one for each of my parents and now my brother.  Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is kind of the bottom of the line toothbrush for Philips sonicare however it works just as well as top-of-the-line models from Philips sonicare that I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My teeth have never been healthier or whiter.</li>
            <li> Previous tooth brush was oral care.  (The kind that just rotates is circles.)  It didn&#x27;t clean nearly as well as this one with the vibration.  Pleased with the cleaning action and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!! Working wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush - great value.</li>
            <li> Good product. Cant go wrong with sonicare</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mid-level Sonicare, so if you&#x27;re expecting the buzzing reminding you of which quadrant you should be on, forget it. It works well though, it&#x27;s not too noisy and it&#x27;s certainly better than other handheld or electric brushes- just more bare bones than other models. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the heads for it are bulky and a little difficult to store.</li>
            <li> Love it, I couldn&#x27;t go back to reg toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Initially I was very skeptical. I&#x27;m a 52 year old man who doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the notion that I need some kind of upgrade in how I brush my teeth. But a dentist was very eloquent and years later I got around to trying one which happened to be this Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only say that now brushing my teeth is one of the highlights of my morning. Now, leaving aside what that does or does not say about the desultory nature of my mornings, this thing cleans my teeth with such inhuman thoroughness that my mouth actually tastes clean hours after I&#x27;ve used it. All it takes is a bit of mouth wash. My gums love the thing too. I even sent one to my father who, as you might imagine doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the idea that he needs an upgrade in how he needs to brush his teeth much less from someone he taught how to brush their teeth. If I get the chance I&#x27;ll let you all know what he has to say too.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush for a great price.  I&#x27;ve used Sonicare brand for over 15 years and this brush is every bit as good at the one that I replaced (which I had for 12 years!)  Don&#x27;t expect this one to last as long but, for this price, there is no downside.  I have had no issues with keeping it clean.  Bought mine 6 months ago and it has performed perfectly...also bought one for my SO about 9 months ago and she is also very pleased. For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can do better!</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare for years before it finally died.  Looked around for a replacement &amp; found this one reasonably priced.  I don&#x27;t need all the bells &amp; whistles of the more expensive models.  This one works and does what&#x27;s needed, clean my teeth well.  There were some reviews/complaints about mold leaking under the unit.  I have NOT had that problem yet and I haven&#x27;t done any weekly or monthly maintenance.  I will keep an eye on it though.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush, works great, packaged well, delivered on time. Would buy again</li>
            <li> it works great very powerful it does a great job.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job, but you have to almost take it completely apart and clean it after every use.  I have this as a &amp;#34;time to time&amp;#34; user, while it takes less time to brush and clean the toothbrush with an oral B old fashioned tooth brush. lol</li>
            <li> Great powered toothbrush,  gums are now 100% since using this,  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> My first one quit after 10 years.  I hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> First power toothbrush - works fine I assume.  Only thing is my husband has one - different model and it has turning brush inside the main brush and this model does not.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping works great</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years, wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Searched in vain for this at local stores.  It was the model I wanted and was used to at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Prefer the Pro Model But this is ok</li>
            <li> does not beep at 30 seconds as I thought but otherwise a great brush.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied  with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my wife as a birthday present and she absolutely loves it and I loved the price !!</li>
            <li> as always, Phillips Sonicare is great.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in level of vibration. Not as strong as previous models. Interested to know if they come in different &amp;#34;strengths&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> excellent service. performs as expected. very satisfied</li>
            <li> My other Sonicare had interval pauses so I could give each area the same amount of brushing.  This just goes 2 minutes and off, so the brushing is not as precise.  But it works well.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare. I have used one for at least 20 years and it just died, so I needed a new one. Now my teeth feel really clean again. Hand brushing doesn&#x27;t feel really clean like it does with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  It cleans my teeth better than a traditional toothbrush and charges last a long time.  One thing to note is the toothbrush can get pretty nasty if you don&#x27;t take it apart periodically to clean/wipe off all the gunk that accumulates.</li>
            <li> the job done good. little to big for insight when I brush my paste is coming outside. But my teeth got much much whiter!!!&lt;br /&gt;thanks a lot !!1 I am not sorry for product</li>
            <li> The packaging could have been done a little better and less industrial. Each and every piece came separately.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush -- cleans really well -- but it&#x27;s so loud it actually wakes my son up in the room next to the bathroom. If it were quieter I would give it 5 starts.</li>
            <li> I believe it is doing an excellent job</li>
            <li> got for significant other who had never used an electric toothbrush ... his teeth are much brighter and he says it&#x27;s the best gift I ever gave him!</li>
            <li> This the third Sonicare Essence I have purchased.  I use them until the battery will no longer hold a charge--about 3 years, I guess.  However,  this latest one is an improvement over the previous ones in that the brush oscillations are much more vigorous, with a longer stroke.  This results in improved teeth cleaning in my opinion, although it takes some getting used to and may leave you with sore gums for the first week or so.  Still, I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> Great price and very powerful, only negative was that battery finally died after about 5 years</li>
            <li> Have been using it for more than 6 months now. Good battery life  - runs for about 2 weeks once fully charged. Just make sure to clean all the brush parts properly and regularly.</li>
            <li> Sonic care offers 2 versions of their brush&#x27;s.  This version has a large knob at the bottom of the brush refill which is half of the motor assembly.  the refills are $30.00 each.  I&#x27;ve also got the other version that has just a brush as a refill.  I&#x27;d never purchase this again as the refill will bankrupt me.  Don&#x27;t recommend this model but LOVE SONCICARE</li>
            <li> Had to replace after a bunch of years on the old one. Battery died. Hope this one lasts as long as the other. Price was half the cost of the ones at Walmart</li>
            <li> Great buy, wish I had purchased this sooner.</li>
            <li> Very good!!  Have used this brand for many years with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush.  This was recommended by my dentist and does a much better job than Oral B.</li>
            <li> I had the same toosbrush for 10 years. When it started to let out some greenish liquid at the bottom while standing in its holder I bought a new one on the Internet from an outlet store. When it was also leaking just the same I returned and bought again the same product, now from Amazon trusting it will not be faulty building on my good experience with the company.  Unfortunately it is not the case.</li>
            <li> After my Oral B toothbrush finally gave up, I went back to the old manual brushes for a while. The Oral B was pretty expensive and I didn&#x27;t want to buy another one that I couldn&#x27;t service with new battery in the future. The manual brush really isn&#x27;t as effective though, so I bought the Sonicare unit. WOW! This thing really works! After the first use, my teeth felt  like I&#x27;d just come back from the dentist. I&#x27;ve been so pleased that I&#x27;ve bought one for each member of my family.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement item so it works well and the price was just right after looking on other sites.</li>
            <li> Although this is the older model, I love it. My newer model broke within 6 months. The original older model like this one lasted for 4 yrs. I changed back and this is solid and it works great.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush was awesome, my teeth felt so clean and it is hard to brush properly with a regular toothbrush. The toothbrush did not have to charge for 24 hours before using, it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Gotit fast just as described</li>
            <li> i seriously love how clean my teeth feel after using this tooth brush! I feel like it really gets to the core and cleans my teeth well!</li>
            <li> good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  Very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t like the lack of a 30 second reminder to move areas.  Auto shut off at 2 minutes okay.</li>
            <li> For me this toothbrush feels too abrasive on my gums.  It&#x27;s well made and I have not had any issues with it.  If you want something that really gets after it, this will work but if you want something gentle on the gums check out the Cybersonic.</li>
            <li> works great.  I had an old model that lasted 15 years.  The negative comments about water contaminating the hand unit is no longer an issue.  The tooth brush has a soft &amp;#34;washer&amp;#34; that seals the brush from the motorized unit.  The newer size of the brush is far better than my old head. It is much easier to negotiate around my teeth.  The only downside is that this unit doesn&#x27;t give you a notice every 30 seconds like the old one did.  For the price though ($40) this one couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a completely closed design that makes it impossible for the internals to get wet or dirty. The trade-off of that is that the batteries aren&#x27;t removable, and the charger is more complex than it should be. Though the toothbrush contains 2 AA batteries (glued into the unit), the time to a full charge is more than 24 hours. And unlike other modern electronics, this unit&#x27;s input voltage is not international. That being said, the charger is inductive (no physical connection to the toothbrush) and it&#x27;s very ergonomic. Just pick up the toothbrush, use it, then put it down and it will charge. You will need to get used to counting 30 seconds at a time, since this toothbrush really encourages you not to brush longer than two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, my teeth feel cleaner than they did with my previous toothbrush, which was the entry-level Oral-B Braun. I am happy with this toothbrush, despite the fact that Philips chose beauty over functionality at every point.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I own anything else that is this old and still works. I got it as a gift 14 years ago and thought it was a waste of money because I didn&#x27;t expect it to last more than a year or two.  We now have two and I&#x27;m looking to buy another base because I&#x27;m tired of having to wait for my kids to finish with them. Never had any problems with either one, ever.</li>
            <li> Decent (and cheap) electric toothbrush ruined by awful, potentially harmful brush head design. The screw on dome style heads aren&#x27;t water tight so water drips into the spacious cavity between the head and base, which is a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. Imagine my surprise when I went to replace the head after a couple months of usage and saw BLACK MOLD inside. I doubt anyone who isn&#x27;t an obsessive germ freak is going to unscrew and clean the head and base after every usage. There are plenty of other similarly priced electric brushes (including those made by Sonicare) that don&#x27;t have the problematic dome style head. Promptly threw this in the trash.</li>
            <li> 👏👏👏very happy with it 👍</li>
            <li> Hope my son in law llikes it.  It&#x27;s what he asked for</li>
            <li> I have been using the sensodyne for many years. Before my cleanings&lt;br /&gt;at the dentist averaged 45 minutes. Now it is 20 minutes and my teeth&lt;br /&gt;are doing great</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my husband and it has been a good purchase.  Definitely priced right but he still prefers the old manual.  Glad I started with this one instead of the more pricier one that I own and love.</li>
            <li> From using oral b mechanically driven toothbrushes to this one and it seems like my teeth are a lot cleaner.  They feel a lot cleaner then they were with Oral-b option at the same price point.</li>
            <li> I never used a Sonic toothbrush before... After my first time I was amazed how clean my teeth were. It felt like I just had my Perio Cleaning. It tickles some, but I can get used to that, and you don&#x27;t have to scrub very hard with this toothbrush. It does all the work.</li>
            <li> Works well but miss the beep from my older model when it is time to move to another area of my teeth,</li>
            <li> I felt the difference after a single brush. Solid price and it&#x27;s not as loud as my previous electronic toothbrush. I would certainly recommend this toothbrush, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old one with this and the price was great. My dental costs went down after I first started using this product years ago. Wouldn&#x27;t be without one.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to tell from the description and the photos if this was the same brush I was trying to replace or the model my wife had which is the one I was seeking. The problem with this brush is the replacement head is massive with magnets and not just the simple brush stalk. So the replacement brushes are  more expensive. Also I find that toothpaste and all drips inside the head housing and after a few uses it is an ugly mess. I returned this brush unused and my wife went out and purchased the Philips Sonicare model I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Got it on sale which was great.  It&#x27;s easy to use and charge. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these now, all work great.  Much cheaper to by bulk replacement brushes on amazon comapred to walmart.</li>
            <li> I have been very surprised on this product. My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush so I tried it. After a few brushings my teeth were much shiner. After a couple of weeks, they were also much whiter. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As described, great seller!</li>
            <li> My son was given this for christmas and he says his teeth feel as though the dentist just cleaned them.&lt;br /&gt;he said it took a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this type because it got great reviews,&lt;br /&gt;His Mother</li>
            <li> I have tried mine the other day, and it vibrates so much making it impossible to use .&lt;br /&gt;It splashes water everywhere and as soon as I turn it on the toothpaste flies off !!&lt;br /&gt;It is not comfortable to use because of how loud it is and fast vibration it has.</li>
            <li> I have owned Sonicare electric toothbrushs for several years now with this being my third purchase.  I find the product to be as billed.  It is light in weight yet powerful enough to make me feel I am cleaning my teeth properly.  The only draw back I have experienced with both this model and my previous model was the lack of a 30 second timer...I really missed that feature which was on my first purchase some many years ago.  Over all I a more than satisfied with the product and could recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have owned several  over the years. It does a wonderful  job cleaning. The dentist  offices sell the same one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed. This model seems a bit &amp;#34;low-end&amp;#34; compared to the one I was replacing. The travel pouch is a soft, zippered pouch and does not protect the toothbrush as well as I would have liked. This model does not have various speeds, but does have a timer to ensure proper brushing. It was considerably cheaper than the model I preferred, but I chose the savings over the upgrade.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I should have bought the more expensive one. But then someone posted to go &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; on pressure let brush do the work,that worked. I just use 2 fingers and let the brush do the work, sometime i go over the teeth twice.</li>
            <li> After careful research and heavy deliberation I settled on this brush.  I&#x27;m very glad I did considering how well this brush functions.  I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and I&#x27;m still surprised every time I brush at just how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I find essence very good altho I when purchased thru amazon.com, I thought I requested one with the 30-seconds quad which I am use to having.  So currently I am using a separate timer to brush my teeth,</li>
            <li> I have had several of these over the years.  I love them.  I bought this one for a second home, one of the must have!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and sonicare is the best. They last a long time too. my old one finally bit the dust after about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare e-Series toothbrushes, but they have a flaw for anyone who likes brushing their teeth in the shower.  If they&#x27;re ever dropped, the seams open just enough, almost imperceptibly, to allow enough moisture into the case to kill them.  I&#x27;ve lost two in this way.  Sure, this is mostly my fault and another consequence of my tragically dysfunctional relationship with gravity, but I do wish their interior moisture resistance was a bit more robust.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick. This replaces a 6 yr old Sonicare.  Everyone family member has one!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has had one of these and I got one for my mother about 6months ago.  On their recommendation I decided to get it.  2 days into use and everything seems to be going well. Nothing fancy.  2 minute timer is helpful.  Indicator light seems to be on at all times despite charging for a day (will keep an eye on that)  Seal between brush top and base is not water tight which leads to the rest of my review :  Wanted to point out something  people seem to be missing with regards to the mold build-up Instructions say : &amp;#34;clean the brush at least ONCE PER WEEK, including under the removaleable nut&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;sonicare handle is dishwasher safe&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t see how mold can be building up as much as in the posted pictures unless they&#x27;re just not bothering with the maintenence.  4 stars for now. Will update later once I&#x27;ve had the chance to use it more</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush.  If it tickles your gums too much when you first use it, you can solve this by using an oral irrigator for a while before you use the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and have purchased one for every family member.&lt;br /&gt;This is on a 2 minute timer, and what a clean feeling it leaves.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at least 3x a day, and resulting in every dental cleaning taking less then 15 minutes, no tarter buildup.&lt;br /&gt;Will never switch brands!</li>
            <li> this was to replace my old one which lasted for years. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product but Sonicare</li>
            <li> Amazing! I felt the difference after one use. I&#x27;m hooked! Looking forward to an upgrade over time.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Makes me feel like I have a clean, healthy, just-left-the-dentist mouth.</li>
            <li> works great as advertised</li>
            <li> For $40 this toothbrush is awesome. It&#x27;s waterproof which is nice and I feel like I get a great clean with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my sonicare toothbrush that stopped working (it was the original model from years and years ago.) I had a bunch of brush heads so I didn&#x27;t want to upgrade to the brand new model, so this is a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li> Like the toothbrush, but wish we had the two minute timer on it. We had one previously with the timer but forgot to make sure this one had it. Still like the toothbrush though.</li>
            <li> Was good, but it doesn&#x27;t have the timer on it like his pervious one did.</li>
            <li> works great, have been using one since the late 1980&#x27;s.  the last one just wore out</li>
            <li> Love this.  Bought it to replace one that finally died.  It had lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says...gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Great tool to make sure your teeth are in great shape and clean. Works fast, easy to charge, does not hurt my gums, but does massage those well and reduces irritation and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a super deal on this toothbrush - not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby&#x27;s Sonicare toothbrush was $100 and I thought this was the same but at a great price.  Unfortunately, this one is super loud.  Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> I needed this thing. I drink tons of coffee and wine which stain the heck outta my teeth. This thing is electric and strong. I didn&#x27;t realize how long 2 minutes of brushing is until the timer sets off. It has noticeably turned my teeth back a few shades and with that I&#x27;m more stoked to use it. Easy to use and waterproof. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My mom recommended the Sonicare and I absolutely love it! I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. After use, my mouth feels super clean unlike any manual toothbrush. The charge is absolutely amazing. I went 3 weeks without charging it until it finally died (I brought it on a trip with me and forgot the charger). I do suggest unscrewing it and rinsing off the inside. It gets dirty in there.</li>
            <li> So far it has been great, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Philips Sonicare products! This one I buy every year and it&#x27;s saved my teeth and gums! My dentist is really impressed, as my gum recession has been halted!</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare Elite for 5 years and loved it. The problem with this model is that it does not have the 30 second alert that makes you aware of the time lapsed while brushing each quadrant. It is hit and miss, so I really miss that feature.</li>
            <li> bought for hubby, he loves it.  won&#x27;t brush with a regular toothbrush ever again.  easy to assemble and charge.  easy to use. Price is great too.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s a basic model but it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Seems like it will work well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as other brands I&#x27;ve had and don&#x27;t like the way you change toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any product here on amazon and although I have been a member for a long time I finally had to make a review on this product. First off let me start by adding that this products does what it is supposed to. Many people complain and rate it four stars because it does not beep after 30 seconds or have some kind of quarter minute timer. Secondly this toothbrush changed my life as far as how clean my teeth feel. I have brush for years using a conventional toothbrush and it always felt as if I still had a dirty mouth after cleaning. I have been using the tooth brush twice a day for two weeks now and my teeth have not only gotten noticeable whiter but they feel really clean. I also notice that I also notice that my gum sensitivity is no longer an issue as it cleans them very well and the increased brushing of the Philips sonicare HX5610 essence is a huge difference. I actually share one with my fiance and we just switch the brushes so that we don&#x27;t need to charge two units. It works out great cause we save on power. I notice some people complain about build up inside the brush. The solution to this is after brushing your teeth and rinsing the brush I turn it on again so that the brush shakes off the water and dries quickly. Just my two cents. I definitely recommend this brush especially if you find you have a tough time getting a decent clean or your mouth and breath still feel dirty.</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I was looking for.  My old one had the quad timer.  This one does not and nothing on it at the time I purchased it said it did not.  It works fine otherwise.  I guess at the time I need to move to the other areas when I brush.</li>
            <li> useful and easy to carry.  Little carrying case is nice.  unfortunately the charger is only 110 V.  It should e 110-220 v for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great price and just the best toothbrush I have ever owned. My teeth and gums get so clean with very little work. One tip, when buying replacement heads do not get the generic replacements from CVS or other outlets; those are much louder on the vibration and the head doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well or as comfortably; that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it. The real replacements are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> fantastic toothbrush .. .</li>
            <li> I wore out a previous Sonicare, really Old! Arrived on time. very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my first sonicare product, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to the more expensive models.  Coming from a regular toothbrush though, this thing is quite the upgrade and definitely worth the $40.  My boyfriend and roommates all have this toothbrush now too and everyone loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrelated to the product, but relevant to purchasing this through amazon:  when my toothbrush didn&#x27;t arrive the day following the scheduled delivery date (I have prime, and usually receives my items before the scheduled date), I contacted amazon to see if they had any updated tracking information (mine appeared to be permanently stuck in a transit location), and they went ahead and sent me a replacement with free one day shipping that I received the next day.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  It was an appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month now and am happy.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy that it turns off after 3 minutes so I just wait till that happens and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> works great - always ready to use. lightweight, would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a simple electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Definitely has improved the quality of my teeth! I love that it has a timer. It does get gross if you don&#x27;t clean it very often, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my boyfriend after receiving my own in pink.  We have both been extremely happy.  We have had them a little over 6 months and I can tell a radical difference from using a regular toothbrush, or even cheaper electric toothbrushes.  The Sonicare times your brushing to let you know when you&#x27;re done, and it leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve experienced.  Not only that but they seem to stay clean all day long.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great, but this is our second one, because the battery (NiMH) eventually will not hold a charge for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Great dental check-ups!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has been recommending Sonicare for a while now, and I finally broke down and bought this one.  The price is pretty good for a sonicare, and the power is amazing.  After the first use, I could definitely feel a difference between the clean of this toothbrush and my old spinbrush.  I hope my next dental check-up will show a difference too!&lt;br /&gt;This brush is also portable, the charge holds for a week, so you can take it with you on short trips without having to bring the charger.</li>
            <li> Nice item, works well and holds a charge</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Had to replace my last Sonicare, and this one works just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Item received quickly and as advertised. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just like I went to the dentist every time I use it! Excellent toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I understand that for people who have used more expensive version, this toothbrush did not get good reviews.  I notice it got good reviews from the people who had never had an electric toothbrush.  Since I have not had one before, I took a chance on this &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; toothbrush.  So glad I did.  It works great and I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is very much like the other one we had about four years.  I get very good dental yearly visits. My gums are in very good condition. The new brush does not let the tooth paste get in like the other one did so it is easier to maintain.  I am not sure if the two minute timer is always accurate or maybe i am not paying attention. I do like using this toothbrush andwedidhave a discount coupon.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one one these!</li>
            <li> This sonicare product last longer than the last one I had between recharing.  I used it 2Xs a day, most days and it lasted about a month before I had to rechare it.  Great product.  I rarely have dental problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush for my husband (we are newlyweds) after his dentist recommended it.  I have used one for years.  We purchased the \\&quot;hassle free\\&quot; packaging...don&#x27;t know what that means, exactly, but the product wasn&#x27;t encased in hard-to-get-into plastic.  So, maybe that&#x27;s it.  Also, the this toothbrush comes with the little bag for traveling instead of a hard case like my older model does.  In addition it is quieter than the older models.  These are all bonuses.  I do think that these toothbrushes make a difference; they keep you from brushing too hard and help you to brush for the recommended amount of time (2 minutes, I think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is that they can get kind of gross under the brush head. You have to clean them regularly.  Also, the brush heads are kind of expensive.  DON&#x27;T use the store brand that says it fits these...they don&#x27;t fit well and rattle around.  The brush heads come in two parts: the brush with the magnet on the end and the cap that attaches the brush to the motor/battery case.  This second part doesn&#x27;t wear out very fast and can be reused.  I with Sonicare would have an (cheaper) option just to buy this brush part alone.  Because of this extra expense and in my opinion waste, I docked a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband begrudgingly uses it.  I hope the dentist gives him a gold star during his next visit!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out our other was until I got this one! But the power in this is great.</li>
            <li> I bought it two months ago and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Return window has expired so i dont know what to do.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush but it suddenly stopped working after 10 weeks of use. The brush does not turn on, although the green charging light in front is permanently turn on, which is also unusual. Probably some electric problem. Per Amazon policy, I can&#x27;t return  this item. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This one replaced our 5 year old Sonicare.  Once you rely on an electric toothbrush, it is nearly impossible to go back to manual brushing.... not just because it makes brushing so easy, but because you simply cannot duplicate the cleaning ability or the correct brushing techniques.  My dentist bills prove the Sonicare is worth owning.</li>
            <li> I got mine on sale for $25 love it.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am a major fan.  My latest one was a 4 year old Essence 5000 series and I recently smoked the charger while in Europe (I forgot it was not dual voltage).  Instead of buying a new charger I decided to change to an EasyClean 500 series for the following reasons. The Essence has internal cavities in the brush heads that collect all kinds of nasty stuff. Even though I rinse it after every use, unmentionable things still grow there. It is virtually impossible to clean completely. Every month I would soak it in Clorox but even that did not always completely clean it. Also, this latest Essence model does not have Quadpacer. I consider this absolutely essential to proper use of the toothbrush. For these 2 reasons alone I strongly recommend that anyone considering a Sonicare toothbrush consider the EasyClean or other higher end models offered, even though they are more expensive. You will be much happier and will consider the extra $25 well spent. The EasyClean is the cheapest model that uses Proresults brush heads, which eliminate the problems encountered with the Essence series. Of lesser importance, the Proresults replacement brushes are cheaper and the chargers are dual voltage (100-240V). I gave the Essence 5600 3 stars for the cleanliness problem and the lack of Quadpacer. I would have given it 2 1/2 but that&#x27;s not an option. If you read my review of the Easyclean you will see that I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great and does everything it says it does. Excellent product!! They love sunbathing in them  and look so warm and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush so much! I will never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to the vibration, but it does an amazing job keeping my teeth cleaned. My dentist is much happier.</li>
            <li> So much better than my OralB tooth brush. Great value also. To avoid the nasty mold issue, I take off the brush head and leave the base air dry.</li>
            <li> Love at first site, will not be without again, this is one of life&#x27;s nesecities !and it makes your month feel healthy! Pleased</li>
            <li> RUNNING OUT OF JUICE AFTER 3 MONTHS.</li>
            <li> PERFECTION!!!!!!!!  This is the BEST tooth brush EVER!!!!!!  It makes my mouth feel wonderful and I love it.</li>
            <li> Bzzzzzz. Bzzzzzz. My teeth are now clean. Electric toothbrush &#x3D; clean as they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> Ignore the stars above. It was given as a gift and I didn&#x27;t ask the receiver.  However, this is not the first time he&#x27;s requested the toothbrush, so I assume he&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> I realize that my dentists never actually taught me how to properly brush my teeth.  Maybe nobody can do it right.  When you&#x27;re using this kind of toothbrush, it requires yet another technique.  The timer is a bit too short, should be 1.5x as long.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and the brushes themselves seem improved because although my old ones fit this handle, the new brushes seem to vibrate more giving better cleaning power.</li>
            <li> Great product for a very good price. You don&#x27;t need to spend more for all the useless bells and whistles of the more expensive models. This brush cleans your teeth just a effectively.</li>
            <li> does a really good job!!</li>
            <li> Works great but not as easy to find replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> dont like the product. not even better than a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good toothbrush, but I used to use an Oral B and this head seems a little big for my teeth/mouth. I liked the featured on the Oral B that buzzed every 30 seconds to let you know when to change quadrants when brushing and this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have that feature. Overall pretty good, but when it wears out, I&#x27;m going back to the Oral B.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement of a trusted company.Very happy with  the new model.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly.Came with a convenient travel case.</li>
            <li> I am vey enjoy to use it</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Had an oral B this one is better.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this model does not have the 30 second rotTion. Had I known I would have selected a different model</li>
            <li> Enjoy product very much.  Even though there is no 30 second alert timer like my prior one.  It works just as well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great!  You can&#x27;t wait to brush your teeth again. I never miss a day without brushing twice a day.  My teeth fill cleaner and look whiter.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. This model seems a bit &amp;#34;low-end&amp;#34; compared to the one I was replacing. The included travel pouch is a soft, zippered pouch and does not protect the toothbrush as well as I would have liked. This model does not have various speeds, but does have a timer to ensure proper brushing. It was considerably cheaper than the model I preferred, but I chose the savings over the upgrade.</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like is the noise when you use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The efficiency was unblieveable and it clean your teeth accuratly</li>
            <li> Fully satisfied with the performance, I use it for 2 weeks now and I can say it&#x27;s a few steps forward from the classic toothbrush. And on top of that I only paid 16$ for it!</li>
            <li> Used as primary toothbrush.  Hope that it holds up better than he two sonicare products purchased a number of years ago....where the handles completely fell apart.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these a couple of years ago and never had a problem.  Just bought a second one.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is when the two minutes are up it just stops and you&#x27;re left with this awkward feeling of having a cotton ball of a toothbrush in your mouth while you struggle to turn in back on.  A beep or a quick on/off/on would have been preferred.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he has been asking for a Sonicare toothbrush. I kid you not, he was like a kid on Christmas when he brushed his teeth with this toothbrush. I kept saying how he felt like he had just been to the dentist and he was brushing his teeth for the first time at home. He kept telling me that I needed to get my own as soon as possible. This comes with a charging dock  and a holder for travel purposes.  My only complaint would be that it can be quite loud when in use. However, that is okay with us when it produces these kind of results. I will be purchasing another one for myself very soon.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does not have the 30 second signal like my old one&lt;br /&gt;i have seen it several places for less than i paid</li>
            <li> Wow, this is such an amazing deal.  I love this tooth brush.  Such a great deal.  I highly recommend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My gums have never been healthier since I started using Sonicare a few years ago. This is my second&lt;br /&gt;Brush and it claimed to be an upgrade from the first model and although it works very well there is one&lt;br /&gt;Feature it is missing  and that is after a minute there used to  be a very brief pause then one continue brushing&lt;br /&gt;On a different side, until all areas were brushed equally.</li>
            <li> Works great. Ths was a replacement for my old one that died after five or SX years so I guess I&#x27;m good for awhile</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my son who said it worked great!.  It actually makes brushing more fun, as well as providing more efficient cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a good electric toothbrush. It is powerful and does the job. My biggest pet peeve about this toothbrush is that water gets into compartment where you remove the head of the brush and the base. It is watertight so I don&#x27;t believe it will ruin it, however it gets gross after a while. It is not something you I often look at because I only see it every few months when I change the head. However because of this I would recommend a different sonicare brush. This could just be because I brush my teeth in a &#x27;messy&#x27; way but I will be looking to get a different philips toothbrush soon.</li>
            <li> As promised, works very well. Good value.</li>
            <li> best electric toothbrush I have used yet. it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums, but cleans better than all the others I have tried. love it</li>
            <li> my husband loves it , great purchasse.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  Feels like you just stepped out of the dentist every single time you brush!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> good price christmas present timely delivery looked around for the best price and what i use it for had to get one for my hubby</li>
            <li> As expected.  It works great and has lots of power.  Great price.  I have used it for a month and have no issue with it.  Some customers complained about the cleaning. Respectfully,  not an issue for me.  I got use to cleaning it once a week.  It will take a minute anyway.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting toothbrush. I like it.</li>
            <li> Basic model. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> great product. my 1st one lasted a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;nice little travel bag with this one.&lt;br /&gt;This model is more easy to grip.</li>
            <li> My dentist loves the fact that I am now using a Sonicare.  Hygienist noticed right away.</li>
            <li> Works great my teeth have never felt so clead</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one like it that I have had for a long time but it is wearing out.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Husband loves his present</li>
            <li> The velocity of the vibration is too much for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give as a gift for my girlfriend. I have the same one, I use it for long time. Great product, does much better job compare to old fashion toothbrushes. Great value. I would recommend to anybody. bY the way it was quick shipping as usual by amazon.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare.  Carrying case is handy.</li>
            <li> Will do in a rush. However it does not come close to old skool  brushing.  Like the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> battery holds its charge for two weeks!!! It also compacts nicely by splitting in half so it is easy to travel with...with no charger!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much and I recommend it.  The handle is a bit chunky, but is easy to hold.  The base is easy to keep clean.  I like the carrying case and have used it when traveling - it keeps the the toothbrush clean.  My old Sonicare had the quadri-pace feature, and this one does not.  I miss that feature a little bit, but I have adjusted to it and have no regrets about buying this model.  A very good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> Clean clean clean teeth!!! had one many years ago, bought this one for my sister, and another one for me. (nothing is for ever,) but lasted me 5 years.</li>
            <li> Good price.. Happy teeth.</li>
            <li> I was a bit dismayed at the lineup of Sonicare brushes and having to make a good choice. After digesting 7-8 models, their features, prices, etc, I decided this cheaper unit would surely do the job. The bells and whistles of the higher end models sound great, but I came to the realization that I&#x27;ve been brushing with a good old fashion toothbrush my whole life, and this cheaper unit offers the advantage I&#x27;m looking for. It vibrates and cleans just as good as the units that are 5x as expensive! The modes of the other units (tongue cleaning, gum care, etc) are cool, but the reality is most people won&#x27;t use those features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than my &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;- 2-minute timer makes me more conscious about giving my teeth and gums a good brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It would be nice to have the quadrant timer that pulses every 30 seconds so you know when to move to another section of your mouth. (if this model had the 30 second timer I would have given 5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;- It isn&#x27;t the sexiest looking unit. It&#x27;s a bit larger/bulkier than the newer units, but not as bad as I thought it would be based on photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this: if you&#x27;re in the market for a Sonicare brush, buy this model! If you really love it and later decide you would in fact use the extra features of the more expensive models, then upgrade! The price on this is extremely reasonable, you can keep it as a backup if you upgrade, or pass the handle off to a family member (they can buy their own brush heads).</li>
            <li> the best tooth brush ever ! What a difference in my smile , you can feel the improvement</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush for my husband for Christmas. I ordered it on Dec 16 and it said it would arrive by Dec 21st. Dec 21st came and on Dec 23rd I got an email saying that it was at the local post office (although it was through Fedex) and that it could take up to 2 more business days to be delivered. I wanted my husband to be able to open it on Christmas so I called the post office and had them hold it so I could go pick it up. When my husband opened it on Christmas day we realized that the toothbrush head that is clearly stated in the packaging and online was not included. Dissapointed, I filled out a return on amazon so that we could get a new one. However, the only option is a refund. Okay, fine. Not that I go back on amazon the cost is more than what I originally paid for. I am really disappointed that I have to pay more now for an item that I had already purchased but because of the seller&#x27;s mistake I wasn&#x27;t able to give it to my husband on Christmas. Now if I want to repurchase it I have to pay more for it.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare Tooth Brush works well.  It is efficient and light weight. It really cleans in the spots that are hard to reach.  I also like the gentleness&lt;br /&gt;of the brush so it doesn&#x27;t damage my gums.  It has kept my teeth clean and actually I brush more often since it is so easy.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Worked fine until recently. All of a sudden the toothbrush will hold a charge for more than a few days and the low charge warning feature had always been an issue. Looking to contact Philips for a replacement being that it&#x27;s only 9 months old.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t clear that this model is lacking the pulsing timer, would rather have paid a few bucks more, but wasn&#x27;t clear in description.</li>
            <li> It works but after a month it s tarted to get mold we need to wash it very good, not for the price</li>
            <li> Works great! Having never used an electric toothbrush, this product made my teeth and mouth feel cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted me 8 years.  This one was much cheaper and still works great.  I really cannot live without my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is reasonably priced and comes with the Amazon.com Prime guarantee.  I was hesitant to get on but my dental hygienist recommended this particular electric toothbrush.  I am pleased to spend so little money and so little time twice a day to have a fresh-smelling breath and nice clean teeth and mouth..</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended to me by our orthodontist and dentist. It really does help get teeth cleaner, and the price on Amazon was a good price. With Prime, I got free shipping, so that made the price even better!</li>
            <li> Great product. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best quality for the price! This is my first Sonicare and I think it&#x27;s a great starter! Noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  I absolutely love that it shuts off after 2 minutes of brushing.  The Dentist gave me compliments before I had the chance to tell him I switched from the manual toothbrush to this one.</li>
            <li> This was given as a Christmas gift and the recipient is very pleased. If he&#x27;s pleased, I&#x27;m pleased!  Would recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent product...made my mouth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush, so for me it took some getting used to.  That said, it seems to do a good job.  I haven&#x27;t given the battery life a tough test yet - it&#x27;s been living on the stand so far.  Initial charging took several hours, but since then it seems to recharge quite quickly and has plenty of power.  Brush head has so far stood up well.  Battery/motor unit is sealed  so is easy to rinse clean.  Overall, seems good value for money - it is hard to see what more an expensive model could provide.</li>
            <li> Use it frequently. One of these is too loud, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Recommended by orthodontist.</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare toothbrushes for many, MANY years. I think I&#x27;ve worn out 4 of them :) I love them. They do a great job.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush came recommended for children.  Not so much!  The speed of the brush is WAY TOO fast for a child.  My 5 year old can&#x27;t use it.  It&#x27;s so fast and rough that it hurts her gums.  The toothpaste flies off if you don&#x27;t have it in your mouth before you turn it on.  Definitely not for children under the age of 8 or 9.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sonicare for a long time and I&#x27;ve recently had to retire my old brush. I bought this one and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second alert that my other one had, but it&#x27;s not a major deal.</li>
            <li> My teeth now feel dentist clean all the time! It tickled a bit at first but that&#x27;s easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s the right price, these tooth brushes are awesome.  I can imagine going back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It works great! And for replacement heads, the authentic Phillips brand work the best, with balance and cleaning power. They also seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> Love this product especially when there are coupons for discounts! Always a reliable product, what can I say! :)</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush.  because of the excellent price I bought one and I am very pleased</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, excellent machine and does the job as described.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, good price.</li>
            <li> Unit is as advertised; very similiar to my old Sonicare which ceased to take a charge after about 10 years of daily use.  This one was actually less expensive than the old one. Both take the same :&amp;#34;e&amp;#34; series replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I have always used non-electric tooth brushes. But as I got older I realized&lt;br /&gt;my teeth started to yellow up a bit. After I started using this brush, my teeth started to clear up quite visibly.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to move from a manual brush to an electric brush.</li>
            <li> I travelled with this toothbrush for the Christmas holiday. It didn&#x27;t need a charge for almost 2 weeks. I like the features like cover for brush and good instructions for use. One problem is that water does get inside the toothbrush handle and I think that is because there is not a good seal.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this toothbrush. Long lasting charge and easy to use. Only improvement would be a larger brush head.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty awful.  It&#x27;s difficult to clean, change heads, and the battery life is not exceptional.  Opted to replace it with an Oral-B / Braun model.  Two stars because it did a reasonable job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Bought one for all people on my Xmas list. They were all very happy and say the toothbrush does a great job!</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel extra clean after using this toothbrush...it&#x27;s a must-buy.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush.  It felt like the difference between a dumptruck and a camaro in my mouth!  The only complaint I have is that the brush head broke after only 2 months of use.  The company replaced it for no additional cost.  I hope it lasts longer this time.  I know they should be replaced every 3 or 4 months, but that was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I went looking for a high quality, no-frills electric toothbrush and the Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence turned out to be a great fit. The bottom line is that all electronic toothbrushes are superior to manual brushes, but I wanted to be sure I was getting a good one. The various brushes have pretty minuscule cleaning advantages/disadvantages, but I was able to find an academic article that made me more confident in choosing the Sonicare. Done at Northwestern Dental School, the study says that &amp;#34;Overall, this study demonstrates that long-term use of these two electric toothbrushes improves periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients, and that the Sonicare brush is superior to the Braun [Oral-B] brush in reducing gingival inflammation and probing depth. Moreover, 6 months&#x27; use of Sonicare led to actual improvement in probing attachment levels of periodontal pockets.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s comforting to find academic support of Sonicare&#x27;s superiority, rather than just a bunch of marketing hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Academically supported by dentists&lt;br /&gt;Good build quality--this brush has a weighty feel and a premium rubberized grip.&lt;br /&gt;Two-minute timer--this feature ensures that I&#x27;m brushing for the proper length of time. I wasn&#x27;t into the 30 seconds by 4 quadrant system that Oral-B uses since it seems overly complex.&lt;br /&gt;Eases on the power--the brush is powerful, but it ramps up the speed over your first week to get your gums used to the new movement.&lt;br /&gt;Sleek charging stand&lt;br /&gt;Dishwasher safe--helps combat the mold issue discussed below&lt;br /&gt;Low price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The gunk/mold--this issue is real. I was careful in wiping it down the first week, but I got a little lax after that and quickly had gunk buildup around the brush head and on the charging base. To some extent this issue is universal to all brushes, but a gap where the brush head screws into the handle allows water to be trapped inside and get extra gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately the pros outweigh the cons on this brush. It feels like a big step up in my oral hygiene for only ~$25. A little bit of maintenance to keep the gunk issue at bay and I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush. It even arrived with the battery charged!cons on this brush. It feels like a big step up in my oral hygiene for only ~$25. A little bit of maintenance to keep the gunk issue at bay and I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush. It even arrived with the battery charged!</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the best electric toothbrush.  This one does not beep every 30 seconds to notify you that it is time to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth (and stop doing hamstring stretches on your left leg.) The 30 second timer is called a quadpacer or Quadtimer.  This valuable feature is missing from this particular low end model.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy one of these sooner? Brushing is as close to effortless as it&#x27;s going to get and my teeth feel amazing.</li>
            <li> bigger and noiser than new ones, expected quiter smaller and two heads.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find replaceent heads for this model</li>
            <li> the misses says it is the cat&#x27;s meow.</li>
            <li> I purchased a tooth whitening paste and gel. It came with a toothbrush but I found it to be too hard for my sensitive gums so I tried this toothbrush. Wow..what a difference. Within a week, my gums were back to normal again. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I been using them for the  last 6 years and this one is a 3rd one i buy this one is for my son.</li>
            <li> It is my second one. My dentist loves it too. I have great check ups . I bought this one specifically for travel, since I missed it when I traveled.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is my new favorite thing. It leaves my teeth so smooth and clean, it feels like I just left the dentist. At first I thought it would tickle too much but it really doesn&#x27;t. It does take a minute to get used to the toothbrush doing the work and not you. It has a built in feature that allows you to &amp;#34;get used&amp;#34; to the vibration over the first 12 times you use it. (You can turn this feature off and on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is this model is less expensive than the other models Sonicare offers and it works just as well (from what my friend who has the more expensive one has told me). It also has a timer that shuts off the toothbrush when you hit the recommended 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really would not ever go back to a manual toothbrush after using this. It really is that good.</li>
            <li> I have used the battery powered version of this brush over the past year or two but kept having to replace the batteries.  This brush stays charged for up to two weeks and has more power than the other version.  I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed with the maintainance issues. I did not know that the seals dont hold and that all gunk/water residue will be collected within the brush head. So after a week of use, I was shocked to find mildew inside the brush bottom (rubbery flexible part). There is no way to clean that out, even with a qtip because of metal parts in the way. I&#x27;m totally grossed out by it and not using the brush anymore. I ordered replacement heads and will try rinsing parts evety night to see if that stop gunk collecting. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothrushes for 20 years or so and this is the third one that I have had.  The sonicare is a nice product, holds a charge for several days, and the replacement heads are easy to install.  I have not had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price, these tend to last for years.  Last one I bought died after close to 8 yrs of use!</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth well but just didn&#x27;t last.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve had that stopped working after too short a time.  This one was worse than the first.</li>
            <li> I choose it because if its high ratings and past positive experience with Sonicare, but it doesn&#x27;t work properly as the timer doesn&#x27;t function.  I guess that&#x27;s why it seemed to be such a good on-line bargan - you get what you pay for!!</li>
            <li> Once this product had full charge it had strong brushing ability better than another electric toothbrush I used to have. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out it did not have a feature called Quadpacer! If I had known I would not have bougt it - as I am used to it. Otherwise a good and reliable tooth brush, good size for traveling too.</li>
            <li> Good value on this basic, no bells and whistles model. I always brush longer than needed because I love how Sonicare makes my mouth feel, so don&#x27;t need timers, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electrical toothbrushes, but the Philips Sonicare is hands down the best you can get for the money. My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentist cleaning every time!</li>
            <li> Although this one works the same as the last Sonicare I had, it is much thicker in size.  I prefer the thinner one.Seems like it works the same.</li>
            <li> pretty powerful, works well</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended to me by my pervious dentist. To tell you the truth, I hated using it. I have always been using the Oral B toothbrush before going to the dentist who recommended this toothbrush. I was a heavy soda drinker &amp; I loved sweets (I had a lot of cavities). The first time I went to this dentist, he suggested I switch from Oral B to this Sonicare Electric toothbrush, so I did. I have a severe gag reflex &amp; every time I used this toothbrush I felt like I was going to be sick.  The brush head was too big &amp; every time I tried to brush in the back, I would always gag &amp; I didn&#x27;t feel like brushing my teeth anymore, which lead to Gingivitis. The brush head was so big &amp; felt harsh to me. I prefer the smaller heads.  I finally got tired of the whole experience &amp; went back to the Oral B Electric toothbrush which worked out better. I just changed toothpaste &amp; everything was fine. The Oral B toothbrush is very comfortable &amp; it is not harsh.  I cut out the soda &amp; sweets &amp; I haven&#x27;t had a problem ever since.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush if you have a serious gag reflex. This toothbrush might be great for a lot of people, but it wasn&#x27;t the right toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy and with a vision problem it&#x27;s more difficult to take apart to clean and re-assemble.  Time will tell if cleaning efficiency is good.</li>
            <li> no more excuses for poor brushing...must brush until timer runs out!</li>
            <li> I have the diamond model but bought this for my gf because she was just transitioning to this from normal toothbrush. This really is the same as any of the models. It will get the job done for a great price.</li>
            <li> Sonicare cleans the teeth exceedingly well.  This is my second Sonicare toothbrush and won&#x27;t be my last. Well done, Sonicare!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s  teeth ate 75% whiter  I would recomend this  tooth brush to all. It is worth the price! Ecellent</li>
            <li> Everything is nice with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it basically because of the price and the other good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good, and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small head. Ill probably buy some bigger separate ones though</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my father for Christmas.  He loves it!  He really wanted a sonic toothbrush.  In doing the research, I found that these types of toothbrushes can be over $200 to purchase.  I decided on this brush based on the price and the reviews.  I was worried that it might be too cheap and breakdown, however, that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.  It was the perfect gift.  According to my dad, it has never been easier to clean his teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great just what I expected</li>
            <li> Good replacement product.</li>
            <li> Gunk still builds up.</li>
            <li> Great product, so I bought another.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and ease of use. Holds a charge well and easy to maintain. Great buy! I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Has been working well for about a year without any issues. At first I did not use it consistently, but now I use it almost every day. I like that it is timed so that I know I have cleaned my teeth for a good amount of time. I am not sure this cleans better than a regular toothbrush however, and have heard mixed reviews from different dentists...I tend to be very thorough with a regular toothbrush and after using this consistently have still felt some plaque on the backs of my front and back teeth..perhaps I am not focusing well enough on these areas.&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is supposed to clean in between teeth and be more gentle on gums, and use it mostly for these reasons.</li>
            <li> Great brush good price. Compared with store price much better. Love idea of warrenty as have had two other brand electric toothbrushes die.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years. All the dental hygienists who&#x27;ve worked on my teeth say it&#x27;s the way to go. You don&#x27;t need bells and whistles. This one is just fine.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended getting a Sonicare, but they are much more costly than manual toothbrushes and I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought a cheap, battery operated electric toothbrush at a local store.  I liked the feel of it, but after only a couple of months, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore.  I thought it was just dead batteries at first, so I replaced them.  Nothing.  Another set of fresh batteries.  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this lower-end Sonicare.  I don&#x27;t really need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive ones.  And I LOVE the way this one works.  It took some getting used to, and I hit my teeth with the hard part of the brush when I first tried, but it didn&#x27;t take long to adapt.  Also, it has a lower setting for the first several times of use, allowing someone new to this type of brush to get used to it.  My teeth and mouth feel so clean after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to beep twice when it is in the lower speed mode, and once in the higher.  Mine, after fully charged according to the light on the charger, didn&#x27;t beep at all.  I called customer service, and they said I needed to put the brush in the charger to see if it beeped.  That worked, but since then, I can&#x27;t get it to beep at all.  Not a big deal, but still, not working quite as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this rechargeable one instead of the battery operated lower-end model because, with my cheap electric toothbrush I got first, I didn&#x27;t like the feel when the batteries start losing power.  Instead of just stopping, the brush just slowed and got less effective.  I assumed that this would do the same but I don&#x27;t know that for a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the replacement heads were not so expensive, but I found that they are pretty expensive for any of the better electric toothbrushes, so this one is not out of line with those.  I&#x27;m willing to spend the extra money for the improvement in brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush works so much better then our old one I wish I would have purchased long ago. It cleans our teeth much beter. I did have to purchase a second head for my wife.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Product delivered was the same one that was advertised.  Delivery was prompt.  No sense spending the extra money for the upgraded electric toothbrushes, this one works great AND has built in timer.</li>
            <li> Harbors mold.  Hard to clean.  Other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product with a great price!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because we love sonicare and suddenly stopped to work. After 5 months of use, terrible, supposed to be new. I will totally buy Sonicare again but not from this company again!!!! I have a sonicare for over 5 years and no problems at all. I will not buy again this online.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price - glad we did our homework!</li>
            <li> Works great, I just wish that the head was a little bit larger.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sure that Sonicare is probably the best or least best know electric toothbrush out there and I&#x27;ve had to previous toothbrushes but I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a 30sec timer like my previous ones but still shuts off after 2 mins. But to be fair, I paid less for it than my previous ones. I also which that the toothpaste and stuff didn&#x27;t get between the cracks but it&#x27;s easy to clean. Good toothbrush over all for thoughts on a budget or first time user.</li>
            <li> Beware of this product! I have had this toothbrush for only 5 months and it began to smell like it was burning. I unscrewed the brush and found where water had been leaking inside of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My family uses this one. We love it and get good check ups since we have been using it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it but nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Live this electric toothbrush it does the job with perfection. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> does a better job than Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;Only five stars, because of price (should provide another hand set)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and I can feel my teeth are healthier because I made the switch to an electronic toothbrush. Love the fact that it is timed and will turn off after a minute of deep teeth cleaning. I would maybe have gotten one that was also a circular, spinning brush in hindsight but that doesn&#x27;t diminish from what this machine does.</li>
            <li> love it, bought another for downstairs bath</li>
            <li> Ever since i purchased my 1st sonicare toothbrush, no other brand will do, really love the product. The only issue that I have is that it is extremely loud.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as advertised and works great. Great price. This product was bought as a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Had to replace an older model, this performs as well as the old one did.</li>
            <li> It looks well made and works perfectly, it cleans teeth really well and much faster hand brush. Charging when place on charging base without a cord. It includes carrying bag for travel.</li>
            <li> Since using these Sonicare brushes I have had no issues at dentist. Basic Essence model gets the job done without bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Powerful with a kick. Does the job well. Will not be disappointed. Will see the difference soon after using. It</li>
            <li> Now I have to hope my dental hygienist likes it as much as I do when I get my teeth cleaned in a few months.</li>
            <li> Bought this right after my insurance rates went up dramatically and had to drop my dental coverage. (I now floss every night and use  fluoride mouthwash too)  It is such a big improvement over regular toothbrushes. You can tell it cleans very well and you know how long to brush because it has an automatic timer. I recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve had a sonicare, you&#x27;ll never feel like your teeth are clean without it.</li>
            <li> This product is a consumables profit play.  The replacement brushes start to show wear in a week.  They are completely done in 3 weeks.  The cost of replacement brushes in bulk at Costco is about $6.50 each.  Think about it.  You spend $49 on the vibrator, battery and charger, but the real payoff for Phillips is the replacement brush.  Fusion razor blade replacements, HP ink jet cartridges, and Sonicare replacement brush heads.  This is where these companies make money.  They design the consumables that wear out instantly, and gouge you on replacement cost.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works well, but didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t have the 30 second &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; to let me know that each quadrant of mouth was done. It just shuts off after 2 min. fMy old one had the 30 second beep feature and I liked that.</li>
            <li> This is the third Philips Sonicare I have owned.  I would not be without one.  Dentist notices the difference at our checkups when we use this toothbrush.  The online prices is also great compared to even Sam&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it is convenient to use, the battery is good and can used for a month with out charging( I use it twice a day).</li>
            <li> Toothbrush runs for two minutes, without interval beeps.  We&#x27;ve had three previous versions of this toothbrush that all beeped every 30 seconds.  Wish that is was easier to understand what we&#x27;re buying from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had a Philips Sonicare Elite toothbrush for ten years. Loved it! Except for the nasty gunk that collects in the base of the toothbrush. As others have noted, the seal isn&#x27;t tight. (Come on guys!) I order this brush as a replacement, but was disappointed to find that it does not have the 30 second timer alerting you to shift to a different quadrant of your mouth. Wish that was stated clearly on the product info! The only thing I could find was that it was available on some products.</li>
            <li> It has been not enough time to really give it a good test drive, but so far its seams great. The time the battery stays charged is very impressive.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was new in the box as described.  I received the order very promptly.  Overall this was a  very good value.</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush.  It has been great for us and our kids. Just make sure you realize that they updated the shape, so you need the new charger to go with this base.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush.  It does a great job and makes my teeth feel like they do after a cleaning at the dentist.  I love the way it shuts itself off after two minutes too.  With this feature there is no more guessing how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  It is easy to clean and the carrying case is a perfect size for packing and taking on trips.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one. The only downside to this particular model is that it does not have the 30 second timer that lets you know how long to brush each of the 4 sections of your teeth. Happily, I had used my last Sonicare long enough to have my own timer internally now. Otherwise, great product, well worth the money for a toothbrush. Better dentist visits since I started using this brand.</li>
            <li> i have had sevral other sonicare tooth brushes and my one i had before this one i lost so i had to drder a new one and this this is amazing it always leaves your teeth feeling cleen and like you just left the dentist every time your teeth. also on a side note last time i went to the dentist he asked me how often i floss (i never do) and i told him and he said just to keep doing what im doing because it looks like i floss daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years, and I think they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this one as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No quadpacer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea I had to check for the presence of this feature. Particularly because it can&#x27;t possibly cost Phillips a penny to include it - they are are doing it arbitrarily to create an upmodel where none need exist. They already have the timer circuit in place - it runs for two minutes to clock your total brush time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fault, I didn&#x27;t do my research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this brush as one star, because I shouldn&#x27;t HAVE TO DO RESEARCH TO BUY A FREAKING TOOTHBRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mark.</li>
            <li> I RECCOMEND TO ANYONE WHO HASNT TRIED THIS TOOTHBRUSH TO TRY IT. IT DECREASE MY PLAQUE AS PROMISED IN ONE YEAR BY 70 PERCENT AS PROMISED. THIS IS THE SECOND ONE IVE OWNED</li>
            <li> i love my new sonicare. feels like i just left the dentist office every time i brush. worth every dime!</li>
            <li> works great  cleans my teeth hundreds of times better than a regular tooth brush- a little hard to clean though</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare brush. It looked like my first one but instead of having a gauge to check the battery it just has a blinking light on the on/off switch. Not particularly a bad feature but no warning as you approach the day it shuts off.</li>
            <li> GREAT THIS IS FOR MY GRAND SON FOR CHRISTMAS  THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING HE WILL  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Our old one broke after many years.  Great device and works well with the brushes.  I would have bought a newer model but we had the old brushes.</li>
            <li> If you want your teeth and gums to feel super clean then this is the toothbrush for you to try.  I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare products for years and when my old toothbrush died on me, I bought this one to replace it.  It&#x27;s a little different in appearance and feel than my old one, but it still seems to do the same great job!</li>
            <li> After going to the dentist, and being told I should start using an electric toothbrush for the millionth time. I decided to not buy the one for $200, which after all seems a little overpriced considering it is all made of cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$20 is the real price, and for that, this baby works well.</li>
            <li> Love this product. After I bought one for myself, I bought one for every on in the family for Christmas. Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth much better than my old toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have ever bought for myself - it has so improved my gums &amp; teeth - I wish I had bought one a long time ago - I had no idea they were so great!</li>
            <li> Best electric toothbrush I ever owned. Cleans well, battery lasts long and I love the charging mechanism. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for many years but recently bought this model with charger and carry case. I&#x27;m totally satisfied. It works just great like all Sonicare products.  Be patient when you first charge the unit. It could take up to 2 days for a complete charge, I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works well. Next time I will research one or two models above this to get the timer function my old one had.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> the zipper on the travel bag is not working at all. Even though it&#x27;s just an extra gift item in the package, a broken-zipper-bag ruined my satisfaction of the product before I even started using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Really like this toothbrush, ordered it after the battery of my first Philips Sonicare stopped working after I had it quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I reordered another sonicare to replace my old model which lasted me 20 years.  These are great; my dentist recommended it to me to control my gingivitis and it has worked all these years to maintain my dental care.  I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Love my new Sonicare!  Works perfectly and love the rechargeable feature, no more batteries to buy. just plug in in :)</li>
            <li> Works as expected. have used these for many years.  Would upgrade to the newer model but already have replacement heads</li>
            <li> I am impressed and happy with my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush. Does a great job. Easy to use. 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works just as well as my previous one.  Doesn&#x27;t have all bells and whistles.. Just simple and does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had luck with this product on two fronts.  The first one I owned had a battery issue where after several weeks it would not turn on as if it had a short.  The second one took me more than a year to order hoping the experience would be better except this time I noticed that water gets in the compartment where the brush head screws on and off and spawns mold.  There is no good way to get the mold out of this compartment, nor do I think that it should be a normal step to have to do as a consumer.  I would not recommend this model.</li>
            <li> It is quite functional, however it is heavy and more difficult to manipulate than my previous electric brush</li>
            <li> great price and fast shipping.  love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if charged. Stopped working after a very short period of tlme which is why I purchased the elite 9500</li>
            <li> The reviews are all wrong on this product. It is very noisy and does not clean well. I will be returning the product.</li>
            <li> Good price and cleans well.</li>
            <li> The brush works well. The only regret that I have is that I am just now purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a couple of months and it start buzzing weirdly every time I use it, like the head it&#x27;s loose or something but nothing I tried could repair the sound. Other than that, it&#x27;s an ok brush,  had better,  had worse. .. does what it&#x27;s supposed to,  cleans your teeth.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this model Sonicare, not all the bells and whistles of the $200 ones in the Phillips line, but it does the job.  I recently had to put my first one to rest after more than a decade.  Glad to catch the deal on this one.  Getting one for my 4 year old.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old Philips Sonicare toothbrush and I am sold on Sonicare because they last a long time and really do a good job of cleaning my teeth and exercising my gums, which is all-important for great dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> My kids seem to really like these toothbrushes and they are the reason I made the purchase, so they would brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Switched to this from a conventional toothbrush, my youngest has not had a cavity since.Does a thorough job cleaning with minimal effort. The whole family now uses these. I buy generic replacement heads at a lower price and they work and fit fine.</li>
            <li> This is the first Philips sonicare I purchase and I love it. I found the refills at walmart, they were a bit pricy but well worth it. You do have to unscrew it and clean it out at leat once a week or it will get ugly. I travel a lot and I have never had to carry the charger. I charge it once a week and it lasts the entire week.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that this toothbrush has a small head.  It will also hold a charge for two weeks of brushing two times a day making it a convenient travel toothbrush.  I wish, however, that it had the incremental buzz to signify each 30 second mark like other models have.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use - I like the travel case.  What more is there to say.  It works - would recomend</li>
            <li> Good package. Not hard to open. Easy to use, easy to handle, easy to clean. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied, hope my dentist is on my next visit.  She recommended this over the Braun electric brush.</li>
            <li> I know, everybody says their toothbrush/toothpaste/gum is &amp;#34;dentist recommended,&amp;#34; but I actually had a conversation with my dentist about the merits of the Sonicare vs. Oral-B electric toothbrushes, and my dentist recommended the Sonicare. Compared to the Oral-B, the Sonicare is a much better toothbrush, and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> good value for the price</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush!</li>
            <li> My dentist appt should go much smoothly this time. Love the product and use it everyday sometimes 3 times  a day.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to brushing my teeth!  They feel sooooo clean afterwards - unlike the Oral B I used to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare toothbrush for about 9 years, I&#x27;ve always believed that my consistent use has prevented a lot of cavities--especially since I&#x27;m a pretty poor flosser. I&#x27;ve never had a crown or root canal, only fillings here or there. My first Sonicare lasted for about 8 years, it was a champ. It eventually just wouldn&#x27;t turn on one day but it served me well for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this new one and have been using it for a couple weeks. It&#x27;s pretty much the same but the buzzing noise it makes is a little louder than my first Sonicare, It also feels a little &amp;#34;looser,&amp;#34; not as tight by way of how the parts are holding together. I&#x27;m hoping it goes as long as my first, we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;ve got a 2.5 year warranty on the thing so I&#x27;m not too worried if this one has any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on mine and my husband&#x27;s long-time use of these toothbrushes, we highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to the feel of this toothbrush, but you can feel the difference. Your teeth will feel much cleaner than a regular spin brush.  Only drawback is that if you even slightly open your mouth, spray will go everywhere.  My son is having a hard time with this concept!  Or is he...</li>
            <li> I bought similar one a few years ago (I can&#x27;t remember for how long). It dead this month. So, I bought this one, hope it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush in the world I want to see my hygienist and she couldn&#x27;t believe how to clean my teeth work we do business with the seller again thank you</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare. It works extremely well. I use this one mainly when I travel. It comes with a carrying case. Love it!</li>
            <li> Took some time to get use from it, generally sprayed the mirrors for the first several weeks but have it somewhat down pat now, eventually I will learn how to wipe it off properly so as not to have it stick to the charger, but that&#x27;s for another day</li>
            <li> I have used other electric toothbruses in the past, but not of htis sonic variety.  Wow, at first it is a shocking feeling.  Definitely cleans my mouth the best of any brush I have ever had, and the price is not bad at all.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes and until I found this deal I felt the Sonicare brand was too expensive. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Just replaced my old Phillips with this one and it&#x27;s great, everything i wanted in a electric toothbrush. I highly recommend, also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love love love this toothbrush. It does a fantastic job cleaning and my gums feel better too. I love the timer so you know when you have brushed for 2 minutes. I will be traveling this weekend and glad to take it with me!</li>
            <li> This unit worked well for about 6 months.  Then it decided to take a dump and stop working.  Won&#x27;t take a charge, won&#x27;t run.  I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush works great, is my second Sonicare and can&#x27;t go anywhere over night without it.</li>
            <li> I like this item but I hope brushing each side of the teeth is with every 30 seconds timer . The timer given is only 2 minutes for brushing all teeth. My bf has a toothbrush like this but has a timer to brush on each side of the teeth and that is the one that I like. Anyway I am using the brush already and also got 3 for my children that sent in the Philippines. I just got frustrated to have no 30 seconds timer as I said before.</li>
            <li> Still a great dental machine. My older one finally gave up but this one looks like the real deal again.</li>
            <li> Tickled my gums a little at first, but that went away very quickly. This was recommended by a friend. I owe him one. Glad I took his advice. This has a self timer that shuts off after two minutes. That&#x27;s a good brushing time. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for almost a year I believe and it&#x27;s one of the best!</li>
            <li> Awesome, what most people should use. Though finding replacing heads is difficult unless you go for generics</li>
            <li> Loyal Sonicare lover here.  The prices have dropped over the years and this one had the rubber grips on it that my last one lacked, so nice bonus for seemingly the same price point.  I hate when I have to resort back to a regular toothbrush.  Addicted.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for 2 years and at various times, it has produced a high-pitched very loud whine as I brush, and lately it occurred to me that this could possibly damage my hearing.  I&#x27;ve tried thoroughly cleaning all the threads, screwing down as tightly as possible.  Nothing helps.  I replaced the brush head a few weeks ago, but still have the problem.  Ear plugs just seem to make the experience more intense and compacted.  I&#x27;m going to go back to using a manual toothbrush while I consider other options.  Maybe a battery operated toothbrush.  I have one with a round head for travel and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> This is my second electric tooth brush and the essence 5600 is ok but I think I would rather have the elite because of the smaller handle. Other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> use for two months, nothing happen, but it is really convince for brushing, great for lazy person who are so lazy to moving the brush!</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush works great had it before my old one after more than 10 years would not charge anymore ok</li>
            <li> Much better brushing action than I could ever do with a manual toothbrush...do miss the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; in this model, when it&#x27;s time to switch to another section of teeth during brushing. Over all very effective brushing.</li>
            <li> Love this Sonicare, use it twice a day and a much better price than in the store!</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power and vibration.  Get the teeth and gums super clean with ease.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li> Cannot charge after less than 3 months...</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I have a permanent retainer on my lower teeth and this has kept 100% of the plaque out of that hard-to-floss area. I&#x27;m sure all of the dentists out there would scoff at my not flossing, but with this toothbrush, it&#x27;s just not necessary. The only reason for the 4 stars is that the replacement heads are super expensive compared to other brands/models. I was, however, fortunate to find a highly rated generic brand of replacement heads that work perfectly - Sonimart.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected. Loved the last one- love this one.</li>
            <li> very wasteful design! The whole cap needs to be replaced</li>
            <li> Comparable to others I&#x27;ve spent two to three times the money on! You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare to replace the previous that I had used for over two years. It uses the same brush heads as the old one. Does a nice job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable,powerfull,affordable and works very well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works wonderfully. My boyfriend loves it! It was definitely worth what I paid for it. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Do you like your teeth squeeky clean? Then this is a must have!! I have used this now for several months and my teeth are much cleaner feeling and longer lasting freshness than using a typical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> What a great price for a Sonicare.  We use one in our home and I bought this one for our Motor Home.  I works great!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Sonicare. I still go to the dentist every 6 months for a cleaning, and for years there has been nothing really to clean. Maybe some staining from my love of coffee but no plaque. I had gum disease, and large pockets before... Not any more.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I dont like about this sonicare is that it does not have the beeps to let you know you have worked on that section 30 seconds. It only has the 2 min timer, my last sonicare did have a beep in 30 second intervals x4.</li>
            <li> Had I known how great my teeth would feel after using this electric toothbrush I would have switched years ago.</li>
            <li> Each time I use this toothbrush my teeth feel like I have just let the dentist office. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t beep at 30 seconds intervals, so you have to determine how long to spend on the four quadrants of teeth during the two minutes.  However, I would still recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare tooth brushes since 1996 and have only gone through 3, I purchased this one for a very reasonable price and the quality is great.  I really miss the beeps quarterly to show that you should move to another section.  Other than that it is great.  I also like the travel bag that came with it this is the first one of these I have received.  I was also happy to be able to extent the warranty.</li>
            <li> I have many crowns, bridges and a couple of implants so I need a brush that works in conjunction with my waterpik and flossing. This toothbrush fulfills all my needs . I don&#x27;t need any reminder beeps or any other bells and whistles so I opted for the least expensive model.. Others have complained about this toothbrush not holding a charge but I have not had that problem. I have taken this on a few trips both with and with out the charger and it has performed fine. The trips were no longer than 3 days however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to anyone who wants a good basic Sonicare toothbrush who doesn&#x27;t need any of the features offered in the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have now been using this toothbrush for 4 months and am extremely happy with it. I bought this model after retiring a more deluxe version of a Sonicare toothbrush that I had been using for over 10 years. The old toothbrush would no longer hold a charge..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Its now May 4, 2014 and the toothbrush has travelled with me on a number of business trips. It continues to perform very well and holds a charge just as well as it did when I first bought it. I am still very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips toothbrush. The battery of the first one was broken some time ago. The new one is so far so good after one month.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. But like other reviews stated there is a lot of nasty gunk that gets inside. You have to clean it out at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It really cleans your teeth well. The first time I used it, I was amazed at how different my teeth felt. It is a good price and good quality electric toothbrush. It is quite powerful and can make a bit of a mess on your mirror until u learn to control it lol!</li>
            <li> Wow. This toothbrush is a dental epiphany for me! I never understood what the big deal was with &#x27;sonic&#x27; toothbrushes, but NOW I get it. Totally different from a regular electric toothbrush. My teeth have never felt so clean and this feels so wonderful on my gums that I have no problem brushing for the recommended 2 minutes. Time will tell, but so far I&#x27;m completely thrilled. I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual or even my previous Oral-B. This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve ever written a review on a product I&#x27;ve purchased. If you&#x27;re wanting to step up your dental care routine, my advice is get this asap.</li>
            <li> You have to clean the brush daily! Take the head apart and wash/rinse every crevice and let dry before putting it back together. Mold (thick black mold) will grow within the head. If you are not one who likes to clean then hope your spouse does or stay away.</li>
            <li> there is no other way to clean your teeth. fresh and convenient</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, can last for weeks without recharging. Also it can lasts severa months without having to buy a new brush head.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it feels to use this toothbrush, and my teeth feel great after I do!  My dentist recommended it, saying it&#x27;s gentler on the gums, and it really is.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good so far the brush seems a little hard</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I expected and did not disappoint.  More words required? Why? I am happy with the product isn&#x27;t that enough</li>
            <li> Love it. Really makes&lt;br /&gt;Your mouth feel&lt;br /&gt;Fresh great product would recommend it over and over and over again thanks</li>
            <li> Compared to a regular toothbrush, this electric brush by Sonicare is exceptional and for the price its well worth it for keeping teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this and highly recommend picking this up if you are on the fence. The only thing is the replacement brushes can be a bit expensive. Don&#x27;t bother with the off brand replacements as they don&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says it does.</li>
            <li> I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t be the right ones for my older sonicare, but they fit and work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had the Sonicare Intelliclean System brush a while ago, but it became more and more difficult to find the toothpaste refills, so I switched back to my manual toothbrush. I stumbled upon this while browsing Amazon one day, and decided to give it a try. My teeth have never felt cleaner! This is the best toothbrush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> no need to look further as this one does it all..&lt;br /&gt;I am just now retiring my old one that is still working after five years of use.&lt;br /&gt;the battery in my old one was getting weak and not holding a charge very long..&lt;br /&gt;so i ordered my new one and could not be happier with it..</li>
            <li> Easy to use! My teeth feel so clean every day. Only thing I didn&#x27;t realize is that it doesn&#x27;t give 30 second signals before the 2 minutes are up like some other models.</li>
            <li> IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN OLDER MODEL - AND IT CHARGED UP OVER NIGHT AND IT SEEMS TO BE IN FINE WORKING ORDER &#x3D; WHY I WENT BACK.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush.  It has a small, powerful brush head - your teeth really feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Perfect clean feeling, however the toothpaste and saliva tend to cake about the power button where the brush-head attaches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an abuser of my toothbrush, I actually take great care of it.  follow the directions for cleaning and everything.  but twice now it has stopped working.  then about a month later starts working again randomly.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it or anything.  When it works love it, but this intermittent working is annoying.</li>
            <li> this my second one,  the first one lasted for 10 years,  what could be better?????????????  it would recommended this product highly.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare for years...best toothbrush for teeth and GUMS...this is definitely worth the price...a must have! Easy to pack for trips and charge lasts about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> My son wanted this as a gift for Christmas so I decided to buy him this one.  It was highly rated and the reviews were quite good.  My son loves this toothbrush and wished he had asked for one sooner!</li>
            <li> We got this product for Christmas 2 years ago and this year we gave it to my in-laws. They love it!</li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference compared to conventional ways of brushing your teeth,  feels great on your gums and cheeks :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you expect, it works well, is easy to use, easy to clean. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for years, recently had to replace it cause a new puppy decided to use it as a chew toy. The puppy got a new kennel and I got a new one of these, a very good electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning the teeth, and the fact that a charge lasts up to two weeks makes it practical for travel. It even comes with a small carrying bag. My previous one also beeped every 30 seconds so the full two minute cycle was evenly divided:: lower inside, lower outside, upper inside, upper outside. There was no indication that this model doesn&#x27;t have that feature, which I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this toothbrush. Holds a charge like no other! Cleans my teeth like a dream!</li>
            <li> Have been using Sonicare electronic brushes for several years. They&#x27;re great! Was having to have 4 cleanings a year. The Sonicare brush has cut that down to the normal 2 times a year. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get it to go into gentle mode/ too intense for me, waste of money, it&#x27;s sitting in the cabinet unused.</li>
            <li> i love the travel case. i down graded from the more expensive model that i had for 3 1/2 year....i can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Sonicare previously and it lasted for 10 years before the battery weakened substantially.  Of course you need to replace the heads which can be bought at Walmart.  I think these toothbrushes really make your mouth feel clean.  Invest in one!</li>
            <li> great quality product.  As advertised, fast shipping, VERY pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have braces and I have been looking for a electronic toothbrush that will keep my teeth and braces clean. It does the job and my mouth always feels refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Good value.  After use, remnants of toothpaste collects in the base and onto the bathroom counter.  Other toothbrushes have had the same problem.  Maybe someone will fix it sometime.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is very basic, doesn&#x27;t give you 30 second beep but it does the job and is a great price.  It is bigger and a bit bulkier than the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I caved in after reading reviews of this product on REDDIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And wow. The praise for the Sonicare is beyond true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am clean.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened. It was fine one day and the next day it started vibrating so fast and so hard it literally hurt my mouth. Amazon has a very conservative return policy, so I am SOOO glad I did not buy a more expensive product. I would never buy another unless it was from a store where I  could return it if this happened again.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even use it now. Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone,&lt;br /&gt;I was certainly not lucky. I bought the toothbrush on June 10th and let me tell you I did not use everyday and today is August 7th and it does not work at all. I am returning it this week, not the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> My wife and I had one last 3 years, and for the cost/$30.00 I got another. Don&#x27;t forget to floss.</li>
            <li> It was such a great deal we bought 2. So far they work great!! We love that they came with the travel case too.</li>
            <li> it was wonderful, I bought 2 and one was a gift to a good friend. I may buy another one someday.</li>
            <li> I used this toothbrush twice a day and it worked great until it just quit working a few days ago.  I tried letting the battery die completely, but it will not turn on.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> A good product but water builds up inside and turns black. Need to take off the head and do the best you can cleaning up the black mold inside. Must be a better way to make it waterproof</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, my teeth get so clean it&#x27;s like getting a cleaning from the dentist. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing and was very impressed with the honesty. I did not want to spend a lot of money on an electric toothbrush, but my hygienist suggested that I get one. So I immediately got online with Amazon.  The Phillips is a great brand name. The packaging is just as described. The toothbrush works exactly as described.  It allows me to brush my teeth for 2 minutes. It is easy to clean and store.  It was a great price and an awesome product.</li>
            <li> great have been using them for the longest time</li>
            <li> Great product and very good price.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly like the one it is replacing.  Even my dentist said, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t bother with all the fancy add-ons; get the most basic model,&amp;#34;  so I did.  The product came with a warranty (if you sign up online) as well as the charger, the brush, etc.  If this one lasts as long as my other one did (six years), I&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand toothbrush for many years, replacing it about every 3 years.  I decided to purchase one online and I am very happy with the quality and the price.  I purchased a 6 pack of replacement heads as the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a toothbrush it works ok. it does what it was made to do. delivered in record time.</li>
            <li> INo user manual. as a computer experience person. this tablet  is so unintuitive that I was looking for the user manual. only info I can find from the included booklet, it that its gsm is only compatible for chinatelecom. unfortunately thechild that inintend to give this to does not live in china. so  have to return the product and try to search for a more suitable one.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift no complaints</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. Thought it came in a simple package and not in the original package, it&#x27;s good for use. Doctor recommended it so bought it. It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> So far so good.  First electric toothbrush and it really was impressively clean at first brush</li>
            <li> After many years of use, my original P.S. quit on me. I was thrilled to find the same on this site, at a much more reasonable price than the local stores.  In the interim, I felt my teeth were never really clean with a manual brush. I recommend the Philips Sonicare for everyone - especially kids  at college and away- from- home trips. IF I ever see a dentist, he/she tells me I am doing something right, because my gums and teeth are healthy and  look great!! Thanks P.E.</li>
            <li> The best.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product the speed on it is very rough on your teeth making the gums very sensitive. It&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t return the item</li>
            <li> Good value for the money and as with all Sonicare products lasts a long time.  best Sonicare value out there.</li>
            <li> I made a good choice and the product arrived promptly and well. My hygienist will be delighted that I am using this twice a day.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Works much better than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My husband got one for Christmas, and I tried it for about a week with the additional head that came with his system. I fell in love and HAD to get my own. I know his mom paid about $80 for his, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I found such a great deal on the exact same model on Amazon. It works perfectly, and better than any dental hygiene product I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I&#x27;ll never use a manual toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  I can take it on vacation for a week without the charger.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the Philips Sonicare.  I had a Philips Sonicare previously and liked it.  The only thing different is the old one had 30 second sounds adding up to 2 minutes, but I got accustomed to this one.</li>
            <li> Best value for the money.  Quick delivery.  I knew what I was getting and it measured up completely.  I would do it again.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush, but it stopped holding a charge after only a few months of use. It&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great buy. It is a fraction of the cost of other sonic brushes, and after using some of them previously I would buy this one again. Replacement brush heads are $8-10 each depending on quantity and location purchased, but they last 3-4 months. The off brand replacement heads don&#x27;t fit as well and transfer some of the vibration into an annoying (and very loud) buzzing noise while in use. We went back to teh more expensive name brand replacement heads. Battery charge lasts for 2+ weeks so its possible to travel without taking the charger. All-in-all, love this toothbrush and have purchased for the entire family.</li>
            <li> I had the same before and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!  I had the same one for many years  I love it!</li>
            <li> This works well, but the buzzing is something that takes getting used to.  Also, the design leaves something to be desired.  Turning it off takes a little dexterity while holding the toothbrush still in the mouth.  If you take the toothbrush out of your mouth before turning it off, prepare for the mirror splatter!  It would be a lot better if the toothbrush could be turned off more easily while still in the mouth.  Teeth feel clean after using it though.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush, good seller, good product</li>
            <li> I love sonicare products and I bought this for a backup because everyone in my family uses one, and none of us want to be without one.  Good deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has the travel bag. I&#x27;m used to the small circle brushes but I am slowly getting used to this brush. I like that it doesn&#x27;t need batteries. Battery life is long too.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get use to the large size compared to the older Sonicare that I use to use. But I like the product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Dentist didn&#x27;t give me a sharp talking to this time . I got it when they said it would arrive. Its all good.</li>
            <li> works well, batteries last a long time, easy to travel with.  Reasonably priced replacement heads. Compared to versions found in the toothbrush isle this one has the automatic 2min shut off.</li>
            <li> We have been using sonicare now for six months. On the plus side, it is cheap and cleans teeth well.  But unaccountably, the replaceable brush is expensive, very complex, and gets very dirty with a black growth that is hard to clean. It makes no ecological sense to design a toothbrush so that much more than the actual brush that needs to be replaced (unless that is the business model to make money). We have succeeded in cleaning the brush by soaking in bleach and cleaning with a q-tip, but this has to be done every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recently got a much better Dazzlepro from our dentist that has just a simple replaceable brush. We keep the Sonicare only as a spare or when one of us is travelling.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these six months ago with the recommendation of our Dental Hygienist. It&#x27;s an excellent tool to help you care for your gums. Bought this second one so I don&#x27;t need to wait my turn with my wife. Since I started using it, the space between the teeth &amp; gums has come back to correct dimensions ... am well on the way to preventing gingivitis.</li>
            <li> I will never switch to any other toothbrush. Sonicare + floss + listerine, my mouth has never felt this good. I may try other model from Sonicare in the future but so far this one works great for home use. One charge lasts for 2 weeks. It seems to be easy for travelling too with the travel bag included.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I get this electric toothbrush -- and I was reluctant at first because of a bad past experience with a water-pik a number of years ago that caused my gums to bleed and that hurt a lot!  My dentist sold these in her office at twice the price (she had the newer model -- one with the 30-second alarm which this one doesn&#x27;t have) -- and so I decided to try this somewhat simpler, somewhat less pricey model and bought it here on Amazon).  I read the other reviews, and decided that since I&#x27;m not used to the 30-second alarm that some of the reviewers were quite fond of, I wouldn&#x27;t miss it.  I was more reluctant to spend money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like at all, so I got this &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happily surprised when I tried this device to find that it was not at all rough on my poor old gums, as I had feared (no bleeding, no soreness, no problems at all). In fact, the vibration starts out on a very gentle setting tit slowly (12 steps) gets a little bit stronger each time you use it, so you have lots of time to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing now!  It really makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! works better then all other electric toothbrushes ive used! I would recommend this product to everyone! :)</li>
            <li> I dislike the new sonicare model with proseries.. when you are brushing and press a bit hard - it makes an annoying &amp;#34;brrrap&amp;#34; sound.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the E series.. No need to fall for the marketing gimmicks of diamond version etc..&lt;br /&gt;If you want to go with electric toothbrush - just buy this.. it is an excellent value and does the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;So what if it does not have an indicator to show you charge left?&lt;br /&gt;Just charge it once a few weeks.. it is larger than the pro series and therefore - I might guess - it has a large battery. it lasts for ever, before you need to charge it again.. you can&#x27;t ask for anything better! Save your money and buy this.. great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read carefully enough. It&#x27;s got a two minute timer, but not the 30-second beep that I&#x27;d come to rely on with my old one. Watching a clock for the whole time is a drag.  Get the one with &amp;#34;quad-pacer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When the HX5610 charges it works great! Problem is it doesn&#x27;t always charge, even after 18-24 hrs. 1st time user received this as a gift in Jan of 2013. By Nov 2013 it stopped charging (intermittently) even after re-seating the base on the charger several times. Contacted sonicare/philips customer service and received a replacement with pre-paid return postage. Feb 2014 same issue, recieved another replacement again with pre-paid return postage. I suggested that it might be a bad charger but was told as long as it has power, it&#x27;s working. Hopefully the 3rd one consistently holds a charge. Is anyone else having this issue?</li>
            <li> Man....this thing is awesome.  Gives you that slick feeling like you actually got a cleaning at the dentist.  Keeps charge for a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t brush your tongue with the thing on, it will sling toothpaste all over you AND the sink/mirror/wall, etc :)</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have been wanting to purchase this toothbrush (per our dentists advice).This was a GREAT deal.With the coupons provided by Phillips,I purchased small brushes for mine.The brush is very accurate....Love it!</li>
            <li> I received this Philips Sonicare Essence 5600 model electric toothbrush as a gift on Christmas 2012. It is now February 2014 and I am left with an electric toothbrush that will not work or function. I guess you get what you pay for and spending only $50 for this results in a cheaply made and ill-functioning electric toothbrush. I had an Oral B that lasted 5+ years and it never gave me this much trouble. Granted, I routinely brush my teeth twice a day, so there is not any unusual wear and tear. But come on, a Sonicare toothbrush should not break in 1 year and 2 months of normal use. I am disappointed and all buyers of this Sonicare should be made aware. Skip this one and buy a more expensive model. Better yet, opt for an Oral B!</li>
            <li> The handle is bigger circumference wise, but still manageable. The charge indicator stays lit up all the time. Is it supposed to do this? Should I unplug the charger?&#x27;</li>
            <li> If you can spare $20, I would recommend going for the slightly more expensive version. The space between the main frame and detachable brush head is huge and molds like crazy. Also, the brush heads themselves are more expensive than the ones for the slightly higher end models.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare saved my teeth!!  My dentist recommended this back in the early &#x27;90&#x27;s so I started using it.  Since then, its made me a strong believer and I never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in December and it died just 7 months later - it stopped charging and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with this way of taking care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find the same brush which I have been using for 15 years. It is not available in retail stores. However it does not have the &amp;#34;quadripacing&amp;#34; feature (or it doesn&#x27;t work) which pauses the brush @30seconds to move from one mouth section to the next. I am adjusting to having to pay attention and count myself. I much prefer this older style brush and handle</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is narrow, it should be wider as it hits my teeth while brushing</li>
            <li> What I bought is new item but the box that came with it was not the original nice looking one, which made me think it was a refurbished item</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I have just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. The noise can bother some, but it is worth it. Nice travel case and easy to take apart for travel. The charge usually lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> but not as nice as the better model(s) doesnt sound the timer alarm. Bought it because it was on sale,</li>
            <li> THE TOOTHBRUSH CAME IN A PLAIN BOX WITH NO OPERATING OR WARRANTY INFORMATION. THE INITIAL CHARGE TOOK OVER 30 HOURS. THE BRUSH FEELS GOOD IN MY HANDS BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T GET MY TEETH AS CLEAN FEELING AS MY OLDER (NOW DEAD) MORE EXPENSIVE BRUSH. IN FACT, AFTER BRUSHING 3 TIMES, MY TEETH STILL HAD CRUD ON THEM.</li>
            <li> Buy it and use it. My dental hygenistfffdfnoted less plaque using this instead of a traditional tooth brush and no cavities either!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, and it takes some time to adjust to not brushing with a regular toothbrush.  It does a great job and my teeth feel so clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> It is a good product that helps you keep your teeth clean. However, I did not see any dramatically changes. Clearly, if you want to whiten your teeth, you should not out your hope on this. Overall, it is a good product to have in your bathroom</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says I should never be without one.  This is the second or third I&#x27;ve bought.  Expect it to last for years like the others.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size and ease of use for travel. Long battery life and cleans as well as my older larger Philips model.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. The best part is that it holds a charge for up to 2 weeks! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a Sonicare that was 12 years old.  Very pleased with the toothbrush.  This one should be no different.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased. The 1st one lasted over 10 yrs. Well worth the money! Even though I don&#x27;t floss everyday , thanks to this toothbrush my dentist thinks I do. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I thought I was ordering a brush that gave a signal when to move to a different quarter of my teeth--like the last one I had.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare had a &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; every 30 seconds, indicating I needed to move to another area of my mouth.  I can live with this,&lt;br /&gt;but I relied on that &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; to let me know I had to move on to another level.</li>
            <li> So far. .I love it.  Hoping the battery lasts and I can find replacement brushes easily because this little device is helping me with better oracare and my teeth feel so clean!  Love it....The price was. .was right. ..shipping was on time. ...packaging and instructions were clear.  All good! !</li>
            <li> This is our second one. I liked the first one so much I bought one for the Girlfriend. She loves the darn thing, and I love mine.&lt;br /&gt;Squeaky clean teeth. Mine has worked over a year with no issues as yet. Costs a bit more than the old reliable toothbrush, but you really do get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been bugging me to get one, so I caved. Am I the only person who finds using these a really unpleasant experience? I expected something different I guess but the vibration takes some getting used to. I feel like it tickles and makes my mouth really itchy, but my teeth do feel really clean after. Still, I find myself wincing a little when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does the trick.  I had been using the type you can buy at Walmart or the grocery store,  I forgot the brand but it is so much more harsh on your gums.  This works really nicely,  I do wish you could buy a family sized set up so each person doesn&#x27;t have to have their own set up - taking up too much room on the bathroom vanity.  We use one handle and put the toothbrush heads on as each person uses the handle,</li>
            <li> Time will tell just how well this toothbrush works, but my teeth felt very clean after using this. No matter how many times I&#x27;ve used the manual toothbrush per day it doesn&#x27;t even come close to how well this cleans and the Sonicare isn&#x27;t even operating at full power right now. Philips does this intentionally to help people adjust to the toothbrush. After about 12 brushings, it will increase to full power. Needless to say I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! I had one a few years ago and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed it!</li>
            <li> Great deal. 3yrs in a row no cavities.. love this!</li>
            <li> Every time I use this thing it feels like I was just at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Great product, competitive pricing</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush.  It made improvements on my dental visits.  I wish I had one when I was younger, it would have prevented more cavities.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. My son loves it.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brush works very well and teeth feel clean when done.  This is my second sonicare, the first gave up after about 10 years plus.  I like not having to keep the brush in the charger all the time.</li>
            <li> I received one of these as a Christmas present a few years ago. I was a bit skeptical at first. However, come late January or February, I had my first post-Sonicare teeth cleaning at the dentist. In just a month or so, the dental assistant cleaning my teeth said they looked much better. In six months, I go in for another cleaning. The dental assistant is so impressed that she says she is going to get one. In fact, she said she had receding gum lines and seeing how much mine had improved, she thought I just might have saved her teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, dental cleanings have always been painful for me. Another year, and two more teeth cleanings later and I can honestly say, it almost doesn&#x27;t even hurt anymore...almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of them being pricey, I almost knocked off one star for one reason. These things do not seem to be real sanitary and are a bit hard to clean. You can clean them off under running water and they look all clean, but if you start looking in all the nooks and crannies, they get crud growing up in the head and down in the handle, and even in the battery charger (which isn&#x27;t too hard to clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean it off daily, but I keep a bottle of peroxide handy and hose it off with it every couple of days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars? Five Stars? I figure when your dental assistant sees such an improvement that she goes out and buys one, and says \\&quot;you may have just saved my teeth,\\&quot; that&#x27;s got to be five stars.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY SECOND ONE.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This is what I have come to expect from a Sonicare toohbush. Base is sturdy,  Brush unscrews and comes apart for easy cleaning. I use this 2x a day and store the brush separately to air dry. Every few days pop the plastic sleeve to wipe down, although I have never found that to be necessary.  Have never had any problems with mold or fungus as others have. Proper maintenance is the key to any possession. Good price, no unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great product.  My wife had put this on her Christmas list and after reading the previous reviews I could not pass it up.  Does exactly what is is supposed to do and she says I need to buy one as well.</li>
            <li> Unlike the prior Sonicare, this one does not beep after thirty seconds but does have the two minute shutoff. i miss that feature. in addition, it sits very precariously in the small base and if not just right, does not charge.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for my teeth for over 20 years.  I&#x27;m addicted to the fresh way my mouth feels after using it.</li>
            <li> I do brush my teeth twice a day, but I never seen able to properly scrub everything off. This fantastic toothbrush actually removes everything. After a week of using it my gums felt better, and are visibly healthier. I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I have been using it for years.  This one doesn&#x27;t have the 20 sec timer like the Elite, but the price is excellent and this feature is not that important.</li>
            <li> Greatest toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> This makes my mouth and teeth feel like I have just been to the dentist and had them cleaned.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Received in excellent condition.  Works awesome, like the last one that worked over TEN YRS!  And, it was cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THX</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have with this electric toothbrush is that it is to loud I do like that you can brush for the full two minutes because then you are getting a good clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model of the Sonicare toothbrush for 15 years, and this is not the quality I&#x27;ve always found.  The brush doesn&#x27;t screw on all the way, so the base fills up with water and the toothpaste foam from your mouth.  After a few days, it starts to smell.  Yuk!  And even though I purchased it recently, it&#x27;s already starting to break down.  The charge light blinks all the time, running down the battery.  This is obviously a second, or perhaps a fake from the folks in China.  I called Sonicare, but SONICARE REFUSED TO HONOR THE WARRANTY. Phoned them four times for a replacement, and each time they gave me the runaround.  Finally, I contacted Amazon.  AND THIS IS WHY YOU BUY FROM AMAZON: just one call to Amazon, and they credited the full amount to my account, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> On time and as described. Would purchase again in the future. That&#x27;s all for now...Okay have I satisfied the word requirement...shessh</li>
            <li> Purchased to place on older one.  Primarily went with this model for price and had several other replacement brushes I wanted to use (wouldn&#x27;t work with other models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well, but doesn&#x27;t have the 30s timer to indicate when to start brushing.</li>
            <li> This was to replace another electric toothbrush that stopped working after many years. I may stop getting professional dental cleanings every 6 months because the hygienist never finds any plaque or other problems. I think this device is partly responsible for that! It does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen commercials regarding Sonicare toothbrushes but I figured it was the same as any $10 electric toothbrush that I could buy at any store... that was my thinking at least... and wow, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole package includes a travel pack, the base/battery, the top/bristles, a plastic cover for the bristle area, and the recharge base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush was charged out of the box so I could take it for a test drive immediately. The brush barely vibrates to the naked eye, but start brushing, and you&#x27;ll immediately realize how strong it actually is. It also has a nice 2 minute shut off feature that let&#x27;s you know that you&#x27;ve brushed enough... for some that would like to continue to brush, press that little green circle and brush on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the toothbrush sit without a recharging it, and I can proudly say that after brushing with it twice a day, it went for 6 days without a charge... that&#x27;s a pretty good battery. With most devices that have a rechargeable battery, I would advise letting the whole thing die before recharging to converse the half-life of the battery. I always have my $10 electric toothbrush on standby for when my Sonicare toothbrush loses its power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase. I don&#x27;t really have any negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> So cheap and works very well.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND IT IS GOOD FOR USE. I FEEL SUITABLE SO MUCH. AND I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRIENDS AND SHARE IT!</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B for years and it finally died on me. I decided to try something different and I have found this cleans a little better than the Oral B. Takes a day or two to get used to and the instructions do say it will tickle the mouth at first -- which it does.</li>
            <li> I have some gum disease and have even lost a tooth recently because of it. I felt the same problem coming on in another area of my mouth. I was so dreading the trip to the dentist, the inevitable tooth removal, and another hole in my head I do not need. In a last ditch effort to stave off the process, I did extensive research online and particularly here on Amazon. To save you my circuitous journey to this device, let me say I dumped the idea of the Waterpik, I tossed the through of the OralB electric toothbrush. I went with the Sonicare. The price here at Amazon is by far the best price I could find -- even with a 20% off coupon for Bed, Bath and Beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the thing. It came super fast. I got it out and used it right a way. My teeth and gums were really hurting, puffy, red, bleeding...eh you know what I mean. Even flossing didn&#x27;t help.  So, once I put it in my mouth I was shocked at how serious that  vibration was. It took a little getting used to. I knew it was good though. Right away I noticed my gums felt better. After a few days, the puffiness died down. The bleeding stopped after a couple weeks. And (knock on wood) as of now my gums have healed. Seriously healed. I love this toothbrush. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It meets our family needs. It operates as efficiently as the Elite, but does not have the thirty second alert to inform one to move to the next quartile.</li>
            <li> arrived on time as promised.  we have been using these for a while and find them very good.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It works great. Was recommended by my dentist. My first one lasted many years. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter and I love how it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> Very good. My last one lasted over 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one. I love it! I reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li> Amazing feeling!Its like a clean up from the dentist on a daily basis. The item was well packaged and delivered within time given.</li>
            <li> Really no better than my crest spinbrush costing 70% less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also sends flecks of tooth paste everywhere is not turned off before leaving mouth</li>
            <li> The inside gets water in it and gets moldy</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for the same model I&#x27;ve been using for the last 13 years.</li>
            <li> Best version yet. It outdoes itself.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to go the dentist, but my teeth feel so clean after brushing with sonicare. The replacement brushes are expensive to replace and wear out quickly. Cleaning the inside is a little bit of a pain because there are hard to reach places, but it is the best electric toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as I have used Sonicare for quite some time.  He really likes it and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I got Sonicare Essence to replace my 10yr old Sonicare Elite and it actually works better than the Elite series which was discontinued years ago; for half the price.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered one years ago.  Does anyone know where to find a reliable place to buy replacement heads?  This thing makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> Works well, brush after brush. Good quality, as pictured, work well as the manufacture describes. I love this product. Would suggest to for great dental care.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH LEAVES MY TEETH SQUEAKY CLEAN,  ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET A FIRMER TIP, OTHERWISE IT&#x27;S GREAT, THANK  YOU!</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth and does a fine job at it. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Replaces my old one and works quite well.</li>
            <li> Love it! I will &#x27;gift&#x27; others with them!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does the job very well and I would recommend it to my friends.  However the unit is a little loud.</li>
            <li> I have this exact same toothbrush I bought 6 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. I purchased my husband one for Xmas and it&#x27;s already stopped working! I was shocked. The return window is only 30 days so now I&#x27;m stuck with it. Wishing I&#x27;d just bought it at target or walmart so I could easily return if/when it broke!!</li>
            <li> handy and easy to clean up&lt;br /&gt;Just wish I can replace with small round brush once a while for some people don&#x27;t hare big mouth to clean well the end of tooth.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Was a little disconcerted at first since it was more powerful than the last sonic toothbrush I owned but I have come to love it a lot. It does a great job of cleaning my teeth. The only con I would say is that it is noisy.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Holds long charge.</li>
            <li> What can I say about a great toothbrush? It&#x27;s great? The brand stands on its own. The 5 stars is for the packageing and shipping...super speedy.</li>
            <li> it can make my teeth very clean and white easily. The only problem is that I can not use it in China.</li>
            <li> my mom she loves it. it&#x27;s easy to use. and easy to carry on. i am planning to buy more.</li>
            <li> It Did Not Even Come In A Sonicare Box It Came In A Brown Box That Was All Smashed It Sucked And I Had To Go Buy Another I Was To Shame To Give It To My Mother For Christmas.!!</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by my dentist. It was cheaper than in local stores. I like the feature that lets you start out at a softer speed. It tickles at first, but you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother you.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is Good!.I like this product.It is very esea to use.I will buy some heads late.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this toothbrush.  I bought it to replace my previous one that I had for years.  This one is already not working correctly.  Will be contacting amazon to replace it.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my husband and wad a great...he has wanted one for a long time..it was a great buy..Thx Amazom</li>
            <li> My son and I use the battery operated, cheap toothbrushes. He was tired of his not getting his teeth clean. So I thought for christmas I would spend a few dollars on him a good one. To my surprise, this one wasnt costly at all. And also to my surprise, my son loved it. &amp;#34;It feels like I go to the hygenist everyday&amp;#34;. Now I want one!!!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Love the price. I know I&#x27;m getting a better cleaning than my regular tooth brush with it.</li>
            <li> Loved the lightness and simplicity. Nothing else required or needed. A must for those wanting the Best Elerctric Brush in the Industry!</li>
            <li> It works, it does what supposed. The only cons are the weight and the cost of the replacement heads, but you have Costco membership for that.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I like the charging modality although you don&#x27;t need to keep it plugged all the time (some people think it shortens its life).  It will work for more than a week on a single charge.  My dentist recommends it.  He says, &amp;#34;let the toothbrush&amp;#34; do the work; don&#x27;t use it like a regular toothbrush,&amp;#34; i.e. don&#x27;t brush with it.  Not sure why they changed the configuration of the base, unless it was to keep people from using the old charger for the newer model brush.  If so, why?</li>
            <li> nasty buzzing is not pleasing to the mouth, would not recommend it especially for those who have the seal. once bought another advantage to Featured.</li>
            <li> Briefly, for a lot less than half the price, the Essence offers the essential benefits of the higher-end Sonicare products and it should be a good buy for both existing Sonicare users who don&#x27;t care about paying a premium for a higher end models&#x27; bells and whistles and for new/undecided users who would like to try out Sonicare without spending a lot in the process. I am very happy with the product and, despite it lacking some of the higher end models features (see below) the Essence is going to replace my current Sonicare brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: my records show that I&#x27;ve been using a [[ASIN:B00008BFXG Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush]] since May, 2008 and I used a Sonicare toothbrush before that which should qualify me as both a &#x27;loyal customer&#x27; and, hopefully, a knowledgeable reviewer for the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Essence shares some key features with most other Sonicare products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* VIBRATION METHOD - Cleaning takes place because the brush head vibrates hundreds of times per second. This usually results in &#x27;love at first try&#x27; or immediate rejection. It was instant love for me but my wife simply can&#x27;t stand the vibration and she will never use a Sonicare product so... try before you buy. Philips will allow you to return the product for a full refund if you are not fully satisfied with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;* REPLACEABLE HEADS - The most controversial aspect of Sonicare is the relatively pricey brush heads. They only last 3 months (4-6 months is possible but anything beyond that is not recommended) and they are not cheap whether you use a high end or a low end model.&lt;br /&gt;* INDUCTIVE CHARGING - You simply drop your toothbrush into the charger&#x27;s cradle and it will charge without having to plug it in and there are not metal parts making contact. This is very convenient and very high-tech looking.&lt;br /&gt;* TWO-MINUTE TIMER - The Essence will stop running after 2 minutes which is the agreed-upon minimum time one should spend brushing teeth. Of course, you can start it again if the initial 2 minutes were not sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;* CORD WRAP - Like most Sonicare models, this one has one at the bottom of the charger to store any excess cord.&lt;br /&gt;* CARY CASE - The ESSENCE actually comes with a zippered pouch. It&#x27;s better than nothing but not as protective as the Advance&#x27;s solid plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;* MANUAL - It&#x27;s English only and it discussing proper brushing techniques, product features, maintenance and simple troubleshooting.&lt;br /&gt;* 2 YEAR WARRANTY - on defects. Does not cover the brush heads, wear and tear, misuse or chips and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, these are the features that the Essence is missing when compared with the Advance which may or may not matter, depending on your needs. I am prefixing them with a &#x27;-&#x27; (minus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- QUADPACER - The Advance and other models give the user a signal every 30 seconds. This should help properly dividing brushing time between the 4 sections of your mouth (up/down, right/left).&lt;br /&gt;- BATTERY CHARGE INDICATOR - Higher end models would show through a string of small LEDs the battery&#x27;s charge level. A nice to have feature but can easily live without it.&lt;br /&gt;- HARD CASE - see above. There is a soft one provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who doesn&#x27;t need the quadpacer feature could save some serious money by going with this less expensive model. When it comes to tooth-brushing, the Essence and the Advance perform very much the same. The Advance body is slightly slimmer and shorter but I&#x27;m comparing today&#x27;s Essence with the Advance of over 4 years ago so they might be the same now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with both models but if I had to pick between the &#x27;basic&#x27; Essence and the more feature-rich and a lot more expensive Advance today I&#x27;d definitely go with the more affordable Essence and use the savings to buy my a couple of years worth of brush heads.eth. Of course, you can start it again if the initial 2 minutes were not sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;* CORD WRAP - Like most Sonicare models, this one has one at the bottom of the charger to store any excess cord.&lt;br /&gt;* CARY CASE - The ESSENCE actually comes with a zippered pouch.

            <li> This toothbrush was a replacement for my sonicare that wore out after about 8 years. I will never use another kind unless they make this one even better!  Ask your dentist or hygienist and they will tell you this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to my Dentist and bought this a long time ago. I love it. I have that, just left the dentist office, feeling every day now. I have good dental practices and I thought a regular brush would be just as good so long as it is used properly but there is no comparison. I am a coffee drinker as well as a glass of red wine each day and the further I got away from my bi-annual cleanings I developed stains. They came off easily at the cleanings but now my teeth stay shiny and white all of the time. The battery life is just as advertised. Used twice a day it lasts two weeks between charging. What I paid for this Sonicare is less than what I paid more than a decade ago for another electric toothbrush. That one worked marginally at best but died prematurely and I disregarded electric toothbrushes since then because of it. Time will tell if this one has long term durability but I am thrilled so far.</li>
            <li> This  broke after about a month. Just doing an effective vibration and started behaving like a drunk hula hooper might. I thought that maybe I just needed a new brush had, but replacing the brush head did not help. I am frustrated that the time frame of the return policy for a lot of Amazon items is so short. Bah!</li>
            <li> This is my second Essence toothbrush. The first one lasted me at least 7 years, so I&#x27;m looking for the same quality here. My hygienist loves that I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both ordered this toothbrush and we both like it.  The sonic cleaning somewhat tickles but it does a gray job.</li>
            <li> For the price that amazon has this for, this is a great deal.  The dentist mentioned going to an electric toothbrush and i never regretted it one day.  It took a while for my teeth and gums to get used to the vibration, but after 3 days I was fine.  I still havent figured out how often I should be changing my toothbrush head.  It says after 3 months, but the head still seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare product. I had a previous incarnation that lasted me about eight years. The on-off button finally gave out. I didn&#x27;t go for the more expensive models as I didn&#x27;t see the point -- this model does everything I need it to do.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare has definitely improved my dentist visits. We&#x27;ve been using ours for the past two years and love them. We purchased this one for one of our kids. I would highly recommend. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Unless you believe the earth is flat, and the sun rotates around the earth you should own a Sonicare !</li>
            <li> how did i never own this toothbrush before? i bought this four months ago and have only had to charge the battery once, and my teeth feel dentist clean every single time! and such a steal on amazon. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The dentist recomnmended it, but it will take some getting used to.  It tickles my gums and hurts when it hits my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed with this tooth brush. I really don&#x27;t feel that it cleans my teeth well. After I&#x27;m done brushing I can still feel plaque on my teeth as compared to just a plan ole tooth brush. Which is weird because this was recommended by my dentist. It&#x27;s just a vibrating tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> Cleans the teeth well for a great price, cheap and plentiful replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend taking off the head and cleaning inside occasionally, not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I had not used an electric toothbrush in years.  I love that the 2 minutes shuts off.  For years I thought about getting an hour glass to&lt;br /&gt;us of the 2 minutes.  I have lower teeth that were worn and yellow across the top and it is helping to lighten them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the Electric Toothbrush.  By the way, I am 85 years old.  God is good.</li>
            <li> Great but very disappointed that it does not have the 30 second interval timer like my previous one! There was no mention of this feature not being in the product!  There needs to be a products features comparison chart so one can be Informed about them before purchasing. There are so many models of these products that it is nearly impossible to become informed without this type of information available. I would have gladly paid more for one with is feature!! Now I have to count each time I brush my teeth to make sure I am getting complete &amp;amp; adequate coverage!</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothbrush. No problems a couple months so far with it! No need for the higher end one in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is well made and seems to work well better than a similar product I have used but it just doesn&#x27;t quite make to &amp;#34;I love It.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love the power of this toothbrush and charge last for weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Sonic Toothbrushes that are much more effective than this one.  Thought i would try this because it was by Phillips, but, it was a mistake.  It leaves a film on teeth after first use and can be painful if the top of the brush hits your upper teeth.</li>
            <li> worked only a short time, it was such a disappontmnt haven&#x27;t had it long, and now it has stopped working.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price. Feels much cleaner than manual brushing. Replacement brushes are expensive though. Like the convenient travel case.</li>
            <li> Liked the toothbrush but the case is not great for packing and traveling. I liked the hard case that I had before better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize these existed until my dentist recommended it. Note sure what the more expensive models are like but this one is great. Would highly recommend this, it&#x27;s not an electric brush, it&#x27;s much more like a dental tool. I have vertigo and was concerned that the vibrations might be an issue, it can be, but I&#x27;ve learned how to minimize that affect.</li>
            <li> Good price for the replacement battery for the larger head model.  This works better than Sonicare&#x27;s newer model.  Comes with just the battery, (lower portion of the brush), so you&#x27;re not paying for extras you don&#x27;t need.  In my case, I have many replacement brush heads which would have gone to waste had I not found this replacement battery.  Good price too at $39.00.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine Sonicare toothbrush!  It works great and a the best price I have ever found.  The travel case is a good bonus.</li>
            <li> My roommate told me this kind of toothbrush would change my whole brushing experience. Whiter teeth, massage, and keeps your teeth feeling fresher than ever :) Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended to use an electric toothbrush, and I always get excellent reviews from the dental hygienist. She always tells the dentist how well I brush. Excellent product. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products for 10 years.  This is my third tootbrush.  My first 2 lasted @ 5 years each.  THIS ONE LASTED FOR ONLY 5 MONTHS AND AMAZON WON&#x27;T REPLACE!</li>
            <li> Replaced Sonicare we&#x27;ve had for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I used it 1 week and it stopped working. The charger was bad or something inside the toothbrush quit working.. I had a bad experience with this product.</li>
            <li> this works great 3 people using it everyday. hold a long charge quiet, work as described. I was going to order newer model, but this is a great deal</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find an electric toothbrush this cheap - the brand and type were &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34; by my dentist in-law and while using it the first few times was very strange, that&#x27;s just electric toothbrushes in general... a week after having it, it felt perfectly normal to use and works great. My teeth do feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> After a good brushing my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning.  I went for several years without a cleaning and only used this Sonicare and the hygienist said my teeth looked really good!  She said it looked like it was only 6 months since a cleaning.</li>
            <li> BRUSH IS EASY TO ATTACH TO UNIT.</li>
            <li> 3rd one I&#x27;ve purchased over last 8 years.  1st one lasted 6 yrs before battery died.  2nd unit, battery died after 2 yrs.  This unit works well</li>
            <li> I chose this toothbrush because I&#x27;ve been using it for approx 3 years and love it.  My teeth feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; every time I use it.  I thought my grandkids would benefit from using the toothbrush and, as it turned out, they had dental appts. a few days after receiving the product and the dentist suggested they all use an electric brush for better cleaning and healthier gums.  I suggest everyone read the enclosed material so that you use the brush properly.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  This is the second one I have bought. The first one lasted over 3 years. My teeth feel so much cleaner than after brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent is exactly what I expected for a great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Elite and Essence toothbrushes for years and love them. Problem is, they don&#x27;t last - about 3-4 years max with normal usage. I recently replaced my &amp;#34;worn out&amp;#34; brush with this one from Amazon. Out of the box, I charged the device for 12 hours to make sure it had a good charge. After that, the device never reliably held the charge, and I had to return it. Fortunately Amazon&#x27;s return policy made this relatively painless.</li>
            <li> Great item.  It really makes my gums feel refreshed and my teeth sparkling. A little bit pricey though but I did get a bonus discount</li>
            <li> This was my first Sonic brush.  It came fast and packaged well.  Must first charge for 24 hours, as instructed,the it holds a charge steady.  Powerful and comfortable brush.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughter she was wanting a new electric toothbrush.  She said she likes it and is using it everyday.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She is very pleased with the toothbrush. It does a very thorough job. She said that she can tell a huge difference in how clean her teeth feel.</li>
            <li> this is an old style brush and works good&lt;br /&gt;handle is fat&lt;br /&gt;cleans good&lt;br /&gt;not sure why they bother with a travel case&lt;br /&gt;good tooth brush if you like and use phillips</li>
            <li> High quality electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to anyone&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting charge&lt;br /&gt;Comes with travel case&lt;br /&gt;ideal for airplane travel</li>
            <li> I have used a sonicare toothbrush for over 10 years. Yes I do have better check ups. My quadpacer died and I replaced it with this one. It is nice but I miss the quad timer. Yes I would recommend this to everyone who would enjoy  cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> Gums stopped bleeding within a couple of weeks of use and dental appointments are no longer scary.  One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It is hard to go wrong with any sonicare and you can&#x27;t beat the price /efficiency of this particular model.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonic are, and they are awesome.  I was just bummer that this model doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second beep to move to the next quadrant in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It works well to clean teeth, but it gets pretty disgusting on the inside. There&#x27;s a cavity where the brush connects to the battery, and within that gunk builds up. Make sure to clean it regularly. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I&#x27;d find a different powered tooth brush where it&#x27;s either all one piece, or there&#x27;s no room for bacteria and other gunk to build up.</li>
            <li> It is way better than Oral-B ones. I really like its electronic vibration, which cleans my teeth efficiently. Good Job Phillips!</li>
            <li> This is the second Philips Sonicare toothbrush I have had.  The first one stopped working after having it for many years.  My dentist recommended it and I have been very satisfied with it.  For that and  mainly because of the good job it does keeping my teeth clean, I ordered this one.  It will automatically turn off after two minutes.  I keep the toothbrush in the recharger and it is always ready to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tested yesterday, very good product.</li>
            <li> like it very much. will never go back to a regular toothbrush again! highly recommended and easy to use. buy it!</li>
            <li> Great product,cleans teeth really well,Good recharging platform.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling.  Great price!</li>
            <li> just received this product, although haven&#x27;t tried, this product impress me.&lt;br /&gt;Elegant design with travel size bag, every easy for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Simple instruction to start.&lt;br /&gt;I am very looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> I only use Sonicare. I have had several and bought one as a gift. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but does not have a time.</li>
            <li> The magnet from my toothbrush fell off inside of the handle and for some reason that was enough to make it not work.</li>
            <li> works great, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love it. My teeth were visibly whiter after the first use. I highly recommend this toothbrush. Also the price was right.</li>
            <li> very good. I love it. have used it for a while. Pretty good quality, just need to clean it every time after using.</li>
            <li> Product works well enough except that it has a flawed design. There&#x27;s a hollow area in the head and handle where dirty toothpaste runs into and gets trapped. Some of it runs out onto the counter when not in use and the rest dries in there. Pretty gross. Only had this a few months and wishing I&#x27;d opted for another design.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but the replacement heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> I just got this toothbrush on May 8th and it already seems to have stopped working! I was very happy with the results at the beginning and I think that it really makes a difference in dental care, but now it has less power. It indicates that it is charged but brushing is definitely less powerful. I am very disappointed with this purchase and for having wasted my money on a  product that seems to have been defective and lasted me just three weeks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband per his request as a Christmas gift. He loves using it. I&#x27;ve noticed though that it leaves a rusty substance on the stand/bottom of the toothbrush after a couple of months. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to do that or what but it hasn&#x27;t affected the performance of the product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> We ordered it to replace another one that we had. It was less costly than the original one that died. and in the few weeks we have had it had worked fine. The person who actually uses it is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips sonicare toothbrush for quite some time and I find it totally reliable. I would recommend this problem</li>
            <li> The tooth brush head is so tiny and soft.  It may be good for a child&#x27;s baby teeth but not for anyone else.  I wish I could send it back but I actually tried it once.</li>
            <li> Kind of Ok&lt;br /&gt;need to charge every 15 days&lt;br /&gt;clean well and easy to carry if you are on business trip&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
            <li> Good at cleaning your teeth, but the gunk buildup in the replacement heads is grim.&lt;br /&gt;It starts immediately. It smells horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Simply a design flaw. Do not buy this model.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple, but did the trick.  Worked well for me until my wife upgraded to fancier new version.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I totally enjoy my brushing experience, my teeth feel clean and look professionally cleaned. My former toothbrush was the Oral B , I will never go back.</li>
            <li> my 12 year old Philips finally bit the dust and wouldn&#x27;t charge any longer. I was really having a hard time parting with it as it has been with me for so long and has always done an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only level of comfort was replacing my Philips with the new Philips and however, my old one did not have the Sonicare feature.,it was delivered very quickly and packaged to get started quite easily. It was really quiet and I was super impressed with quality in which it cleans. Good job Phillips.</li>
            <li> This model did not have the timing beeps. I ordered another model that has beeps every 30 seconds.  So it is just a back up.  Cory</li>
            <li> I miss my old one that had a 30 second notification. Doesn&#x27;t matter much, but it&#x27;s weird now not to have it. Otherwise, works great and does it&#x27;s just. And I love the color.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than manual toothbrush. Better than oral b automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the purchase of Philips Oral Healthcare toothbrush it&#x27;s a great bonus for my dental care.</li>
            <li> I sort of have to watch these sonic toothbrushes.  They clean so well.  But, I love how they work.</li>
            <li> Works like charm cool product.</li>
            <li> Cleaned off a bunch of long term stains within a couple days of using it. Works great!</li>
            <li> performs as advertised.  no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare 5600. My first one lasted for years. After that, I tried one of the newer skinny Sonicares. It lasted 6 months, so I replaced it with another 5600.</li>
            <li> seem good, used half one month</li>
            <li> I was thinking that this product would beep after 30 seconds at each quadrant and it doesn&#x27;t, the manual says it does this only on &#x27;select &#x27; models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says that it drives fluid between teeth, it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is way too noisy as well.</li>
            <li> Head replacement is kind of expensive</li>
            <li> The people at the bed and breakfast we are staying at while we build our house, recommended this toothbrush. It is wonderful. My teeth feel cleaner than after a trip to my dentist. Travels well and stays charged.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a pretty good job. Unfortunately like all of these the brush heads are stupidly expensive (like $8 a piece in bulk) but it&#x27;s still worth it. I like the sonic vibe style way more than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; oscillating head. The oscillating one always seems to get really groty in the mechanism whereas this one is pretty much sealed all around.</li>
            <li> Everything looks all good and new except I didn&#x27;t receive the case. It clearly states a travel case comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no excuse for any sellers to not deliver the advertised products when paid for.</li>
            <li> My old sonicare broke and I bought this is a replacement. The price was right compared to buying anew at the store. I bought this model because I had just bought a packet of toothbrushes for my old sonicare which was quite expensive. This is quality product with no problems or issues.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Sonicare for the past 3 or 4 years after having it recommended to us by our son.  Since we have started using it we have experienced a much cleaner feel and have been receiving great comments from out dental hygienist.  Although a little pricey when compared to a regular tooth brush or many of the electric brushes, it is well worth the investment.  I recommend Philips Sonicare to anyone who is interested in maintaining and keeping their teeth.  The younger you start, the better</li>
            <li> This is my third sonicare toothbrush.  I will not use anything else!  I love the travel case.  Makes it much easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works ok but vibration is so hard, I can&#x27;t bear its intensity.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush.  If you&#x27;re like me you consider brushing your teeth just something you do while your getting ready.  This product is timed for 2 minutes of teeth brushing.  Its very convenient because I used to just start brushing and walking around a bit.  I know I now spend more time brushing my teeth and have found that there is much less scraping during my regular trips to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few uses took a little getting used to because of a funny tickling sensation but once you get used to it your good.  I also find that I save more water since I shut it off while im brushing which is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning though, the rubber gasket between the brush and the mount to the battery handle can let water or other fluids get down in the little reservoir of the handle.  If this happens and you don&#x27;t know it, things can get funky in there so I&#x27;d keep an eye on it and check once a month to make sure its dry.  I&#x27;d also remove the brush tips from the handle if your going to clean that rubber gasket at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their oral health in between cleanings and dental check ups, I&#x27;ve def seen a noticeable difference and will never go back to a standard tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My old tooth brush was on its last-leg and was dead on arrival, too many choices online to choose from but this item is a good replacement. It works fine....!</li>
            <li> Our old Sonicare bit the dust after six years.  I thought this was the same model, but discovered too late that it is not; while our old model beeped every 30 seconds to remind you to move the toothbrush, this one does not; for consistent brushing, you need to keep an eye on the clock.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s the second one I have owned</li>
            <li> this is one of those buys where you can&#x27;t go wrong . this is a great toothbrush, one of my favorites an i will purchase this item again nice price too and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one for a long time. The old one finally died. New one is perfect. Cleans better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Purchased in January on the recommendation of my dentist to eliminate some minimal plaque issues on my otherwise healthy 58 year old teeth.  I wasn&#x27;t enthused since my only experience with an electric toothbrush was the old 1960s version.  After reading the reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try.  WOW, what a difference.  The &#x27;soft start&#x27; feature was great; really helped me get used to the feel of the product.  I&#x27;m still re-training myself to let the product do the work.  Seems to hold the charge well.  My mouth feels like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  Since I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, I will stop back in five months after my next dentist appointment to edit my review as far as health improvement and product durability.  As of today, I&#x27;d recommend purchasing!  Don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> Compared with previous electric toothbrushes I have used, the Philips Sonicare HX5610 packs a punch. It is heavier, has more battery storage, and vibrates with more power than Oral-B. This means the teeth and gums get a stronger brushing action, but it can be irritating, especially on the inside gums. The literature says I will get used to this! Time will tell if it works better as a cleaning device.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s easy to use and does all the work for you. They can be a little pricy in the stores but I found a great deal on line and saved about 40. I one before I purchased this one and it lasted for 10 years. It still works but takes awhile to charge. I use it for a spare up in my cabin. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Cleans much better than regular toothbrush. Charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I had my previous Sonicare for a long time-can&#x27;t remember how long.  I love that this one is lighter weight and more maneuverable than my previous one.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever. I had absolutely no scraping needed aty regular dental cleaning, no no cavitiys, no problems at all!  Six months of use made a huge difference.  I will never go back to a plain toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I love using this toothbrush. I can breeze thru my morning/nighttime bathroom routine and my teeth feel great and healthy. Previously, I used the more expensive Philips Sonicare model for 5 years and when it broke I did not have over $165 to buy another one so I went with this, the Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush. I was shocked at how well it worked. It came with 2 new heads, charges right up and is full of speed. For $49 you get the SAME cleaning power as the expensive Sonicare. I highly reccomend. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I do think after all most a year of using it that is great , until you have to change the head and you see grouse staff that  is forming inside the brush,  i did not know about this problem until i did change the head. Is a great brush but if you don&#x27;t  have much time on your hands to stay and clean, is not a good choice for you</li>
            <li> Had to replace a 12 year older one.  They do last,  just like the Energizer Bunny tey keep on going and going!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few days. So far it works great!! Very powerful and really cleans your teeth. It feels like I just left the dentist after everytime I&#x27;m done brushing!! Better clean in half the time.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife. She seems happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush itself but was a little disappointed that the head of the toothbrush was broken when I received.</li>
            <li> The price and the product... can’t complain. I just need the patience to figure out how to set the 30 second timer, then i’ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first with not getting one of the most current ones, but this toothbrush was cost effective and is very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product with few minor issues. One; the handle is a little too large and hard to grip for my small hands. Two; I&#x27;d prefer a warning that time is ending. It stops abruptly. That said, once I got the hang of pause/restart, it has been great. My previous brush was a Spinbrush sonic, which sometimes made my mouth sore and was not quite as effective. The Sonicare hasn&#x27;t caused any sores or soreness from brushing top of the molars. It also leaves my mouth feeling cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my original Sonicare brush that died after ~10 years of service.  Over the 10 years the battery life degraded to the point that it would only hold a charge for about 3 days, but up until it died it was a great brush, working dependably.  The brush does a great job at getting my teeth clean, as you would expect.  The travel case is a decent little case to help keep your brush and head together while you are on the go.  I hope I can depend on this for another 10 years, but would be happy if I just got 5 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- at the end of brushing your teeth it vibrates funny to let you know the battery is running low.  You still have multiple uses before you need to charge from that point&lt;br /&gt;- case is nice to keep everything together&lt;br /&gt;- charging base is small and easy to store out of the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Charging base (while I like how small it is) has a terrible design for the cable management.  The cable can not be nicely stored under the base becasue of how the cable comes out of the base.  Hard to explain, but its a bad design.  Luckily, its not a huge deal, and not worth taking a star off.</li>
            <li> This brush definitely is worth the money.  I have tried those other spinbrush pros and they just don&#x27;t stand up to the quality of this one.  My teeth feel so much cleaner and my dentist says that it massages the gums to make them stronger as well.</li>
            <li> He loves it, his old one, our hand me down with a new brush of course, stopped working about a year after we gave it to him so we bought him a new one.  He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare since it was first developed.  The original basic remains intact.  I&#x27;ve used this new one more than a month by now, peefect aleays.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested because I never felt like my teeth were clean &amp; I was brushing my teeth too hard. This is a good price &amp; makes your teeth feel clean. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I just had extensive shoulder repair surgery on my right shoulder and arm. Because I am right handed, I had difficulty in attempting to retrain my left hand to effectively brush my teeth.... the Sonicare solved all my problems!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for 5 years now and will never be able to go back.  I don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles and this was the best option for a reasonable price.  Definitely recommend this item for anyone looking at an electric toothbrush or those with poor gum quality like I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but it doesn&#x27;t have the timer that pauses at 30-second intervals to let you know that you&#x27;re done with each quadrant. It&#x27;s also incompatible with the charger for the better model.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. My teeth have never been this clean from an at home toothbrush. I love it!</li>
            <li> its Ok, Its not fun to use, I am not sure as its my first electric brush but its just sitting there and not using any more.</li>
            <li> Such an awesome toothbrush that I&#x27;m ordering a second right now for my Mum. It does feel like a really powerful teeth cleaning comparable to that of a dentist. I&#x27;m in loveeeee!</li>
            <li> After just one brush, my teeth felt better than they have in a long time. I enjoy the two-minute timer - forces me to brush for as long as I should!</li>
            <li> been using the Sonicare for years and my teeth love it.  Recommend everyone buy a new tooth brush.  Good Deal</li>
            <li> The device is very noisy but provides a great cleaning to all teeth. The weight is kind of heavy too.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. be careful which replacement  tops you buy. The ones recommended to me were much louder and rattled my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for myself and it&#x27;s a great toothbrush but after a week of using, I just didn&#x27;t like how strong the vibrations were, though my teeth felt extremely polished, it just tickled my gums which made it uncomfortable to use. It&#x27;s a great product so far and it would have been 5 stars if it had a vibration setting to control. If you don&#x27;t mind the vibrations and you like teeth feeling polished, I see no reason you should not get this great deal and awesome toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We all know that Sonicare is a good product, it works great. I appreciate the fast delivery and good value.</li>
            <li> Works great and I use it twice per day.  Keep my teeth clean, works great to clean those back molars.</li>
            <li> I would have given it another star except for the cheapo vinyl carry case they send with it.  This is such a crummy throw-in item, they&#x27;d have been better off not including it at all.  A previous Sonicare had a better, actually useful hard plastic carry case.  Why did they drop it?  To save a few cents on a product that undoubtedly has a huge profit margin already?&lt;br /&gt;They should start including a replaceable battery, too.</li>
            <li> Because of work I live between two houses. I was so happy with the first one i bought that i bought the same one for the 2nd house.</li>
            <li> will not go back to a regular tooth brush ever again. This brush makes it so much easier to clean and i know it works better then the traditional brushing methods.</li>
            <li> It feels weird at first, but once you get to used to it, it does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare years ago when I had braces and needed something to break up the gunk in between my brackets. I lost that brush a long time ago, and so when I heard they had a basic version for MUCH cheaper I didn&#x27;t hesitate buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush was awesome back then and is still the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. It blasts through all that plaque and buildup you get throughout the day. The first time I used it I was actually kinda grossed out at how much stuff had built up on my teeth. I went to the dentist regularly and brushed like they said, but apparently I wasn&#x27;t brushing that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush times your brushing session as well: 2 minutes, just like the dentist tells you every time you visit. Just keep brushing until the brush turns itself off and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more expensive versions beep every 30 seconds to let you know when you should change surfaces (Top back to Top Front, etc.) so you&#x27;ll just have to time it yourself with this model. It&#x27;s not a major gripe, and I only miss the feature when I&#x27;m just waking up and am too groggy to count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issues with the brush are with the head and the charger. There is a gap between the brush head and the screw-top base that like to accumulate A TON of toothpaste and spit. There&#x27;s really no way to avoid it, so I usually have to disassemble it and clean it every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger, while it works phenomenally at home, does not travel well. I take a lot of extended trips overseas and the charger is only rated to 110V. You&#x27;ll need a voltage converter to use it in most other countries. The brush does have a 2 week battery life though, and I usually am able to stretch it that far with regular use. It does come with an easy to use carrying case, but the case doesn&#x27;t carry the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate buying this brush again. Unless you have the money sitting around, there&#x27;s really no need to drop the extra cash on a fancier Sonicare. You get the same experience for less!n a fancier Sonicare. You get the same experience for less!</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and it feels like it does a much better job than a manual brush</li>
            <li> Works well, better than using a regular toothbrush. Really not much more to say but amazon seems to think i need X amount of words...</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and the product was a replacement for one I had been happy with for years and am similarly pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> This model lacks the 30 sec. interval brush action &amp;#34;stutter&amp;#34; present on other Sonicares to tell you it&#x27;s time to shift the brush to the next quadrant. Not a big deal if your watch has a second hand. But just like other Sonicare models it does a gangbuster job of cleaning and polishing your teeth and massaging gums.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for 3 days, and can not tell you enough how great this brush is.  Prior to the Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600, I was using the Oral B rechargeable.  The Phillips brush vibrates at a much higher speed and leaves my teeth feeling incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> It is well designed, and I have used it for one month. It goes perfectly. I highly recommend it, although the price is a little bit high.</li>
            <li> I have been using Electric toothbrushes and I like the way they clean my teeth.  This model was purchased for travel use.  I recommend this Sonicare product to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This product was very poorly made and broke almost immediately.  I was unable to return it, as it had been given as a gift and my window to return it had closed.  Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great value. Does the trick and costs 1/3 of the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product as expected.  It is my second Sonicare model and I will not go back to regular toothbrushes anytime soon.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and it does what its supposed to do. However, the device is loud and top bristles oscillates so fast, it looks like its gonna take down everything on its way.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy an expensive ET, id recommend try with this one. If you like it GREAT, next time buy better one. ELSE, its only 40 bucks! Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> This is the first tooth brush that I have found that really cleans your teeth very well.  I bought one with a sensitive brush head because this tooth brush is very powerful.  It was recommended by my dentist.  A great buy and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had an old soniccare and it was going on its last charge, so I was able to find it online for less then most stores sold them for. I think the toothbrush works really good and once you get through the tingling of the first uses it great, also make sure toothbrush is in mouth.when you turn it on other wise you&#x27;ll get sprayed.</li>
            <li> I only gave this item a two rating because it gets wet inside and leaks a colored substance on the charger stand.  I am concerned that the brush may not be durable and I made this purchase because my last Philips Sonicare toothbrush lasted over 10 years.  I am considering returning it so that I can try another brush to see if it also gets wet.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Travels well and keeps a charge, I would buy another again if I needed one or as a gift.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It works pretty well. I hope it can include the header holder next time.&lt;br /&gt;Philips electric stuff is always good.</li>
            <li> I remember these toothbrushes costing MUCH more than this! I&#x27;m very happy with it, and feel well on my way towards improved dental hygiene in 2014,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare for over 6 years. My first was an Essence e5000 I got for Christmas in 2008, a very early version of the E series. It still works after thousands of hours of use and charge cycles. I bought this one (sans the charger) on eB** because my old Sonicare wouldn&#x27;t charge. I suspected the battery, but it turned out it&#x27;s the charger, so a new one&#x27;s on the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the newer model of the e5000, the &amp;#34;HX&amp;#34; designation. The basic design is unchanged from the older model, but it has a different battery and some other welcome improvements from the E series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t know, the Sonicare is an electric toothbrush, but differs from other brushes in one major way. Instead of a mechanical system, it uses a sonic oscillator in the handle to vibrate magnets in screw-on brush head. The magnets are attached to rigid metal &amp;#34;struts&amp;#34; that provide counter pressure to oscillate the brush head and cause it to vibrate side to side 3000+ times per minute. The oscillations work to vibrate water molecules in your mouth that work between your teeth and gums to remove food, plaque and tartar many times better than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnets never touch the handle, so there&#x27;s no mechanical drive system. It&#x27;s super simple and reliable, which I like. The handle and charger are permanently sealed and completely waterproof. The brush handle contains a rechargeable NiMh battery that lasts quite a long time. The older Essence has a NiCad battery that didn&#x27;t give as much runtime. I found myself charging it once every 5-6 days with normal use. This one will definitely last longer, and hold a charge better. The battery won&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; as easily unlike NiCad cells, so it will stay functional longer. I only get about 2-3 days out of my old Sonciare now. It took all night to charge as well, so it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compliment the new battery, the toothbrush also has a new feature that gradually increases the intensity of the sonic action to help acclimate you to using it, as it takes a little bit to get used to the sonic action. It took me about 2 weeks to get used to the sensation and the vibrations. It also has a smart timer (the old one does too) that turns the brush off after 2 minutes to let you know you&#x27;re done. It will also remind you when it&#x27;s time to charge with a blinking light on the power button and a beeper that turns the brush off. You can continue using it, but eventually it will turn on then turn off after a second. The new design also has rubber strips on the side for control when your hands are wet. This is the most welcomed feature, as the old one would slip out of my hands occasionally when wet and slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are disposable and really expensive (about $12 each, cheaper if you buy them in volume), but thankfully last a long time. Philips recommends replacing them every 2-3 months, but I&#x27;ve stretched mine out to a year with no problems. The heads are skinny and long, so you can reach way back into your mouth to get all your teeth. My wisdom teeth are in, and they don&#x27;t need to come out, but it&#x27;s critical to keep them clean and my Sonicare is able to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also affordable. It does the same thing as the more expensive Sonicares, sans some features for more than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as function, it works great! I went almost 2-1/2 years without going to the dentist, and went I finally was able to go in, they said my teeth were spotless- no cavities- nearly no plaque buildup. Gums were perfectly healthy too. I credit it to the Sonicare. This won&#x27;t replace flossing though, so make sure to floss before brushing (as recommended by my dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripes for this, despite the improvements is the cost of the brush heads. Also, they seem to collect every manner of filth and goo that builds up on the inside. Gross. The handle is also bulkier and heavier. There&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re a new user the sensation might be unbearable. Not a major detriment, but this may turn some off to it. My wife hates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;New non-slip handle&lt;br /&gt;Smart timer&lt;br /&gt;Easy Start helps new users&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush handle is bulky&lt;br /&gt;Heavy&lt;br /&gt;Brush heads are expensive&lt;br /&gt;Sonic action can turn some off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic oral health tool.

            <li> A very good toothbrush. My previous Sonicare had a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; built in every 30 seconds to notify me when to change the area of tooth brushing. Maybe other Sonicare models come with this feature, but I wish mine did.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge longer then a week of use which is a plus.  My last model was a little more advanced.  This one is a good basic unit.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare electric toothbrush.  First one lasted over ten years!  I will be at 80 when current brush gives up!</li>
            <li> I had this toothbrush for awhile but lost it in a move. Glad this deal came around because now I remember why I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> The filing would have failed eventually, but it does vibrate rather violently. It vibrates so hard that it really bothers the arthritis in my hand. On my teeth it was extremely painful. Apparently it starts out easy and then works up to full power after a several uses. I don&#x27;t want to experience full power. I suppose I can use it to remove grout or sand my deck or mix up a 5-gallon bucket of paint. (Yes, I am exaggerating for those who have no sense of humor or cannot otherwise tell the difference). I do have very sensitive teeth so it is truly I fine product, but alas I cannot use it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Two stars indicate &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t like it because I paid $50 bucks for something I can&#x27;t use. I have put the brush in my mouth, so I won&#x27;t return it out of personal ethics. I would hate to think that someone at Philips would recycle a toothbrush, but you never know.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but the automatic built in break in period is just about right. If you think you don&#x27;t need a breakin period for your gums, you can cancel the timed break in of 12 uses.  Very powerful, a little noisy. Brush does a very good job. Brush seems a little soft and not sure it will last 3 months as advertised. But it should be close</li>
            <li> I had seen this item for a much higher price, and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it was the same as my husband&#x27;s toothbrush; it was, and I paid less than half what he paid.  This is an great toothbrush, and my dentist has said he seens an improvement in my teeth with less tartar.  You will not beat the price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, is holding up very well and it cleans SO well! I researched this before buying it and it got excellent reviews and I found that it&#x27;s easy to get replacement heads for it. The only thing to watch out for is to keep your mouth closed as much as possible or be prepared to clean your mirror LOL! Very glad I got this.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and neatly wrapped in an easy-to-open package.  Is easy to use, does the job, and I much prefer it to a standard, non-electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great. It takes the guesswork and manual work out of brushing. I know how long I need to brush for and it is doing all the work for perfect strokes. Teeth are noticeably whiter and healthier ever since using.</li>
            <li> I liked my old one better. they changed the chargers &amp; they don&#x27;t work together.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Charges quickly and easy to travel with.  We have an Oral B brush and this one and like both equally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for about 5 years.  Though this one is an older model than I previously owned, it did what I wanted, which was to turn on and automatically run for 2 minutes.  Plus, the model fits the toothbrush heads that I already had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they have always been of high quality! One thing that has surprised me is how long the batteries last.  That said, I do wish the batteries were replaceable, but on one of my units like this they lasted for about 10 years before the batteries gave way and the whole unit had to be replaced, so that&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to explain how good this product works.  You will need to buy it for yourself to see.</li>
            <li> Bzzzzz bzzzzzz. I can brush my teeth much more effectively and efficiently with this brush. It starts slowly and whenever I use it, it gets powerful to help beginners learn how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use it without charging the battery for about 2 weeks. But I charge it weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very simple design and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> This is another product I highly recommend. Don&#x27;t bother with all the extras - they are not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;This basic toothbrush is all you need. A++</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as our old one, but serves its purpose.  I sure hope it lasts longer than the old one!</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Was replacement for Sonicare that died. Does not have the 30 second alert but that is OK.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since December and its fantastic.  The charge lasts a while, stands straight up on the sink and the travel pack is very nice.  Have had zero problems, teeth feel very clean and the head is taking some time to wear out.  Very happy I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really gets deep into the crevices and kills all germs.  It&#x27;s powerful and love that it comes with a portable bag for my future travels.</li>
            <li> good, i like it.it is worth to buy. I was very pleased to find an electric toothbrush this cheap - the brand and type were &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34;, and while using it the first few times was very strange, that&#x27;s just electric toothbrushes in general... a week after having it, it felt perfectly normal to use and works great. My teeth do feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> Amazing Customer Service!!!!! I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for the past 10 plus years.  I will say their customer service is second to none!!! The battery has failed a couple of times and they have replaced it under warranty no questions asked!!  The customer service is worth it alone!</li>
            <li> What can I say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Sonicare&amp;#34;  could not have gotten a better price than Amazon price - wish it would have had different packaging though - everything seem is included, but it came in a brown cardboard box instead of the nice packaging in the stores.  Would refer this to anyone - Very Happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, and I looked online for brands available. The Philips Sonocare has a good reputation and had the components I was looking for.  It has been working well for me so far &amp; I feel that it does do a good job in keeping me teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Extremely loud and very painful to use! Did not like it at all!</li>
            <li> works better than my dentist said</li>
            <li> Excellent. Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> make its work very good. its lets my tooths very clean. the battery life is long. i buy a set of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is way better that my old electric toothbrush. After brushing, my teeth feel as if I just returned from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wince at the cost of replacement heads though. I guess I will worry about that when the bristles are worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual has instructions on how to remove the batteries for disposal when they wear out. Once the batteries are shot, you have to throw the toothbrush away. On line registration gets the warranty extended to 2.5 years, so I figure it will last at least three years. Even if it fails right out of warranty, having super clean teeth would bring me back for another Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING. Works fine until you screw the head off and realize that due to the terrible design, water leaks in causing disgusting build up. I take care of it, I dry it off after using it, but there&#x27;s no reason a product meant to get wet should have this problem. I don&#x27;t want mold coming anywhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great clean feeling! At first my teeth were sensitive because I wasn&#x27;t used to such high force of a vibration from a tooth brush, but it is nice!</li>
            <li> I owned a toothbrush like this about 10 years ago, but after several years of use by my husband and me, it eventually wore out and we didn’t replace it. In the meantime, I used manual toothbrushes and more recently, several battery-operated brushes. But nothing can compare to this Sonicare brush. It makes your teeth feel like you’ve just been to the hygienist, and with regular brushing (I brush my teeth twice a day), the Sonicare has removed a lot of the stains on my teeth that had built up while I used the other brushes. It’s is a bit pricey, but because I have gum disease and the above-mentioned stains, I went for the best, and I’m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this Phillips Sonicare.  The head is comfortable, and the way it vibrates seems effective for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought it to replace my old Oral B, which I liked quite well, but the Phillips is even better. My only concern is that a replacement head is probably going to be pricey.</li>
            <li> Over many years we have been very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift.  Each time he uses it he says his teeth has never felt so clean...so I think it is doing it&#x27;s job.  It&#x27;s well made, not too heavy and the stand isn&#x27;t bulky at all.  It&#x27;s too tall to fit in the medicine cabinet, however we can adjust the shelving.  Overall, great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these for my family. These our first electric toothbrush. My kids are complaining about the odd sensation but they get used to it and now couldn&#x27;t use manual toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li> I had the older model that has the 30 sec warnings. This new on for the price is just great, gets less dirty inside due to new design and I didn&#x27;t really need the 30 sec warnings so the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> Had my original for 15 years and it finally wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge.  Only toothbrush I would use! And the one my dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sonicare electric toothbrush for my husband.  This is his first one.  He is very happy with this model.</li>
            <li> I had a similar Sonicare for years and when this one arrived it worked fine for a few weeks....you know they run for a certain length cycle then shut off.  Anyway, the cycle  keeps getting shorter (most of the time) and has to be restarted.  And no, the rechargeable battery is not at fault.  It keeps a full charge all the time.  There is just something wrong with the time cycle electronics and to me it is not worth the trouble sending it back.  Though I will keep using it, it is not the quality  I paid for!</li>
            <li> this electrical toothbrush is been a blessing discovering for my teeth...the price is fair</li>
            <li> This unit replaces one I had purchased years ago.  It&#x27;s a nice replacement but just one complaint... At times the head will vibrates itself loose. It doesn&#x27;t happen often and It&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t work with. I&#x27;ve charged this unit and took it a 7 day vacation and it kept its charge the entire time. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Tooth brush stopped charging after 3 months of use. This is very disappointing since my previous toothbrush lasted over 5 years. My first Soniccare lasted over 10 years (the plastic turned yellow but the brush still worked perfectly. Maybe this is a one off quality problem but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is one good toothbrush . Very satisfied with this product. I highly recommend this toothbrush . But expensive heads</li>
            <li> Good price! Works well. I have it 3 years now, still working. I use it everyday. For the price and how long it last, a good good buy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not sure why rust forms between the charger and the brush....everyday. But otherwise great!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple months. Great product which creates a wonderful clean feeling that normal brushing can&#x27;t quite match. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I only wish these were available when i was young.  Probably would have saved thousands in dental bills over the years (crowns/etc).  Just get one.  I bought one for the wife and for myself.  I plan on putting all my young kids on them as soon as I can.  Even bought one for the mother in law!</li>
            <li> replaced my old worn out one.&lt;br /&gt;does the job.&lt;br /&gt;timer is great.&lt;br /&gt;keeps the choppers fresh.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I wish I had done this years ago.  I love it more every day</li>
            <li> I am a retired dentist, and have been using this brush for many years....it is the best.  Purchased this one for my father-in-law.</li>
            <li> The price on this for a Sonicare was too good to pass up.  While it&#x27;s a good value, there is a noticeable difference in how it operates compared to more expensive versions.  This is the lowest end model that I&#x27;ve ever bought (I&#x27;ve own Sonicares for around 12 years now) and the velocity seems to be a lot less than other models.  You may think that once you get past umpteen thousand strokes per minute, you might not notice, but you do.  You definitely feel cleaner with the more expensive Sonicares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on a tight budget and want a replacement for a manual toothbrush this is a good buy.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for something that cleans a lot better than a manual toothbrush, get one of the more pricier models.  This is what I&#x27;ll do next time.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this based on recommendation from my dentist&#x27;s office.  It holds a charge really well, I only charge it maybe once every 2 weeks.  My teeth have never felt so clean after brushing!</li>
            <li> I had purchased one before and I loved it. It lasted several years.I replaced it with this one and was so unhappy. It did not last 30 day before it stopped working. If I would have known of the short return time frame I would have sent it back sooner, now it&#x27;s past the return policy time frame. I am out the cost and have a tooth brush that does not work. If you buy one learn the return policy before you waste for money.</li>
            <li> Charges quick and the wife is back in action again. Good quality as well. I would have liked an extra charger though.</li>
            <li> Seems like they&#x27;ve improved this basic model since I had one about eight years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth and gums feel very clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery indicator light appears to be working properly. What else do you really need from an electric toothbrush?</li>
            <li> I live in Kentucky where most of the residents are missing one or more teeth due to poor dental hygiene.  I really want to keep all my teeth until the day I die, so I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for years.  I always have great check ups at the dentist.  The Sonicare is beautifully and elegantly designed.  It works great, and unlike that other brand, it will never get clogged up with gunk.  There is no better way to brush your teeth!</li>
            <li> The basic model gets the job done--no need for any fancy features.  My teeth and gums are in good condition because I have been using Sonicare for years.  I bought an extra one to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes are great for my teeth and gums. I am happy with the product. I highly recommenf this item.</li>
            <li> Simply Amazing.  It is a joy to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best!  I use it everyday and bring it to work in the grey pouch.  Thank you Philips for creating a great product that keeps me healthy and happy.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush rocks! It feels like I&amp;#34;m using a professional tool from the Dentist&#x27;s office when I brush with this toothbrush! I am on a mission to improve my gum health and I brush twice a day with the Philips Sonicare and use dental floss twice a day and rinse with a mouthwash twice a day and I can tell that all the extra steps are making a difference. Can&#x27;t wait to go back and get a good review from my Dentist. I&#x27;ll be shocked if things haven&#x27;t gotten better!</li>
            <li> Love love love this toothbrush. This is actually my 2nd. It is the most basic sonicare tooth brush, but it&#x27;s reliable and works great. My dentist highly recommends them. Holds a battery charge for a long time. My husband can travel for a wk w/o taking the charger which is nice. The price was the same as the 2013 Black Friday deals at all the big box stores.</li>
            <li> My expensive programmable Sonicare died the day before my surgery and rehab. My wife bought this bargain basement version on Amazon and I found that I love it. She brought it to the hospital where I charged it once and it remained charged for a month through rehab. This cleans my teeth perfectly and with daily flossing has allowed my teeth to remain free of decay and gum breakdown through several hygienist visits.</li>
            <li> this thing removes plaque, it is unbelievable. i have the just left the dentist feeling everytime i brush my teeth</li>
            <li> This is a terrific toothbrush. It cleans so much better than a normal toothbrush.  I especially like the low profile, which makes it easy to clean your teeth in the back</li>
            <li> I have probably purchased over one thousand items on Amazon but this is my very first review. I bought a Sonicare FlexCare Plus which is a higher end model costing four times as much. While I question the efficacy of cleaning your teeth with what seems to be nothing more than a vibrator, my immediate frustration is from a support standpoint. Philips provides a two year warranty which may have been carefully considered to avoid having to replace too many units that could result if it were just a bit longer. After 23 months, mine failed. After two lengthy chat sessions with &amp;#34;customer support&amp;#34;, and sending my receipt in twice over a period of a month, I still have not received my authorized replacement. A third chat attempt tonight ended with, &amp;#34;I am so sorry but the system is under maintance [sic] and I am not able to locate the desired information. I request you to [sic] come back tomorrow and we will be happy to locate the shipping [information] for you.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I replaced an older battery-powered Sonicare with this because after a point, the batteries became somewhat difficult to maintain contact.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how clean the Sonicare makes my teeth feel (it was initially recommended by the woman who cleans my teeth) and how it helps keep plaque under control.  The charger works very well and the brush unit holds a charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to improve my gum health after my last cleaning.  I had used the less expensive Oral B brushes in the past, but didn&#x27;t like them because they hurt my teeth and gums.  This toothbrush does a great job cleaning my teeth and gums, but feels much more gentle yet leaves my mouth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Sonicare quality product&lt;br /&gt;-One of the best electric toothbrushes on the market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Gen 2 Brush head (will grow mold if not taken off and dried correctly each time you brush)&lt;br /&gt;-carrying case instead of extra brush head&lt;br /&gt;-NI-MH battery&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive for what it is now&lt;br /&gt;-No 30 second timer beep (don&#x27;t really need it, but some people are spoiled, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, I could have gotten cheaper on Black Friday with an extra brush head too. Oh well, the carrying case is alright. After about 2 weeks use, my teeth are healthier, whiter, and smoother. Sonicare brushes do work, if you don&#x27;t have one, or know a family member that doesn&#x27;t. Do yourself a favor and spend a little to save you teeth for the future, unless you want dentures.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is an excellent replacement for the old Sonicare with the dying battery. The soft case is more convenient than the plastic case that was part of the old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Like the toothbrush it works well. I would like it better if it had adjustable speed settings. Overall good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are great. You do need to remove the head and clean these pretty well between each use because the head of the brush can collect stuff in it.</li>
            <li> My first sonic toothbrush arrived the first of 2013 and I fell in love.  It wasn&#x27;t a Philips and quit working in the late Summer.  I bought this to replace it and love it more!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold with wide handle.  I seem to be able to reach all areas well.  Easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t take up much space on bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li> I have used a sonicare toothbrush for years and my gum disease and gum recession has been stopped.  Now my teeth only feel clean when I use this brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they have just been cleaned by the dentist when I get done brushing.  I love the two minute timer. I am sure I have never brushed for two minutes in the past.  Great price, great item, highly suggest.</li>
            <li> My college son wanted an electric toothbrush after seeing a few friends have them.  His friend uses a $200.00 version.  He has been very happy with his electric toothbrush at more than half the price!</li>
            <li> Does not have 2 speed settings or the 30 second interval timer, but if you don&#x27;t want or need those features, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> very nice toothbrush.  I had a sonicare before but it finally pooped out.  nice to have a new one.  always get very good checkup reports from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare for quite a few years, and received a new one from my husband. Mine was not worn out, but he thought I could use a new one. Not knowing this I bought him his first one and he also likes it. It was recommended my our dentist, and after my last check up he said he never saw my gums and teeth look so good. Anyone with gum disease I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I chose this as a gift for my husband.. He loves it! The price is right and it does everything it says it does.</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare product I have owned.  I loved the first one; purchased in 1999, it lasted for more than a decade.  At that time, Sonicare offered only limited variations of their unit; it was prior to Philips purchasing the company and expanding the product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past two years I have purchased three more units, two for myself and one for my son, none lasted for more than one year.  The one most recently purchased, in July of this year, is unable to operate after 30 seconds.  I am sorely disappointed in the quality degradation.</li>
            <li> My husband was in great need of a new Sonicare Toothbrush. We have always bought Sonicare and trusted the name.&lt;br /&gt;This one was on sale and had a coupon through Amazon. I checked all over online, no one could beat the price, and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;My husband was happy for the super $$$ deal and his teeth will be cleaner. Thanks for the Awesome Price Amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent sonic toothbrush.  Great service, arrived in couple days &amp; price was same as the lowest prices advertised in local stores.  Better clean than a standard toothbrush, highly recommend.  Also, great tool if problem with lessened arm muscle strength or stamina.</li>
            <li> The price is good and it works very well. The only thing is it is a little bit big and heavy.</li>
            <li> I often travel internationally and am gone for two weeks at a time. This toothbrush holds a charge long enough for me to make it home again with a still sparkling smile.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the basic Sonicare model because it was so cheap. I don&#x27;t find myself wishing that it did anything more than it does. My teeth feel cleaner after brushing with the Sonicare than with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product! I highly recommend this. You will notice a difference immediately. I brush twice a day, sometimes 3, and this takes it up a notch to a cleaner experience.</li>
            <li> And I gotta say...I know it&#x27;s weird, but it cleans so great, it makes me want to lick my own teeth! I know...strange. But it&#x27;s really great...will never go back to manual.</li>
            <li> Like others, not a big fan of how the toothbrush head extends to the toothbrush arm.  All the toothpaste runs down and gets into all the creases.  As soon as im done using it, i disassemble and leave it separated to dry.  Otherwise, there will be moldy goodness between the attachment points.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. Great product for the price. Came fast and was able to give as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gives great results with clean feeling and looking teeth.  The bristles and soft and soothing to the gums.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and a great buy! I had this toothbrush before and when it needed to be replaced, I bought the same product again.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Sonicare for approx. 20 yrs. I guess it finally died of old age. I tied another brand for about 6 mo. and wanted to return to the Sonicare.  I prefer the compact head for the smaller size and can do a better job cleaning. The brush supplied was the standard or full size. I usually have a hard time finding the compact size in the stores so I order replacements online.  My dentist recommends this brand since it does a super job. I highly recommend this product for anyone that wants cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is good for the price. It requires more maintenance since you have to unscrew it and drain the water out after each use. If it wasn&#x27;t for that, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> No need to spend a lot of money at Costco for a lot of features you do not need.&lt;br /&gt;This has it all, and the travel case is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice brush better than Braun. Replacement head are expensive thou so 4stars because of that. Clean very well head worn quic</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.  If you need an ultrasonic toothbrush, this has all you need!  I wouldn&#x27;t use the case for airport travel - get a rigid case molded for the unit to protect it from damage.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a small tooth brush she could take with her on trips. This one was on special and I bought it. She likes it.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist recommended I buy this. It took awhile to get used to it, but it works just fine so far.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years. I bought my first one 20 years ago when they were 100.00 bucks so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> The rave reviews for these sonic brushes are true....much better cleaning than my old Oral B electric.  The buzz is a little hard to get used to, but the 2 minute timer is a nice touch.  The downside is that foam and saliva get under the brush housing, you have to take the brush off and clean it once in a while.  When this one wears out I will get the newer.. more expensive.. design.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Sonicare.  This model does not have the different speeds that the older one had but I never used those other speeds.  It does as good a job with my teeth.  Good product!</li>
            <li> I wish I would had bought this years ago!  I have periodontal disease(had). After surgery, I purchased a Sonicare toothbrush from Amazon. My teeth feel clean and my periodontal visits have been very positive!  I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare.  They are great toothbrushes.  My last one had &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; and made it easier to know when you had brushed each section of your teeth for the right amount of time.  This model does not have that feature.  I miss it.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this brush a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush feels great on my teeth. There are a couple of changes I would love to see, however. My previous sonic toothbrush (from another manufacturer) had 30-second notifications while brushing. In other words, brush one quadrant for 30 seconds, then switch to the next, etc. It was a nice feature to have. The biggest problem I have with the Sonicare, though, is that when one reaches the 2-minute mark, instead of just pausing to indicate the 2-minute brushing period has finished, the toothbrush simply stops. If one prefers to keep brushing, it means turning the toothbrush on again. I prefer a notice that gives me the choice to keep brushing or not.</li>
            <li> A great investment for my teeth and gums, I think this electric toothbrush works extremely well. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No timer to let you know when to move to another area and you cannot buy &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristles for it... or at least I couldn&#x27;t find any.</li>
            <li> Excellent- a traditional toothbrush can&#x27;t get under my braces. This works great!</li>
            <li> Love that teeth feel so clean, Took on a trip&lt;br /&gt; and charge last four complete days and still had charge on return home.</li>
            <li> The sound is loud, I wish that the rechargeable is universal so it can be carried on travelling to other countries where have different output.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. They love it. It has the two minute timer. That is great. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This device is quiet and easy to operate. It arrived fast and was priced fairly ( a bit less than the reatil stores).</li>
            <li> After five years using my old Sonicare toothbrush of the same model, it would only hold a charge for 15 minutes of brushing.  I had to buy a new one because the battery would no longer recharge long enough.  This toothbrush is the new version of my old one.  I charged it once and so far haven&#x27;t had to charge it for the last three weeks. As for cleaning your teeth, it cleans your teeth extremely well without using excessive force like traditional tooth brushes do.</li>
            <li> Excellent improvement on the design.  I have used this brush for approx. two months, with great results.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve used Sonic for years, now and I have never been disappointed.  This is a very good unit.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We bought 2 of these in August, 2013.  I absolutely hated mine.  When we replaced them last spring I found that water had entered the handle.  While I felt that this created a major opportunity for health problems, we did not experience anything&lt;br /&gt;i worried about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The other double set we ordered is reviewed elsewhere - it&#x27;s just terrific.</li>
            <li> Basic model, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I just love this sonicare electric touthbrush. It is gentle but does a fantastic job.Also easy to buy additional brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and Amazon is the best place to buy it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks of receiving the Essence it stopped holding a charge after about 30 seconds. The company replaced the handle and the new handle only lasted a few days before it stopped holding a charge. They replaced the charger and that didn&#x27;t cure the problem so they sent another handle. That stopped holding a charge after just about 3 days. For me, three times and you are out. It&#x27;s back to Oral B for me.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to find, but the Essence series Sonicare toothbrushes are excellent for cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this after I had some gingivitis problems.  Now I never have to go to the periodontist! This toothbrush is easy to use, stays charged for 14 days so it is great for vacation, and it really cleans&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is when you first use it, it does tickle a little bit, but that goes away quickly&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone.  I bought my daughter and my husband one, and they love it</li>
            <li> got it based on orthodontist recommendation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my son says it brushes his teeth well, but his lips and cheeks are numb by the time he finishes cleaning around all his braces.</li>
            <li> This has happened with the past 2 sonicares I&#x27;ve purchased. They last for a few months but then end up losing their charge, and stop vibrating the brush thistles as much as is necessary to be useful. I&#x27;m returning to non-electric toothbrushes because these are just too expensive. Perhaps there&#x27;s a higher quality alternative to Philips on the market... not sure</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really brushes your teeth like no other!  This bristles are just the right level of softness and they hold up after several weeks of youth.  My teeth feel so clean after I use it!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied shopper! Awesome product, works great, just as described, at a reasonable price and received the product in one piece within no time.</li>
            <li> definitely has helped maintain my gum line which was receeding a bit.  this is my first electric toothbrush so I was really struck by how clean (un slimey) my teeth felt after use.  note the replacement heads are pretty pricey in general which adds to long term cost.</li>
            <li> Avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush does a good job where it fails is in its longevity. This is the second Sonicare that failed in about a year&#x27;s time. This is not acceptable. Manufacturers need to design product for the longer term while asking buyers to pay a premium for their product.</li>
            <li> I already had one of these for myself and bought another for my daughter who just got braces after the dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve had a sonic toothbrush.Teeth feel much cleaner than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and the brush does clean the teeth as well as whiten them.</li>
            <li> I never got this Toothbrush.  The watch is great but no toothbrush I have no idea what happened but I am nbot happy</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for same model that he&#x27;s had for about 6 years.  He loves it, and obviously it&#x27;s had a good life span.  I replaced mine (after about 5 years) with the Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush which I prefer because it&#x27;s much smaller to hold, and travel with (holds about a 2 week charge), and brush replacements less expensive.  But for the big guy (or gal), the Sonicare is great.</li>
            <li> Definitely see an improvement in my teeth and makes brushing so much easier</li>
            <li> Teeth feel really clean. Gums get a nice workout too.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Phillips Sonicare--I love it!  Travel bag fits perfectly into small cosmetic bag or shaving kit.  Charge lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> We really love these electric brushes they do a great job and the timer is very handy. I would recommend these to anyone who likes having healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this all the time and like it very much.  When my teeth are sensitive, I can put it on the SENSITIVE setting and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like the stronger setting can.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, the only problem is the charging. The brush has a mind of its own; sometimes the charge lasts for a while other times it shuts off on you while you&#x27;re brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But great product, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for many years; I ordered replacement brushes for it.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. If you&#x27;re never used an electric toothbrush before, prepare for a whole new world. Your teeth just feel a hell of a lot cleaner, and dentists tell you your teeth look great. This is an incredible value at $39.99, as this model used to be more like $100. Don&#x27;t bother with any of the more expensive models, this one does what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> I had my Sonicare for over 12 years, so I bought one for my husband and he says it cleans the best he&#x27;s ever had.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago, after a couple of years of nagging (recommendations) from my dental hygienist. Had my annual check up yesterday and my gums are actually healthier than they were a year ago!  The only change I made to my routine was switching from a manual toothbrush to Sonicare. It&#x27;s super easy to use and effective. I highly recommend getting one.</li>
            <li> Used in combination with my water flosser.  Got a A-1 from my dentist!</li>
            <li> I have avoided paying the money for a Sonicare toothbrush, because I thought my re-chargeable Oral B with the spinning head on it had to be just as effective.  But when I saw the $10 coupon off of this $39 model, I just had to give Sonicare a try.  Boy, was I surprised!  The effectiveness of the cleaning and the gum stimulation made me a fan with the first brushing session!  Unlike others, I have not had a problem with mold, icky fluids, or anything else in the handle because I try to rinse it out with every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone who is reticent about spending big bucks on a Sonicare toothbrush.  You&#x27;ll see that they&#x27;re definitely in a class of their own!</li>
            <li> Works great, as advertised....just be aware that this does not come in retail packaging.......</li>
            <li> I love this. Much better than an oral-B.</li>
            <li> Great price for a good product.  Strongly recommended for best dental care.  The Philips Sonicare is a product that works well and keeps the teeth and gums in good condition.  What else can one say.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price I paid.  Excellent !</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new Sonicare. I had an old one for 10 years, so I was excited to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I like it but I miss the 30 second timer that the old models had</li>
            <li> We are glad these are still available- they work well for us.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t want an expensive toothbrush but was due up for a new electric one. He loves this toothbrush! It&#x27;s larger than the standard models so it&#x27;s easier for him to hold on to. Great product, packaged well, and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, I was told to get of of these toothbrush and I am happy I did.</li>
            <li> Just used this thing for the first time and all I have to say is WOW. My mouth feels 20x cleaner than when using a regular toothbrush. It&#x27;s powerful, toothpaste splattering everywhere so keep mouth close lol. Only thing I find bothersome is having to use a flat head screw driver just to open when needing to replace batteries other than that it&#x27;s amazing. Love my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is our fourth sonicare toothbrush.  The second and third ones still work-we just thought it would be nice to have a spare for the future.  Our dental health has never been better!!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush at the recommendation of our dental hygienist.  I tend to brush very hard and have some wearing of my tooth enamel. This toothbrush helps in that area.  This version of the Sonicare was to replace our old one, which is still working but the battery is close to dying.  It doesn&#x27;t make it for a full brushing (unless you are cutting it short.)  The one feature I miss on this new version is the tones.  The other version had 3 tones that told you when to change from front to back and top to bottom.  I know it sounds lazy but it was really nice to know that you had evenly covered brushing all of your teeth.  Still a great toothbrush, all-in-all.</li>
            <li> I just happened to see this go on sale for a low price and it was a Christmas gift and my sister just loves it.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush finally died after about 12 years of use.  I bought this one to replace it and have been happy with it.  With the new e-series brush heads I did have problems with water collecting inside.  A few times I opened it and it was black and mildewy inside!  Eeeeuww!  But after reading other reviews, everyone said to take it apart once a week to clean it out and let it dry.  I&#x27;ve been doing that and it&#x27;s been fine.  If you do that, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with mildew forming inside. I hope I get another 12 years out of this model!</li>
            <li> This Phillips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a replacement.  Great quality, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> We could not go a day without this product! We have not found anything better for leaving your mouth clean and free of bacteria, even when just brushing with water.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Philips Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;d had for the past five years which I loved. This however is significantly inferior. The stem is MUCH chubbier than standard electric toothbrushes and is unwieldy to hold. Furthermore, while brushing it sounds very rattly. You do not get the impression that it is doing a good job. I don;t know what to do as I discarded all the packaging assuming it would be brilliant but it is unusable to me.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. My teeth are feeling very clean! As other reviewers have said, the design allows water infiltration into the cavity between the brush head and the motor, that *could* allow for mold growth. However, a little preventative maintenance once and a while keeping it dry would stop this. Take it apart once a week, and dry it out! For 40 dollars you can&#x27;t find a better tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was good but expensive, $130. I wasn&#x27;t happy when it stopped working after three years. When I tried to fix it, the best advice I got from Philips was how to dispose of it. They steered me to the Essence ($40 on ebay) and gave me a code for 15% off. It doesn&#x27;t work unless you buy it from them at $60. Gee thanks, guys. I&#x27;m looking into Oral B and other toothbrushes instead.</li>
            <li> It works so well. My teeth feel the cleanest ever from just brushing.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I feel like my teeth were cleaned by the hygienist after every brushing. Where do I buy replacement heads?</li>
            <li> super clean teeth. readily available new heads. extremely cheap. the carrying bag is also pretty nice to have for transport.  thanks.</li>
            <li> Better than others.  A reasonable price for the same level of oral care compared to other models.  Easy for travel.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed to find that the 30 sec interval timer is no longer on this model of Sonicare.I have used this product for years. If it is mentioned on the carton it must be in the fine print.</li>
            <li> So this is what it feels like to brush my teeth with a high powered vibrator. This thing seriously vibrates. Like crazy. I like it. Definitely  a clean feeling after brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I do like the Sonicare electric toothbrush. I have gum troubles and this method of cleaning is essential. When my old one quit after 10 years I was in a hurry to replace it.  I find it convenient and reliable.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works way better than i expected it to. it is a great buy for the price for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare, but this version is so stripped down that you HAVE to clean it frequently or the moisture inside gets gross.  It&#x27;s worth the upgrade to a better version and one that has the intervals to tell you when to switch to cleaning other areas of your mouth.</li>
            <li> OMG, my head was practically spinning the first time I used this due to the intense vibration!  I&#x27;ve looked high and low for the racing stripes on this thing but can&#x27;t seem to find any.  For me, this sensation is fun and enlivening, though I imagine it would be too intense for many people.  My gums actually tickle when I use it, and the very first time, toothpaste splattered on my shirt and on the bathroom mirror.  If you are elderly, disabled or a young child, this might not be the right choice for you.  For me, however, all this power makes me feel like my teeth are getting really clean.  My previous toothbrush was a Braun Electric Plaque Remover, which had a much gentler but still effective vibration.  I&#x27;m enjoying the elongated, narrow brush head, which is similar to that of a standard toothbrush as opposed to the Braun&#x27;s small rounded brush.  The long, slender brush seems to allow me to gain better access to the harder-to-reach areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This replaced our old one, the kids never get cavities anymore!  Best product I have ever purchased for oral health</li>
            <li> this is my second sonicare brush. The first one was broken after 3year usage.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare replaces another similar one which we had for many years that stopped working.  We expect this one to be every bit as excellent as the original one.  A travel case was a nice added bonus with this purchase and the price we paid was excellent.</li>
            <li> This brush has a two minute timer, but does not have a 30 second split timer. My Oral B, which was way more expensive, has a 30 second timer so I can hit all 4 quadrants equally.  It is minor, but it is something I miss. Other than that, I love the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for several years and enjoy the toothbrush. I&#x27;m glad they included a travel case, but this model does not have the LED power indicator. I would hope in the future Phillips makes it easier to change out old batteries.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is absolutely fantastic for the price!&lt;br /&gt;For ~$30, this toothbrush really helped me maintain a clean oral hygiene routine.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 minute timer is fantastic and gives me some insight in how long I should be brushing for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the battery is great and lasts ~2 weeks using it twice a day. The included wireless charger makes charging a breeze. However, charging does take around ~8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel kit was a nice touch that I enjoyed using whenever I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am incredibly happy with this purchase. I just wish that the replacement brushes were cheaper...</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one we&#x27;d had for many years, and still worked, but was falling apart.  First time I used it I realized it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second incremental beeps.  I thought they all had that, but apparently not.  Otherwise it&#x27;s fine, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a different version of Sonicare.  I probably prefer the slimmer model to this one, but I do like this one.  It certainly works well and does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.  Easy to charge and operate.  Toothbrush does a great job and I get great checkups at the dentist.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love the travel pack this toothbrush comes with. It automatically shuts off after two minutes so you know when you are finished brushing. I have been using it for a couple weeks and it has held a charge so far without needing to be put on the base. I will probably end up getting this as a gift for my family.</li>
            <li> I picked this up to replace a sonicare with a dead battery....&lt;br /&gt;it works great... and dont be fooled... all the other versions of sonicare&lt;br /&gt;work exactly the same as this one does.... it just does not have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bluetooth...programmable... internet capability smart technology... blah blah blah whatever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and who cares... its a frickin toothbrush... the last one of these I had was one step up the scale and it went off after 2 min to inform me I was done... seriously.... I can figure that out on my own....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one does something radical.... it cleans your teeth.... and leaves you the hell alone.... Id call that pretty perfect!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are the best thing since homemade Apple pie. If you don&#x27;t have one you should. This was a steal at the price they sold for. The battery life is awesome also.</li>
            <li> Was a replacement for one I have used for a long time. Also a very good value. Easy shopping method.</li>
            <li> I am well satisfied with the product, which I use at least twice a day.  I expect to order an additional brush after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I sent this back after using it 3 days and cannot get a refund.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Sonicare that I had for about 10 years.  Love this one too!  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! My teeth have never felt more clean and looked better! I love this pr</li>
            <li> The head is alot more compact than my previous Sonicare, it comes apart to put into travel case.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new or replacement electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush works fine.  But it does not have the feature that pauses every 30 seconds.  A feature that is for me,  needed.  It is a signal to change the area you are brushing.  Currently, I have to count to cover all areas uniformly, time wise.  I would gladly exchange it for one that has that feature.  I would very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The travel case fits nicely and the base it actually a good feature but the tooth brush one has one timer. It runs for 2 minutes and then stops. The one I used to have would beep every 30 seconds so you knew you were getting every section of your mouth with equal time. Seeing as Im adult and I can typically brush my teeth thoroughly enough not to need this feature, Im okay that its not there. I just didn&#x27;t think the newer models wouldn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush...doesn&#x27;t have the quadpacer feature but it isn&#x27;t really necessary to get the job done and the price is great!  Arrived as hoped for, quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This model did not have the 30 second timer in it, but it is OK as the clock in my head is pretty much right.</li>
            <li> Lost when my last electric toothbrush died--thrilled with my new one! Clean, clean teeth again--yeah! Highly recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush works great&lt;br /&gt;Cleans teeth well and keeps charge&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for a family or friends&lt;br /&gt;Does a wonderful job</li>
            <li> The sonicare works as well as any electric toothbrush.  I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 sec timer my old sonicare had.  That means you have to have a clock handy, and remember to look at it,  in order to get all your teeth brushed before it automatically turns off in 2 minutes. I do like it because it fits the old brush heads I had.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with Amazon Prime! Free 2 day shipping and unbelievable pricing on almost every item they sell! This same toothbrush would have cost be double locally, but I was able to order a new one after I dropped and broke my old one right from the comfort of my own home! Well done Amazon :).</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean and I finally brush for a full two minutes (goes by quicker than I thought).</li>
            <li> We bought this pair of toothbrushes to replace a much older pair that must have been over 10 years old...we immediately found out that the battery had been improved so that they did not have to be charged so often...they are sturdy and really clean your teeth...I swear by them because they took me from the brink of periodontal disease to healthy gums...</li>
            <li> I finally got a very good electric toothbrush that actually works. It is a little loud but good for you</li>
            <li> my family has been using sonicare for years.  we love it.  our dentist always has good reports for us too.</li>
            <li> Is this worth $40? You bet. HOWEVER, there is one major problem with this set which is why I gave it 3 stars rather than 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Sonicare&#x27;s most basic model, and, honestly, for most people this is all you&#x27;re gonna need. The handle is a little bulkier than other models, but I don&#x27;t find this a big deal. It also doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;beep\\&quot; after every 30 seconds to tell you it&#x27;s time to change the part of the mouth you&#x27;re cleaning (you&#x27;re supposed to use it 30 seconds each on the insides and outsides of the top/bottom of your teeth, resulting in quadrants that evenly space into the recommended 2 minutes of brushing), which I admit would be a handy feature, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter. I more or less guess when it&#x27;s time to move parts of my mouth and my teeth feel squeaky clean afterward. It&#x27;s like a sandblast for your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There IS the issue of wetness getting into the toothbrush and causing mold, but... uh, if you take the time to actually clean the toothbrush, this is NOT going to be an issue. Once you&#x27;re done with your mouth, you can unscrew the brush head, and then easily separate the brush itself from the dome casing, and rinse both off. Then dry with a piece of tissue, and use the damp tissue to wipe out the inside of the handle. Then - and this is the rub - put it back in the charger but DON&#x27;T screw on the brush head until you&#x27;re ready to use again. This allows air to circulate through the unit and you won&#x27;t experience mold. Yes, it&#x27;s a little bit of maintenance, but the whole thing takes less than 30 seconds. The instructions with the Sonicare say to do this every other week or so, but, really, it&#x27;s not going to cramp your style to do it after each use and an ounce of prevention is a pound of cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the toothbrush functions well, and if you care for it properly you&#x27;re not going to have problems with cleanliness. I would recommend this model to anybody who&#x27;s looking to really up their dental hygiene game and doesn&#x27;t want todrop a mint on the more lux models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why three stars instead of five? IT ONLY WORKS WITH 110 VOLTAGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this incredibly stupid. Sure, the charge on it will last about 2 weeks&#x27; worth of regular usage, but I work abroad regularly for periods longer than 2 weeks and need to be able to work with 220 volts. I have no idea why Sonicare doesn&#x27;t make a 220 volt charger with this, or give it 220 volt charger capacity. The higher grade models allow for a wider range of voltage, so it&#x27;s not as though the technology isn&#x27;t there to make the brush able to function in countries other than the United States and Canada. This is particularly irritating to me, since I work abroad regularly and would like to be able to use my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, I&#x27;m glad I got this unit at a mega discount (got some mad coupons before buying), since I won&#x27;t be able to really use it for too long. I&#x27;m planning on giving this one to a relative and purchasing another model off ebay since I am not happy with the manufacturer for this and don&#x27;t want to give them the satisfaction of buying a better model direct. I realize that I should have done a bit more research before buying (my fault); however, I think the fact that it ONLY works on certain voltages and you can&#x27;t even use transformers to make up the difference is pretty heinous because it forces you to buy a model with more bells and whistles than you want, just for the ability to charge it in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you travel abroad frequently, do NOT buy this model. If you stay in the US/Canada, there really isn&#x27;t a need to go for the more expensive models as this one will do what you want it to do (clean your teeth) and is worth the full cost.</li>
            <li> It is effective and convenient for use. It is worth to buy for price offer. I definitely recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the the that died.  The battery seem to last longer too.  Great product and great cost.</li>
            <li> would buy again...if I needed another one. Travel case is nice to have. pretty much a basic sonic care. which are great. Amazon is awesome</li>
            <li> I wished I had gotten a sonic toothbrush years ago. What a difference from a regular toothbrush. My teeth are so much cleaner after a brushing</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clear my tooth completely. Also have a package for travel. Special price 39.99 is worth.</li>
            <li> A really good toothbrush and great value. This was a replacement for my first one, which I have used regularly for approximately 4 years.  The original one was still working, but would no longer hold a charge for more than one brushing, so it was not any good if I needed to be away from home for a few days.  These toothbrushes really help with periodontal disease, my dental hygienist recommended it, and it has helped tremendously.  Highly recommend Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to but great  once you use it a few times.I recommend it.way better than my old oral B</li>
            <li> All the power and clean teeth without the stupid bells and whistles. Just right said Goldilocks!! Good, fine, neato and well done.</li>
            <li> Does not take up much space, Works well &amp; fits well in hand. Yes I would recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Great price.  After just a few days of use, i noticed the difference in the brightness of my teeth and combating tartar and plaque build up.  I really struggle w/ plaque build up and I brush and floss religiously.  The only down side is when the brush bumps against my teeth when it is on.</li>
            <li> This replaces a previous sonicare that wore out, This one shuts off after the recommended 2 minutes. Now if I would just use it more often. It works great. I have to take the brush off every other week and clean out the well where toothpaste has dripped down the shaft &amp; it is a little hard to get inside with fat fingers but a damp handkerchief works great.</li>
            <li> I still cannot believe my last Sonicare Elite lasted as long as it did. After 7 years the battery would only run for just under 2 minutes on a full charge. Buying another one was a no brainer. So far, this one works just as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this model manufactured by Philips .  A positive brushing stroke produced sonically to clean teeth.Simple recharging system and lasting battery technology. In my purchased model, I received a coupon for replacement cleaning head.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that replacement head will be needed every ninety days to make the most of the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> I have had an electric toothbrush for over ten years by the same company.  They r easy to clean, and assemble. Buying the heads r also very easy. One can buy the. At Costco, Walmart or bed bath and beyond,  there not cheap but there worth the price. The toothbrush is very simple to use, all u have to do is press the green button.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy the toothbrush at Costco but they were selling two for 80.00 dollars and I wanted to buy one for my mom. I went online and I saw that it was a better deal buy it on amazon. The toothbrush can go up to 5 days without having to be charged. The phone is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that every time u change the head of the toothbrush u clean the entire toothbrush. The seal connecting the head of the toothbrush and the body is not a water proof seal. Water will penetrate and it has to be cleaned.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve always wanted a spin brush and this one has been good so far. I like that it comes with a travel case to protect it. I move around a lot so its nice to have. I bought this a few months ago and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush arrived very fast and it is great.  I had the same series tooth brush before and would order again if the need arises.</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using a disposable battery-operated toothbrush, which I loved and which I do still like a great deal.  But this Philips Sonicare Essence 5600 Rechargeable is even better.  I have a VERY small mouth, so I LOVE the size of the brush head... it allows for reaching all the way back!  My teeth feel truly clean.</li>
            <li> while its nice to have this toothbrush for cheaper than it was on the market ten years ago (over 100 for this same design)- i hate how sonicare just took the beeping function off just cuz ---  they needed a reason for you to want the 80 dollar one.  but it works. i like it. my dentist likes that i like it. you should think about getting one. if you know what im talking about with the &#x27;beeping&#x27; than you&#x27;re seriously looking into this - and therefore would direct you to spend an extra 40$ because this toothbrush will last you a while. plus the 80 dollar one has a different industrial design which is cleaner, thinner, and therefore, better.</li>
            <li> I tried a Sonic electric for 6 months but had problems with plaque buildup. After using the Philips Sonicare less than a week the plaque was gone. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how much cleaner this brush gets your teeth!  I usually travel for work and sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to pack it up and just use my manual toothbrush for those few days, its then that you really can tell and it makes you wish you had taken the time to pack your electric one!  I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for this price. Philips Sonicare makes good products to meet the consumers budget. My last toothbrush was just a different model. This was to replace it not an addition. Wish i had spent a little more money and gotten one with the beep feature that tells you to change position. The only reason for not marking it 5Star was due to not having more features. However,as stated above, for the price its a really good product.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s, my daughter&#x27;s and son&#x27;s and my Sonicare all stopped working simultaneously after probably 10 years. I bought 4 of these as replacements, and like it almost as much as the original.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a sonicare toothbrush for a long time. I picked up this edition because of the price and the decently good reviews. I haven&#x27;t used any other electric toothbrush aside from the crest spinbrush, but I do not care for the vibrating sensation. If the plastic so much as touches my teeth I feel like they are going to shatter. Just brushing with this makes my skull feel like I am being electrocuted. I really wanted to like this and I really wanted the super-clean, white teeth results, so I tried using it for a whole month and a half. I can&#x27;t say that it made my teeth feel any more clean or look any more white than my Colgate Optic White toothbrush and toothpaste. In fact, the latte seems to work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because I may be somewhat biased because I&#x27;m not a electric toothbrush aficionado and someone who is may find it suitable to their oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> love the sonic this is my second one, my first one lasted 10 years , I was amazed so when it was time to purchase another one , I wanted the same one! It is great and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> 2nd one.  Took to England, battery lasted entire trip.  does a great job on the teeth.  Glad we bought it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it did not have the quad timing as my other Sonicare brush did.  I really liked that feature and was not aware that the one I purchased did not have it.  But that is probably my fault for not checking more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush to replace my old brush that finally gave out after 5 years daily use. This thing works great and I&#x27;ll keep replacing them with the same as long as they keep holding up this well. Great product.</li>
            <li> lite,easy to use,holds charge when traveling,cleans teeth with little effort,relatively inexpensive,can replace brush as required,compact with small footprint,indicates when charging,cord adjusts to required length,auto shutoff when cleaning complete</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I began using this product. I knew Sonicare has a reputation for quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect that much from this lower-priced product. Boy, was I wrong! I love the timing feature that keeps me on track with brushing time and I especially love the clean feeling I get after using it. I recently took a trip for a week and didn&#x27;t pack the charger. Didn&#x27;t need it. It lasted the week with no trouble and the small carry case is really handy for traveling. All-in-all, I&#x27;d say this product is well worth the money, and then some.</li>
            <li> Can happily say I&#x27;m never going back to other toothbrush brands again. You can literally feel the difference in the amount a sonicare brush cleans.</li>
            <li> Make the kitties purrrr with the Sonicare + [[ASIN:B005GO5C3U Colgate Optic White Toothpaste, 4 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. After three uses on the initial virgin settings, my teeth are a couple of shades whiter. If you&#x27;re one of those rich people that brushes their teeth everyday, you may or may not get the same results. The design flaw that lets a minimal amount of residue into a cavity is really negligible as it can be easily rinsed out. I try not to get the handle wet. Also I would recommend draining the initial charge on the new battery by normal use and then charging it for the recommended 35 hours on its first time. I also do not recommend charging the handle every time you&#x27;re done brushing. Very few people have that many teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great - my teeth have never felt cleaner and my dentist gave me positive scores at my last visit.  I have had it for at least 2-3 months and have had to charge it only once or twice since it&#x27;s initial charge (I use it once a day). My only complaint is it is quite loud to the point that I can&#x27;t use it in the morning if my husband is trying to sleep later than me.  I don&#x27;t know if other models are quieter but it may be worth considering if you tend to be the first one up or the last one to bed and don&#x27;t want to disturb your partner.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to try these?  I don&#x27;t know, but I really like the way my teeth feel.  I thought that the vibration would tickle too much but I got used to it and now don&#x27;t even notice a tickle.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them polished all the time now.</li>
            <li> Well designed product. I am using it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> After I started using Sonicare, I can&#x27;t do without it.  Makes my teeth feel so clean.  The first few days it took a little getting use to.  I felt like I was getting drilled at the dentist.  But after the initial adjustment, I use it every day.  I even take it camping as I have gotten lazy about moving my brush.</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for my 11 year old who just got braces.</li>
            <li> sent me the wrong model when i was informed it would fit several brushes I had,</li>
            <li> I had other sonic toothbrushes, and I was disappointed when I came to this one. I choose it because it was cheap, and said it brushes the same as the more expensive ones, but I was wrong. This brand is good, just not the toothbrush. Pay $20-30 for a better one.</li>
            <li> Right priced. Works very well so far. Can definitely feel a difference. I&#x27;m curious though if using this high speed sonic technology 2-3 Times daily will wear down my gumline. For now once a day use.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clearly cleaner than using a regular toothbrush. Additionally, I love the two minute timer. It keeps me honest. There&#x27;s also a thinness to the brush that makes it quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I went this long without this product in my life.  The toothbrush is perfectly priced for the super clean feeling it provides. I now have metal braces and this ensures a thorough clean. Excellent battery life (up to 6 days when fully charged!).</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this so I got one for myself and another for my Mom on Mother&#x27;s day!  I opted for this one because of the price, its amazing and I feel confident that I&#x27;m taking care of my teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush stopped working within 20 days. Even after being on charge for whole night it stops within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Great buy and great for your teeth!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as my old one. My old one got ruined in a power surge which ruined the base. The old toothbrush still works- I use it for my travel kit. These hold a charge for a few a week or 2. I have been using this for 1 and 1/2 years- still working good.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the much more expensive model I had before it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This was great for the 1st year, but then soon after, the blue plastic on the sides and base of the toothbrush began to melt when I charged it, leaving a sticky, tacky melted blue plastic goup all over the place. Whether I charge it for 30 min or an hour, doesn&#x27;t matter, it instantly begins to melt!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds like my old one did so you know when to switch quadrants. In the insert it says it does but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare...the first one I left behind on a trip, 2nd one I&#x27;m still using, and this one is a back up. I love using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product is simple and easy to use.  No muss - no fuss! It totally fulfills the &amp;#34;Keep It Simple Stupid&amp;#34; paradigm!</li>
            <li> Will not work after 6 weeks. We have had these before and loved them. This one stopped working after 6 weeks and can not be returned.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for years. It finally could not hold a charge past a day. I bought this thinking it was across the board replacement. Not so. The 2 minutes are not broken up into 30 seconds, pause, then continue. It&#x27;s 2 minutes continuous. I looked at the detail at Amazon. It did not state this. I called Phillips and brought this issue to their attention. Still it doesn&#x27;t take 30 seconds to brush each side and back. But it was not what I saw or expected. That why I give it a lower rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard now that it has reached full capacity.  It&#x27;s the force of the motion on my teeth that feels too hard.  I&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Sonicare Toothbrush for several years. Recently when mine broke I decided to try another brand. Although it worked okay, it just doesn&#x27;t do the job that Philips Sonicare does! This is the brand I will stick with for good! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and good product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking to upgrade to an electric toothbrush for quite some time now but didn&#x27;t feel like spending so much money.  I was initially eyeing this one a few months ago when it was $59.99 or so and couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much on it.  However, when I saw the price dropped to $39.95 I was much more willing to shell out the cash.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for just around a month and I have to say, I really do love it.  I didn&#x27;t want anything crazy fancy with multiple speeds or functions so this toothbrush is perfect! A simple on/off button that runs for 2 minutes and shuts off when it&#x27;s done. The only thing that isn&#x27;t a problem so much as a slight inconvenience is there is no indication how long you&#x27;ve been brushing and/or how much longer you have until your 2 minutes are up.  But it&#x27;s not the end of the world! Overall a great electric toothbrush that I do not regret buying.</li>
            <li> Came as described, been using almost a year and no problems at all!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works amazing and it&#x27;s a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> So much more affordable, then the retail stores</li>
            <li> Buzzzzz. Takes a little while to get used to it (tickles at first), but it&#x27;s kind-of like going to the dentist but without the exclamations, &amp;#34;Do you actually floss?!?&amp;#34; etc.</li>
            <li> everyone in our family owns one and we love them!</li>
            <li> Worked right out of the box. Every time I use it I feel as if I just came out of a dentist appointment.  The brush head is a little on the small side, great for teeth brushing but tounge brushing is a little tedious because of the brush size.  Still a great product!</li>
            <li> There are lots of gadgets on the market that are designed to automate day to day tasks, such as electric can openers and electric razors.  These things may do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, but they don&#x27;t do much that you can&#x27;t already do manually.  The Phillips Sonicare toothbrush is not  like that.  It gets your teeth clean in a way that you simply never could do with a traditional toothbrush.  It may clean even better than the cleaning you get at the dentists office, and it whitens teeth that you didn&#x27;t even realize were stained.  It doesn&#x27;t abrade the gums.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product; it is simply amazing.  If you are on the fence about whether to buy one, don&#x27;t hesitate.  Buy one.  I have never used any other electric toothbrush so I can&#x27;t compare, but I doubt that any other type of electric toothbrush could be as good.  One word of warning: the first 2-3 times you use it, the vibration tickles the inside of your mouth a bit and takes some getting used to.  After the first few uses you no longer even notice it at all.</li>
            <li> Great product. My original one finally died and this one was less expensive but works very well. So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Had an inexpensive electric brush to try which was loud. Now with this brand -is quiet&amp;efficient.Good value.Will see at next dental exam if better results-I feel if will be yes.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric brush.  At first, &amp;#34;yay!&amp;#34;, its a nice step up.  I have no major complaints except for the 2 minute timeout.  I brush for 2.5-3 minutes and don&#x27;t need a freaking nanny to tell me when to stop.  I have to stop brushing, reposition my hand, press the power button, and then continue just to work around this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a child, I could understand how it may encourage proper brushing time (BUT NOT TECHNIQUE!). But for an adult who knows how to brush their own teeth properly, FORCING a 2 MINUTE SHUTOFF is ludicrous and annoying enough to me to justify a one-star rating.  They could have easily included a switch to toggle the behavior off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, unscrew and regularly clean the cap if you get this.  Otherwise mold will build up beneath - there&#x27;s nothing like having a bunch of nasty black mold on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare,my first being a higher end model-more features. This model is very basic, which is what I wanted. It fits the existing heads that I just purchased before my other one died, which I had for many years. Hopefully this model will last as well!</li>
            <li> I thought my last one was broken. After this new one began to fail I realized the outlet it was plugged into was intermittently working!</li>
            <li> ...with a Sonicare toothbrush! Trusted name in dental care and works as expected. This being my first Sonicare toothbrush, it does take some getting used too at first as I could really feel the vibration on my teeth as it cleaned and polished, but I guess thats to be expected considering the quality of the device. This little baby is charged up and ready to &amp;#34;get the job done&amp;#34; each morning when I grab for it. I just hope it endures (time-wise) like my OralB vitality toothbrush of 7 years did!</li>
            <li> Previously, I owned an Oral B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush. I used it for approximately seven years until it slowly died, sometimes stopping short of its two-minute clean, sometimes not even able to start it at all. I finally gave in and looked up a new electric toothbrush to purchase, after all, who can go back to a plain old regular toothbrush after using an electric one? This Philips Sonicare popped up as the best seller/one of the highest ratings. I&#x27;ve now been using it for roughly a week. The brush head is a tad longer, and narrower than my previous one. I has a two-minute timer, but it does NOT have the 30-second intervals to remind you to switch to a new section to clean in your mouth. I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because while it does clean my teeth quite well, I&#x27;ve noticed on a few occasions that it has made my gums bleed. Also, if my teeth slightly touch the back of the brush head while cleaning, it clatters quite a bit on my teeth. If, as they say, this is the &amp;#34;gentler version&amp;#34; during the first two weeks of use to prepare you for the real-deal mode of teeth cleaning, I am a bit nervous. I don&#x27;t think my teeth/gums are sensitive, as I floss almost daily without bleeding gums. Nonetheless, it does the job and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this since I already had own one before. However, my dentist highly recommended I but one. Apparently, it was noticible because the next time I visit my doc noticed the difference and asked me what was I doing differently because she noticed the difference. This thing even cut time on my visit. I was outta there sooner than usual.</li>
            <li> Great product... I would buy again if lost or broken... I highly recommend... I&#x27;ve had one for the past 4 years and love it...</li>
            <li> And a very good recommendation it was.  Easy to use and clean.  My only complaint is that the replacement brush heads are quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for five weeks, when trying to brush my teeth yesterday, it would not work and will not recharge. Now I can find no way to get a replacement for a faulty product. I have had very good service from Amazon until this!</li>
            <li> After 6 years my original gave up so I purchased the Essence 5600.  Looks about the same and works just as good.  This is a great product and works as advertised.  Teeth feel like they have just been cleaned and my dental cleanings are a lot less painful.  I will probably stick with the Sonicare products forever.</li>
            <li> I have one of these that I have used for years.  This was a present for a dear friend.  I will never use another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The third one I&#x27;ve had in about 15 years.  Works well.  Slim profile.  A good size for an average-sized mouth - not too big.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go for the more expensive ones from Sonicare.  This is all a you need.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second.  I lost the first one in a hotel while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It holds charge for over two weeks, so don&#x27;t bother to pack your charger.&lt;br /&gt;I had the first one for over 2 years and it would probably have gone longer if I had not lost it.&lt;br /&gt;With the water pick water flosser this gives the best care for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people rate this product less than five stars.  Who needs a beep to signal it&#x27;s time to move to another section of teeth??!!  Give me a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model works great, and IMHO why spend all that extra money on a model that has bells and whistles?  I&#x27;ll admit I grill my steaks with a timer, but need a timer to brush teeth?  Nope.  If it stops and you&#x27;re not finished just turn it on again and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low price&lt;br /&gt;works great&lt;br /&gt;Happy wallet&lt;br /&gt;Clean teeth&lt;br /&gt;Happy mouth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  Somehow I had refills for this model but not for the newer  ones  - so i bought this one for a really good promotional price on Amazon.  It works as well as the newer ones - just a few missing bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Nice for a very good price. Not happy with the brush though. It is too soft. I know you need to use a soft toothbrush, but this is beyond the soft ones I used in the past.</li>
            <li> My dentist is happy I switched to this (from regular toothbrush)! It&#x27;s also easy to travel with. It lasted 2 weeks without being charged.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t really know the degree to which my Sonicare helps me until my next dental appointment in December. I have been plagued with plaque despite two a year appointments and regular brushing. If my using this makes my dental hygienist happy then I&#x27;ll be happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to operate exactly as advertised. The two minutes sometimes seems to go on forever but that suggests that one of my issues has probably been not brushing long enough :-)</li>
            <li> This just vibrates. I was hoping for circulating brushes.</li>
            <li> I had this same tooth brush 8 or so years ago, and somehow lost it. When I wanted a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; toothbrush I went with this again because it was cheaper than the new models. Still works great for me. It does take some work to keep it clean, though. I unscrew and rinse the two pieces out after each use.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  Ordered it for him.  Thanks much.</li>
            <li> The Philips sonicare toothbrush works very well.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted for many many years.  It finally died (it did not recharge any more).  My dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush. It really does a fantastic job. When I travel, I charge it before I leave and it typically lasts at least 1 full week before needing another charge. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the motor really kicks butt!  it shakes so intensely that you feel only a need to press very lightly.  so at ~$64 you feel good it was a good deal and that it should last forever.  so i recommend it TO EVERYBODY.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive teeth and gums.  My teeth were whiter withing a week after using this product.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Massages gums and does a good job of cleaning your teeth. I would definitly buy this toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> The old one died after 5 years of usage ! so ordered this one loved the new blue color line !</li>
            <li> This thing will rattle your brain. My teeth have never been so clean. I&#x27;m going to buy two more for the family.</li>
            <li> Started using this electronic toothbrush about 9 years ago, at my dentist&#x27;s suggestion, and just now had to replace it.  Since using it and doing my daily flossing, I have only had my teeth professionally cleaned 3 times in the last 9 years.  I have saved a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my sonicare. I&#x27;ve been considering one for years and I could absolutely kick myself for balking at the price. This wonder wand leaves my teeth clean and scrubs my gums with the vigor they deserve. Set up is relatively easy with simple instructions. My girlfriend and I share a sonicare and swap the heads. If only someone would make a good bathroom caddy for this.</li>
            <li> All SonicCare brushes get my teeth noticeably cleaner than any other brushes I&#x27;ve tried. This cheaper model is good as, or even better than, then more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Works well, Looks nice.  Inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Between this and my new water pik my dental hygene is so much better. This tooth brush is much more effective than both regular and the other cheaper electric ones I have tried. The 2 minute brush timer is also perfect to make sure you clean for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare products and this one did not disappoint.  A great way to get the kids to brush 2 minutes at time. Very fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonic toothbrush and I felt the need to replace the old one when it cease recharging. It does not, however, replace manual|mechanical brushing and I would not recommend using it alone as the only toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I gave this rating one star because I couldn&#x27;t give it zero stars.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Sonicare and told my daughter to get it when she needed a \\&quot;cheap electric toothbrush\\&quot;. Unfortunately I hadn&#x27;t had enough time with the brush to realize that it traps dirt in all of the crevices and spirals that interlock the brush head to the handle. The brush head pops out from the brush cover and is coated in spirals of  - who knows what? Bacteria? Mold? I&#x27;ve used scalding hot water, used Q-tips to clean in the crevices and still - it won&#x27;t stay clean and gives me the creeps to think that this is going into my mouth. I&#x27;ve used Oral B in the past and I sorely regret changing brands. At one point the motor stopped working and it took an unreasonable amount of time for the company to replace it. They stated that they were \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; and I would have to wait. Really? You make toothbrushes and you&#x27;re \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; for the electric mount? Please take my advice and don&#x27;t waste your money. As the saying goes \\&quot;cheap is dear\\&quot; and this is \\&quot;cheap and disgustingly filthy dirty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after I use it and I took it on vacation and it was off the charger for 5 days and still worked.  I was worried that it would die while I was on my trip but, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Good price - great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Second Sonicare we have bought.  First one still worked but Phillips stopped making the brush heads, and no notice they were so one could stock up.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a little too flimsy, plus the head is not as large as the older models.</li>
            <li> Bought a Sonicare for my daughter who is leaving for college. I have had mine for about a year now- still works great.</li>
            <li> UPDATE  June 2015:  I still love this brush, a caveat:  Change the brush head much more often than you&#x27;d think - every 2 months - it works SOOOOO much better with a new brush!!!  Also, swish (don&#x27;t swallow) about a teaspoon of 3% H2O2 (peroxide) with your toothpaste for a ridiculous clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is amazing!  I&#x27;ll just say this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a manual brush, I notice a film of plaque reforming after 12 hours or so.  I thought this was normal.&lt;br /&gt;Well, imagine my surprise when after using the Sonicare, my teeth remained squeaky clean for 3 DAYS!  Yes, I experimented to see how long I could go without accumulating plaque. This device cleans the mouth SO thoroughly, it&#x27;s scary; the junk I spat out after the first use was truly frightening!  All that bacteria that had been damaging my smile were dislodged with stunning completeness! The Sonicare literally vibrates the plaque out from under the gum-line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely wish you try this item for yourself.  You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, in the case of travelling overseas - when fully charged, you&#x27;ll get about 20 uses on a single charge...enough for a 10 day trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about the design: I advise simply unscrewing the brush-head after every few uses and cleaning it with peroxide or just plain H2O.  This will keep any gunk from accumulating inside the apparatus. It takes about 20 seconds to clean it, so it no big deal, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is economically priced and functions flawlessly to give you a clean you thought only a trip to the dentist could give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find my review helpful, please give it an up-vote; I really appreciate your feedback!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;PeterThanks,&lt;br /&gt;Peter</li>
            <li> Only con the brushes are expensive, otherwise I like it better than a normal brush or I would say much better</li>
            <li> I was replacing an older model.  I like this toothbrush very much.&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that the traveling bag was not included in the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole Symonette</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me that m teeth were clean. It was the first time she&#x27;s ever said that to me. I like to think she was proud of me.</li>
            <li> great price and great product !</li>
            <li> The brush is too small, it doesn&#x27;t have the 15 sec. timer, the handle is too small, and no matter how I wipe it off after brushing, it has toothpaste on the charger after sitting a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend lots of money on different electric toothbrushes over the last few years because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $80 on a high end model. Recently the philips sonicare dropped in price so I snapped it up and I LOVE it! My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had a cleaning at the dentist every day. Awesome quality for the price. The one thing I&#x27;ve found is I had to purchase a toothpaste for sensitive teeth because the run of the mill tooth paste was too much with this intense brush.</li>
            <li> This is a mid-range electric toothbrush and so far, I haven&#x27;t missed the power windows and moonroof. The vibration is strong enough to blow (most) of my plaque away AND embarrass me at the airport when picking up my luggage.</li>
            <li> Have had several Sonicare toothbrushes over the years and love them.  Should have ordered two at this one&#x27;s super low price.</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive version of this toothbrush.  When I found this one I wondered if it would be as good.  It has exceeded all my expectations its a great toothbrush especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush so it took me a while to get used to vibration. Once I was pass that stage, I would never switch to a regular toothbrush. The automatic timer makes you actually brush for 2 minutes, so no more half-a.. teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks and love the clean feeling. Had always used a manual brush before but really like this now.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it&#x27;s she said she brushes 4 or 5 times a day know</li>
            <li> I only use Sonic toothbrush and am very happy with it</li>
            <li> We have Sonicare products for several years and can imagine being without them for any length of time.  This most recent Sonicare works well for us, as we expect it to.  Before Sonicare, I tended to hurry my brushing and didn&#x27;t get as thorough a cleaning as I get now with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> We have been using this toothbrush for 14 years now, (2 of us using the same body, on our second one).  When I went to my dentist for my checkups, he told me, &amp;#34;you have good hygiene&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t take my hygienists very long at all to do my cleaning!  They last a long time, of course you have to replace the heads regularly.</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price</li>
            <li> it makes your gums tingle (which I believe my dentist said was the point).  But watch out, keep your mouth quasi closed while using otherwise the toothpaste shoots out everywhere.  This product cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> stopped working a fter a few months</li>
            <li> works great and it really makes your teeth feel polished like coming from the dentist, you just have to get used to the vibration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as my old Sonicare which lasted more than 5 yrs. The bristle is stiff and smaller, the cleaning cycle which beeps 4 times does not work. Somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> Philips makes more expensive models, but they have a bunch of features that I am not sure I&#x27;d use. I chose to get this bargain model and save $50. It&#x27;s a little noisy but I&#x27;m happy. My old one finally quit working after 15 years of use. Once you use an electronic toothbrush you&#x27;ll never want to switch back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare since the early 90&#x27;s.  I never floss, yet I&#x27;m always told at the dentist I have no plaque.  Sonicare also tightens up my gums so they cling closer to my teeth, and whenever I have a sore spot on my teeth or gums, I apply the Sonicare for a few minutes twice a day, and the problems clears up.  This is because the sonic waves eliminate bacteria causing the infection.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Holds a charge for a week using it 1-2 times a day.</li>
            <li> Works great - great price.  Replaced our 10 year old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> works well, but my daughter says it is too powerful and it is uncomfortable on her gums.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectation.</li>
            <li> I purchased the HX5610 for my SO and she loves it, she&#x27;s been using it for almost a year now and regrets not making the switch to a premium electric toothbrush sooner. She use to use one of those Oral-B electric toothbrushes but the vibrations and strength of a Sonicare absolutely blow those away, it&#x27;s not even a comparison. It also came with a soft travel case which was nice as well. And a tip for owners, always unscrew your brush head and clean it out every few days, if you don&#x27;t the mold it can build up in there is truly revolting, it&#x27;s one of my main negatives of owning most electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is soft with the bristles.</li>
            <li> Great item, motor is definitely better than my previous one. Great for cleaning back molars. Teeth feels smooth like when you return from your dentist!</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for the same model.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift, recipient likes them.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much as I tend to put too much pressure and brush too hard. This is a soft rotation which is perfect for me. But if you like it harder, this is not the product for you. I like the cover on the brush. The other brand I had a plastic cover that was hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the one I left at a hotel</li>
            <li> It worked fine but when resetting it back in the charger, water had accumulated underneath  the toothbrush part of the connection and leaked out onto the charger.  Don&#x27;t know how the water leaked into it while in use.  I needed to detach the top, rinse out the compartment after each brushing.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush! It is everything advertised!</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare tooth brush previously so I knew what to expect.  I like it and the fact I didn&#x27;t have to go out shopping around for it after my dentist suggested I might want to try using one...again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love it.  I can&#x27;t go back to manual tooth brush.  You can get a good deal on replacement brush heads at Costco.</li>
            <li> Fabulous toothbrush!  38,000 rpm brushing up from gumline towards teeth cleans particles from the sulcus.  Aiming the bristles directly at the junction of teeth and gums with the brush on cleans plaque formation away.  My last trip to the hygienist got a surprised reaction and no scaling from them.  No plaque!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 is a superior way to brush your teeth. No manual brushing can equal the high level of vibrations this toothbrush can deliver in a two minute cycle, which results in a clean mouth. Sonicare suggests you use this for two minutes (30 seconds in each quadrant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not used this before, you should notice an exceptional squeaky clean every time after using this. My dentist certainly has taken notice of the lack of tartar build up. The battery lasts a long time and the rechargeable base is very comfortable to use. After using this for a while now I cannot find a negative thing to write about. Even the price has gotten more affordable nowadays. This Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 surely pays for itself in saved trips to the dentist and overall delivery of a very satisfying brushing experience every day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  I had bought a much more expensive one (same co.) but find this works just as well. It&#x27;s hard to go back to a regular toothbrush once you try these electric things.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that leaves my teeth feeling great.  I was pleased to find a good ultrasonic unit for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> love this tootbrush. had one previously and like it alot. better than regular tootbrush. comes with charger .works well</li>
            <li> Lasted me less than a year. I bought this several months ago - not yet a year. I noticed the light kept blinking and wasn&#x27;t sure why as I had it plugged in. However I noticed the brush was less effective - less power. That lasted about 2 days then yesterday, it died. Completely dead. Light won&#x27;t come on. Tried it in other outlets thinking maybe it was a dead outlet but was definitely the tooth brush.  Can&#x27;t believe it lasted only about 5 or 6 months. Of course I didn&#x27;t hang on to my receipt never dreaming It would die so soon. This is the 2nd Sonicare I&#x27;ve had. The other one lasted about 2 years I think. I&#x27;m looking for another brand this time. Probably all made in China so who knows what&#x27;s going on with them now. Piece of JUNK. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> I am using this product for less than 1 week, I am very pleased with the sonicare toothbrush and the results are visible and outstanding. Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Affordable price, great quality</li>
            <li> I admit, I was skeptical about this toothbrush. After all, it is significantly more expensive that my previous toothbrushes, and really, how much better a job can it do? But after talking to friends who raved about it, I still wasn&#x27;t convinced. But after speaking to my dentist, who also recommended it, I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner with the sonicare compared to a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush.  This is the third one I&#x27;ve had; they seem to last just over five years.  I&#x27;ve had no cavities and my gums are in perfect condition.  Since I&#x27;m 60 and have no dental insurance, I consider this a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Functions great. Handle is just too big, but i shouldnt complain for the price. Biggest down side is that bristles only last for about 3 weeks, i brush twice a day, and in my opinion those refills are way too over priced.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself and loved it so much that I bought one for everyone in my family including my 7 year old grandson. Best investment and gift ever. Highly recommend the Sonicare..it&#x27;s the best toothbrushing experience.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just way too noisy.. Leaves teeth feeling very clean. I recommend to anyone who is on a budget and want great feeling teeth..</li>
            <li> Best little brush you could ever want for travel!</li>
            <li> It does just what it is supposed to do. If it holds up for a good long time I will be ecstatic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a disappointment when a company tries to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; on what is already a rock-solid idea. This new version has a smaller head which I have yet to get used to. The brush head is a curved oval which also doesn&#x27;t feel right and wears out much, much quicker than the old style. But the worst part is the floating head. It allows saliva and toothpaste to slip into a large empty space just above the magnets that cause the brush head to rotate. The new user is not aware of this and before you know it you have manufactured a breeding ground for bacteria. The entire space turned black and emitted a foul smell. It took me three days to clean it using hydrogen peroxide and blasting the interior with high pressure from my Water Pic. If you decide to buy one be aware that you M-U-S-T clean that portion of the head after E-A-C-H use with hot water. And once a week after the brush head is dry I irrigate the interior with hydrogen peroxide to keep that area from another bacterial build up. The Sonicare continues to provide me with healthy teeth but this new toothbrush is a major pain-in-the-butt!</li>
            <li> I used to have an expensive Sonicare brush and wanted something cheaper with the same brushing power. The Essence did the trick. Just as much power as my old one and way cheaper. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t come with a timer of flat screen TV on the handle, but I don&#x27;t really need those anyway. Great buy.</li>
            <li> It is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time to use electric toothbrush, it is much better than manual one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, just not very convenient to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it is very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very good one. but the consumable is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;With a pretty carrying case, I can take it with me everyday when i am in travel.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would, very powerful.  Feels like I just left the dentists office for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this item after a coworker suggested it. It cleans like no other product. The 2 min. timer is just what you need...never realized how long 2 minutes can be! I strongly suggest you purchase one and see what difference it will make on your next dentist visit.</li>
            <li> This product has met my expectations and then some.  My teeth feel like I have just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  Very smooth and polished.  Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderfully easy to use.  This was a great price for the whole package.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it takes a little getting used to.  It does and excellent job of cleaning,  mean it gets my teeth very very clean.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush. I have a small mouth and have trouble getting to my molars. This toothbrush is very small and is perfect for me. The vibration is very strong and takes a couple of days to get used to. The first day I spent the whole time laughing and spitting toothpaste everywhere, now that I&#x27;m used to it it is fine.</li>
            <li> This is one of many Sonicares I have purchased for my entire family. It holds up well and does a great job. A good product, we have been using them for years,</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works fine, however, it requires disassemblying and cleaning every third use and does the housing have to be so cumbersome?  I have to admit, &amp;#34;Amazon delivered!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> yep, i love this tooth brush. i noticed a difference after the first use. i do not know why i didn&#x27;t get one sooner. will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have not had it too long.  It seems to be doing the job well.  There was a little friction in my mouth in the beginning, but that has gone away.</li>
            <li> Within a week the brush head started shedding .  Pieces of thin plastic were mixed in with my toothpaste .  As I was to begin a five week trip, I decided to leave the brush home and take my more dependable electric toothbrush....from a rival company.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful value as the toothbrush is easy to use--cleans as well as the larger more expensive models and can be used for travel.  A win win!</li>
            <li> After my old Sonicare stopped accepting a charge, I unsuccessfully attempted to change the battery. So, I bought this model since I still had a bunch of the now &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; screw-on brush heads. It works great. My old Sonicare had the quad-timer thing, but I don&#x27;t miss it.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush. It works flawlessly. I have noticed a difference in my dental hygiene and whiteness after using this brush. If you want a toothbrush with timed intervals for certain parts of the mouth look elsewhere. Otherwise this is an excellent electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second unit. The battery on the first unit stopped charging after 10 years.</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel like we just left the dentists office after brushing with the Sonicare Essence 5600 Electric Toothbrush. It was delivered on time and packaged well. Happy with o</li>
            <li> Charge lasts so long. Weeks and weeks. Charges quickly when it does need charging.  Has a timer so you know how long to brush. I use mine in the shower without any issues with the water. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s water proof or water resistant but shower brushing hasn&#x27;t caused any issues w mine and I&#x27;ve had it for months.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush takes a while to get used to if you have only used a manual.  It does a good job and keeps a charge for a long time.  It also reaches the back teeth better than an manual.  Remember not to push too hard, it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for many years and always had a higher priced model. My old Sonicare finally bit the dust (I&#x27;m not complaining - I got about 8 years of use out of it) and I decided to buy the more basic Essence 5600 Rechargeable model. This model accepts the same style of toothbrush heads as my old model, so the package of new heads that I recently bought can still be used. The only really noticeable difference between my &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; Sonicare and the Essence is that the 2 minute brushing cycle isn&#x27;t broken into 30 second audible increments. I have used Sonicare for so long that I really don&#x27;t need the 30 second reminders to know when to move on to another section of my teeth. Other than that, this model meets all my needs at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a way to not have water  leak into bottom of brush from where it meets the removable brush head.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush meets my expectations.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to combat plaque and dental disease with a very good cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> With the $10 off deal, the toothbrush came to $32 with tax, a much better deal than other online retailers or brick and mortar stores such as Target. Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is as good as the original product I replaced with the newer model.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. Everytime I use it, it feels like I am getting back from the dentist. It takes a little bit of time to get used to, but yeah, its definitely worth the money as your teeth will be so much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After verbally praising this product in my household, my brothers and mother have all purchased one and are equally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Arrived promptly</li>
            <li> I think this was flawed, but I didn&#x27;t send it back.  My prior Sonicare paused every 30 seconds for a total of 2 minutes.  The 30 second pause was designed to know that you spent that amount of time on each segment of your teeth cleaning...the front of teeth on bottom...the back of teeth on bottom...the front teeth on top...the back of teeth on top. This doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; so unless you&#x27;re watching the second hand on a clock, you don&#x27;t know how much time you&#x27;re spending brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> So far the Sonicare has performed well after about two months of use.</li>
            <li> I have had one for years and bought this to replace an old one.  My dentist could tell I was doing something different.  It&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li> This has done a great job helping keep my teeth cleaner than I had been able to get them with a regular toothbrush.  For the price I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Exceptional My dentist recommend this product</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the noise and the tickling sensation, this is a great toothbrush.  Just small enough to get in all the areas where bacteria can get in.  Really makes your mouth feel clean after you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth well, massages your gums, but sounds like a Jet taking off.</li>
            <li> It works well. I like it. The only shortage is that this product can not be used under 220V.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> gift for my girlfriend she likes it</li>
            <li> Way better than the old fashion toothbrush. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest toothbrush.  I love the timer on it which makes sure I brush for long enough.  It feels so nice and leaves my teeth and gums feeling so good I look forward to brushing.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement as my old sonic care &amp;#34;bit the dust&amp;#34; after several years.  I love the product, the service and delivery was quality in nature also.  Thank  you.</li>
            <li> Great product awesome price quick delivery .</li>
            <li> This is easily the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. After using this, all other toothbrushes don&#x27;t make my mouth feel truly clean. I&#x27;ve been plagued with dental problems since I was a child (cavities, demineralization, etc.) but I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for three years now and have had zero problems for the first time in my life after averaging about a cavity a year. This product is well worth the money. It&#x27;s a total lifesaver.</li>
            <li> This was for  my husband and it is soo loud! He gets up very early for work and if he doesnt run the shower and shut the bathroom door the sound will wake me up and im not a light sleeper!&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work ok but not sure if its really better than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has this neat charging base that it sits in instead of having to plug in. It also has a fairly durable carrying bag for travel!&lt;br /&gt;If not for the noise (that sounds like a smalk jack hammer btw) it would get 4 stars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to clean it and the tooth brush ir too small for adult to use.&lt;br /&gt;The carrying bag is too soft, not good for traveller to carry it.</li>
            <li> She likes how it cleans her teeth but wishes it was a three minute run instead of the two minutes that is programed. She uses it twice a day.  However, that would reduce the run time on a single charge which is 14 days.  The toothbrush sends out a few beeps when the power is low which was at 12 days.  Came with a nice travel case.  Wife would have liked a more narrow handle.  It is a little large for her hand.  Brush size was okay for her but you can purchase other sizes.  Replacement brushes are pretty pricey though running about $12.00 each and they suggest you replace it every three months.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement toothbrush for me.  I had an HX5810 that died after about a year and a half.  This one looks exactly the same but is programmed differently.  The HX5810 would signal you every 30 seconds throughout the 2 minute brushing interval.  This one does not.  There is just one single 2 minute interval.  But, since I could not find an available HX5810, this one will do just fine.</li>
            <li> I did not need multiple speeds and found this toothbrush on Amazon&#x27;s Lightening Deals plus a Sonic coupon. There was a free extended warranty for registering on-line, so this was a great deal. I had quit using Sonic brand due to poor experiences after my first Sonic that lasted 5-years. So far, this one works great and is holding its charge. Can&#x27;t ask for more. If it fails prematurely or if my warranty is not honored, I will update this post.</li>
            <li> After buying one, I had to get two more for the rest of the family. Everyone in the house loves theirs. It makes brushing your teeth so much less of a hassle and it cleans really well in a short amount of time. If you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like rushing when brushing your teeth, you&#x27;d really appreciate this. It has a 2 minute timer and turns off automatically. Great for avoiding those moments when you brush so hard that you hit your gums with the head of the brush, in fact going slow allows better cleaning.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this recently and has really liked using it. I will probably buy one for myself soon. Seems easy to use, takes up little space and works fine.</li>
            <li> Why spend more on more expensive units?  Unless you need a water flosser or some other &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; features, this compact unit does all you&#x27;ll likely need...at a fraction of the price.  The carrying pouch makes it even more convenient.</li>
            <li> My last one finally died so I was without it for a few days until I replaced it.  I didn&#x27;t realize what a thorough job it does until I has to use a manual brush - never will I be without it again.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonicare but my wife got possession of it in the divorce. I bought this unit to replace it. Nothing beats Sonicare for really getting your teeth REALLY clean. This is the model to buy. The more expensive models don&#x27;t really offer any useful features that you really need.</li>
            <li> My older Sonicare stopped working &amp; would not hold a charge. Since I had recently purchased new brush heads for my old one I wanted a replacement that was compatible.  This one arrived promptly &amp; does as described.</li>
            <li> This model seems to be the current version of the original Sonicare brush we had 10-15 years ago.  I loved it then because of how well it cleans your teeth.  Hated the way mold/mildew grew inside of the head.  It&#x27;s still the same today.  I bought the &amp;#34;cheap version&amp;#34; Essence model for my child to use.  It is still way better for cleaning than a manual brush and even way better than the oral-B version, in my opinion. (I have had their version and went back to the Sonicare--it just didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel as clean.)  I have soaked these brush heads in rubbing alcohol, denture cleaner, put them through the dishwasher, rinsed them after each use and left off the motor so they would dry--nothing has worked.  They do come clean (as far in as I can see...) but then they grow mold inside--again.  I love Sonicare brushes but it is definitely worth it to upgrade to a model that uses the other style of brush head.  I have had the HealthyWhite model for myself now (for the last 2 years) and never had a problem with those brush heads.  I&#x27;m replacing the other ones our family uses with the higher level model.  It seems a waste before the motor has worn out but I just can&#x27;t believe this is healthy and personally think Sonicare should discontinue this model.  Clearly they know it&#x27;s a problem or they wouldn&#x27;t have changed the design on the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is my third sonicare I love it. although it doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of my last one</li>
            <li> Shipment was very quick.  I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for the past 12 years.  It finally died and I had to replace it.  Purchased this one and I&#x27;m just as happy with this one as I was with the last.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product at first but I must say I really do see a noticeable difference in the cleanliness of my teeth even after just the first use.  After using it about a month I really feel that this brush gets my teeth cleaner than my old tooth brush which was motorized but was of the 10-20 dollar variety, not exactly top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; tooth brush and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My old electric toothbrush stopped working after many years of use so I replaced it with this Philips Sonicare.  What a difference!  My teeth and gums are happy, happy, happy.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent buy. Worth the money for a durable electric toothbrush that has an expensive look. My teeth&lt;br /&gt;Look good.</li>
            <li> This was my second Sonicare and i love it. I bought the smaller brushheads to be sure i get to my back teeth easily, per dentist suggestion. Holds a solid charge for 2 weeks and re-charges in a few hours completely.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my original, and for the price it does a great job. My check ups have been great since using Sonicare. It is bulkier but it works!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an old Sonicare toothbrush. My fault I suppose for not reading the specs carefully, but I assumed all Sonicare toothbrushes had the 30 second timer. This one does not although it does have the 2 minute timer. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you are shocked at first at how strong the vibration is on your teeth, stick with it for a couple weeks and see - I finally got used to it and it works great.  At forty bux how can you go wrong.</li>
            <li> This cleans my teeth as well as the Philips Sonicare FlexCare that I have had in previous years,  Since I had to keep replacing the Philips Sonicare FlexCare  because of its faulty design I decided to give this a try since it was a fraction of the price.  I was hesitant since I was concern if it would clean as well but IT DOES!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great ,love it.Use 3 times a day.Its expensive but worth it.Gave up on tooth brushes5 years ago.great product hope they reduce the price.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.  This is the third one I&#x27;ve owned in 15 years.  The first one lasted almost 10 years, and only died when dropped on floor.  The second one&#x27;s battery died after about 5-6 years.  This is super simple to use and does exactly what it advertises!  Leaves your mouth feeling super clean and your gums invigorated.  I can&#x27;t recommend it any higher, and just bought one for my partner too.</li>
            <li> Wow! This product leaves your teeth feeling like you just got them cleaned at the dentist. The plug in charge lasts for days and is still very strong. I would never go back to a regular toothbrush. The price was also a great deal!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one. It works great and is quieter than my previous rechargeable toothbrush. Shipped quickly and I loved that I saved an additional $10 on coupon/deal offered.</li>
            <li> I recommend this toothbrush for everyone.  My dentist is also a great supporter of it&#x27;s use to reduce cavities and plaque.</li>
            <li> I always get an A at my oral exams and with bridges, the extra fine sonic vibration really makes a difference. I was very pleased that Amazon offered a single, and the price was lower than anywhere else. Not happy that Phillips makes a product that can&#x27;t be repaired. Sort of a self-serving business generator.</li>
            <li> I had a similar model with the same style of brush.  That one developed leaks:  Brown-gray goo oozed into the magnet compartment on a regular basis.  After a couple years I decided I don&#x27;t like the taste of the brown-gray goo, and it probably isn&#x27;t safe to eat while brushing.  I am hopeful this unit will last longer before leaking since battery technology is improving.  I still rate it 5 stars because it is much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning, is very easily used, and had a special feature that made it easier for the sensitive gums to adjust.</li>
            <li> First time using Sonicare and love it.  I really like the timer.  My teeth feel very clean.  Not sure what the other&#x27;s offer for so much more money but as a first time user this is good.</li>
            <li> This is a good replacement for my old Sonicare which quit after many years of family use.  Power to spare but I do miss the slight interruption every 30 seconds to let me know when to switch sides.</li>
            <li> All sonicate products are great, and this is not the exception.</li>
            <li> Works well for the money.  I had a more expensive one before that was better, but it was around 25% more.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and useful for my needs.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described. Works very well, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it and it&#x27;s still going strong after a year, I also am having better check ups with my dentist.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!! Can NOT BELIEVE I DID NOT BUY This Before ... EVERYONE SHOULD USE AN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AND THIS IS AN PERFECT ONE AND AN IDEAL PRICE ... AND IT WILL ALSO COME WITH An Extended 6 Month Warranty - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???????</li>
            <li> The brush works very well BUT it also isn&#x27;t sealed. If you do not remove the brush head every time it&#x27;s used awful gunk collects between the head and the handle and runs down onto the charger base. Ughh!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a good design. I felt it was unhygenic even though I was cleaning it with hydrogen peroxide each time. I returned it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself works fine. It cleans well, it times for two minutes etc. Cleaning it can get icky sometimes but that&#x27;s honestly not that bad. Currently I&#x27;m having difficulty removing the brush had though - it seems to be stuck on. That said,  get the sonicare Pro-Results or flex care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will want to switch brush heads eventually. They get disgusting. The pro results /flex care line have cheaper, generic but quality replacement heads. The e series  replacement heads are pricy. So yourself a favor. Pay the extra $30 for the toothbrush from the pro results/ flex care line. You will thank yourself later.</li>
            <li> You know, I would have never believed that an item like this was needed..... then I tried it.  My teeth have never been cleaner.  I do wish the head of the brush was larger..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 200lb 6&#x27;3 inch male. The brush is amazing and gets rid of a lot of plaque but the biggest problem for me is that the brush head is too small. I would recommend this brush but if you are large like me then I would suggest buying larger brush heads.</li>
            <li> Love it, best tooth brush ever!</li>
            <li> great value mouth feels very clean gentle to gums</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing what this can do with the right toothpaste. It motivate me to brush more often and it&#x27;s effectively on the cleanness and freshness of my teeth. Charging is not hard, simply putting it into the slot and it charges. Fit isn&#x27;t that great, however, as it makes an annoying sound as it jiggles around. The major cost is replacing the heads every few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my current Sonicare that is 5 or 6 years old. The old one worked fine, but when I packed it to take it on a trip (first time it had been out of the charger for any length of time) it wouldn&#x27;t recharge anymore. I had just bought a package of 6 replacement brushes for it - the old E style. So that&#x27;s why I picked this one. It is inexpensive, and uses the brushes I already have rather than the new ones. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Reliable, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and well priced</li>
            <li> Kind of reluctant for use</li>
            <li> Love it!  Does a super job.</li>
            <li> I prefer the old elbow-grease toothbrushes.  The brush that came with this is extremely tiny and the brush is angled.  The angle makes it so that you have to hold your arm in an awkward angle.  I switched back to my old toothbrush because every time I was done with this teeny little brush, my mouth felt like it could be cleaner by using my old toothbrush.  Stick to the old toothbrush, don&#x27;t be lazy like I was.</li>
            <li> Make your teeth feel clean. Good for people who brush too hard makes your teeth feel like they are getting clean even without scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun electrics, but I saw the great deal on this and thought I would give it a try.  Makes my teeth feel extremely clean and brushes thoroughly.  Also, due to its fairly narrow head, I&#x27;m able to get to my wisdom teeth, which was always a challenge with the Braun.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price. cleans way better than you would if you were manually brushing. Definitely recommended. It charges via the stand which is pretty cool and it starts and ends after 2 minutes which is the recommended brushing time</li>
            <li> Pros: Met expectations, arrived timely&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
            <li> I have no qualms about about this toothbrush. It really cleans the teeth well and I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> After the USPS lost the first order, Amazon quickly sent out another. The toothbrush itself is loud and buzzy with a small head. I much prefer my old WaterPic, (better head, quieter) but will wait till this one quits to replace it.</li>
            <li> Upgrade from batteries. Make sure you have an outlet in an appropriate place though. Nice to get away from batteries. Always strong brush if you keep it charged.</li>
            <li> The last electric sonic I had lasted for 8 years and I&#x27;m hoping this one will also....only time will tell....so far so good.</li>
            <li> Compared to the newer models:&lt;br /&gt;positives - cheaper&lt;br /&gt;negatives - very difficult to get the mold that collects inside the cap area including a rubber piece that&#x27;s permanently molded, replacement heads are pricier, bulkier, slightly heavier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;buy one of the newer models!</li>
            <li> This product was better that expected. I believe it has really help my oral hygiene and whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like toothbrush, it does a great job. The 2 minute timer is nice, because I don&#x27;t have too be conscience of brushing time. It takes a few days to get used to the feel due to the vibrations per second.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive as the technology requires some complexity. But it works as advertised, and does a great job if used daily as recommended, along with flossing!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush since my whole family are using it. Works very well and brushes your tooth well. Got tire of using regular toothbrush. I would recommend this product to other users.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is everything it says it is.  Recommended by my dental hygienest, we picked this up.  It definetly cleans way better than any other electric toothbrush we have tried.</li>
            <li> This product gets my teeth very clean and works great. I am very happy with it.  I would recommend, as it is so much better than a manual toothbrush, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Water leaked into the battery compartment upon first use. Very cheaply made, not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I gave this toothbrush 4 stars. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with it. For $39.00, it&#x27;s hard to beat. It has no bells and whistles, like the 2 minute timer in 30 second increments that I had been used to, but at this price, it&#x27;s hard to complain. Works just fine, cleans my teeth well, and I just have to keep track of the time myself!</li>
            <li> great item and great price</li>
            <li> Big sonicare fan for a long time, bought this one in late april and two months later one of the metal &amp;#34;Blades&amp;#34; in the head has broken.</li>
            <li> This is a simple sonicare.  It&#x27;s affordable and fabulous at dental cleaning -- and that&#x27;s what I want.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush with great action. Battery life is great too. However the brush itself has a cavity underneath which keeps an incredible amount of disgusting goo just after a few uses. I recommend to always take the brush off and clean after use. I found that a bit of a hassle. So I am not using this anymore.</li>
            <li> Feels like you just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> been using for about a month seams to be cleaning my teeth better. battery life is very good i would reccomend</li>
            <li> Philips makes some good toothbrushes they have the best value. I would think so, I used this a few times and got some nice smooth teeth. I&#x27;m happy with it thanks for selling</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job and is reasonably priced. It takes a few days to get used to as the brush head moves so fast. I would prefer it not shut off after brushing for 2 minutes. But this is not a big enough issue for me to give a lesser rating.</li>
            <li> Our sonic are just died after five years, and this was a great replacement.  Works like the last one and was $25 less expensive</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this purchase and I am so glad I did this!!  Teeth feel as clean as after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare and this one should last because I now have my own charger instead of sharing.  Great product that performs as expected.  Only oddity is that this unit doesn&#x27;t do the split-second pause each 30-seconds to let you know when to change quadrants when brushing like my former Sonicare of same style.</li>
            <li> No more finding just the right brush with just the right amount of energy applied.  Let Phillips Sonicare do it for you!</li>
            <li> After having about 5 battery operated toothbrushes around, I finally found my perfect rush.  I love this brush.  I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It works like a charm.  I have seen an improvement in my gums and teeth feel a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted and came as advertised. Really enjoy using it. My teeth feel much cleaner. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not so good, after using it, I find some part of my teeth is very clean, but other part not. The product partly fails to remove all residue on teeth, not with very good efficiency, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my husbands more expensive one that had died, he seriously likes this one much more as the head can reach in and get to all those hard to teach spots.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare in 20 years!  I was so disappointed when my last Sonicare quit working.  This new model is much lighter and seems to be more efficient...as efficient as an electric toothbrush can be.  I&#x27;ve very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really works great. Expect better Dentist visits. I have taken it on vacations for  a week at a time and the charge lasts for the whole week. I would not leave home without it.</li>
            <li> I like Sonicare the best. This model has the features I need.</li>
            <li> Worked out just great !!! Thx</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my sonicare that I bought at Costco a few years ago. This was the right item and well priced.</li>
            <li> I charged it right away and the charge has lasted for weeks.  It cleans really well and leaved my teeth feeling like they have just been cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that so many of my family members did not use electric toothbrushes.  Sonicare makes an awesome brush.  Cleans your teeth so well that you will feel like you do not need to floss anymore.  I bought 12 total this past Christmas for family members and friends.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my son for his birthday, the price was about half of what they retail and the store when it came it was the same thing other than the packaging much simpler. When I asked my son how he liked it he replied it&#x27;s the best thing you ever gave me Mom it&#x27;s a great toothbrush the price is right and replacement brushes are affordable.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about paying so much money for a toothbrush.  One use changed my mind completely.  If you&#x27;re expecting it to be like your standard electric toothbrush, it&#x27;s going to be completely different.  The speed this thing moves is completely faster, and really lives up to the sonic in its name.  I barely have to put any action into my brushing movements and it leaves my teeth wonderfully smooth and clean.  It also auto shuts off at 2 minutes, which greatly helps me time my brushing.  It&#x27;s made my dental hygiene  so much easier to manage,</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these on the advice of the dental hygienist who works on my teeth every six months.  She said, &amp;#34;If you invest in one, you will save time in the chair, your teeth will slowly become more white and you will really have the overall feeling of having a cleaner mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was absolutely correct.  While it took a bit of getting used to (the feeling of the sonic toothbrush against the teeth and gums), I do have to say that I have a truly clean mouth after using.  Once I read through the manual and taught myself the proper way to angle the brush on the teeth (and to keep my lips closed - lest the toothpaste spatter everywhere) - I was on my way to a great brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee and some diet sodas and teas so I&#x27;m not seeing the whitening effects so much but the fact that, after flossing and then using this device, my mouth feels like a just got out of my sixth month cleaning - is enough for me to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to look for retailers (or go back to Amazon) for replacement heads (every three months).  Makes sense to &amp;#34;keep things clean!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent item not bulky and easy to travel with. Hold a charge for a long time. Refills can be expensive but less than a dentist</li>
            <li> I like it very much! it gives me the best brushing experience! And I do not want to use the normal toothbrush since then!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and greatly reduces plaque.  Teeth feel as clean as they do after professional cleaning.  I highly recommend the Sonicare rechargeable brush!</li>
            <li> After using this mechanical brush for several months, I can easily say I am never going back to a manual brush! By the way, this is the first mechanical brush I have owned so I can&#x27;t compare it to others in this class&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through using this brush, I have noticed (no placebo effect here) that a considerable amount of plaque has been removed. Seeing this really made me happy and my teeth were indeed more white. Using this brush does not damage nor cause your gums to bleed. If anything, it feels like a slight massage on the gums. Nothing harmful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use this brush, and if it&#x27;s your first time using a battery-powered brush, you&#x27;re going to feel a lot of noise in your mouth, traveling up to your head. This is normal and will subdue after a week of using the brush. At this point, I can&#x27;t exactly recall what that feels like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few comments where people were complaining that this model brush did not feature the &amp;#34;30 second beep&amp;#34; interval, but a very simple way to counter that is just to use your smart phone as the timer. I do this every time I brush my teeth and the brush and timer are always spot on of each other. If you try to wing it without a proper timer, you might get an &amp;#34;uneven&amp;#34; sensation feel. It&#x27;s best to get a timer and brush it that way so each quadrant gets an equal time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel bag, for me, is convenient when I sleep over relative houses and the bag is water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is about this brush is the battery is sealed in the unit. Now, we all know batteries will die out sooner or later so once the battery can&#x27;t hold a charge, you will need to think about replacing it (and recycling the battery). Depending on the battery, it could be a few years before this happens (I&#x27;m sure there is probably a clever way of opening this up and replacing the battery, but I imagine not everyone can be so crafty. If I see or figure out a way to do this, I&#x27;ll possibly post an update on it). Philips recommends leaving the brush on the charger when it&#x27;s not in use so I am going to assume the battery does not suffer from the &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34;, but I only charge it when the &amp;#34;low-battery&amp;#34; indication comes on, and for me, that&#x27;s a week (sometimes I brush multiple times a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also going on Philips site and downloading the user-manual for this. It has some good tips for using this brush that I can&#x27;t remember right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic brush, and I can not go back to a manual brush again!).

            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for 2 years. Bought this for my girlfriend. We love them. no complaints. My dentist says she can see the difference. I hope that is true.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a few months ago.  During a standard cleaning of the top battery water entered the brush and destroyed it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Feels so much better cleaning my teeth. My teeth feels so clean afterwards. First time moving to an electric toothbrush and had a great experience so far. It was definitely a bit awkward at first using it but it feels so normal now. I tried brushing with a regular toothbrush the other day and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing as good of a job.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it until it become completely unresponsive after about a month.  Although I leave it on the charger nothing happens when I press the one and only button it has.  It did make my teeth feel cleaner although I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy this brand again after my experience.</li>
            <li> With the right toothbrush end, this brush is more powerful than my old one.  I have been using this product for a lot of years now.  This upgrade is even better.  If you have dental problems, this is a very useful tool.</li>
            <li> It feels different from other brand toothbrushes. More powerful.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this toothbrush and is now taking pleasure in brushing his teeth! It is worth the price. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare brush for several years with good results. My sister complimented me on how white my teeth are so I purchased one for her.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Have seen this in drugstores for three times the amount. Actually replacement brushes cost as much as item.  Only regret not having [purchased extra at time I ordered brush. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> We got this for my 21 year old son.  He uses it frequently and is happy to be improving his oral hygiene by using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Our dentist has recommended the Sonicare product for years.  Didn&#x27;t really see the need.  Finally purchased one and realized should have been using it for years.  Purchased several more.</li>
            <li> Sonic Toothbrushes are like washing-machines..The more you pay the more bells-n-whistles you get, whether you actually need/use them or not.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the single benefit, to us, that we like; It DOES NOT stop vibrating the bristles and sound a buzzer 4-times every brushing &amp;#34;cycle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This brush just vibrates (with a not-to-loud hum mm).&lt;br /&gt;The fancier brush models physically stop the motor and &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34;, to let you know they think it&#x27;s time to move-on to another area of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;We did not want nor need that extra &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As adults, we feel qualified to know when and where to move the brush.&lt;br /&gt;It also cost less as a plane-jane model, but still doing the work of the $$ ones.  We are aware that for the 2-minute &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; brushing time, some (also adults), prefer and seemingly enjoy the brush quitting, burping out a ding, and then continuing...as a reminder to move-da-brush.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, a &amp;#34;product line&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;have it your way&amp;#34;...That&#x27;s good I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the older model Sonic with it&#x27;s stubby fat toothbrush stem, we find this new longer-thinner brush-stem design a true improvement, as there is less plastic body to wrap you lips around. It&#x27;s easier to keep your mouth/lips closed on the brush &amp;#34;stem&amp;#34; and thus make less of a mess while moving the brush around. With a little practice, and in fact NOT putting your head in the sink, we can brush the two minutes without dribbling.. try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush, as in others similar, should have the nut unscrewed, and any unwanted junk/mold?, removed with a disinfectant, as under-the-nut is not truly waterproof. Another reason persons who prefer to not do this occasional clean-up, up-grade to the stated &amp;#34;water-proof&amp;#34; models. And only since Sonic has never &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; this model, to gasket-seal it, or provide a silicon slip-on sealing cover (which is available and good), we give it 4-stars.</li>
            <li> Better than my previous model and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with all os my purchases</li>
            <li> my teeth really appreciate this purchase, never felt cleaner and my dentist even saw the difference</li>
            <li> Much improved over previous versions...she loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare  rechargeables for many Years starting when there was only 1 model....I&#x27;ve had some last for a very long time&#x27; others not so long...My husband has had his forever....Can anyone comment on product life?  Yes I replace on charger immediately and clean the machine frequently....thanks</li>
            <li> Sonicare has always been a great product and this was a great value</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, cleans amazingly well, but the toothbrush is expensive, and the heads are expensive and unwieldy (seriously, you have to buy the whole screw-on part?). The well on the handle (underneath the screw cap that is attached to the head) traps water, which quickly turns into a yellow soup of bacterial growth. Yuck. Get the Sonicare Easy Clean instead (that toothbrush is even more expensive than this one, but at least you won&#x27;t be growing a bacterial colony in your toothbrush...).</li>
            <li> Am disappointed that my sonic does not buzz after 30 seconds 3 times.  But it brushes very well!  This is my second one, I wore one out after 10 years of use.</li>
            <li> Love it but replacement heads cost too much.</li>
            <li> mine go some dirty smell on it, i try cleaning it but it work stop smelling</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my original Sonicare</li>
            <li> This is a really great toothbrush.  I never thought I would splurge on an electric model, but I have had one for years now and cannot imagine going back.  When I have to take a manual tooth brush when I travel it drives me crazy because I miss that extra clean feeling.  This model is especially good.  The main benefit to this kind of toothbrush is that I used to get about one cavity every two years or so, and I literally have not had a single one since I started using Sonicare.  They also last a very long time - you just need to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by the dentist and kids n I love it!</li>
            <li> Toothbrush holds a charge for a L O N G time.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth, but I was displeased with their head-replacement incompatibilities that were not clearly marketed despite being from the same brand, meaning I wasted money buying the wrong heads. The motor also seems to have a problem as it doesn&#x27;t run nearly as strong as it did when I first bought it but it technically still functions.</li>
            <li> Maybe my dental hygienist will stop bugging me now every six months to purchase one of these toothbrushes. Even though I slid by with no cavities last exam, she&#x27;s always complaining about the tartar build up and how this will help.  So let&#x27;s see if this makes it any better after six months.  The toothbrush is loud, buzzes your brains, and splashes everywhere if you brush with your mouth open.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the annoying noise and mess, but I guess I&#x27;ll find out.</li>
            <li> Essentially, this toothbrush is a Loss Leader to get you into buying the REMARKABLY EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT BRUSHES.  Otherwise, OK.  (Google &amp;#34;fake reviews&amp;#34; and notice how many reviews for this product fit the bill.)  UPDATE:  After a year of using this toothbrush, I never did get use to the way it felt when the hard plastic head accidentally vibrated against my teeth so I&#x27;ve gone back to an authentic (not generic) Oral B.  Downgraded from 3 to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Intended to improve dental hygiene and reduce gum recession. It takes getting used to the tingling of the cleaning, but hopefully will be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the model I was hoping for but OK with it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. The only thing I&#x27;m not fully satisfied with is that it isn&#x27;t completely sealed and gets a bit yucky inside if you don&#x27;t maticulously clean it after each use. I hear there is a different model that doesn&#x27;t have that issue. Other than that, my teeth have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have owned this toothbrush for a little over a year. In the last 4 months, black mold spots have started to develop underneath where the toothbrush head snaps on. There is a rubberized-like seal here that makes mold prime for growth. Because of the gap between the toothbrush head and the handle, bacteria regularly gets trapped here. I have made a point to clean this area every month using intense hot water and dishsoap, then drying it. This has not prevented the mold growth. It smells horrible. I LOVED this toothbrush before this occurred, so please be wary of customers rating this before using it for an extended amount of time. I have gone and inspected the new models at stores and all but one model appears to have fixed this gap problem which leads to the trapping of bacteria there. This will clean your mouth, but it will not keep itself clean even when you diligently try to do so.</li>
            <li> Excellent entry-level electric toothbrush. Makes my mouth feel very clean after using and the two minute timer is a nice perk.</li>
            <li> It Is not as substantial as my old Philips Sonicare.  I have been tempted to return it.  It vibrates badly in my hand.  I have to tighten it EVERY TIME I USE IT.  Sometimes the brush part just starts wobbling so badly I have to stop brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted for at least 10 years maybe more so I had to get another.</li>
            <li> This Product cleans teeth very well</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace a similar Phillips device that cost a good deal more. The old one lasted several years and I have great hopes for this one. So far so good.</li>
            <li> At the instruction of my dentist, I purchased this toothbrush. I actually got it for a steal at $29.95. After undergoing a deep cleaning, I&#x27;ve found that this toothbrush keeps my teeth white and keeps plaque at bay. It&#x27;s high powered and takes some getting used to, but it is great so far. I really can&#x27;t see any problems with it except that I do like to brush my teeth between heavy meals so I don&#x27;t see myself taking it on the go, but for a good brushing morning and night, this is the right toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so far so good, only used it a few times, hope it holds up, (replacing my original one which lasted several years) When I started using one several years ago my dental hygienist noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone wanting the extra measure of brushing without the big costs associated with the more \\&quot;high end\\&quot; models of electric brushes...</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have to say I was legitimately impressed by this this electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had other cheap ones in the past and didn&#x27;t really think that a Sonicare was worth spending the additional money on, but I admit now I was wrong.  I think one of my favorite features, and it&#x27;s the little things that count, is that it has an internal timer for the 2 minutes that you are supposed to brush your teeth for.  So all you need do is press the power button and brush until it turns itself off.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth also feel a lot cleaner with this brush.  The vibration from it takes a little getting used to, but is well worth it for how clean it makes your teeth feel.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really like about this toothbrush is the quality of the enclosure.  My last electric toothbrushes all had battery compartments that you could unscrew and replace the batteries and so they tended to get water seeping around the battery.  Here, the battery is completely enclosed with no real seams for water to leak in to or crack.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t recommend about this toothbrush is the replacement head price (~$30 USD), but it seems that coupons float around often enough to bring that down some.  Otherwise, this was the best toothbrush purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> This being my first electric toothbrush I don&#x27;t have much experience or knowledge about them.  After using for a few weeks, I love the brush.  It almost gives me the clean feeling after just getting done at the dentist office.  The brush is a bit smaller than I expected/wanted but I like how it comes with a charging base and is very easy to use.  You press one button for on and off, it also has a built in timer for 2 minutes of brushing so you know you are doing a thorough job.  I would recommend to anyone trying out a new brush or looking to get an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have one since last Xmas, it&#x27;s so easy and enjoyable to use compare to traditional toothbrush, so I brought this one to my bf, and he likes it!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother.  Haven&#x27;t given it to him yet but know he will like it,  Have used one of these for three years now and there is no comparison to a regular toothbrush at all!</li>
            <li> I have been using sonic care for several years and would not use anything else. My last one had a timer every 30  seconds it hesitated. But that is what went wrong on it.  This one is simpler.  So that is good.</li>
            <li> I have the older version of this one for the past few years, so it was just time to retire the old one.  I can&#x27;t say much about it, because it is &amp;#34;just a toothbrush&amp;#34; and I have never had a different brand to compare it to!</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush with a great price.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing your teeth so much easier!!</li>
            <li> worked for 2 weeks and battery died then</li>
            <li> Great product!  Has been working fine.  A good buy overall.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old one, its not as deluxe but does a good job, I am happy.</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth amazingly and in a very short time. My dentist recommended it and it was dirt cheap $39! I recommend getting this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Got it on sale. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years and it had seen its better days. So this price was perfect&lt;br /&gt;for a replacement.</li>
            <li> My teeth are cavity prone, so anything that helps keep them healthy is worth trying. This toothbrush does the job and comes with a handy travel case. The base is a little difficult, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare! Been using one for years. got this one to replace just to have something cleaner. Shipment was fast and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> The handle is surprisingly heavy and has a nice sturdy feel to it. The vibrations are very strong and at first they tickled my lips before I got use to it. It makes me teeth feel very clean and smooth. I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> EZ 2 min brush, shuts off automatically. Arrives with carrying case, rechargable electric stand. Replace brush heads every 3 mos.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;My dentist recommended a Sonic toothbrush.  It cleans thoroughly and I love the two minute timer.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I gave the Philllips Sonicare to my daughter as a gift and she loves it.  It is everything that she wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Received and used it a month before my six-month checkup and got great reviews from my hygienist!  She was impressed with the low level of tartar and plaque, and you know what that means....less time in the dentist&#x27;s chair!  Try it!</li>
            <li> Effective for cleaning. Noisy</li>
            <li> Did not receive a travel case. Would love that. Peace.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to order and best price I have found.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  First Philips lasted five years.  Such a difference in dental hygiene, and your dentist will confirm.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and works well with multiple users. Like the charging system that blinks till fully charged.  Also good buy</li>
            <li> Definite improvement to gum health since using this.</li>
            <li> My traveling husband needed an electric toothbrush.  He couldn&#x27;t take our dual set, because then I&#x27;d be left without the charger.  This is a great toothbrush and my dentist recommends them.</li>
            <li> the sonicare is really a great tool and your dentist will love you as well.  It also comes with a carrying case so you can take it with you</li>
            <li> Works Great!  Helped out with receding gums</li>
            <li> great toothbrush, great value!</li>
            <li> Better than the conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but impossible to keep clean.  There is a design issue with this toothbrush where there is water that gets under the toothbrush head and causes it to mold.  Unless you take the brush head off after every use and let it air out I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to prevent it from molding.  Stay away from this model.  The toothbrush itself works great, but it gets disgusting before the blue like in the brush head wears out signifying it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare for many years. My Dentist approves.</li>
            <li> Sonicare electric toothbrushes are the BEST!  This is my third.  They do an excellent job and are much better than a manual toothbrush can do.  I love the 2 minute timer to make sure you brush for the correct dentist recommended length of time.  I like the rechargeable battery much better than having to replace regular batteries and it&#x27;s better for the environment without the waste.  Sonicare toothbrushes last years and the brush heads themselves they recommend be replaced every three months. Best electric toothbrush you can buy!</li>
            <li> Gave as Holiday gifts to my two children ages 25 &amp; 20. They LOVE them. The price was cheaper tham purchasing from a box store. Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> I love it!  My teeth never felt so clean and no more changing batteries!</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Beyond what i expected</li>
            <li> Very effective.  You just can&#x27;t go back to manual brushing after this, and the two minute timer is very helpful</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever! Switched from a vibratory brand that was out of stock, and got one for me and spouse, and both of us agree- leaves teeth feeling clean, not too rough in handling in mouth (you have to get used to the vibration and not place plastic edge against the tooth). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old Sonicare died on me.  I ordered this one.  My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean unless I use this toothbrush.  Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I miss the timer that would go off every 30 seconds to remind you to switch your brush around.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is also too strong (similar to the Oral B). I thought it would be better because it is sonic, instead of rotating, but it vibrates your teeth so hard that it feels like they&#x27;re going to fall out! I have crowns so I&#x27;m seriously concerned. It should come with a speed/sensitivity control option. It should also come with an option to have a round head instead of the oval shape it comes in which makes it really difficult to clean the inside of your teeth. I&#x27;m disappointed because I used to have a sonic toothbrush from a different company that was far superior to this one and I liked the idea of the travel case that it came with.</li>
            <li> I love the clean this provides, however the vibration is overwhelming some times.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  i love it.  the price was very good too.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I should switch to electric because I scrub my teeth so hard my gums were wearing down.  It was difficult when I first got it as I continued to scrub and not let the brush do the work.  Once I got the hang of it, I would never go back to a traditional toothbrush, and my gums, in less than 12 months have stop receding and some have grown back!</li>
            <li> Great.. Holds charge good.. Best check ups with dentist after using it.. I don&#x27;t floss and even though it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing I know from experience that it definitely helps.. I used the Crest cheap one before this and this  one is like night and day.. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed in this one the top doesn&#x27;t connect proper and gets  toothpaste inside having to clean&lt;br /&gt;every time and charge much more often.&lt;br /&gt; My old one was great only reason purchased new the batteries died after 15years.</li>
            <li> Be aware these Brush heads are not made by Sonicare and do not work the same. This was part of a package that included 6 heads and an electric Sonicare rechargeable tooth brush. The Sonicare is made by Phillips and is fine it is the brush heads that are the problem. I did not see in the description the word generic. Generic means they are knock offs made in China.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have the 30-second timer. Instructions show that it&#x27;s available on some models, but not this one. It&#x27;s the cheapest Sonicare I&#x27;ve seen, so maybe that&#x27;s why. Otherwise, the toothbrush works just like my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> While the toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning teeth it was manufactured poorly and large deposits of BACTERIA must be cleaned out at least twice per week.  I can&#x27;t put something in my mouth that I know is so dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explains why this model is so cheap.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush.  It has been very reliable and provided great dental hygiene over the decade I have used one.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement from my previous Sonicare.  I had the other one 13 years.  I was just ready for a new one.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  More effective than typical battery-powered toothbrushes.  The timer feature is an excellent idea. I also like the idea that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> With these new rechargeable toothbrushes my grandsons are good about brushing their teeth twice a day. The Phillips Sonicare brushes were recommended by their dentists. It was money well spent!</li>
            <li> The best thing my teeth have felt. Leaves a fresh clean feeling unlike any other forms of brushing. Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> As many other reviews mentioned, fluid gets into the toothbrush. This happens where the replaceable head screws onto the remainder of the body. I didn&#x27;t heed the warnings posted by others - I neglected to empty/clean this area for almost three months. It was pretty disgusting when I finally unscrewed the old head for its replacement.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush on Ebay, but it is the exact same toothbrush.  I have a number of issues with my teeth and so brush my teeth very frequently, at least 4 times a day.  I have been using a battery operated toothbrush for years and found it an extreme improvement over a manual tooth brush.  An electric toothbrush is far more effective than a manual toothbrush.  As far improved an electric is over a manual, this is even more improved over an electric.  This isn&#x27;t just an electric toothbrush, it&#x27;s in a league of its own.  I can visibly see and feel a noticeable difference between how clean my teeth are immediately after using this as compared my previous, battery operated toothbrush.  If you want clean teeth, there is no other choice.</li>
            <li> I have had the sonicare for about a month now and it seems to work great.  Just remember to turn it off before you pull it out of your mouth, otherwise you get spittle everywhere.</li>
            <li> Is a terrific product and I paid more before for this same item that eventually wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Good deal. Works well. Cannot complain. Does what it iw supposed to do. Basic model. Keeps the teeth clean. Good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Sonicare HX5610 based on personal recommendation from my dentist (and close friend). I have been undergoing a &#x60;rejuvenation&#x27; of sorts.  In the past 6 months I&#x27;ve made it my goal (with the help of my dentist) to have the healthiest, cleanest and whitest smile possible in preparation for my best friend&#x27;s wedding. The first step was to upgrade my toothbrush from my [[ASIN:B00763LZWQ old manual toothbrush]], to the Sonicare. I chose this because he said it was what he used at home, and it was somewhat economical compared to the other options he mentioned. This is also the reason why I chose [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC this teeth whitening solution]] as opposed to using his services - he said it would cost me $500 dollars, then laughed and gave me the 2nd option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that my dentist is an honest person who will recommend solutions to me not based on personal gain, but on quality. He said the way to use this product is as follows. You&#x27;ll want to use this product for exactly 2 minutes, 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth. Think about your mouth&#x27;s surface as having 4 sections, top front, top back (behind), bottom front, and bottom back. There is an easy 2 minute indicator that is built into this brush, which makes it easy to remember when you&#x27;re done. Or you can simply watch a 2 minuteyoutube video, which is what I do to kill time while brushing! J (pro tip!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried about gum and teeth sensitivity due to how fast these things go. It&#x27;s the equivalent to 31,000 brush strokes per minute. I asked my dentists about this, and he said don&#x27;t worry about it too much, as long as you&#x27;re not using a tooth-paste with heavy abrasive, because the combination of abrasive action and strokes can do more harm than good if used frequently and often. He recommended to only use a teeth-whitening toothpaste like [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS this one]] and a teeth whitening system like [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC this one]] every-so-often to keep your mouth from becoming overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have owned this model for several months and while it functions well, I only recently looked closely at the base of the brush head after removing it to clean it.  I was shocked and disgusted to see that there is mold on the inside, which is hollow and inaccessible for purposes of cleaning.  Some other reviewers have said removing the head and rinsing it after every use is &#x27;no big deal&#x27;, but that doesn&#x27;t address the fact that the inside is a breeding ground for mold and bacteria, which could only be avoided, if at all, by making sure the inside &#x27;pocket&#x27; dries out completely after every use.  You would have to leave it unscrewed and reassemble it every day. This is a serious design flaw.  I purchased this model based on the high ratings, but am now baffled as to how it got so many.  I&#x27;m going to ask for a full refund from Philips.  (On hold for customer service as I write this.)</li>
            <li> Great little tooth brush.  Good power, speeds up toothbrushing time.</li>
            <li> I had one of these sonicare for years so when it stopped working I started looking for a replacement. Amazon by far made the best prices. I love my sonicare.  Thanks</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this toothbrush, my teeth feel as clean as after a trip to the dentist. I usually have a hard time reaching my back teeth, but the small head on the Sonicare fits easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside: it&#x27;s still difficult to get the backs of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the usage of the brush. I am very disappointed that I do not have the 30 second timer that I had in my other sonicare. If i could send it back for another model I would.</li>
            <li> Love it.  A big step up from just using a toothbrush and brushing manually.  My dentist has been suggesting this for years and finally I did it.  The big difference, I think, from this model and the more expensive Philips is the timer.  This one still shuts off after 2 min but it doesn&#x27;t remind you every 30 secs to move on.  No biggie.</li>
            <li> I love it!. My mouth feels like i just got a cleaning from the dentist everyday. I specially love how it had a 2 minutes timer.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it, and uses it twice everyday. He is also trying to convince me to use a electric toothbrush. So I think it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This was quickly shipped to me with no issues. I love this toothbrush and the easy and convenient travel package. It&#x27;s also great because when I travel I don&#x27;t even have to charge it every day. My teeth feel amazing with this excellent brush.</li>
            <li> Look for something else.  The brush head breaks easily. You would be better off with an Oral B or some other model, not Phillips.</li>
            <li> Why would you use any other type of tooth brush, this thing rocks!!!</li>
            <li> Works fine but doesn&#x27;t have the built-in 30-sec split timer.</li>
            <li> Got as a gift for my wife. She&#x27;s got great breath and teeth, so I think it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> A little loud but leaves my teethe feeling like I just left the dentist every time!</li>
            <li> This is the older model but it&#x27;s price is worth it. It works just as well as the new models. The new ones might have a slimmer grip, but this one is slim enough. Don&#x27;t get caught up in the trendy BS just to spend more money.</li>
            <li> Frighteningly good. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone this long without having a quality toothbrush like this in my life. I will probably never buy another toothbrush until this one dies out.</li>
            <li> Wife loved the one I bought for her so much I got one for myself.  They take a few days to get used to.  I clean them once a week and it only takes a min.  I have had no mold growth like some people complain about.  The cleaning process takes less than a min and I use a little warm water and s cap full of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite electric toothbrush thus far. I honestly don&#x27;t have one complaint about it but it is my first Sonicare. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the value of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner with the Sonicare.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> What can I say. I have ordered three of these for my offices and home. Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has the same brushing quality as the higher priced versions.  However, it has no timer so I must remember to count to 55 (or thereabouts) and then change to brushing my upper teeth.  This is more nuisance than I like!  Update 9-24-15   I have now upgraded to the higher priced version.  The need to track my brushing time is a hassle which I could live with if in addition I didn&#x27;t also have to change the brush head in less than two months to keep up the power of the brushing.  I am disappointed though not surprised since this was the bottom of the line version.  I just ordered the Healthy White Plus model -- will provide input in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Did not come in original packaging...... But works great</li>
            <li> Who honestly uses traditional toothbrushes anymore after this amazing invention?</li>
            <li> Hello,I love my Philips Sonicare tooth brush. I had 3 of them now and I will not buy any thing ells. It clean my teeth so good and my checks ups come out so good and not a problem at all. This Sonicare will work for all that wants a tooth brush to do the job.So thanks Philips for the good teeth I have and I&#x27;m 66 years young. Keep up the good work and thank you so much.W D</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush.  makes me feel like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> helps the little peeps along</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to if you never used a Sonicare before, but cleans very well.  Wish I would have spent the extra $$ on the model that beeps every 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have been using these, &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34; for a while and my teeth are so much cleaner than if I used any other regular motor brush.</li>
            <li> Keeps the dentist visits easier and makes it feel like you have been there without the pain of going through it.  Work every dime!</li>
            <li> Still using and it works great</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare, but it wore out.  Mine lasted a good 6 years.  When I went to pick a new one I didn&#x27;t expect so many choices.  This one was probably cheaper that some, but it does the job!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything but Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended getting a Sonicare, so I finally picked one up and it works great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his gift. Great product!!</li>
            <li> i was leave in ny about one month .when I go back. I opened the box, don&#x27;t have the brush head. Because over time can not return. I am very disappointed with this .</li>
            <li> Reduced my cleaning time at the dentist by 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> A really huge improvement in electric tooth brushing. Blows away earlier electrics.</li>
            <li> Nothing like a Sonic. I&#x27;ve been using these for years. When I go in for dental cleanings (which I don&#x27;t do that often) my dentist always mentions that it&#x27;s clear I keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> My second Sonicare - had the last one for 5 + years.  Don&#x27;t need the bells and whistles they now have available -  this one is doing a great job of cleaning my teeth very well...fits my needs.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush comes with everything you need and a travel case and cover for the brush.  Easy to put together, good instructions, easy to use.  Works great, and now my dentist will be happy!</li>
            <li> My last one worked great for years, I hope this does the same. I would take it along on ski trips and never took&#x27; the charger in about 2 weeks it gave me no trouble. I dom&#x27;t know i this will do the same but it does have more modern and up-to date features. That&#x27;s about all I can say!</li>
            <li> My second Sonicare in 12 years</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as the Sonicare it replaced - I don&#x27;t even remember when, during the last decade I bought it. My dentist always comments how little plaque I have at my 6 month check-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have MS and my right hand (dominate hand) quit working at the end of the 90&#x27;s &amp; I had to switch to lefty. Electric toothbrushes (and razors) are a great work around. This will be my third electric toothbrush: The first (non-Sonicare) lasted a couple years. My last Sonicare - most of a decade. As it was starting to fail, I began web &amp; physical price shopping. The Amazon price even beat Kohl&#x27;s + mail-in rebate.</li>
            <li> Much better than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever bought...battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> It died a year after I bought it.  It won&#x27;t charge at all and it&#x27;s not the charger.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush at a terrific price. Feels more substantial than the battery-powered version, charges quickly, and the travel bag makes packing easy. Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Leaves a Very clean sensation throughout your mouth. Perfect for use with braces.</li>
            <li> awesome ... clean ... sparkly .. smooth feeling in my mouth these days - but the vibration takes some getting used to ... :)</li>
            <li> The power of this sonicare HX5610/30  is great, I feel it really does a good job.</li>
            <li> Definitely scrubs away plaque much better than a manual toothbrush leaving your teeth feeling super clean/smooth.</li>
            <li> This product meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> very good upgrade from my old battery-operated model</li>
            <li> I ordered this on recommendation from my dentist because I am increasingly disabled in hand and arm control.  It seems fine for the purposes although the vibration is a little unnerving.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush i ever had. Price is about the same at Target.</li>
            <li> Great price and product.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job at removing stains and making my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> It is keeping my teeth clean and is very effective and affordable.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I just came from the dentist every night. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as slick or refined as my Braun, and Chinese instead of German, but reviews seem to say the lifespan is as long. Action seems comparable. Don&#x27;t know about the yuck factor yet in the head, but I would lay it down after use, and I&#x27;ll bet that solves that. You only need charge when it dies.</li>
            <li> Bought as a stocking stuffer, and he loves it. Love the travel case</li>
            <li> Great Electric Toothbrush !  Have used this brand for 10 years and needed a new one !!  Ordering on line was easy and delivery very timely !!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank YOU,  debbie</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my Sonicare essence 5600 and the 2 extra brushes I purchased.  Also very satisfied with ease of shopping at Amazon and the accurate delivery information provided by Amazon.  Used Sonicare brush the last 12  yeas.</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth toothbrush  - the only reason for replacement is that the rechargeable batteries eventually wear out. Would never go back to simple handheld.  Teeth feel clean right up to 6 month cleanings.</li>
            <li> this is a terrific toothbrush. but the model i bought does not have the 30 second timer within the two minute timer.  I was sorry that I didn&#x27;t know that; I would have purchased the more expensive model as that is an extra I miss.</li>
            <li> I had an older model and after several years of good service it dyed.&lt;br /&gt;The new one has been great, it is sleeker and yet more powerful then the old one.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I punched one for my wife, see loves hers also.</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare toothbrush that died after about 6 yrs. Just bought this as a replacemet, and it works well. (It was also half the price of what I paid previously for essentially the same model). For those on the fence about buying a battery-powered toothbrush, do it. I will never go back to using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an identical unit I had had for many years when the non-replaceable battery died.  The price was reasonable, it came in two days, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It works well for my wife after trial and error.. the replacement toothbrush was expensive though...will try OEM replacement instead</li>
            <li> never use any thing else!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know if I could justify spending the money on an electric toothbrush instead of just buying those cheap plastic toothbrushes from the grocery store. After a couple of days brushing, I am very happy that I decided to go with the upgrade. Very easy to use. in my opinion, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Looks like PRETTY GOOD quality.  Semi-&amp;#34;level-with-handle&amp;#34; button is invisible from mirror, and almost impossible to find with your finger.  You have to turn it over, which splatters the mirror if you take it out of your mouth when it&#x27;s on.  BTW, you ALSO have to turn it ON with it in your mouth.  Strange noise, a high &amp;#34;dentist drill&amp;#34; noise.... That kinda sucks.  Holds a charge forever.  Not heavy or unwieldy.  You can clean it by turning it on in the sink (aiming down) with water running over it.  That&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> After I first used this I said to myself I am sticking to this.  Makes teeth feel cleaner and auto shutoff tells me that I am not brushing my teeth too quickly or too long.</li>
            <li> I bought air floss from same company then I bought the brush its a must have item go for it</li>
            <li> I have used the new toothbrush for about three weeks and I am loving it! My teeth are feeling very clean and look white.</li>
            <li> The item came promptly. Good product, I would highly recommend the Sonicare toothbrush. If you want a simple brush without bells and whistles..this model is the one to purchase.</li>
            <li> Captain Joseph L. Naselli, did &#x27;Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoying this item everyday and thank you for a good price and fast delivery...Will do business again and again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Joseph L. Naselli USCG</li>
            <li> Does what it said it would do, easy to use.  I bought this for my son and he has special needs, the staff said it is great!</li>
            <li> Pro- After using a Sonic are brush, you&#x27;ll never want a regular tooth brush in your mouth again.&lt;br /&gt;Con- The brush attachment doesn&#x27;t seal. It will stay on but what happens is moisture will get inside of that cavity. if you don&#x27;t unscrew it and let it air dry or wipe it clean about once a week before you know it open it up and it will be filled with some nasty black mold/slime. Clean it regularly!</li>
            <li> Travels well wherever you go.</li>
            <li> Sprays everywhere. Collects mold in the seams</li>
            <li> Great price and great product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I could literally see the difference after the first time I used the brush. The only fault I have against it is, there isn&#x27;t 30 second interval beeps like the description said. It doesn&#x27;t lose a star for that minor inconvenience in my eye still. Great product.</li>
            <li> So far so good! It&#x27;s my daily toothbrush and makes brushing for the recommended 2 minutes a snap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Sonicare ... what more to say?  Fantastic product.  Try Clarisonic, too.</li>
            <li> With every brushing, I feel like I just left the dentist office with a cleaning.  Only wish I had invested in this years ago.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery &#x3D; THANKS!  This is the second Sonicare that I&#x27;ve owned.  Like it very much.  However it is rather expensive, hence the 4-star rating.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference after using it for a few weeks.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great but the replacement heads seem wasteful.  It looks like the little toothbrush should pop right off for replacement but the entire top third of the unit must be swapped out.  Not cheap to replace that much stuff that still looks good.</li>
            <li> I had extra old heads and this uses these</li>
            <li> Great, basic, Sonicare Toothbrush!  Great value!  Comes with 1, smaller brush head, just the right size that I need. Comes with charger and travel pouch, in generic, frustration free packaging, Yay!</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and my mother loves it. Not much more to say, if mom loves it, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Man this thing can clean teeth like your favorite hygienist, only no sharp hook! It isn&#x27;t really noisy, and it cleans and stores easily. Get extra heads, so you can share. Be prepared, load the brush, wipe the paste over all your teeth and then turn it on. Then it&#x27;s watch out, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable until you clatter your teeth with the back of the brush. Not horribly so, but a rubber back on the head might be nice. The head itself is a small profile and can reach everywhere. Two minutes can seem like a long time, but it&#x27;s worth the smooth and shiny bright smile. The only thing that I found surprising is that the vibration causes me to salivate like Niagara Falls every time I use it. I use it about every third brushing. Don&#x27;t forget to floss!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Oral brand!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son.  He likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. My teeth feel so clean. Plus they had super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Any other way of brushing is barbaric!</li>
            <li> this is the second one that I bought and I absolutely love how it makes my teeth feel clean and my dentist noticed the difference too.</li>
            <li> great product.  good seller</li>
            <li> This is our second Sonicare toothbrush. The previous one lasted several years but finally wouldn&#x27;t accept a charge. This is a low end handle, but I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend extra money on bells and whistles. Functionally from the perspective of actually brushing your teeth, this is the same as more expensive models. I don&#x27;t feel the need for a beep to tell me to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth or whatever. There are nicer looking models (Diamond Clean) and models with several features that I don&#x27;t need, like settings for sensitive teeth and the like, which I also don&#x27;t need. This one does the job for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. This is my second sonicare. The first one lasted about four years before the power button collapsed. The new brush head seems to vibrate more than the old ones which makes it more effective. Overall a really good toothbrush. The travel bag is not as good as the old one. The zipper gets stuck easily. The old model was velcro and worked fine...not sure why they changed.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush.  Makes a huge difference with my gum health. My dentist could tell I had been using a Sonicare based upon my excellent dental check up.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has not let me down for years! no cavities just pearly whites.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. These sonic brushes clean your teeth wonderfully while keeping your gums healthy and preventing gum damage by brushing. You don&#x27;t need to brush normally with them, just turn on the brush and slowly move it over and around your teeth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought to replace an old toothbrush. I had thought I had a good toothbrush but boy was I wrong. This brush makes my teeth feel like I have just left the hygienist. Tomorrow I have my first appointment since I started using this brush and look forward to her response.</li>
            <li> Everyone should own AND use an electric toothbrush.  This is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement for a similar one I have had for years.  This on is lighter and more compact so I like it but I was disappointed to find this model does not have the 30 second pause on the timer.  While the timer works to shut off the brush after two minutes of brushing, my old one paused every 30 seconds so I was sure to give each section of my mouth 30 seconds of brushing.  Now i have to count or guess!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for about 12 years now. The one I replaced was still working but not as well as the new one. I have a bridge and my gums are very pink and healthy using the Sonicare.  Won&#x27;t ever go back to a regular brush again.</li>
            <li> better than the Philip I used before</li>
            <li> Well-made, no issues.</li>
            <li> Sure wish they had been available 50 years ago. I have been using a Sonicare since they first came out, and they make a large contribution to keeping a healthy mouth and gums. My first one died and I did without for a few weeks..YUCK...had to have another one and wow, does my mouth like it.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush always makes my teeth feel so clean! I had one for 7 years before it broke! This one is my repurchase!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush arrived on schedule and had great packaging. Sonicare Toothbrushes could sell themselves.  Fine product!!  I recommend buying one.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for quite a bit as I really wanted the Sonicare rather than another Braun.  Although it takes some getting to used to the sensation at first--what a difference!  Really makes a difference and I&#x27;m glad I switched.  These can be expensive and this was the best value I found.  And think quite good value.  Shipping was great and on-time.</li>
            <li> great product for the price. Old sonicare quit so had to buy a new one.  Only difference is no quad-pacer but otherwise is perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush, and I bought one this year for the whole family. Everyone loved them. My dentist sees a big difference in the claening.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a new electric tooth brush in a while and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed having one. The cleaning is much improved over the manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I for me. The first one lasted 5 yrs no problems. Hope this last as long. Does as well as others that are more expensive so why pay more.</li>
            <li> Compact size but does the job well. For the price, this was a great purchase. It makes your whole mouth feel clean and doesn&#x27;t hurt like some others do. Good for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My teath feel so clean after brushing.  Almost like pearls.  Buying a second one for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;No matter how dry I think I get the brush and handle, water still leaks through to the bottom and leaves paste marks on stand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It works great. It did not come in a nice box like at the store, though. It comes in pieces and you have to put it together. But, then it works great.</li>
            <li> Came better than described. Got as a Christmas gift but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a plug in or cordless so took my chances. Turned out it had an adapter thank goodness. Very nice product, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on the products quality I selected it for purchase.  It has lived up to its reviews and is an absolute quality purchase especially in price comparison to others.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and it didn&#x27;t work. Product was defective. We followed instruction but still didn&#x27;t work. We had to return it. So unable to give a good review.</li>
            <li> has 4 30 second brush times . Doesn&#x27;t work did not work when i got it.&lt;br /&gt;Should have sent  it back.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t want the hassel</li>
            <li> Product was flawless!! No issues at all, all working parts and instructions, yet MUCH cheaper than purchasing in store!</li>
            <li> I have always used the sonicare. Since I started to use it years ago, I no longer have gum issues when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> bought one for each family member</li>
            <li> Does what it promises!</li>
            <li> My second Soniccare. . Works likes it is suppose too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  My purchase was actually to replace one that I have been using for years that finally gave it up.  Very worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Loud, but you get used to it- also totally worth it for the whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. First charge takes a really long time.</li>
            <li> Amazon hooked me up with $10.00 off on this Sonicare!  I was going to buy it anyway I guess it was just good timing.  I have had it for over 2 months now and it is a major upgrade from the battery toothbrush.  I am very happy with my new sonicare toothbrush and my teeth feel a lot cleaner too:)</li>
            <li> This device lasted approximately 8 weeks and then quit working. It is past the timeframe to return it. Now I am stuck with a $40 paperweight.</li>
            <li> love it! works really well,my mouth feels so clean after every brush!</li>
            <li> Greater clean than I thought</li>
            <li> Long battery life. I&#x27;ve been using sonic brushes for 10yrs.</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price.. Use it twice a day and floss once. No dental problems ever. Switched from regular brush to phillips sonicare on jan of this year. Will never go back.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction.  The item was as described and arrived on time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this toothbrush for over a month and I&#x27;m very happy with it! My teeth feel very clean after brushing, I love the built in 2 minute timer and the charge lasts for over a week at least (I can attest to that). Beware of taking it out of your mouth before shutting it off (toothpaste splatter galore!). I did experience some sensitivity with initial use, but after about a week my teeth were used to the fast brushing bristles. Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> Felt like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned!</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Was hoping that the unit would fit into our holder and charger from our  previous Sonicare units.  Not the same model # so it didn&#x27;t.  Now we have to have two charger units plugged in.  We had the Elite before and it was terrific.  Hope this one is just as good as the last.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and had one when I was younger.... Unfortunately my gums are receding and it made my back teeth so sensitive that I am unable to use it anymore.  Think I need to go to the dentist and have him put patches on my teeth so I wont be in pain.  Please be careful of your gums!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Sonicare ten years ago on the advice of my dentist.  I still use it today.  The most recent purchase was for my wife.  She loves it as much as I love mine.</li>
            <li> I Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I Love it and it works Great!</li>
            <li> works wonderfully, teeth have never been cleaner! the only thing I don&#x27;t like is when the back of the brush head touches any of your other teeth it sounds/feels like a wood sander in your mouth (not painful, but surprising).</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. The brush is large without being uncomfortable and the vibration is not to strong to hurt the gums. Battery last long.&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was getting the toothbrush that notifies user when to brush next quadrant.  I did not realize the error until after I used it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and delivered so rapidly and safely.  Takes longer to reach me as it has to be brought down to Mexico!</li>
            <li> Had the original model Sonicare for about 10 years and it always did a great job.  Soon the batteries in that model were too weak to hold a charge long enough for travel even though it still worked adequately at home.  When it finally died completely I sawed it open to remove the batteries and found that they were 1-1/2 volt NiCads (2 nickel cadmium batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Essex 5600 model advertises NiMh (nickel metal hydride) batteries inside.  These batteries hold a charge much longer and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; problems of the old NiCads.  My toothbrush now has renewed vigor and it will travel well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weighing the difference between replacing just the handle and buying this new set I would have to say that the 2 year warranty, the new battery type (with matching charger) plus another brush head make the small difference in price well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one cause I moved away.  They last forever, just get a new head every 6 months.  Will pay for itself in dentist visits.</li>
            <li> The philips sonicare is a great selectric toothbrush!! it is small to reach hard to get places!  super powerfull, really good clean feel.  long battery life!</li>
            <li> Works great, no problems so far, great product.  The charger is very convenient, product is well built, good quality, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have had this brand of toothbrush since the late 1990&#x27;s. I have nothing more to tell you about the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Died after 5 months of use.  This toothbrush (my wife&#x27;s) was not even close to the quality of my Sonicare toothbrush, which was much more expensive (and worth the price).  Caveat emptor!</li>
            <li> works well and provides timed brushing. This is my 2nd or 3rd one. Cooked the charger while in Europe on the previous one. Battery only worked 2-3 days on previous brush...that is the negative. They don&#x27;t hold a two week charge as advertised</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great! It works well and after a full day of a blinking light, it finally fully charged.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have pauses during the two minutes for when to switch sections in your mouth (usually, the vibrations would pause for a split second to tell you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth).  Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> Best $35 you will ever spend. I bought three of these all for me. I have about 15 yrs of toothbrushed with the three I bought. I am very very happy!</li>
            <li> Let me just say I Love,love this model sonic care toothbrush! I&#x27;ve had it for like 4 years and it still works just as well as when I first got it! My sister bought 2 of the newer sonic care toothbrushes and both didn&#x27;t even last her a year! It broke and then she bought another one and it broke also! I highly recommend this model sonic care toothbrush I bought mine when it was over a hundred dollars so I have had it for quite some time I highly recommend this!!!!!;)</li>
            <li> does not seem to be as much a quality product as previous versions. I don not believew that it will last as long.</li>
            <li> Replaced the one I had.  Does a great job cleaning teeth and gums and makes a difference at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a Sonicare I&#x27;d had for years. This one is an improvement, though I would have liked the 30-second timer the old one had.</li>
            <li> this was gotten to replace an old Philips sonicare elite, which had a failing battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;new unit works.  however it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second quadrant timer that the older elite model had.</li>
            <li> I must laugh at this purchase, although it was shipped quickly, priced right, and arrived in great condition, the person I bought it for said it was just confusing for him to use to brush his teeth.  So, he gave it to me!  I did read the directions and it is not that difficult to understand.  So, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but am looking forward to using it.  Hope that all works out well, as I also want to be able to just go brush my teeth without a bunch of things that I have to listen to or watch out for, like the type of toothpaste to use so that the plastic doesn&#x27;t crack!  Can&#x27;t use toothpaste with whiteners or baking soda!  Like don&#x27;t know if there are any, but I am game to try it and think that it will be just fine!  LOL</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift. No complaints from the recipient so far. Item arrived on or before delivery date stated. It&#x27;s a Sonicare product so I only expect the best.</li>
            <li> I have not used the toothbrush, I am not sure it is new, and it did not sound like it was working correct, but no problem</li>
            <li> This is a great buy...got it for my daughter who is now in braces and she loves it! Does a great job!</li>
            <li> Try and find a single one of this at a great price .......... I did.  My sister temp. moved in with me and wanted to remove and put her toothbrush head on my sonicare and back and forth.  That&#x27;s what she and her hubby do.............nah, a lot of places sell you two rechargers but I only needed one. Nice little pouch too, plus she got the newer model that still takes the &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; series heads which  mine uses.</li>
            <li> Less expensive then the Sonicare I usually buy. It works great, as usual, but I miss the timer, as it keeps me on track.</li>
            <li> this is my third one to buy, for myself and two for a cousin, they work great no problem fine!</li>
            <li> I have toothache few months ago. After i bought this product, i prefer to clean my tooth better than before&lt;br /&gt;Amazing things is i don&#x27;t have toothache any more~~Haaa~~~&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because i change my toothpaste, but i like this product~~</li>
            <li> this is my second one - I love it - the price is a bit high for my liking but I like the tooth brush - lasts a long time - my other one lasted years - easy to use, easy to clean - great product</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is a little too small for my liking. Has a lot of power though, so my teeth do feel clean after brushing. This is my first Sonicare, I guess I am a little biased towards Oral Care as that is the toothbrush I&#x27;ve had the last 3-4 years. The brush head was bigger.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner than when I get them cleaned at the dentist. I highly recommend this amazing product. It lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare tooth brush wore out so I ordered a newPhilips Sonicare HX5610 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White and I am quite please with its operation.</li>
            <li> In the past few years I had my share of dental work done including an implant and a root canal.  All those missed dentist visits resulted in a monstrous bill.  After my procedures I finally invested in an electric toothbrush.  Should&#x27;ve done it sooner.  It really makes brushing my teeth less of a chore.  The brush does all the work.  The head is small and reaches areas normal brushes miss.  The sonicare bristles are jagged shaped and cleans thoroughly.  I also noticed some of the newer heads vibrate more and massage the gums.  After using this for several months, I went to my dentist for my teeth cleaning and he commented on the excellent condition of my teeth (without knowing of my switch to an electronic toothbrush).  Floss, brush, rinse.  And use the sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Sonicare toothbrush which gave me good service for several years.  The only reason I bought a new one was because the replacement brush heads were getting to be hard to find and expensive.  WOW!  I had no idea that this newer design would be so much more mouth-friendly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My teeth seem to be cleaner then they ever have.  Really like the bag.  Like the way it charges.  It been great!</li>
            <li> best brush ever. great price. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for traveling. I travel often so I bring this along. Have gone 10 days using twice daily without charging so far. The automatic shut off after 2 minutes is great so I know when I&#x27;m done. At first this will train your gums and teeth at a slower speed then increase gradually. But be warned, even in the beginning, it brushes quite hard. Only downfall I can think of is that you must clean between the handle and brush head frequently, if not it gets a bit grimy and filmy inside after a few brushes. But it is easily cleaned. Very good design.</li>
            <li> The best brushing experience i&#x27;ve ever had. Only downside is the replacement heads can be expensive.</li>
            <li> Well known manufacturing defect that went uncorrected for years. Rather than drain affluent from the inside of the head chamber, it accumulates and rots and occasionally releases the stinking rotten gunk through the little holes on the side and onto the hand you are holding it with. DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> I was pleased, it was sent quickly and I have owned one before but really like the next model.  thanks</li>
            <li> This is a classic and works as well as others twice the price. Lasts forever. I kept my old one going for years with new brushes and duct tape to hold the batteries cover on. The dental hygienist always says my teeth stay clean between visits. Most of us are on a budget and this is one tool that is worth the family money. You can get extra brush heads at Wally&#x27;s - just sayin&#x27; ...</li>
            <li> When it came time to change the brush head, I could not remove the old brush, no matter what I did. My husband tried removing it also but did not succeed. So I am stuck with the old brush, and if I want a new brush head, I need to buy an entirely new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a sonicare then maybe that&#x27;s why your breath smells and you get cavities.</li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease, and given to understand that the pockets around my teeth will just continue to deteriorate. I was told to floss daily by the dentist; it was the dental assistant who cleaned my teeth that told me to invest in a Sonicare toothbrush. I did, and my pockets have actually improved and I get praised every time I get my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> At  3 months the charger dysfunctioned.  Although it  seems to charge the brush the blinking light does not go off even if left plugged in for 48 hours so you have no idea when it is fully charged.  The return policy cut off is 60 days and there does not appear to be any longer warranty which is unacceptable on a $69.00 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist loves it to! He says my last check-up was great and asked me what I had done different. I changed to a Sonicare toothbrush I said.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. My teeth actually feel cleaner, and I&#x27;ve always had great teeth (never a cavity). I like how it eases you into using it by increasing the intensity throughout the first 12 uses or so. I can tell that helped because it would tickle sometimes early on, but now it just feels natural.</li>
            <li> Dies not have quad timer - not worth buying</li>
            <li> First impression: Wowzers! Just got this Ordered it for the family to use and added brush heads for the rest of family from Sonimart. Both my 11yr old daughter and I have used it and it really cleans. What we both noticed the most was how obvious the spots we missed were - making easy to go back and get those pesky spots. After we were done, it felt like we just came straight from the dentist. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I love this my teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li> This is the third Philips Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve had (two were gifts), and unless I spend an extra bunch of time taking it apart daily (their recommendation, according to a recent phonecall with a Philips representative), it grows gunky, sludgy mold inside!  Notice that they&#x27;ve redesigned the toothbrush?  Notice that there&#x27;s a company selling rubber covers for this toothbrush?  It&#x27;s super-gross and Philips definitely doesn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Great price for one of the best electric toothbrushes out there. Clean, easy to place and waterproof! Just place it on the charger and it works! Although the heads are sorta expensive, apparently dentist&#x27;s recommend these because they can clean in the smallest of areas.</li>
            <li> Have used it for one week, good but need a power converter for 220v.</li>
            <li> I bought this for replacement of a Philips Sonicare toothbrush that I had for 10 years.  I love this one too.  it works great!</li>
            <li> Blasts away all the tartar, scale and glued-on crud that no amount of manual brushing could ever dislodge. It also pounds mouthwash, peroxide, coconut oil or whatever exotic treatments you use deeply but gently between the teeth and below the gum line. I&#x27;m on my second Sonicare brush, paid $100 for each and thought it was a bargain given the results. Delighted to see Sonicare #3 will be significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Long time user, and this one is still just fine.  Can&#x27;t believe how expensive these still are, but good for Philips that they own this franchise</li>
            <li> great price and is just as good as my old one</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had more updated models, but this one performs very well.  However, I bought 2 of them and neither of them chime, chirp or buzz at the 30 second intervals.  Can&#x27;t figure that out, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Well worth the price, though!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. The well collects water and quickly develops to mold. I clean it out frequently and there is no stopping the problem. A product that is used to clean your mouth should be clean not prone to mold due to a horrible design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called their customer service to ask for assistance and they only offered a 15% off discount. Not cool.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY FAVORITES ...KEEPING MY MOUTH CLEAN AND HEALTHY</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my more expensive model that finally died.  It works great, was less money and it also can travel (with an included case) as it will hold a charge for 2 weeks!  I think that&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I&#x27;m still using mine, the refills are pretty expensive even if you buy on amazon but in the end I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it. No need to go crazy and spend the 200 dollars on the next level of toothbrushes. This one still has the 2 minute timer. Your charge lasts a long time, probably around 1 month without needing to recharge and the extra carrying case is great for travel. Everything works as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Phillips Sonicare for years and I love it. My old one finally died and this was a replacement. I like it much better than the other &amp;#34;electrics&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and is just as good as the first one.  Cannot imagine that the higher priced ones are any more effective.</li>
            <li> My second sonic are purchase. Works very well and it stays charged for a very long time. It&#x27;s never died on me and I don&#x27;t always have the charger plugged in. The little carrying case is nice.</li>
            <li> This is our second Sonicare toothbrush and it is very good with the exception of not having the feature of beeping every 30 seconds, indicating the time to move onto another area of teeth to be brushed, as our previous one did. Otherwise, we are very pleased with this new one.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very good deal.</li>
            <li> Thus far works amazingly well.  Leaves no tarter on teeth and my breath is fresher.  I only charged it once for 24 hours and going strong one week later used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this 5 stars because I had a problem with breath being not s fresh and bought every mouthwash I could find, this worked after one day!  So I&#x27;m not going back to a normal toothbrush again.  Nothing else was different, same toothpaste same mouthwash.... this works.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush about 8 months ago. I like it very much - my teeth feel so much cleaner than when I use a manual toothbrush. Sonicare is the company my dentist recommended. Two complaints: one is something that others have mentioned a lot - the way icky stuff builds up under the toothbrush head and smells; and the other is that it&#x27;s not terribly durable. I&#x27;ve already had to replace it twice. Both times because of drops. The first time was kind of understandable - it fell onto a tile floor. The second time it dropped only 3 feet onto a carpeted surface. I suspect the battery connections are a weak point in the design. I think the maybe the way around both issues is to take the brush head off after each use, and lay both sides in the carrying case, laying flat. Also, despite the issues, sonicare stood by its products and replaced the toothbrush without question.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this toothbrush. Just be aware of the issues, and if you have one, don&#x27;t be shy to call sonicare customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters boyfriend. I have the newer style sonicare and love the way my teeth feel when I get done brushing, so he asked me if I liked it and when I told him my opinion he said he wanted one also. So i bought him this style and he really likes it and doesn&#x27;t want to use a manual toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li> MYWIFE LOVES IT. IT  IS GREAT WITH THE BUILT IN TIMER AND RARELY NEEDS TO BE CHARGED. NICE HANDLING ALSO</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  The original one lasted over 3 years before the battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  Only 4 stars on this one because still evaluating. This one may have less features than the older model.</li>
            <li> Love it. I loved the price as well. I think it would make a great gift. I Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love this model as the toothbrush head is really a great size for me (smaller than previous models I have used).  Does a great job and recharges pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Folks complaining about it getting gummed up with excess toothpaste, should consider using less of it.  My dentist recommends a small 1/4 inch dab of toothpaste is the ideal amount.  When I stay true to that, I do not have any excess toothpaste gumming up the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and it was ok... But once I tired the Sonicare, I was hooked!  My teeth felt cleaner after using the Sonicare and I like the pulsating as opposed to a spinning brush (as with the oral-b).  It&#x27;s nice and compact for travel and has a good charge. Move this toothbrush and glad I converted to Sonicare</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in nov. 2012. It stopped working jan. 2013. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Amazon falsely advertised this toothbrush as having the quadpacer feature and it does not. It was a great price around black Friday, but I really wish I had purchased this from another vendor instead.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Sonicare! I will never go back to a regular toothbrush again. This is my first one, so I can&#x27;t compare to any other models, but it is a great deal for the price and works wonderfully.  My teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Great value at a low price. I think it works just as good as the 200+ one.</li>
            <li> I love it, and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I have heard is you need to still move the brush back and forth, and hold it at a 45 deg angle to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I have also heard that this type of toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as those with the rotating heads, but for the price you really can&#x27;t  beat this.</li>
            <li> Long time user of Sonicare products.  This product was priced right so I got this for my wife and she loves the results.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this toothbrush because it doesn&#x27;t have the automatic four segment timer for brushing the four quadrants of your teeth. My previous brush had this feature, so I wish I had known this before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I received this for a christmas gift. I really have enjoyed using it. I feel like it gets my teeth cleaner without brushing so hard. I did up grade to a new head and I like the upgrade much better.. Over all very satisfied with my first use of an electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush does the trick of cleaning your teeth. It works well and may be less expensive than other brushes!</li>
            <li> Never had cleaner teeth or healthier gums.&lt;br /&gt;Love the brush-head cover; keeps it safe from those nasty toilet particles floating in the air.&lt;br /&gt;Also love the automatic 2-minute timer; now I never feel guilty :P&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush came in an easy to open packaging. It was easy to assemble, took me 2 minutes to put it together. The controls are easy to figure out. It does tingle in the beginning if it is your first time using a Sonic toothbrush, like it was mine. But, you dont even notice the sensation after a few days of use. It came with a full charge, but the instructions said to charge it for a few days continuously which I did. Now once charged, it lasts me a week of use twice a day. It gets teeth really clean without scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The no frills, 2 minute timer is very helpful. You can pause it and then resume the timer. You just have to gently move it over your teeth and it does all the work. Way, way better than battery operated drug store toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order an electric toothbrush offline, having not seen it in person, but I am very pleased. My teeth feel sparkling clean for a very long time after each use. Plus it&#x27;s a pretty good deal for a great toothbrush, travel bag, and charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use at work to replace a cheap and nasty battery-powered toothbrush I bought earlier. I&#x27;m very happy with it as a toothbrush to use after lunch at work. For home use, I have the slimmer and more expensive model, but this works very well for after lunch teeth brushing.</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush before, battery died so needed replacement,&lt;br /&gt;good toothbrush, does the job, good price, comes with case and charger</li>
            <li> Just loving it. I thought I&#x27;ve used similar product before but have never felt so much as clean for my teeth as I am using this sonic care product. And would want to continue enjoying it and maybe even buy another set for my family. Thank you.</li>
            <li> We have used our own Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  We originally bought ours because of the recommendation of our dentist.  This one was purchased as a gift for a very close friend who is a senior citizen in his 80&#x27;s.  It is his first electric toothbrush and he reports that he really likes it.  Whether for yourselves, or as a gift, these brand of toothbrushes can&#x27;t be beat.  We would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really the first true upgrade to brushing, can&#x27;t wait to show off my new gums to the dentist. After 2 minutes f brushing, you really feel the cleanliness of your teeth</li>
            <li> My dentist insisted for a long time that I should use the Sonicare toothbrush, so I decided to give it a try. I have used for a month now and I really like it. I do feel that my teeth are cleaner. The rechargeable electric battery is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars is because it has a negative point: it&#x27;s really noisy. I have had electric brushes in the past (other brands) and the noise doesn&#x27;t even compare with those, it&#x27;s way too loud. At the beginning I even thought that it was broken, but after a quick search for reviews I noticed that it&#x27;s a fairly common complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the noise, I would still recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> much cleaner, much better, more smile</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush , the dentist recommended . I am so very happy with thsi purchase, it&#x27;s not hard on teh gums at all . easy to control.</li>
            <li> A very good electric toothbrush.  I think it is very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these in my house already and this one is a pretty good deal.  The others cost me $200 so I am pleased with this.  Same quality as the others.</li>
            <li> I have had several Sonicare&#x27;s over the years and I really like them. I gave it 4 stars because this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that did not come with the feature that lets you know when to move the toothbrush to another area.</li>
            <li> I have a few models of these toothbrushes. This is just the basic one, but it seems to do the job just as well.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to by an Sonicare so I did.  He didn&#x27;t tell me it would make my head hum, but I will use it to save my teeth.</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing vibrates like it&#x27;s going to take off any minute!  It&#x27;s so loud, I can&#x27;t hear anything else!  I&#x27;&#x27;ve learned to put my finger (gently) on the stem to keep some of the vibration down!  Quite disappointed.  It does clean well tho, no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Needed this as my old one had expired. I got a great price (including a $10.00 discount by ordering the Monday after Christmas) and quick free delivery.</li>
            <li> I love it. feel clean and no effort to use. Thank you for putting it on your site. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic! Highly recommended.  Changed from a cheap battery operated toothbrush and am so happy I did. Cleans great and it feels like I went to dentist for cleaning every time.  2 min timer is great as well - the toothbrush will automatically turn off after two minutes.</li>
            <li> I received this item as a Christmas Gift and it was just what I needed to encourage me to brush my teeth:) I have had this toothbrush for a while, and the battery is outstanding! Overall, I love this toothbrush and would definitely recommend it if you are in the market for an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for someone who travels and it was great, perfect with the travel case! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This vibrates at a frequency that make it feel like you are in a torture chamber.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to inspire one to use an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> have to admit I wasn&#x27;t quite convinced by the tv ads, but now after using the Sonic Care, I cannot stand to use my old style manual brush ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I registered  online and got free extended warranty.</li>
            <li> Far exceeds brushing manually. I spend more time brushing of my own choice. This is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I still floss.  I find brushing manually very ineffective.</li>
            <li> I just replaced a Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve had for probably 10 years.  I love this brand, and my teeth feel so much cleaner than using a regular toothbrush.  I was just disappointed to find out that this model does not have the 30 sec. beep, alerting you to the need to start brushing in a different quandrant of your mouth.  The rechareable electric portion of the toothbrush is also a little awkward to hold, and I ended up losing my grip and spraying toothpaste on my face after I had already applied my makeup.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever! Get one now. The first one I bought got rujined becuase I was taking it in the shower. This one is pretty much the same. Best tooth brush for the money</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I won&#x27;t ever go back to a regular toothbrush again.  After using this toothbrush, I feel like my teeth have been cleaned by a dental hygienist.  It holds a charge for many days; it shuts itself off after 2 minutes to make sure the brusher uses it an appropriate length of time.  The replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap, but the results make it worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Before I had carpal tunnel surgery on my right hand I decided an electric toothbrush would make it so much easier when I had to brush my teeth with my left hand..I was right and now that my right hand is well I use it twice a day. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my 13 year old nephew.  He loves it too.  How many times have you heard a teenager say, &amp;#34;look at my teeth, they look and feel great!&amp;#34;  And he made it a point to thank me!  Nice!</li>
            <li> Using the Sonicare cleans while it refreshes your mouth. Manual bushing is like not brushing at all, while the Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> my dad has essential tremmor and has a hard time brushing his teeth, with this it is a breeze.  i have a similar model that i use at home and i have always been happy with the phillips line</li>
            <li> my wife said she couldn&#x27;t handle the power.  she can go back to the manual brush while I continue to get great compliments from the dental hygenist.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have 30 sec timer to tell you when to switch to another quadrant in your mouth. Toothpaste and saliva seeps into magnetic area where it sits and forms a horrible stinky mess. You have to unscrew the head, clean the insides out with  a Q-tip and old toothbrush. It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for over 18 years now.&lt;br /&gt;When it first came on the market I bought it through the Canadian Shopping Channel&lt;br /&gt;Price was around $300 at that time.&lt;br /&gt;It saved my gums and prevented more tooth loss (having already lost one tooth due to gum abscesses).&lt;br /&gt;If I had had this product earlier I would have been able to save the lost tooth as well.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Other brands can copy but this is what I am sticking with.</li>
            <li> I had one before and after 7 years stop working, so this is why I had to order a new one, I love it, my dentist can not stop complementing my teeth....</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for an electric toothbrush. The travel case is small and packs well when traveling. Cost is half what you would pay at a store.</li>
            <li> I received a gift certificate from my family for my brother and was having a hard time deciding what to get. There was nothing I REALLY needed.  We were talking one day and my brother and his wife suggested a Sonicare, since they have one.  I found this model and redeemed my certificate and ordered.  I could hardly wait to try it as I&#x27;ve heard these are great little tools to take better care of your teeth.  I&#x27;m a &#x27;scrubber&#x27; and can wear out a regular toothbrush in no time. The idea of not having to &#x27;scrub&#x27; sounded great.  This is not a high-end toothbrush, but it does the job.  My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels good when I&#x27;m done brushing.  It is easy to operate (even though it still tickles!) and I think it is a great starter for anyone that has never used one before.  Hopefully in the future I will upgrade to a better model, but I am perfectly satisfied with my Essence to do the job it was purchased to do!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush rocks! It can be a little weird getting use to its power. I&#x27;ve never had a brush as powerful as this one before. My teeth feel squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done, no matter how much chocolate and caramel I have wedged in my teeth. Lol.  I Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really works very well &amp; I&#x27;m finding that it does a great job. The reason I gave it a 4 star is that if I take the toothbrush out  of my mouth while it&#x27;s going then water shpritzes out but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied &amp; wud definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great line and the toothbrush is great.  But the head of the toothbrush didn&#x27;t even last 2 months before a metal piece on the inside broke.  For an OEM head I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it. I bought a different brand for myself at Walmart  because it was on sale. The sonic has a much smaller head than the one I bought. I wish I had bought two of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes time to get used to because it&#x27;s very powerful, but when you&#x27;re done brushing you feel like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Love it. Dentist recommended this product.  It has proven to be a good investment. xXXX ssss&lt;br /&gt; xxxxx  xxxxx xxxxx xxx</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is very loud.  Don&#x27;t brush your teeth while others are sleeping in the morning . . . it will defintely wake someone up.  As far as effectiveness.  I do like it.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought it was because my dentist told me that he sold them and also recommended it, I was glad that I did buy this bursh</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and already have one for myself. The brushes last a long time and the battery does not need charging often. Very pleased. Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I had a Braun toothbrush and wanted to try the Sonic.  I am very happy with the Sonic.  I think it does a better job then the Braun.</li>
            <li> This was one of the Christmas gifts I gave to my son.  At first he had to get used to the vibrations, but now he says he really likes the way it cleans his teeth.  He&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Now the product will serving both of us. Great Compliment to Costco Purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Do like it because teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Best purchase yet. would definitely get another one.</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd one to buy a granddaughter.  We have had one for a few years and have better dental check-ups.  Our 12 year old requested one for her b.d. and then our 11 year old granddaughter requested one for hers.  Now, to get them to use them twice a day.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Works very well just read the instructions for most effective use.  Teeth look better with two or three uses.  I feel better and believe this will really improve your dental health.  More purchases of this for Christmas and Birthdays.</li>
            <li> Excelent product! Wont leave home without this toothbrush. Battery works a long time and the brush heads are very comfortable on gums</li>
            <li> Delivery was as promised.  Item was complete.  Mechanical toothbrush needed while right arm is in a sling.  Brushes are interchangeable with my spouse&#x27;s toothbrush, a convenience.</li>
            <li> Really efficient! :easy to use. Reasonably priced  would recommend.  Travels well. I don&#x27;t like using a regular toothbrush any more.  Makes my mouth feel extra clean ^ fresh.</li>
            <li> This is easier to clean than any I&#x27;ve had before and does the same great job on my teeth.  It was also a LOT less expensive than my last one by the same company.  Hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised...I assembled it...I put toothpaste on the brush...I put it in my mouth...I hit the switch...it cleaned my teeth very nicely...that&#x27;s what I wanted...and that&#x27;s what it continues to do</li>
            <li> I had one of the original Sonicares with the thick straight shaft and I loved it forever. After 10 years or so, it finally got to the point that I couldn&#x27;t find the heads for it anymore so I broke down and ordered this newer model. Got one for my daughter too. She can&#x27;t believe how much different it makes your teeth feel compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, and from the picture I thought I was getting the same thing.  It turns out it is a much cheaper model that doesn&#x27;t signal each 30 seconds of brushing. I had gotten used to this feature and was disappointed it was missing from my new model. Just double check before you order about all the features.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads are very good,I love it! It can clean my tooth very well.</li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare.  My teeth (and overall mouth) feel much cleaner.  The feel is great while brushing as well.  It honestly feels like a massage for my teeth.  You&#x27;ll have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly. We needed it to replace one that was about seven or more years old when it finally quit.</li>
            <li> The items works fine but does not have circular motion.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted more than three years. The cost of this one was less than buying the replacement heads. Can&#x27;t go wrong at this price..I&#x27;m happy!!!</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  Have gone through at lease 10 units.  The biggest problem with the past brushes was the rubber protection cover over on and off button. It eventually tears and once that happens its a matter of time until it goes belly up.  Other than  that we liked them very much.  The last two brushes that we got did not screw on the brush.. It is just a push in or press fit. These are the biggest piece of crap I have ever wasted my money on.  The brush vibrates horribly and falls out while using.  My wife has to hold the brush in to complete brushing. They are of such poor quality the must have them made in China now.  I called the company with my concern.  They said they would have the local rep contact me.. After two weeks I found out who the rep was and called her.  Got no where. They pretty much blew me off and said that was the way they are now.. REALLY???  To bad, used to have a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush gave me many good years of service.  The price of this replacement was very reasonable and&lt;br /&gt;works very well.</li>
            <li> Replacement for the same toothbrush that finally wore out.  They last a long time, and do a great job.  My dentist is very pleased.</li>
            <li> It Cleans my teeth very well. It is Easy to use. I Brush my teeth longer since started using this.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my father. My husband and I both have one too and for the cost it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had a cleaning at the dentist.  It&#x27;s easy to use and alleviated some of my carpal tunnel issues.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush; it&#x27;s a Sonicare.  But I wish I had noticed that this model doesn&#x27;t have a timer like my old (but dead) one did.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, is good product for the price point.  Reasearch on consumers report identifies this item as a best buy.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years because of the great quality this product is no exception. It was shipped on time and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I love that Sonicare has come down in price to a place where it&#x27;s reasonable. This works great and with OEM heads is quiet and fun to use.  No problems with cleaning or charging or anything yet, though the heads to wear out quickly if you apply even a small amount of pressure (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway).</li>
            <li> Works great. Good value.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great, Would recomend it to anyone who wants to have perfectly clean teeth. my dentist even uses the same item</li>
            <li> The sonic electric toothbrush is really a great product.  I use mine daily and it has never failed me and is always charged.</li>
            <li> After four months, the brush will no longer hold a charge. In the four months, I kept the brush in the charging base as the instructions suggest. Now, when I travel with the brush it doesn&#x27;t maintain a charge. This brush replaced my last brush that started to do this after 2 years. Now that it&#x27;s begun again and after only four months I no longer have faith in this product or the manufacturer. Back to trustworthy old toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare before and have always been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The brush is great - gets your teeth very very clean.  Buy replacement heads in a bundle if you can - seems like they loose their mojo after about 45 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy and the vibration on my top teeth and gums took a bit of getting used to, but my teeth are incredibly clean, great value</li>
            <li> No need to buy the expensive models they don&#x27;t clean any better.  These do an amazing job and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my previous Sonicare rechargeable.  Received promptly and I am very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel so much cleaner using the Sonicare, very easy to set up and use.  Dentist should be happy with me.</li>
            <li> Actually I was looking for another model of e series with 2minute timer.  Settled on this model.  Just as wonderful.</li>
            <li> Having used the Sonicare Essence 5600 for a few weeks it has met my expectations and the recommendations of my hygienist....it is providing a better level of cleanliness than I experienced with manual brushing. I feel much better about my oral care using this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this about 1 mos. ago for myself after using other brands.  The head of the toothbrush is much smaller and has a different vibration but I like it!  Gets into those nooks and crannies just fine and what a good price!!!  Stays charged for a long time - like the compact feature!</li>
            <li> I recommend buying a different model.  Toothbrush is great but this one makes changing brushes more difficult.  Maybe more expensive - I haven&#x27;t checked the price of replacement heads yet.</li>
            <li> Regular use helps as my insurance won&#x27;t cover  the Dentist  visit.</li>
            <li> it is so good ,i like it ,I like it it it it it it it it it it it</li>
            <li> Bought them for my kids for Christmas.  They love them.</li>
            <li> this is truly an amazing product...much much better than some of the other ones I have used.</li>
            <li> Really gets your teeth sparkling clean!  We bought this on the recommendation of our dentist &amp; it certainly has proven that they know what they are talking about!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She seems to like it very much. No problems. Cleans good and charges quick.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for many years. His dentist first recommended it to help with gum problems as well as plaque and general cleaning. A family can buy one unit and each use his or her own brush head, but we like the convenience of having our own separate units so we don&#x27;t have to keep changing heads. I sometimes, ok most of the time, I wait longer than I should to visit the dentist but still have great check-ups. It will take stains right off your teeth and leaves the enamel intact. It works with internal magnets that somehow produce sonic waves rather than mechanical abrasion like manual toothbrushes and most electric brushes that I&#x27;ve seen. When I change the brush head, which isn&#x27;t necessary all that often, I take the magnets out and and rinse them off. Those tiny little things make the most powerful refrigerator magnets you have ever seen in your life! No kidding! The Essence is rechargeable, so no batteries to change. You can use it for several days without charging if you want to take it on a short trip without the charging apparatus.This particular unit is one of the more reasonably priced. Sonicare does have some pretty pricey toothbrushes in it&#x27;s line with bells and whistles that we don&#x27;t necessarily need. This model works just great for us!</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare toothbrush I have owned since 2005.  Sonicare has been using cheaper battery components since I first used their electric toothbrushes.  My first toothbrush took 6 years before it lost the capacity to fully charge a toothbrush.  My second toothbrush, a year.  This toothbrush lasted 1 month before I was unable to get a full charge capacity (Purchased December 11, 2012, lost capacity January 9, 2013).  Granted, I paid slightly less for each iteration but if I can only get 1 minute of brushing it renders the purchase useless.  For those looking to buy Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes, they&#x27;ve gone downhill since they started worrying about their bottom line.  I know this will likely be my last toothbrush I buy from them until they can prove otherwise.</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for. wefiwrhgf wkjhbfkjhfkj jrgkjngfjnf sdkjbfkjwbfkjwb wkjbfkwjhebfkjhsbf dskjbfwkjhbfkjwbfd wkjbfkjweb kjebfkjwe kjwbfkjhwebfn skdbfkjwbf wkejhbfkjwebf jhbfjhsbf wkjbf kjhbf</li>
            <li> I solely can&#x27;t  believe Philips  still produce this antique  and what&#x27;s more,  I buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but  it works as it shall be, like a old pal without handsome  words but always ready to help you in need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I think this basic model is qualified for most guys, for its price, but you need to clean the inner once a week,  I suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it works in PRC, with a voltage converter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, based on the price.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Sonicare toothbrush for a while, but never thought they would live up to the hype.  Man was I wrong.  This thing cleans your teeth nearly as good as a dentist would!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my dropped Sonicare. I uses the same heads and charges even faster than the old one.</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth feel great after a week of using this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s my third electric toothbrush and the best so far.  My dentist suggested this model while using plain Colgate Total toothpaste.  Solid recommendation for anyone with delicate gum lines. Competitive pricing thru Amazon makes this purchase an easy 5-star.</li>
            <li> This is our third purchase of this product and we are very happy with Sonicare Essence. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone should buy this product.  It is great for children as well as adults and the price is right on</li>
            <li> got nthis for my WIFE, KAREN, she loves it  ,dentist recommened it for her to use daily, and she could not wait to get it</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I use this.  I love how clean my teeth feel after I use it!</li>
            <li> I would give 5, but this thing is a royal mess to clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended and although I was using another brand electric this is really good and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Does the job!  Some reviews mention how it&#x27;s difficult to keep clean, but I am not having that issue at all.  Very good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I am disappoiunted in that this is not ine if the models that lets yoy know your brushing time after 30 seconds my previous brush had that feature</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  I have the same model and like it.</li>
            <li> If you want to break your teeth and knock out your fillings - buy two.</li>
            <li> i really love this tooth brush and the price was good</li>
            <li> bought two for my parents. they like it.</li>
            <li> It changed my brushing experience to a better one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect set-up for me.</li>
            <li> Try as I may, I just couldn&#x27;t handle the jarring vibrations from this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s now in a basket on my bathroom counter, because I can&#x27;t bear the thought of disposing of something that I paid way too much for, only to use a month. I prefer a regular spin brush to thus one.</li>
            <li> Good product. It works well and is good quality.</li>
            <li> Very happy with how efficient it removes plaque.The brushes are a little pricey but after the two minute brush, I feel like I just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping- great product and price.</li>
            <li> No problems to date. Love it</li>
            <li> Works great, as always!!</li>
            <li> I like how it tickles my gums</li>
            <li> Wish it had the 30 second signals, like my last one did...</li>
            <li> This was bought for our grandchild who had braces.  Orthodontist said she did great with her brushing.  Braces are off now.  No cavities.  Her grandfather has also been using his Sonicare for over 10 years with great success.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product....and you can purchase additional brushes anytime. It is easy to charge and holds the charge for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.B.</li>
            <li> I like the action and the ease of cleaning, but find the toothbrush a little too light in weight.  It topples over too easily!  It has the feel that it is made out of less sturdy materials compared to my old one -- which I&#x27;m sure it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I find what it actually does for my teeth to be good.</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare tooth brush.  I use another one at home and bought this to bring along for travels as I travel lots for work.  Amazon has the best price as always.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get use to but it does a good job. I like the timer because it makes my dentist happy. However, it is poorly designed for cleaning as it gets water into places and produces mildew even when you try to clean it with anything that will reach the tiny areas.</li>
            <li> I used the more expensive cousin of this for several years with the multi speed etc. I found I don&#x27;t really need the extra bells and whistles. This one works great and is much much less expensive.</li>
            <li> cannot switch the speed....hurts!</li>
            <li> The brush and the speed make brushing too harsh.</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth Sonicare toothbrush.  My dentist recommended this brush 20 years ago and it has been a great help for my gums.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is functional (it will do the job)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but there are other, better, more effective electronic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this one again nor can I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old one that died.  This toothbrush cleans your teeth great.  My teeth feel dentist visit clean after using it just like the old one.  My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second mini timer anymore.  Now, I have to count to 30 to keep track of how long to clean each section of my mouth.  I know that this doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal, but I&#x27;m always multi-tasking when brushing my teeth and the 30 second timer was invaluable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for 10 years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had, like going to the dentist 2-3 times a day!</li>
            <li> This is a great Product for the price. It gives you a 2 min brush cycle. Feels great on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much but would be nice to have the 30 second timer.  I had one of these several years ago and tried another brand.  This is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I have one of the older ones but it&#x27;s worked for so many years.  I was about to buy this at Best Buy and just decided to search online.  Thankfully I did because Amazon was selling this for 1/2 the price!  Great product for a really great price!</li>
            <li> These are the best . all my grandkids have them</li>
            <li> My old one would not hold a charge after 7 years, so I bought this one. I guess that tells you I missed the way it cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li> really like the ease of cleaning. would prefer it to be a little slimer and easier to hold. It fits well and cleans thoroughly</li>
            <li> I had one before that finally gave out after about 15 years. I had to get another.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Excellent and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not using these as this one is probably my 5th or so......</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  Gives you a just left the dentist feeling every morning!  i can go 2 weeks without a charge and have never had it die on me, i just charge it every other week to be save.  I like the fact that i can go on vacation and not have to worry about bringing the charger.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I like the bursh head, it fits in tight spaces and does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush ye!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! It vibrated so much at first it tickled my mouth and teeth. It was weird the first couple days using it but after that you get use to it and it is amazing!  It makes your mouth feel so clean. It is gentle on your teeth also. If you are looking to get a nice electronic toothbrush this one I highly recommend! It also comes with a travel bag because they say it lasts 2 weeks on a full charge. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet but pretty cool if it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. Streamline. Packs away easily. I prefer my previous Sonicare toothbrush that signaled every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> works well and is reasonable priced</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist, and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It would be helpful, however, if Philips provided 4 30 second timers in its cycle instead of the one two minute timer.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> grand daughter loves to use it...</li>
            <li> Charges fast! Very strong! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Second one of these I&#x27;ve owned.  Excellent product.  Simple to use.  Will buy another someday.</li>
            <li> This is my second Soniccare,  My otherone lasted for over ten years.  The new one is just as good, and no day is started without using it .  Great product.</li>
            <li> It brushes better than I do. My first one lasted about 5 years. The battery would no longer charge, so I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> This unit is hard to keep clean. You must disassemble it completely every time you use it. Other models we have had were sealed so this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Sonicare about 20 years ago.  I fell in love instantly - in spite of the initial &amp;#34;mouth full of hedge clippers&amp;#34; feeling.  I have used Sonicare exclusively since. My dentist has assured me that it has helped with my dental care tremendously.  Last fall, I found that I could no longer get  a brush head that fit the Sonicare model I owned, which was about 10 years old.  The handle was perfectly functionally fine.  But useless without brushes.  So.....I had to get another one.  And I somehow did not realise that the timer function did not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this sonicare good?  Yes, just like other ones I have owned, it cleans wonderfully well. Does it have fancy trimmings?  No, it is very basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basic that is lacks the timer that will let you know when it is time to shift the brush around (30 sec here, 30 sec there, etc) to get the full experience.  I have been reduced to COUNTING in order to try to move the brush around properly.  No timer in the bathroom.  I have become so frustrated with this process that I plan to replace this perfectly functional toothbrush in the near future.  Talk about a needless throw away!  Now, twice, I will be getting rid of electronics that work just fine, except for small things like no more brushes or frustration with the lack of a timer.  Personally, I feel that the timer is a significant and important part of Sonicare tooth care and not an extra trimming.  Would be nice if Sonicare recognized that and fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has changed my relationship with brushing my teeth. Before I bought this toothbrush, brushing my teeth was a bit of a chore, but now I actually look forward to how clean my teeth feel after brushing and wish I had a second one at my office to brush after lunch.  I had an Oral B electric brush before, and I thought it was a good brush, and must be just as good as these Sonicare brushes, but now I know that I was just kidding myself.</li>
            <li> Travels well. Good product. It made my gums healthier (or so says my dentist). Would recommend it to someone thinking about getting an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel they have never felt cleaner and seems I use way less paste which I despise anyway  good job for the money ended up getting deal and coupon love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I wish it had the timer like my previous one, otherwise it works fine.  This is for good regular dental hygiene made easy</li>
            <li> Says it holds a charge for 2 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t charged mine in around a month and I use it for a couple minutes two to three times a day, works like a beast.  Also works in the shower, no problems yet.  No complaints with the performance or results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> No regret to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Strong recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Appropriate price with good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it for my mom and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li> good. The reason I don&#x27;t give 5 is that it doesn&#x27;t have a traveler&#x27;s charger -- only 110V. I wish I could use it in China where it is 220V.</li>
            <li> cleans better than manual brush and massages my gum. can&#x27;t help using it. this may be a nice christmas gift as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an older model that had died, and wanted something simple, for a one-person household.  This model seemed to be the closest to my old one, and I have had good luck with it in the month since it arrived. It does not have the 30-sec. alert that it&#x27;s time to change quadrant in your mouth, but I do just fine using my watch for that.  I note that some other reviewers have complained about needing to clean the inside. I take mine apart every time I use it and rinse both parts with warm water. I purchased a test-tube brush (very small, at a dollar store) a few months ago, and about once a week, I clean inside the head using that brush. It keeps things very clean.  I have had good dental check-ups since using Sonicare, which I started about 8 years ago.  I recommend it highly - simple to use and each to keep charged.  I keep the charger from my old unit in my travel bag and always have it when I am on a longer trip.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush came in good condition, as mentioned, and quickly. This product makes my teeth feel really clean. Make sure you only brush for the allotted time. It&#x27;s also helpful to clean inside once in a while.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush feels like it is goin go knock your teeth out</li>
            <li> This cleans better than the old Braun toothbrush I used to have. However, the inner parts of this toothbrush get extremely nasty if they aren&#x27;t cleaned out every other day or so.  Updated 8/25/2016 After having owned it for about two years, the toothbrush now just lasts a few days and then needs to be charged. Also has problems charging sometimes even after you reset it (hold down power button while in the charging station for about three seconds to reset).</li>
            <li> At the advise of my dentist, I have been using the Sonicare tooh brush for many years. They hold up well with a reasonably long life.</li>
            <li> Great value.  I bouth it for my son and he brushes his tooth more now due to the fact he likes it better.</li>
            <li> My first brush lasted 7 years before it stopped holding a charge.  If you want a good dental report from your dental hygienist buy this brush.  It does a very thorough job better than manually or those battery operated rotating tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I have begun using this toothbrush exclusively, and am very happy with it.  It makes my teeth feel as though I just came from my Dentist.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as my previous Sonicare.  With the Clean&#x27;n&#x27;White, every time I brushed I felt like I&#x27;d just been to the dentist.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Sonicare. It does a very good joob of getting my teeth nearly as clean as when I visit my dental hygenist.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric toothbrush that didn&#x27;t irritate my gums, left my teeth feeling clean and that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t come apart while brushing and that&#x27;s what I found here.  This toothbrush cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling like I have had them cleaned by the dentist.</li>
            <li> Been using this type of toothbrush for years.  The dental hygenist always think I floss all the time (which I don&#x27;t) but this product takes great care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Came to my home within a few days, quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I lost my original one on vacation and could not wait to get a replacement !!!</li>
            <li> This replaces my first Sonicare toothbrush, which helped my gum health, according to my dental hygienist. I would have liked at least a second brush to have been included with this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get this rechargeable electric toothbrush to deal with plaque, possibly due to dry mouth. Certain meds that I take really make my mouth dry &amp; it seems that the Sonicare is helping reduce the plaque. It&#x27;s a nice feeling to feel smoothness where I used to feel a plaque buildup long before I was due for an office cleaning. I&#x27;d say the hardest thing for me to get used to, is that &amp;#34;crazy tingling&amp;#34; early in the morning! I&#x27;m not a morning person &amp; it kind of takes me by surprise ~ every time!&lt;br /&gt;It does the job though, &amp; I &amp; my dentist are both pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Great results at the dentist just after months of use.  Cleaning the  brush is a must, just unscrew the brush head after every use and rinse to avoid mold.  Mold free for over a year using this method.</li>
            <li> I have one and love it. Bought this one as a gift. 2 years of dental cleanings &amp; NO Plaque.</li>
            <li> I am not used to using electric toothbrushes. This seems to bounce against my teeth and gums too rapidly. They say you get used to it. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush. I have been using Sonicare tooth brushes for years. My dental office brushes go toward detailing the car.</li>
            <li> way too heavy. unless you like to workout your arm while brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> just what the doctor ordered</li>
            <li> I love the two minute timer on this model. My teeth have never gotten this clean even after using my usual hard bristle brush. Plaque has gone packing and flossing finds very little between my teeth after I finish brushing. I took it on a 14 day trip without the charger and used it twice a day without any problem. Perhaps not so if the battery has been recharged many many times. But I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind electronics. Easy to use, small head for tight places, and did not take long to get used to at all. I have no experience with any other brushes like this, but I am sold on this one for it&#x27;s performance. Even came with a travel case!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Sonicare.  The wand units don&#x27;t seem to last very long - this was our third replacement over ten years.  I would expect better longevity.  Also, this particular unit does not have the 30 second &amp;#34;quad timer.&amp;#34;  I ordered it not realizing that the timer was an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; feature.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal but we really miss it.  I would switch to another brand but we have a pack of &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; brushes to use and they aren&#x27;t cheap either. So I get bummed about Sonicare every time I brush my teeth...</li>
            <li> It took a little while getting used to it, but love it now.</li>
            <li> This is our second one. Used the old one for along time.  Very nice device!  Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I tried one of these as I was waiting for my order to come through at my aunt&#x27;s house and it was weird.  The vibrating just feels like it&#x27;s going to knock all your teeth out and you gums feel overstimulated.  I thought since my dentist recommended it, it was cool but I was wrong.  My teeth were like, &amp;#34;na bro, this is not cool.&amp;#34;  Having to hold it at a 45 degree angle every time is odd too, it just felt a huge distraction the whole time.  I&#x27;ll to a manual toothbrush.  I&#x27;m too noob for this kind of power</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome - I just wrap some blue tape around the base of the head to prevent the dreaded water seepage and gunk accumulation that others have mentioned.  The bristles are perfect and not too hard and the wider base/handle suits me as I tend to get a hand cramp from gripping more slender brushes.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush great price</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush , feel like my teeth and gums are healthier than they&#x27;ve been in years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sonicare fan -- been using sonicare for 16 years now</li>
            <li> good price and works just as well as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> my teeth felt no cleaner than they felt with a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Charging is funky - sometimes it takes a couple hours and sometimes 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Love it but it collect tons of crap under the screw on cap. Needs extra cleaning</li>
            <li> My hygienist was always complaining about plaque buildup and bleeding gums! After using this toothbrush my teeth feel cleaner! No more cavities, fresher breath, no more bleeding, no more complaints! I highly recommend this toothbrush! Its a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> we have been using the sonicare but found it hard to find. we&#x27;re happy to have it again.</li>
            <li> What I expected and priced right. Prompt delivery too.</li>
            <li> My family owns several of these Philips Sonicare toothbrushes.  They are well priced and do the job.  I have not used other brands so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to others.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH FOR THE PRICE. EASY TO USE, AND IT CLEANS YOU TEETH VERY WELL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO ANYONE THAT WANTED A GOOD TOOTH BRUSH WITH A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! My dentist told me sonicare is the best electric toothbrush you can use. After just one time my teeth felt so much cleaner and smooth.  It also packs well in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush, and this is a replacement for the one that my daughter bought me five years ago, after I had carpel-tunnel surgery, and was having a hard time maneuvering a regular toothbrush.  I use it everyday, and my mouth feels like I just walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office, after a thorough cleaning.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a sonicare since forever but didn&#x27;t want to pay $80 for one. YOu can&#x27;t beat this price. It&#x27;s new, its amazon exclusive, and it has the 2 minute timer. The heads are easy to find everywhere, and the charger is amazing - no plugs you just sit it on top of it, it uses some magnetic induction or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the manual, and enjoy. I love brushing my teeth so much I started doing it after meals. IT&#x27;s actually fun and somehow...ritualistic? You put a tiny dab of toothpaste (you&#x27;ll actually save money on that because you can&#x27;t glob it on, this is a good thing, trust me) and go to town, when you&#x27;re done - it beeps and turns off. And that&#x27;s it. I am such a creature of convenience (&#x3D;read: lazy) that this is actually very encouraging. Can&#x27;t rave about it enough. Like Oprah said about it: \\&quot;SONICARE...IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so far awesome!  It shipped in one day and when it arrived it looked beautiful.  The to go case is perfect. The only problem is that it will need to be cleaned manually on the inside.  Other than that I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Recently, my third toothbrush has died on me in the last 7 years.  They work great for almost exactly as long as the warranty lasts, then you have to buy another.  At this price, plus $7-10 a head every three months, that&#x27;s a really, really expensive toothbrush.  If you&#x27;re okay with having to pay to replace the heads and handle that often, then by all means buy it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, well made product. This is my second sonicare and I love it!! A manual toothbrush can&#x27;t compare with how well the sonicare cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband,&lt;br /&gt;He mentioned he wanted to try an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I knew he wasn&#x27;t going to buy it for himself, so he was very happy to see it under the tree.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> This is a nice change from your everyday toothbrush.  Gave it to my son for Christmas and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Tragically I left my old sonicare brush in a hotel room, this was a good replacement for the same basic-ish model. Works well, stays charged for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The feed back I got on this product, is the recipient simply loves it and is very happy to receive such a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li> It really works well! I got it for a great price! I got my mom this for a Christmas present and she loves it. She threw all her other toothbrushes away</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and my dentist says to keep doing whatever I am doing. But the old one beeped every thirty seconds to show you should be finished with one quarter of your mouth. This one doesn&#x27;t do that, just shuts off after two minutes, the reommended brushing period. Otherwise, all good.</li>
            <li> This product is a pleasure to use.  It&#x27;s quiet yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say more after my next dental checkup.</li>
            <li> Bought at high prices</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted for years and I really liked it, so I decided to order a new one. So far it is just as good if not better. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> im so loving it.and will recommand to friends.&lt;br /&gt;feeling clean and fresh everyday.&lt;br /&gt;hope it at $29 again and pick another one then.</li>
            <li> My wife and I each have one of these toothbrushes.  One of them works perfectly.  The other develops a gross black mold inside the top of the handle where it meets the brush head.  This problem is so prevalent in these toothbrushes that a third party manufacturer has developed a product to remedy the issue.  Search for Philips and black mold and the product pops up at the top of the list.  It would seem that if the problem is in the design, Philips would just buy the company that solved the problem and put a water tight silicon cover over the brush and top of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the toothbrush appears poorly designed.  During and after you brush your teeth water, and who knows what else, gets inside the head because it is not adequately sealed against moisture.  After a few weeks, you may notice that the surface of the charger develops a black crust on it.  That is from the black mold draining out of a small port on the side at the top of the brush handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the black mold is present, it is almost impossible to get rid of it because of the tiny crevices and hard to get to edges inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending a long time chatting with Philips and answering questions and given instructions not to put the unit in a dishwasher they agreed to ship me a new handle.  They did not offer to send a replacement brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this unit becomes moldy, which it most likely will, I will toss it and look for a better product or start using the manual brushes that my dentist gives to me.</li>
            <li> Vibration takes a little to get used to, but your teeth feel great after brushing!  Highly recommend it.  Bought one for everyone in the family!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this good price and quality you will be happy and so will your teeth . Smile and enjoy</li>
            <li> An excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  Much easier then manual brushing and seemingly less &amp;#34;mechanical&amp;#34; then a Oral B rotating type brush.  It also seemingly never runs out of charge!  I&#x27;ve taken with the included travel pouch for two weeks vacation never needed a charge while using twice a day!  Love it!</li>
            <li> We just needed an easy to pack toothbrush for our trips and this one fit the bill perfectly for us.</li>
            <li> I should probalby wait to review this, since I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush in use for two days!  I had an OralB previously that lasted for several years and I liked.  Almost went with the same brand, but then decided to branch out and try something different.  For my two-day&#x27;s use, I love it.  I like the narrower and longer brush head.  Makes navigating my mouth much easier, especially getting to those back teeth.  It&#x27;s quieter than my old OralB.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the timer, but I&#x27;ve found that it is helpful.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think I was brushing long enough before!  There were some complaints about cleaning the handle in reviews.....I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if that is an issue.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and I was thanked about a hundred times because they just loved it. So I bought another one and same thing happened. Now I am going to get a third one.</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips sonicare care toothbrush for my hubby for Christmas. He was use to using just a battery operated kind of cheap one .whenever he was brushing his teeth he will  get sick and gag . With this one he doesn&#x27;t get sick or gag which is music to my ears if you know what I mean. For the price I paid it is well worth it .</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the basic Sonicare, and you don&#x27;t want to spend $119.00 this is a great choice. According to my Dentist and I have to agree, what this brush accomplishes: is &#x27;disrupting&#x27; bacteria that cannot be gotten to sans the vibration that it creates. It is not possible to get to some areas under the gum line, but Sonicare manages to do so via the vibrations that are created when it is in use. Gum disease over time causes bone loss; which in turn causes loss of teeth. When you look at it like that, then it is well worth spending the money for a competent toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps someone.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. My first sonicare was given to me as a gift over 15+ years. It has always been highly rated by my dentist which is one of the main reasons why I stayed with it. So when I started experiencing problems with my other one...it only made sense to replace it with another sonicare. Excellent product indeed.</li>
            <li> Good quality, simple to handle and very good cleaning results. One has to get used to the very high frequency in which it operates.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price.  Love the less packaging as it seems I&#x27;m just constantly throwing away plastic and packing bags and recycling cardboard.  Just ordered extra heads for this brush from Amazon at a great price as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Excellent product and purchase!</li>
            <li> I would have never believed that a tooth brush could make such a difference in how clean my teeth felt.  I was mistaken!  This tooth brush cleans my teeth so well that they feel like I just had them professionally cleaned.  I have had it almost 3 months and the e-series brush head is just about ready for replacement so it lasted as long as was suggested.  I am so glad I made the investment... FYI Sam&#x27;s Club sells a 4-Pack of the e-series heads for $36.00 dollars.  I thought that seemed a little better than what I have seen other places.  If not let me know... Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> Ordered, shipped and arrived quickly.  Charged overnight.  Had a much more expensive model before this one.  A bit noisy but does a great job.  My only complaint was the nylon head is poor quality.  The nylon brush head had strings of uneven lengths sticking out in a few places.  Trimmed with scissors and it seems to be fine.  Saw it for the same price in WalMart.</li>
            <li> Just what my mom wanted and nice to have the little travel bag it comes with.  Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space either</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for teens and up. It makes your teeth and gums feel good and clean..  My denist recommend it to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews and regret the purchase. The slower gentler cycle that you initially experience is great especially because the brush is a soft brush BUT once your past that phase, the full power jack hammer speed is uncomfortable &amp; concerns me that it will losen caps and bridge work from the power of the brushing.</li>
            <li> Great product I have used Sonicare for many years. Product provides the best results of any other product on  the market.......</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a sonicare toothbrush. It is easy to use and it makes the teeth and gums feel good.</li>
            <li> Great product cleans perfectly my hygienist was in shock of how i mentained  her cleaning my teeth feels so smooth after</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for my kids (8 &amp; 6 yrs old) so they would better brush their teeth and know when they needed to move to top, bottom, back &amp; front BUT sadly this tooth brush does NOT do that.  It only beeps after 2 minutes is up.  It&#x27;s a strong toothbrush and brushes well but if the reason you&#x27;re purchasing it to ensure your kids (or you) brush each section of their mouth equally it does not do that.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My wife bought me one of these, and I liked it enough that when hers died I bought her one too. We used battery toothbrushes for many years, but these are a little different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smooth, minimal seams design means they don&#x27;t build up anywhere near as much grunge as my old one - the wireless charging is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensation as the brush touches your gums is a little different from my old toothbrush - almost tickly - almost annoying, but wears off after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> 1. Made my teeth feel really shiny&lt;br /&gt;2. Made my gums tingle&lt;br /&gt;3. Pulsed to tell me when I was done&lt;br /&gt;4. Wish I had bought the replacement heads already - maybe I&#x27;m too rough :(</li>
            <li> I got this for my 13 year old son, who needed to be reminded to brush his teeth twice a day and to do a *good* job. I think the Sonicare helps him to do a much better job of brushing. It has the timer on it for one thing, so he brushes for a full two minutes, but it is also just a superior clean with this brush. I know this because I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for 10 years. The price was reasonable too, compared to what the Sonicares used to cost.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush. So far so GOOD! I like it and makes my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star short because the advertised 2-minute timer doesn&#x27;t work.  The product made some beeping noises upon starting up the first few times I brushed and then never was heard from again.  Otherwise, it does the great job Sonicare is known for.  I just got the thumbs up from my dentist the other day.  I love the little carrying case, too.</li>
            <li> I got my first Sonicare Essence (5300) rechargeable electric toothbrush as a perk from my health insurance company. It served me well, and the battery lasted 7 years, much longer than I had expected. I have been using my new Sonicare Essence 5600 for several months. It is as good or better than the old one. This toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing tartar from my teeth, and my time with the dental hygienist has been been reduced. The zippered&lt;br /&gt;travel pouch is an improvement over the bulky plastic case that came with my original Sonicare. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There was no manual with the toothbrush, it didn&#x27;t come in Phillips box, rather a plain cardboard box. The 2 minute timer is non existant. I&#x27;ve had a different model for about 5 years and it finally died, but it makes me think this one was a refurbished model, so steer clear of this product. Oh yes, it took 3 days to get a full charge.</li>
            <li> I love the product, though I am wondering just HOW LONG it takes to charge up?  It&#x27;s been sat in its charger for nearly 18 hours and it&#x27;s still flashing. When I take it out of the charger, it still flashes as in &amp;#34;it needs charging.&amp;#34; Anyone else having this happen? The other one (without blue stripes on the handle that my wife uses that&#x27;s about six months old doesn&#x27;t keep on flashing when it&#x27;s taken out of the charger).</li>
            <li> The first unit sent to me failed on the 2nd day of use...... but Amazon sent me a replacement unit, and it&#x27;s been&lt;br /&gt;working fine for about a week so far.  But I have used Phillips Sonicare &amp;#34;Essence&amp;#34; models before:  they last about&lt;br /&gt;3-1/2 years, and then you need to buy a new unit; that&#x27;s reasonable service life in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, as my first one finally wore out after over 5 years of use.  I have consistently been impressed with the quality and reliability of Sonicare, so making the decision to purchase a new one was easy.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I got a good price on this from Amazon so I&#x27;m pleased.  The product is alright; it vibrates as reported.  The top and bottom of the toothbrush screw together, but not tightly, and it giggles apart a bit, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem.  I&#x27;ve been interested in the ionic toothbrushes but I&#x27;m told that you must shine light in your mouth while using it.  My friend has one and likes it, but seems it does just about the same as mine w/ regard to what we See about our teeth.  It certainly does make my teeth feel clean and great on brushing the tongue and palate which is important, too, of course. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush but I was a little disappointed to discover that it does not have the &amp;#34;quadpacer timer&amp;#34; where it gives a little signal at 30 second intervals to let you know to change quadrants on your teeth. Wish I would have known that up front.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for several years and can&#x27;t say enough good about them.  I really loved my last toothbrush (the elite e7000) which had the \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; (30-second interval timer), but this time I was not willing to pay $100+ to get a toothbrush with the quadpacer feature.  In addition, I was looking for a toothbrush in which I could use the eSeries brush heads.  Hence, I chose the Essence 5600 and am quite satisfied with this toothbrush.  I am totally sold on Sonicare!!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve had.  The first lasted a long time.  My teeth feel really clean. It has my recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the price of the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is great with one exception.  I have an earlier model, and the tooth brush refills were much cheaper and less intrusive to the environment.  That&#x27;s my only complaint, primarily that you cannot just replace the brush part.  Oh well!</li>
            <li> works very well , like it.</li>
            <li> Gets the teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Does not have the 4 short pauses indicating when to change sides, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who has gum sensitivity. He finds it easy to use and efficient. I was not sure that he would like using it because of the movement, but this has not been a problem.  I bought this at a very good price. It arrived quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tooth bush and an improvement over past models on all counts save one.  The old model alerted you when a quarter of the session was up.  I miss that feature</li>
            <li> Loved it at first then the battery died within 2 months. Too expensive for a toothbrush that&#x27;ll only last 2 months. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, charge, and use right after. My dentist recommended any Sonicare toothbrush and after a couple of days of using this, I can see and feel the difference in my teeth. I really like the 2 minute timer which has helped me become more disciplined in how long I brush. The only downside would be the build up of old toothpaste/water/spit that ends up in the area where the brush and charger connect. It&#x27;s easy to clean so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> unable to fill out warranty. their sit is faulty</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare toothbrush lasted 17 years, but quit suddenly earlier this week.  So I got online and ordered little unit. LOVE IT!!!!!  I paid for the over night - - no one wants furry teeth.  It arrived the next day.  I plugged it in to charge - that first charge did take about 30 hours to fully charge the unit up - and now it&#x27;s working like a dream.  I&#x27;m happy with this unit.</li>
            <li> Love it, this last forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product recommended by my dentist. I have been using it already for 3 months and the improvements in my gums are clear. The only thing is the brush is a bit small so I will change it soon.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and got it at a great price. It really keeps the gums healthy. I was using the Oral B electric brush which&lt;br /&gt;works very well, the Sonicare is even better.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are true... it&#x27;s much louder than the original manufacture version and feels just slightly different somehow.  Still gets the job done but I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Price was well below retail cost.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This is the less expensive version but It preforms great.  Comes with a charger and a travel case. My teeth are feeling the effects every time I brush which is a lot easier thanks to Sonicare</li>
            <li> It is wonderful.  It does just what it is supposed to do with no trouble</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying this product. It took me a bit to get used to having all that power in my mouth but after sticking with it I am finding my whole mouth feels so much better.  I also like that it has a small profile and the charge remains plenty for short travel without the base.</li>
            <li> item as described, thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was on no hassle packing...so it looked like it was replacement pieces rather than the toothbrush.  I never saw that option listed...but product was fine!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, this is my second one</li>
            <li> Excellent dental visit after using for a few months!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the fact that this model doesn&#x27;t have the feature that beeps every 30 seconds to help you organize your brushing...it&#x27;s OK otherwise.</li>
            <li> I know this is doing my teeth and gums a big favor and was recommended by my periodontist.  However, it tickles in a very uncomfortable way.  Some folks who have the same toothbrush say it will just take time to get used to.  It is getting better and my teeth do feel cleaner.  However, some days I just can&#x27;t stand it and revert to my normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My brother in law is a dentist and bought my husband one years ago saying it was the best. Now everyone in my family has one including the kids (the kids version). Once you start using them you will notice how much cleaner your mouth feels compared to a conventional brush. It also has a timer on it so you are more inclined to finish the full two minutes that dentists recommend. Well worth the investment on your future dental bills.</li>
            <li> Awesome tooth brush! Really gets my teeth good and clean. Never looses a charge cause i just put it back on the charger on my sink.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  Love that it&#x27;s timed. Just a tip though don&#x27;t leave the head on the base.  After a short time, it will get moldy.</li>
            <li> Have used the Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush and think it is the best.  They are well constructed, easy to use and clean and a reasonable price.  Have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> Probably 10 years ago I paid around $100 for a Sonicare that beeped every 30 seconds.  This one just goes for 2 minutes and turns off.  I never much paid attention to the 30 second beep and the price here on amazon is amazing.  Seems like the same product brushing wise.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my dentist b/c I was brushing too hard. I didn&#x27;t go for the fancier models and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t-- this basic model works fine if you just take the time to use it.</li>
            <li> WE love our Sonicare toothbrushes and ordered this one thru Amazon as the price was good.  The carry case is nice if you are vacation or our for a night or two.</li>
            <li> I purchases this toothbrush because of the reviews. It works great, I haven&#x27;t had any problems. If anyone complains of the noise, it&#x27;s only loud to the user. I stand next to my husband while he is brushing his teeth and its not that loud.</li>
            <li> Teeth are cleaner, which is true for any electric toothbrush. The \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush-size does not help to clean wisdom tooth, and you probably need to buy a smaller brushhead too, which I have not used yet. The replacement heads are very costly!!</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare works very well on removing plague. I use it to clean my tongue as well..very effective. I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a long time.  So glad I purchase from Amazon, pricing was just right for me.</li>
            <li> these are the very best electric tooth brushes....I have used Philips&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare for years and will continue to buy...the last one lasted for five years.</li>
            <li> Love this - handy but powerful enough to brush teeth great.</li>
            <li> missing the dings to alert you on timing by quadrants but seems more powerful. We have used sonicare for more than 25 years and found their products to be good quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this Philip Sonic toothbrush for a really long time. I&#x27;ve traveled with it overseas two times now and every place I&#x27;ve gone, I&#x27;ve accidentally plugged it into a wrong voltage outlet and killed the charger. Unfortunately, the charger itself is so expensive that for an extra few dollars, you can purchase the entire set. Besides the high price of the charger, this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Everything I thought it would be. This is my second electric toothbrush and this time I went for most cost effective model. It does the job so no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Had the battery version and wore it out. This rechargeable version is great.</li>
            <li> Continue to use a Sonicare. Wife has tried a couple of other, less expensive, brands but keeps stealing the power unit out of my bathroom (just wish she&#x27;d bring it back when she&#x27;s through with it) so that&#x27;s the best testament for the product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!  This toothbrush has a design flaw, in that, water gets inside the unit. It then molds/mildews inside. Impossible to remove all. Black mold.  Should not have to disassemble toothbrush after every use and even had I done so, not sure this problem would not have occurred. Phillips would not refund purchase price.  Only offered to send replacement handle.  Mold was also inside the brush head...in crevices too small to reach, even with a Q-tip. Wish I&#x27;d read reviews before purchasing as I see this problem mentioned over and over by those who have previously purchased. One would think Phillips would take this model off the market.</li>
            <li> WOW what a tremendous price for this toothbrush. I love it and amazed at how much better it is than my last one which was an Oral B Sonicare. I plan on buying another one for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great item! Fast shipping. Product came as described.</li>
            <li> The true test will be whether my dentist tells me in 3 months that my gums are improved.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare (this model) for maybe 10 years.  My first one quit working after about 6 years.  Since then, I have had two others, and both have stopped moving the brush after a few months!  This is getting expensive.  The quality control in China must be lacking.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have it for two years now and it still works great. Got it several times for my family as gifts.</li>
            <li> its a sonicare electric tooth brush anyone who has used one knows it aint your grand pap&#x27;s tooth brush.(lol)</li>
            <li> excellent product but somewhat overppriced</li>
            <li> Its alright.Its not what I expected</li>
            <li> You will never use a coventional toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> I used it in China with a converter and it did not work anymore. You did not mention that it cannot be used with power converter!! If I knew it, I won&#x27;t buy it. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as a gift but it came to me on time and undamaged!</li>
            <li> My bought this toothbrush as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. He loves it so much and would like to give a five stars. It keeps the teeth clean and makes him feel better than the traditional toothbrush. It looks cute and the battery last very long. But, it is heavy somehow. Good product overall. I am consider to purchase one for myself now!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased after hearing so much about it.  Was&#x27;t really sure about it, but once I used it, I was convinced.  The additional brushes are a bit expensive, but really worth it.  My teeth have never been so clean.  Glad  I took the advice from my dental assistant.</li>
            <li> My dental assistant recommended this version of the Philips Sonicare , she knows what I like.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt so clean without going to the dentist !&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this item, in fact, I will soon be ordering one for my husband too.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for many years. They do a great job. When I go to a dentist they look at my teeth and always say &#x27;you must use and electric toothbrush&#x27;. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in many years.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about eight years, but after this period of time the battery wouldn&#x27;t do more than the first two-minute brushing.  So I shopped on Amazon for a replacement.  This one is pretty much your basic Sonicare.  There were others for about twice the price.  I&#x27;ve never tried one with the extra bells and whistles, so maybe I&#x27;m missing something.  However, I think this basic Essence 5600 does a great job and am very satisfied with it.  Hopefully, it&#x27;ll last another eight years.</li>
            <li> This is the third or fourth Sonicare I&#x27;ve had over a period of many years. Withstands trips to the floor! Gunk collects in the well under the brush head, but I just clean it out every couple of days. No real reason to replace it -- I imagine new ones are easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, just getting a replacement. Arrived quickly, happy with it. I like the new cloth case.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought the Essence 5000 A lot sooner. Price is awesome excellent product.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and needed another toothbrush for another destination and chose the same toothbrush that I have at home.  Excellent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is good size, brushes well and leaves mouth and teeth feeling clean like coming from dentist office. .Also like the timer</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to be here on the 7th of May.  It is the 24th of May and nothing has come, no explaination, no package and no acknowledgement that it is very late.  How are you going to resolve this?  I am a very unhappy customer!</li>
            <li> It came in the right amount of time and was what I thought I was ordering. I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Feels like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist! Fantastic product! You should try this awesome toothbrush! Get it!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best tooth brush I have ever used, it is truly amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about their teeth</li>
            <li> I had an older version of Sonicare which finally went kaput! I love this toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same toothbrush that I have used for about 10 years. I wouldn&#x27;t own anything else. You will see the results when you visit your dentist!</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is amazing my teeth feel great after I use it I can believe ever going back to a manual tooth brush</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush. The price is right. I have one and just sent another to a good friend, who is also delighted.  I also have an extra head. Brushes well. Easy to use. Holds charge long. Easy to recharge.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Sonicare from my dentist several years ago.  He doesn&#x27;t sell them anymore so when I needed to replace it, finally, it seemed like a good idea to order online.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product . . . . .</li>
            <li> I love it, cleans my teeth gets them nice and white again.  Closest thing I have to an issue is my concern that my teeth one day will get so white that they will cause a glare back in pictures.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush since they first became available through my dentist- around 1994. This one was for my teenage daughter now that her braces have been removed. These toothbrushes clean very well, especially if you tend to have plaque build-up on your teeth like I used to have. When I go to the dentist for cleaning, the scraping for plaque removal is very minimal. Totally worth it right there!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use. Easy to hold and easy to position and brush all my teeth from all angles.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve owned for many years, so I already knew I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only way to brush!</li>
            <li> this is my second toothbrush and I love it!!! Had to replace one that was very old, happy to have it back</li>
            <li> The person I bought this for is a big fan of this toothbrush.  This was bought because the one she had needed to be replaced...too old.</li>
            <li> The was the first sonicare I owned before I upgraded to the healthy white model. This is the cheapest one, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it lacks in cleaning power in any way. The vibrations took a little bit of getting used to, but after awhile, I actually started to like it. One thing I love it is the fact that after I was done brushing, it feels after-a-dentist-cleaning clean :) It gets the spaces inbetween your teeth and even under the gumline. It says on the box that you get better dental checkups, and that is the truth!&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks to this model is the size and how the brush head is designed. The size is a little bulky compared to the other models, but it&#x27;s not horrible. Also the brush head is a pretty big assembly that screws onto the top. Water and toothpaste can get under this assembly so you have to periodically take the top off and clean under the brush head and the place where it screws onto.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, if you want a sonicare, but don&#x27;t want to burn a huge hole in your wallet, this is a nice one to start out with.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an older version of the same toothbrush. I love it and have already traveled with it. The new, smaller travel bag is nice. My charge lasted long enough for an 8 day trip.</li>
            <li> the tooth brush is the same as my last one which I lost on a trip  and the new one works fine</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare and this less expensive version doesn&#x27;t seem inferior to a more expensive one I had a few years back.  Dentists love them and your gums will too!</li>
            <li> This product works as promised, doing a much better job than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;In fact after brushing my teeth feel as clean as when I leave the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bewildering array of models to chose from. I got the bottom of the line Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 It does the cleaning part very well. I don&#x27;t need a timer, two speeds, and an iTunes connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the replacement heads cost a fortune. But I guess it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;better to have an expensive brush than expensive dentist bills.</li>
            <li> I was considering buying at Costco.  But I saw this at Amazon.com.  I could buy one instead of having to buy two.  It was cheaper with an amazon coupon.  I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, and very little patience so it&#x27;s difficult to get into the back corners of my mouth.  I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now - I purchased it just after a tooth cleaning - and after my first cleaning after purchase my dental hygenist has had to scrape at my teeth a great deal less than in the past.  Win!</li>
            <li> Could not find whether this model has quad pacer, which is a feature I require. Called Sonicare and was told it had this feature. NOT ! Problem is supposed to be resolved by Philips. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband for christmas and he loves it! says its the best one he has had so far</li>
            <li> We purchased this product for our son who is very good with teeth maintenance.  He&#x27;s been using an electric/battery operated toothbrush so we thought this would satisfy him.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my second Sonicare toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had a total of 2 of these great toothbrushes and I love them. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 20 years or more, and would not buy any other brand. This one is just as great as the previous models I&#x27;ve used. And now I have a travel bag so it will be going with me every where I go. I have another brand of toothbrush (battery operated) that I travel with that&#x27;s ok! But nothing like my Sonicare toothbrush. If  you have used one then you know how good it is. If your trying to decide on getting this, let me tell you. Get it! You will not be sorry!!</li>
            <li> I actually DID get a better checkup at the dentist because I was using the Sonicare, so I bought another one for a family member and my daughter bought one too.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed...I betcha.  :)</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son and he specifically requested this brand of toothbrush.  He likes it very much</li>
            <li> first time using one, and it was amazing. My husband likes it also! Feels like I just left the dentist every time.</li>
            <li> Been using this model for about 6 weeks, very happy w/ the results. Way better than my previous Oral-B. Replacement heads can be a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This order was a gift however, I also have this and love it.  It has changed my checkups with the dentist.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and awkward to use.  My dentist recommended it, but I cannot use it. I can brush for only a few seconds and then it becomes painful.  It does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I WAS SHOPPING FOR A SONICARE UNIT, AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT.BUT I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW WHAT AN&amp;#34; E&amp;#34; SERIES WAS - WELL&lt;br /&gt;JUST SO HAPPEN ,YOU HAD THE 5600 MODEL ON SALE . I PURCHASED IT ON A GUESS &amp; IT WAS A HIT !! T.Y. MUCH !!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he said it does a great job...now if he used it without spraying toothpaste all over the cabinet mirror it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as gifts.  I received a &amp;#34;I love this toothbrush&amp;#34; from both people.  (Both teenage girls who would definitely say if they didn&#x27;t like them)&lt;br /&gt;One of them noticed the timer and one didn&#x27;t....  That was an easy way to tell the one that she wasn&#x27;t brushing long enough....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happier if the toothbrush fit into the base a little better.  It will fall out if you give it a little bump.  Other than that, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> My kids love their new Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes. Would highly recommend for personal use or as a gift. Shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for granddaughter for xmas. She likes the way it cleans, it&#x27;s just a little noisy and wish it had come with extra brush head.</li>
            <li> I truly did not care for this product, it could just be me due the fact that I have never used one.  So this is just my opinion.  When you brush and take it out to rinse you must have to turn it off in the process because when I removed it from my mouth it just spun every piece of moisture everywhere (from my mirror to my eye...hahaha).  Good thing I have a good sense of humor. I tried it a few times to find a way to adjust (and I do think I am a pretty bright and smart individual), but this was a bit out of my league.  Again this is just my personal opinion and I have not used it since.  Thank you......</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new Phillips Sonicare toothbrush. I did not think that the electric toothbrush would be any different than others I have tried. I was pleasantly surprised how terrific my teeth feel after using this toothbrush. I would highly recommend this product to others. In fact, I may purchase additional Sonicare toothbrushes as presents for my hard to buy for relatives.</li>
            <li> This really is an excellent little toothbrush. There are no frills, but does exactly what is needed &amp; at a great price point.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and both showed up without the brush heads.  I don&#x27;t know if that is the way it is supposed to be, but that is not what I understood when I paid for them.  The site didn&#x27;t even give me the option to contact the seller to ask a question about it.  Now I have 2 handles, and NO brushes.  Makes it a little harder to brush my teeth don&#x27;t you think???</li>
            <li> No matter how much I clean and dry the handle, by morning the charging stand is stained green.  Every time.  Must be leaking down the middle. Impossible to keep clean</li>
            <li> I bought the Phillips sonicare after much research on various brands.  I previously had an Oral B that I really liked but died after 5+ years of use.  I plan now to get another Oral B.  The Phillips sonicare is far too hard on teeth; the gentle setting (which you can program to use) is fine, but the brush seems to keep switching back to the regular setting, which is way too hard and feels like I have a jackhammer in my mouth.  I have moderate gum recession, and this toothbrush, unlike the Oral B, makes it worse--I constantly have pain when I brush, whereas with the Oral B I did not.  Cleaning, however, is at least as good with the Oral B.  On the plus side, this Phillips toothbrush should do an awesome job on my bathtub grout, which is what I&#x27;m going to try it on once I get a new Oral B.</li>
            <li> Water seeps through the plastic handle where it joins.  This leaves goop and yuck that requires frequent cleaning.  Surely the new design toothbrushes seal better than this one.</li>
            <li> The description says it has a 2 minute timer, which is one reason we bought this brush.  there is NO timer and we are disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> easy as one two three. press button, brush teeth. compact. not overly complicated. works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the replacement heads are way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I was scared and skeptical at the same time about using an electric brush. But after reading all the raving reviews, I had to give it a try. Result? Amazingly fresh mouth and breath! I am an avid coffee drinker and lately I had been observing more than usual yellowness on my teeth. I can say, after first use itself, I felt my teeth much more cleaner, and my breath much more fresher. It is the best gift that you could give your teeth.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage son and he loves it. Set up was easy and it works well for him, the handle is a bit large for me but I don&#x27;t have to use it.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare toothbrush in the past and they are simply the best would not trade for any other brand.</li>
            <li> bought this because I was unable to find a Braun comparable to the one I had been using.  Braun is, in my judgement,&lt;br /&gt;a better product.  With Braun, I had a choice of speed, not so with Sonic</li>
            <li> I would have to say, I expected more than I got with this product.  I owned a Philips Sonicare prior to this one, and my old one had the timer that beeped in 30-second increments so you could switch to a different part of the mouth.  This one does not have that feature.  Also, the travel bag provided was worthless.  The zipper split the first time I used it, and since then it doesn&#x27;t zip at all.  All in all, it was kind of disappointing for the money.</li>
            <li> It was everything I thought it will be .I&#x27;ve had one before but didn&#x27;t take care of it with a little more knowledge on them now it will last even longer here&#x27;s a few tips don&#x27;t use baking soda for some reason it will stop working over time even if u clean it use hot water to clean it pop it loose to clean where the battery is also every three months replace the brush even if it don&#x27;t look like so u can get maximum use</li>
            <li> I will never use a regular toothbrush again. I absolutely love my Philips Sonicare. It makes brushing your teeth fun and enjoyable instead of having it feel more like a chore. Your teeth will never look whiter and feel more clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush purchase but I did have a previous hand-me-down.  That one had a rotating head.  This one is much different and works much better.  It buzzes in your mouth quite strongly and seems to get the job done great.  I&#x27;m no expert on these things but my Dentist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush when my dental hygienist recommend a sonic toothbrush for better dental health. It is efficient.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.  I&#x27;ve always hated the dentist.  But my dentist recommended this toothbrush if I had a little extra to spend.  Luckily I found a deal, but this toothbrush is worth every dollar.  It really cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling like I just left the dentist.  It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the charging light.  I wish it stayed lit instead of blinking, but that is my only complaint.  I have sensitive teeth and gums, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> So impressed I bought me one along with my wife&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mom. She loves it and said that after just a week she can feel a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth. I definitely recommend the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s nice to buy a product that works exactly as advertised! Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it, so I decided to look at Amazon to find it for less.  Same great product, exceptional price. Works just like expected.  I go back to the denist in 2 weeks and can&#x27;t wait to see what he says!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I do not think I will ever use another type of toothbrush again. Such a great buy!</li>
            <li> Really helped my gums.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.  Have used it for over six months and the brush head is still good.</li>
            <li> I have alwasy liked the Phillips toothbrushes, but I ordered this one too quick and did not realize that it did have the feature that have interval (30 sec) signals that tells you to move to another quardrant of your teeth. But I think I can live without it since it does turn off after 2 min which is the recommended time for brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Sonicare and was well aware of the excellence of this product.  However, this Sonicare was defective and would not tighten when attempting to connect the top and bottom of the toothbrush.  Due to that problem the brush made an unwanted screeching sound.</li>
            <li> feels like a dentist cleaning.  Bristles move incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Ok... it&#x27;s a toothbrush but my other electric toothbrush died so I was stuck using a non-electric for a few months. I bought this one and after the switch... what a difference.. It works great on my teeth and the travel case will be handy on trips.</li>
            <li> Great Value for a very good toothbrush.  Very Easy to setup and learn to use.  Two minute timer ensures a consistent brush every time.  I was late to the electric toothbrush party, but now have bought one for everyone in my family.  Dont be fooled by the low price - this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped my old one on concrete and it died (my fault, not the unit&#x27;s). I was going to upgrade to the newer version but didn&#x27;t because; a) my dentist said they weren&#x27;t really any different, b) I still had a bunch of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; heads (that they still sell as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy camper.</li>
            <li> This is a great product . It cleans your teeth better than a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a fool, buy this and get rid of your yellow teeth and halitosis. You deserve it.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, regret did not have to buy a few brush head&lt;br /&gt;Really like this product&lt;br /&gt;I hope to have more promotional activities</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Love the little bag that came with it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommend to me by my dentist. I had a previous model that sucked batteries and gave up on it. This one is rechargeable and keeps the charge for a long time. The cleaning action is excellent and the two minute timed cleaning cycle has actually trained me to use it for the entire time until it automatically shuts off. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So far, this toothbrush is working great.  It vibrates very fast, much faster than my last electric brush.  I like the two-minute timer, too.  I keep brushing until it stops at the 2-minute mark.</li>
            <li> Water gets into the handle and then mold grows... it&#x27;s gross. This design requires you to screw the brush head onto the handle, but it is not water tight. I read other reviews that complained of this too. They&#x27;re right. Go for a newer model, I heard they fixed this issue in the new models.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality toothbrush for the price. This is my 1st sonic toothbrush and the tickling takes some time to get use to.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel great, are so clean, and my dentist is super happy! I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it getting &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; or cleaning as others have mentioned. Charge lasts a long time; I&#x27;ve traveled with no charger, and it didn&#x27;t die at all. I got the &amp;#34;easy packaging&amp;#34; which was nice, and the travel bag was useful. I&#x27;m never going back to a manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The batteries were weak when they arrived and lasted less than a month. When I tried to replace them, I could not get the battery well cover off, either by sliding the cover or by prying it apart with a screwdriver. The unit I received is NOT rechargeable. It has no contacts for a charger base, but Philips Chat swears it is, and they can&#x27;t help me! What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush overall, just one thing I don&#x27;t particularly like. First, I&#x27;ll start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;- great clean&lt;br /&gt;- my teeth are visibly whiter/cleaner&lt;br /&gt;- my mouth feels healthier&lt;br /&gt;- love the 2 min timer&lt;br /&gt;- battery charge lasts a looong time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me has been the design of the removable brush head. This part can get a bit icky if you don&#x27;t unscrew the top and clean it regular.  A minor drawback, though, to an otherwise great electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband since I got one as a gift.  We both love ours</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. holds a great charge and it works great, read the directions for best results to learn where to start and the correct angle. Only thing that takes getting used to is not brushing in the circular motion. Highly recommend and work in a dental office.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected for the price.  It arrived quickly, and for that I was grateful because mine had stopped working!</li>
            <li> I had to retire my old sonicare (can&#x27;t remember the model) and replaced it with this one. The only thing I miss is that this one doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 sec so that you know to move to another quadrant of your mouth. Otherwise, no compaints!</li>
            <li> My last one finally quit so I ordered a new one, It works as expected, hope it lasts as long as my first one</li>
            <li> I have another brush which is better, but this one&lt;br /&gt;is good for traveling or a second brush.  My old&lt;br /&gt;original Sonicare (over 6 yrs old) has a stronger&lt;br /&gt;brush action .</li>
            <li> Second one i have purchased.  Wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> using this everyday, feels great.</li>
            <li> I had an older Essence model that beeped every 30 seconds so I could switch from top/bottom and right/left. This one does NOT have a 30-second interval timer. BIG disappointment as I used the other one for years. I guess I&#x27;m spoiled. If you never had it, you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. The toothbrush is great. The 30-second timer is a nice feature so I&#x27;d recommend a model with it over one that doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Our second Sonicare - it is a great power toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it over the more expensive models of Sonicare</li>
            <li> I have used sonic toothbrushes for years.. It was first recommended to me by my dentist and it was the best advice he has ever given. Nothing beats them\\&quot;!!!!</li>
            <li> My old one died and I bought this to eplace it. Yes, Sonic Care brushes buzz your lips. yes they mak things tingle. Yes the brush is small and not tough enough to brush hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole idea is to let the ultrasonic waves do most of the cleaning, not hard brushing.</li>
            <li> Ya this is a good deal. The travel case is nice, but doesn&#x27;t fit the actual charger in it. Other than that I have had no problems. The manual says that the vibration stutters every thirty seconds so you will know when to move to the next part of mouth, 4 sides, upper left, upper right, lower right and lower left. I am still waiting for the hesitation in the vibration. It doesn&#x27;t do that at all, but it does turn off after 2 min.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift and it was totally appreciated and used daily.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is much better than the e-toothbrush I got from other brand.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this electric toothbrush. I love the long term battery, which so far has lasted around 3 weeks. The feature that stops the toothbrush 2 minutes after start gives you an alert as to how long it should take to brush your teeth. The spinning of the toothbrush head is perfect to effectively clean your teeth and remove anything.</li>
            <li> Pro: super job for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Cons: too harsh for teeth, I got sensitivity teeth after 2 use. I cannot even use cold water afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It might only be good for super healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> Except for its lacking the nice-to-have but not essential Quadrapacer* feature, this reasonably priced Sonicare does everything the more expensive models do.  Like all Sonicare models, it is an excellent product and the travel case is a handy addition.  I recommend Sonicare toothbrushes to everyone.  We have been using them since the mid-1990s and I recall my dental hygienist&#x27;s comment on my first check-up after using my Sonicare for six months.  She asked, \\&quot;Are you enjoying your Sonicare?\\&quot;  I said, \\&quot;How do you know?\\&quot;  She said,  \\&quot;Sonicare&#x27;s clean so thoroughly that it&#x27;s easy for me to tell.\\&quot;  I highly recommend Sonicare and I bought this one as a gift.    *Note:  For first-time Sonicare users, the Quadrapacer feature helps train them to brush each quadrant of their teeth for 30 full seconds during the total two minute run time.  It&#x27;s not essential, but it&#x27;s a good training tool because most manual brushers don&#x27;t come even close to brushing for two minutes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works great, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I had to return it becausde it didn&#x27;t have the quadpacer.  I thought the quadpacer was standard.  I should have never thought this, because this would be the perfect thing to have as an option to make more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a little bit more money and get the quadpacer!</li>
            <li> Have always been happy with the Sonicare unit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buty one of these.  I returned it and got another model so I can&#x27;t say if it was good or not but Soniccare products gerally work well and last a good long time</li>
            <li> Always loved sonicare... and it&#x27;s well priced now!</li>
            <li> An excellent product for the purpose. This is a repeat purchase. My family has 4, so obviously we&#x27;re quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare. So does my dentist.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  2 minutes a day makes the dental hygienist happy.  I like my new techie-toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Nice price and works well.</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric toothbrush and I love the clean feeling of my teeth after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Seriously feels like I went to the dentist after brushing. Don&#x27;t know how I lived without on before</li>
            <li> Wow lol yes it functions as an electric toothbrush but the design actually inflicted pain on me... Because the insides allows for water to fill it and is inconvenient to clean, mold began to grow. I left it in my apartment as I went on vacation for a few weeks and noticed on my return that it looked kind of gross so I tried to clean it and used my finger to pick out some of the gunk that appeared to form in some cracks. I washed my hands to go look into how to properly clean this and did not notice a bit of the gunk which was essentially a mold at that point was still on my finger/finger nail and I began to feel sudden pain as if needles were being punctured into my skin... After rinsing my hand in soap and and hot water for half an hour I&#x27;m here to report that I just threw the thing away and will be purchasing another electric toothbrush that won&#x27;t end up killing me through mold grown inside of it. Jesus christ.    Edit: Confirmed -- I received a finger nail infection from this product and will be taking further action with the manufacturer and Amazon to refund me completely. I also received a gum infection 2 weeks ago while I was in Cancun and did not realize that this toothbrush may have been the source until I returned to my apartment yesterday.</li>
            <li> Think it&#x27;s Great Open it up after 2 days of use&lt;br /&gt;This item Must be cleaned and dried daily&lt;br /&gt;I week  build up is incredible&lt;br /&gt; I clean this with Q Tips and dental floss&lt;br /&gt;Everything  accrues  bacteria</li>
            <li> This is my 4th one of these.  Have gone from 45 minutes to 15 when my teeth are cleaned.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare.  The first one only lasted nine years.  At nine years each, I should be dead in two more, age 100 plus.</li>
            <li> Good product as expected.</li>
            <li> Needed a new toothbrush.  My other Sonicare lasted a long time.  It is a nice weight and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Recommend for cleaner teeth and healthy gums!! Reduces plaque almost instantly!!</li>
            <li> I like it.. I think I have owned about 6 these since they came on the market years ago.. I love them, but, they do wear out and have to be replaced.. This unit replaces one of my older ones that finally died..... So far, so good.. As for age, I have two that are over 6 years old, I think, but the newer ones do not last as long... Why so many, I have property in different places and keep a unit at each location!!!  If you are reading this learn about taking care of your teeth, the best advise I can give you is A. Floss after each meal with Twin-Line Flossers by Placker, B. Use an oral irragation system.. I use the Pansasonic for travel and the RediBreeze, for washing the area around my gums.. Then the last step is the Sonicare... My teeth stay soo clean they hardly need any attention at the dental office... And, now, to add to this, I use the Oil Pulling.. For this, I use Coconut Oil.. Seems to work!!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job, for the basic model you couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Great value.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush for keeping my teeth clean.  It can travel without the base for up to two weeks before needing to be charged.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I hate going to the dentist so after six years I finally went and she was amazed that I hardly had any plaque. She asked if I flossed alot but I don&#x27;t so I said it was my sonicare and she agreed. Thank you so much Sonicare for taking such good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush and have purchased for all my family.  It really motivates young teens to brush daily. Our dentist has noticed an improvement in our dental care. Best price also.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to clean my teeth, at home, that I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Great price, for a good product; And I keep using it!</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted for one of our sons.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this electric toothbrush. My teeth and mount feel so much cleaner. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> as good as the previous ones; this one however doesn&#x27;t have the split timer that splits the brushing times in 30 second intervals.</li>
            <li> Wow. After a week of using this I feel like I just had a cleaning after each brushing. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but gets wet &amp; moldy under the head.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the previous oral b</li>
            <li> Sonicare continues to be the only way to truly clean your teeth and this is a good price for a very efficient model.</li>
            <li> its too bulky and noisy, and the bristles are not at all good, its better to brush your teeth with manual/ regular toothbrush rather than this one.</li>
            <li> I am new to the Sonicare toothbrush, so this was quite a change for me. This is a basic model, but my dentist said the bells and whistles on the others weren&#x27;t necessary. I really like this toothbrush. It&#x27;s great quality and even came with an extended warranty! I will definitely stick with Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Surely cleans well: leaves teeth and gums feeling smooth and refreshed. Makes it easy to use low pressure. Is not for the faint of heart (mouth?), as it is truly sonic: will resonate with everything your head has to offer. My son (7 years old) keeps using his, but it is almost too intense: it tickles and vibrates intensely. My wife is not keen on it. I rather like the clean feeling. I like the 2-minute timer it uses to guide your brushing time.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get accustomed to the sonic aspect.  But it does a great job.  Has a flat side so it doesn&#x27;t roll when you apply the toothpaste.  Cord stores in base so it is neat.  No negatives.</li>
            <li> The dentist insisted that I use this and it has resulted in better check ups and good plaque control. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought first one on Amazon and it broke in less than a month. Brush has a timer and would only run a few seconds. Returned to get a replacement and the exact same thing happened. Just checked and I was told I cannot return to get a refund. Just received second brush six weeks ago. Now I am out $40.</li>
            <li> Was everything I heard it would be. Get a dentist clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the money. Recommend to buy it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good one I am sure but it would not fit the brushes that I have from an older model.  I could not use it since it did not fit my pack and half of brushes that I purchased some time ago.  My old unit started working again after I ordered this one so I made a mistake in ordering this one.  I was able to return it and the company was very good about allowing me to send it back.  Thank you for correcting my mistake.</li>
            <li> After using the Oral-B brush for years, and feeling like the brush was pretty aggressive on my teeth, I did not worry about it until my dentist pointed out that the brush needs to be softer or it damages gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She recommended this brush because of the smaller and softer brush head. It in fact is very effective and cleans the very bottom of the teeth wall without creating discomfort. Wish I changed to it long time ago.</li>
            <li> cleaner and less time consuming</li>
            <li> Replaced a Sonicare that wore out after 7 years. Am very happy with my toothbrush. Does an excellent brushing job.</li>
            <li> You get a quality Sonicare product at a great price.  Nothing fancy, just the base model!  At this price, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Sonicare and I have been very pleased with it. It has a two minute timer which is an excellent way to assure that a thorough job is done. I recommend this for any adult who a values good dental care.</li>
            <li> Basic and does the same job as the upscale multi program models.&lt;br /&gt;I perceive it to be somewhat studier and less likely to fail.</li>
            <li> great,,,,long lasting charge,,,,,,but small head,,,,than older models</li>
            <li> Works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> great cleaning,  easy to use,  stays charged for several days so travels well</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is on sonic&#x27;s website for $79.95, what a great deal,on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This tooth brush is the single best tooth brush i have ever had. It leaves my teeth very clean feeling, and I consider myself a brushaholic  and have been for years (ex smoker). I look forward every morning and night to use this and if I&#x27;m home during the days,will use it after lunch.&lt;br /&gt;Great product fantastic price.</li>
            <li> No timer on it (to alert me to rotate brushing site every 30 seconds)</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth brush with a good price.</li>
            <li> Good price...great shipping</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the brand name except the cost a lot less as is often the case for generic products. Glad I took a shot</li>
            <li> Very sad, this product has already stopped working. Seller can contact me regarding this problem.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush - this is my second one.  But this one was marketed as having the zone timer and it did not. Poor form from the seller.</li>
            <li> Even though this is one of the older models, it is a wonderful toothbrush.  It was purchased for the son of a friend and he loves it.  These are meant to remain on the base, but for some reason I see it left in the bathroom &#x27;off&#x27; the base and apparently the battery life is really good.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t leave it off the base, but it looks like it can take it.  At least as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> The 2-minute timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t order this.  Already have one.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.&lt;br /&gt;My Cousin used it for a year until her dental professional told her to stop! She this device wasnt cleaning properly.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd or 4th Sonicare I bought. Recommended by my dentist, and for good reasons. Since I started using it, more than 10 years ago, all my dentist has to do is the twice a year cleaning. Before, with regular toothbrushes, I frequently had little cavity spots to take care of, maybe once a year. Not any more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a normal toothbrush anymore.  i wish there was a setting to turn down this machine, sometimes it&#x27;s a bit much.  It took a while for me to get used to it and stop hitting my teeth with the back end of the brush (the side without the bristles - um ow), but once I got used to it I don&#x27;t do that anymore unless I&#x27;m really sleepy and clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so powerful that i&#x27;m a bit worried i&#x27;m dehydrating my teeth, that&#x27;s my concern</li>
            <li> My new best friend!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have dental issues and wanted a better electric toothbrush than what I had been using.  Decided on this one as there was a $10 off coupon.  Very happy with purchase.  The pulsating/sonic action is extremely strong and jarring for anyone not use to it (i.e. me).  Felt almost too strong.  Was afraid it would shake loose a crown!  To combat this I used a lighter touch; and over a few days, it was easier to accept/use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate how this really cleans.  Also love the timer.  It comes already charged.  Simply push the button and brush.  Automatically shuts off when the time is up.  (You can always stop earlier than the timer by pushing button to stop as well).  Use with Marvis Jasmin Mint toothpaste.  A winning combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Travel case holds toothbrush only; not the base.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I figured electric toothbrushes were the same as they always were, up and down up and down.  Boy was I surprised then I got this one and it vibrates.  All you do is just place it on your teeth and it does all the work.  I am sold big time!!!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fine.  Does what you expect from a Sonicare.  But $39 (what I paid) and now $45 (the current price) is all just too much for this very basic model.  Buy it somewhere else or wait for a deal.</li>
            <li> looked everywhere for an extra toothbrush for traveling, this was such a great deal I bought 2 to have one for a gift. This also had an extended warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This model does not have the 30 second pause indicator like the others I have had before. It works like the others, but lacks that little 30 second reminder I use to remind me to switch positions.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I buy one of these and all I can say is &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just an amazing toothbrush, totally unlike any of the powered toothbrushes you buy at the pharmacy or grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly cleans your teeth and if used properly is also good for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I got this and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for me son at Christmas. Our Dental office had these and want our son to use one. The price was of high that I told them I would check around. I found this one and it comes with a travel bag. Our son tells me that it&#x27;s awesome and can&#x27;t wait to brush his teeth now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with electric toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve tried a few battery ones and what not but I&#x27;ve normally just used a manual brush. When i caught this item on sale with an Amazon Coupon I decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed. It&#x27;s easy to setup and use and holds a charge for several days if not longer. I&#x27;ve found my teeth look and feel cleaner and look even whiter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m considering buying two more for my families....for my mom and dad....it&#x27;s very useful for lazy people like me to keep the dental health</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, and I&#x27;m pleased with the actual product. Packing seems to be not-so-great as the first brush I received had a large slice into the handle (plastic wrapping was sliced as well, but the shipping box was undamaged). Returned very easily for a second brush, which also had a small scrape in the handle. I decided to just keep this one as it didn&#x27;t appear to interfere with functioning of the brush.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using the tooth brush.  It keeps its charge and is not too loud.  My only comment is with regard to the carrying case. The zipper has given way and can not be repaired.</li>
            <li> excellent cleaning.  HIghly recommended for anyone who has periodontal (gum) issues.  Was recommended by my dentist.  Didn&#x27;t think a toothbrush could make such a difference.</li>
            <li> My teeth do feel so much cleaner. I&#x27;m not sure if I can return to a regular toothbrush again. I feel like I never brushed in my life before I bought these.</li>
            <li> I would give this brush 5 stars, except that while it has a 2 minute timer, it does not beep every 30 seconds so you can be sure to brush all your teeth equally. The Philips Sonicare brush I am trying to replace had this function, and I need it! If this is not an important feature for you, this brush is awesome!</li>
            <li> Love my new sonic.  It &#x27;s amazing how fresh my mouth and teeth feels after using.  This is my second one, the former one lasted almost 4 years.  Very pleased.  Best price ever from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> We purchased two Phillips Sonicare Essence 5600 when our old Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes were not working well. We bought two. Both with a new head for less than $100 for both. They work very well and we prefer the head that screws into the base. The new Sonicare cost a lot more for one than we paid for both. We have been pleased with our purchase and the quality for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;Helen C.</li>
            <li> everything just as described. very happy with order.&lt;br /&gt;I would refer a friend to them.&lt;br /&gt;No hesitation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, AG</li>
            <li> My mean dentist said that I was doing a great job brushing. All I had changed was this. Didn&#x27;t change my routine or anything.</li>
            <li> Cheap and awesome. Works really well for a $40 electric tooth brush. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are a lot cleaner using this brush than with manual brushing. The timer can get annoying if you usually brush your teeth for more than 2 minutes, but I can see why they implemented it.</li>
            <li> works good but like my old one better. Was given as gift and had  2 heads with built in sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Really made a big difference in terms of dental hygiene. My dentist was happy and I could see some visible results.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it and do not look further:-)</li>
            <li> Our first Sonicare lasted years and years and years.  But, eventually, ALL rechargeable batteries fail.  They just do.  So, we bought another one.  And will continue to do so, when they fail, until they plant us.  Great product.  Buy one.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again. I am 70 years old and need to take good care of my teeth. I have a sonic toothbrush of the same kind but it is not going to last much longer. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
            <li> My teeth thank me daily! Actually twice a day</li>
            <li> No stopping to let you know you&#x27;re done with a quadrant.  (Seriously...who uses that?  I hate that feature and am glad it&#x27;s not part of this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush screws onto the base which, unlike the snap on models, doesn&#x27;t leave room for toothpaste to creep into the mechanism and slow it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No speed feature, but the speed is adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> The high frequency buzzing sets my teeth on edge. If you bump it against a tooth with the plastic it gets worse. I think it does a good job and it&#x27;s useful for brushing at the gum line.</li>
            <li> If you are into top tier dental hygiene, and this or the Braun toothbrush aren&#x27;t on your kitchen counter, then you&#x27;re missing the best part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic action might take some getting accustomed too.  First time I used it, it tickled so much I wondered if I would be able to use it.  It does gradually increase the brushing sensation to allow you to adapt.  Took me about 3 or 4 brushings, but the tickling only was that first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, I only wondered how sorry I&#x27;d been had I not purchased this thing.  THere are better models (Braun) that seem to clean to tongue better than this one does, but I am not dissatisfied in the least.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Had it for almost three months now and works great.</li>
            <li> my mother-in-law loves using that, it greatly helps clean the teeth. definitely recommend, amazon has great service for this product</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with debilitating Depression for the last year and have not taken very good care of myself as a result. When I started getting up and doing the things I needed to do, especially self care, I ordered this toothbrush because to be honest my oral hygiene has been non existent.The very first time I used this toothbrush my teeth gleamed and felt so smooth and my mouth felt so fresh and clean, luckily I have good teeth or my dentist would have been mortified. I went back to my dentist for a check up and he didnt even know I had been neglecting my teeth so badly, part of it is genetics, everyone in my family was blessed with strong teeth but I can tell you that before I brushed with this toothbrush my mouth felt down right fuzzy. So yes, this toothbrush is the bomb and undid months of neglect to my oral health. Get it and you won&#x27;t regret it. It goes above and beyond.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been recommending me to switch to an electronic brush for some time.  I finally did, and honestly it feels like I have just come from the dentist every time I brush (a good thing).  The two minute timer is great to make sure you are getting everything super clean, and the ramp up of the amount of vibration through the first 12 times of use made it easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been great too.  I charged it to full power the first time and have been using it twice a day for the last month without having to recharge.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the box it came in was plan and cheesy looking. But the product is great.</li>
            <li> It cleans well.  Only downside is that the replacement brushes are expensive.  Also one need to remove brush from battery after use because mole may grow between the connections.  Since I am sharing the unit with my wife, I need to remove the brush head each time anyway.  I may consider buying softer bushes replacements after the originals wears out.</li>
            <li> Our original Sonicare was more that ten years old.  As expected, this Sonicare product is just as effective as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> The Cadillac of toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Bought to try this at first since it was recommended to me. It didn&#x27;t fail me, the vibration is just right. It also charges quite fast. I will surely buy some more for my husband and daughter. Thanks for this tool.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband.  He loves it and states he could never make his teeth feel do smooth and clean on his own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonic toothbrush for many years, and it was time to replace my old one.  This is a great product that cleans so well, my dentist even sells this product though at a much higher price.  The product is great as well as the price.</li>
            <li> Of great importance, the unit holds a charge for a long time, several days-five days easily-and then I charge it so that it never runs out.  just as advertised, it does a great job of getting my teeth clean and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Great product! Reasonably priced. Simple to use, clean and maintain. I highly recommend it to anyone looking at electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, make brush teeth fun and easy to reach the area that are hard to reach</li>
            <li> We had worn out our old Sonicare, and needed to find a new one. This one was more than adequate: fit our needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> My mother in law bought the whole family sonicare tooth brushes right after they came out. This is now my third version of the tooth brush. They seem to last me about 3 year a piece. There really doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much different about each version. The head are a bit smaller than they used to be. The power is about the same. The batteries seem to last longer. (I forgot my charger on vacation and it only died the last morning of a week of vacation. And I am pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t fully charged to start with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main feature I really like about this particular model is completely ascetic. The handle has blue strives up the side. Since my wife and I both have sonicare tooth brushes it is sometimes hard to tell the difference (just a small circle of color on the bottom of the head.) But now that mine has a blue handle I won&#x27;t ever accidentally grab the wrong one. I really do think these are great tooth brushes and the price really has come down from where they were originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue i that they do need to be cleaned every once in a while. I am not sure this is a design issue, but tooth paste seems to get into the handle a little more than the first generation ones did. But this one is a bit better than the last one that I had in that problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for 10+ years and this one is every bit as efficient as the first one.  Good quality, easy to use and travel case was handy.</li>
            <li> I have waited years to buy this toothbrush, wish I hadn&#x27;t. This is money well spent. After using this for a couple days. I was easily convinced to get one for each member in the house. With 3 kids and the wife, we now have 5 Sonicare toothbrushes in the house. Fast shipping and in perfect working order</li>
            <li> Does the job. Does beep and shuts off after two minutes.  An old review said it didn&#x27;t. Seems well made</li>
            <li> A good choice for the price.  Fits the extra brushes I already had. The original unit I had lasted approx 5 years.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected. Nothing fancy but plain unit which is what I purchased. Good value.&lt;br /&gt;Had replacement brushes which only fit a few models.</li>
            <li> It´s a very good product, i recommended to everyone here in my country, everyone in my home have one of these</li>
            <li> I purchased four of these brushes. Two of them work great, however, within six months, two of them no longer work properly. One will only hold a charge for two minutes, but must constantly be charged. The other will only hold a charge for 10 seconds. Between February and May I contacted customer service and had three replacement handles shipped to my home. Each one of them held a charge only once for 2 minutes after being fully charged for 24 hours. Thereafter, they would not hold the charge longer than 30 seconds or 10 seconds. The warranty covers only replacements and no refunds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time I contacted customer service they asked me for my personal information and wanted to troubleshoot the handle with me over the phone or chat. After telling them repeatedly this is not my first time at the rodeo and giving them my last chat session or case number, then they would concede to no troubleshooting (five minutes waste of time). Each time a brush was mailed out, it would take between 7-10 business days to arrive. Ultimately, I asked for a manager to call me on my cell during the day or after 6 at my home number. We played phone tag for weeks because the manager kept calling the house during business hours. Ultimately, I just left a message that stated please tell me if I can get a refund. The answer was &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was bad customer service compounded by poor product replacement, and terrible manager follow up. Customer Service FAIL.</li>
            <li> This brush Works better that my previous older model electric brush. Powerful, smooth, compact. I recommend it to everyone who wants clean.</li>
            <li> I love using the Sonicare.  The timer is a perfect way to make sure you get your 2 minutes of brushing done.&lt;br /&gt;The whole process makes me mouth feel really clean.  love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first powered toothbrush and I was sold after the first use. My teeth have never felt so clean.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first and only electric toothbrush brand.  I don&#x27;t know if they are all pretty much alike when it comes to cleaning them.  In other to avoid sticky messy goo on the inside, I take it apart and thoroughly clean it after each use.  So, a three-minute brushing ends up being a six minute ordeal.  My only experience is a Sonicare, so this may be an unfair review if all brands work the same and need to be cleaned after each use.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric tooth brush on the market. This is another product that came out of the Seattle area, along with Nordstroms, Microsoft, Starbucks, Boeing, Costco, and of course, the Seahawks.</li>
            <li> It is similar to my old one but my old one was a step above this model.  When I bought it I got the cheaper one and did not realize it does not have the 30 sec. intervals it just runs for 2 min. done.</li>
            <li> Many years ago it was recommened to me i use Sonic Care  i started and still&lt;br /&gt;to this day i use this product. It has saved my teeth from more dentist vists.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% in support of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday. This purchase is a replacement of my old one.</li>
            <li> Loved it! It was hard to get used to it but after third time I was totally amazed by this product. Time saving product completely worthy every penny</li>
            <li> This was the best price i found on this, after much research--It works great, and is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> My dog loves this tooth brush</li>
            <li> If you used Sonicare in the past and loved the Quadpacer  feature -- don&#x27;t expect this model to have it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 rechargeable electric toothbrushes for my boys. They actually enjoy brushing their teeth now! I think this is a quality item and it was delivered very quickly!</li>
            <li> Once I got used to it, I like it. Makes my teeth have that fresh from the Dentist kind of clean and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well.</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family has one and we all like them.  Son is getting married so it made a great gift for his fiance.</li>
            <li> It really made it easier for me to brush my teeth....i can do it during work or reading without much effort. I recommend it to lazy brushers for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, finding the best angels need skills and you might still miss spots. Also, the vibrations is strong and might shock your teeth if you take a wrong angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but all in all I am happy. here is question. who would ever read a 4 star review among 100 other ones?!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad as a gift and he loves it. I did have to purchase the standard size heads for it. So far so good</li>
            <li> Great product. Lightweight easy to use. Tingles at first until you get used to it</li>
            <li> What actually needs to be said here?  Sonicare is the only way to brush.  Every morning, I feel as if I&#x27;ve gone tot he dentist and feel very clean and polished.</li>
            <li> This was $29 after a $10 coupon I found on the site. For the money, it&#x27;s the best thirty bucks I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel much cleaner, the buildup is completely gone and it&#x27;s smooth as if I just went in for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is pretty big and the head does not pop off easy, so having multiple heads for each person in your house is optimistic at best (for the price, you can buy a unit for each person). The charger base is small and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have a few complaints: I wish there was a compact design. I charge this thing every minute except the 4 I&#x27;m using it, why does the battery need to be so big? I also wish the base would accommodate one more unit (not charging, just hold it). That way I could buy just another base and switch out when it needs to be charged. Also, a quick release top shouldn&#x27;t be a \\&quot;feature\\&quot; of a higher priced model. Lastly, I should be able to switch out the brush at will, not the entire top. There&#x27;s no way I should have to pay $10 per brush when only the tip has worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all still worth it. I&#x27;m buying another one for the wife and just setting it on the counter. Clean teeth are worth the costs.</li>
            <li> I brought it as a birthday gift for my daughter.  She had said that her dentist wanted her to buy one.  She loves it!  It makes her teeth feel so much cleaner.  I went on vacation, but didn&#x27;t take my electric toothbrush and had to buy one of those battery operated kids brushes because I couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth right with a regular toothbrush.  I&#x27;m sure she will feel the same as she gets used to using her Essence.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush worked great when first received. After about 2 months, it stopped holding a charge and would only brush for 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate it because I gave it to someone for a gift. It must be ok.</li>
            <li> my dentist recommended that I try the Philips Sonicare.  I&#x27;m glad I did. My teeth feel squeaking clean.  It feels funny at first brushing with this but I have gotten over that.  I can&#x27;t wait to go to dentist to see if there is less plaque.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this toothbrush.  Spend a little more money and get the HealthyWhite or the HealthyWhite Platinum.  I had a Sonicare Elite for almost 8 years and it was the best toothbrush I&#x27;d ever had.  When it died, I bought the Sonicare Essence and I hate it.  The handle is too thick and makes it hard to hold and maneuver.  The on/off button is located so that it makes it easy to shut off in the middle of brushing your teeth.  The Elite had the quadrant brushing had an alert every 30 seconds to shift brushing areas.  The Essence doesn&#x27;t and I had to count off every 30 seconds in my head in order to shift areas to brush.  I used the Essence for about 3 months and then bought the HealthyWhite Platinum and am much happier with it.  Sonicare makes a good product, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before picking this product and was warned about the unit not staying charged so discussed this problem with my husband, an electronic technician and he informed me the toothbrush was not meant to stay on the unit all the time, just when it needed charging and that would make it stop working sooner so...as long as I just charge it every couple of days, until the light stops flashing...so far, so good!!  Plus, the replaceable heads were not more expensive than the whole unit, like at the stores!</li>
            <li> I got one as a gift.  After the first month, I removed the toothbrush head and found a large accumulation of toothpaste and moisture.  Absolutely disgusting, and I assume it was filled with bacteria.  I started cleaning removing the head and cleaning it.  It lasted for 1 year before the rechargeable battery died.</li>
            <li> Vibration was too strong. Very uncomfortable if it touches teeth.</li>
            <li> My son requested this for Christmas and is very pleased with how it cleans his teeth! Good buy and good product. I am sure the dentist will notice the difference at check-time!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, and he absolutely love it! &amp;#60;3  it was shipped to me timely.  5 stars &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Works great, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I already have one; this one was for my husband, who is trying to get used to it.</li>
            <li> this is to replace the tooth brush i have been using for the last 5 years or so. This is the newer verson and it works great. I will buy it again in another 5-6 years...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sonicare. You probably know about it already. It works great. My only complaint is the stock brush is quite hard, tends to irritate my some parts of my gumline.</li>
            <li> This is a new toothbrush for me, since i hadn&#x27;t replaced the old electronic I had in years. I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a week now, and to be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not TERRIBLY sure what exactly it&#x27;s doing in terms of cleaning teeth, but it could be just I&#x27;m just not used to the way in which it operates, since it seems like it moves super fast back and forth faster than you can tell. It feels different, but not in a bad way, and I like the charging system they have, so it&#x27;s easy to tell when it&#x27;s charging. The box says that it can hold a charge for two weeks without needing to be back on the base, but I&#x27;m not so sure I believe that when it takes almost an hour to restore a charge when I used it for 3 minutes....so we&#x27;ll see. But I&#x27;m happy with the price, since most of Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> Works just fine for an electric toothbrush.  Easy to clean.  This is my third one in about twenty years.  The batteries go bad after five or six years but that&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Sonicare before so this was a no brainer.  This is worth the price when you see how your dental check ups improve!</li>
            <li> My wife has one of these, and raved about it, so she bought me one for my birthday! I can honestly say that my teeth feel much cleaner. As my heading states, with the two-minute auto-cut-off, it makes sure you do brush your teeth &amp;#34;long enough&amp;#34;, i.e. properly. One caution, don&#x27;t accidentally turn it on with toothpaste on it outside of your mouth - otherwise you&#x27;ll be wearing it! And no, that didn&#x27;t happen to &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;, it must&#x27;ve happened to my wife?! LOL Also, it does feel funny when the head of the brush actually touches your teeth - quite a buzz - but when just the bristles touch/clean the teeth, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;just fine&amp;#34;. Love it!</li>
            <li> Has replaceable batteries and uses the same brushes as the package I bought for the old Sonicare that broke because the on of switch membrane tore allowinfg water to enter causing a failure with the electronics.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I am presently using the version that uses batteries.  It can be a pain when you&#x27;ve just put toothpaste on the brush and realize the batteries are dead.  I will save the battery operated version for camping trips and such.  I&#x27;m sticking with the rechargeable!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of toothbrush for several years and my denist keeps telling me that it has kept my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare. My first one was still working fine when I ordered this one, it was just yellowed and really used looking...time to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 tooth brush.  It really cleans my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The dentist had mention how great my teeth look&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Lefty</li>
            <li> I received a dirty Amazon box with all the shipping labels on it; which would be standard and normal in any other case. I figured the toothbrush itself has a very flat box. I opened the shipping packaging to discover that the toothbrush and the other contents don&#x27;t get shipped in a normal factory box from Sony, but rather the Amazon packaging which is absolutely filthy and disgusting. I wouldn&#x27;t place this box anywhere near my personal belonging. This means that you have to physically take out all of the content and fix a place for it. The WORST part is that this was supposed to be a gift which I was planning to wrap, but now I have NO CLUE how to make this all work on time. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I had been traveling a lot more often than usual and decided to pick up a second Sonicare toothbrush. My regular travel one just didn&#x27;t cut it anymore. I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this toothbrush.  After using it for many years, my old one stopped working.  I ordered this new one from Amazon at an amazing price.  This product keeps me from having to visit my dentist more often, it really helps keep your gums healthy too.</li>
            <li> As advertised good product cleans my teeth well but does not have the beep function. other than that great product.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of using it.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a reliable product.&lt;br /&gt;This item is actually an upgrade from my previous Sonicare which lasted a full 6.5 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for years and swear by it. I will never is another toothbrush. I bought this as a gift and as expected is great.</li>
            <li> I got for someone else and have never used one. I wish it came with an extra head though. My parents like them.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner. This model automatically shuts off after two minutes of use, which is nice; however, I wish it beeped every 30 seconds or so to let you know when to switch quadrants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations are pretty strong - I learned very quickly not to turn it on until it&#x27;s IN your mouth unless you want toothpaste on the ceiling!</li>
            <li> Went from using the old stick and bristles to this electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s not as fancy as other models I looked at but it was on a really good deal and Phillips Sonicare is a recommended brand by my dentist&#x27;s office. I haven&#x27;t had to test the 2 weeks on one charge claim yet. I noticed with my old tooth brushes that it was easy to miss parts of my teeth when brushing, but I&#x27;ve noticed with this toothbrush that my teeth get really clean with 2 minutes of brushing. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Received sonicare in a reasonable time. It does not have as many functions as my old sonicare but so far it seems to be adequate.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  I have used Philips Sonicare for 4 years, just replace brush head every half year (it was recommended to replace every 3 months).  This is the first time I have to buy a new whole toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Essence 5600 is the best on the market right now it does the job,and the price is right. It fits well in your hand and is gentle on your teeth battery life is great also,have used a few Philips in the past, this one does it well</li>
            <li> I dont know how long but i didnt charge it for 14 days and it was still going strong!! dfgdfg</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for probably about 7 years, had to buy a new one because the battery on my original one would&#x27;t last two minutes anymore, it would die at about a minute and a half and switch off as soon as I pushed the button again. I bought the exact same model because it served my purposes wonderfully and it&#x27;s a killer toothbrush. One thing I would recommend though, is unscrewing the brush from the base every couple days ( I unscrew mine every morning) to let the liquid inside dry out, otherwise you can develop a petri dish inside the internal workings. My medicine cabinet is made out of metal and since the feet on the brush part are magnetic I stick it to the side or top of my cabinet to let it dry out. Works perfectly. Brush heads should be changed about every three months, they can be pricey but if you live near a costco they sell them in a pack for cheap.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected. This is a tried and true product. I had this product for many years and needed a new one. Perfect</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Sonicare which I had been using for about 5 years. The old one still worked but the battery pack did not hold charge over a long term any more.&lt;br /&gt;The new one is exactly the same but did not have the rigid carrying case like the old one.&lt;br /&gt; However, the bottom line is that since using the Sonicare my dental hygenist says my plaque buildup is much less and my teeth stay in good condition between cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> I use that jsut Two Month and that broken!!!!! WHat kind of Product it is ??? Is that really in guarantee product??? It just Broken for just using Two Month and which cannnot be return!! Do Not Buy It and Pay Attention to it. It is Really Bad in Quantity.!!! Do not Trust it. It is really bad in Quantity.</li>
            <li> Though this is the simpler version of what has many different kinds and features now, it still does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need the fancy ones as this one is good enough and has the self timer that tells you how long to brush overall. I used to have one that tells you how long to brush each part of you mouth and there was a capability of vibration strength, but for me personally I found it unnecessary and like this one better. Great travel case included. Awesome fast shipping! :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she is happy with it. We have had no issues so far so its exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference between this and the Philips Sonicare Essence (usually sells for about $70 on Amazon) is that this one has a 2 minute timer ONLY.  The Essence has a 2 minute timer that has a tiny pause every 30 seconds, so you can make sure you&#x27;re brushing each part of your mouth for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush without all the bells and whistles, just one that did a great job and was comfortable.  I found it!  I personally like the smaller brush head as it is easier to do a good job on the back and sides of your teeth....I recommend this to anyone who wants a brush that works well without all the extras of different levels, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and the receiver was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare  Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes for over 10 years now.  When my older model Sonicare died on me a few months ago, I purchased this model and I love it. My dentist recommended it since I had trouble with my gums. I no longer have trouble since using this product.  It is a great product, I would not use any thing else.</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas gift for daughter. she loves it!!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it. However it sounds pretty loud when its on.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have now had four of these.  Even this lowest priced one does essentially the same great job of cleaning your teeth.  We now have one of these and one with all the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; which personally we do not need those extras since we seldom if ever use them.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the toothbrush to get. The other new ones may look fancy, but I don&#x27;t really think you are getting much more for your money.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I am not overly excited about it. I think it doesn&#x27;t do a better job than my manual toothbrush of cleaning my teeth. Also the battery seems to be getting weaker with time. The charging takes longer and has to be done often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for beginners but would definitely buy a better version next time.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, the service was fine.  I do miss the 30 sec. timer on the handle though. Why did they remove it?</li>
            <li> Have used the Sonicare for years.  This one is fine and seems to have a much faster charge rate.  I&#x27;ll stick with these until somebody can convince me that there is a better product out there.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this item . for my friend as a gift , he loves it a lot . thank you very much ,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great for my daughter and her gums are improving!</li>
            <li> I used (and really liked) the same Braun electric toothbrush for 11 years. I really loved that toothbrush, but my wife convinced me to switch to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap, this thing is amazing. I always thought &amp;#34;that fresh from the dentist feel&amp;#34; was just marketing BS. But wow...after my first use of the Sonicare Essence, my teeth really did feel like they&#x27;d just been professionally cleaned. I now annoy my wife by continually declaring that I just came from the dentist&#x27;s office. &amp;#34;Can you believe I was able to get the dentist to see me on a Sunday night???&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great toothbrush. Buy it.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare is my third, they don&#x27;t last forever.  The prior two had a 30 second interval timer.  This unit does not have that which may seem like a small thing.  However, I&#x27;m accustomed to it and had no reason to assume it was only available on \\&quot;selected models\\&quot;.  Just checked and the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush which costs 2 bucks more has \\&quot;Quadpacer with 30 second interval timer\\&quot;.  Perhaps I&#x27;m an uninformed consumer, but I did not see this other model when I was looking and felt no need to be concerned.  I am also no longer a consumer of Phillips products.</li>
            <li> The head does not seal well to the base and it gets FILTHY inside.  (Gunked up with water, spit, toothpaste, etc.)  It is really gross and not hygenic.  When charged fully, it is powerful and stays charged for a long time.  If they could fix the design issue I would love it</li>
            <li> My 12-year-old daughter loves this toothbrush. She recently got braces, and this helps her a lot. The charging station works well. She has had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> We ordered a Philips HX5610/30 and the box we received said it was a 10/30. however, what was in the box was model number HX5610/10.    Amazon is attempting to fix the problem, but in the meantime make sure you get what your ordered and paid for.  They were vey gracious in trying to figure out the problem and issuing me a credit.    We like the /10 model but it does not have the timer as promised in the /30    Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White  by Philips [...]    November 5, 2012 2:30 PM EST</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted about 8 years, with brush head changes regularly.  This model is almost identical to my original.  In fact, I think the brush heads are the same size.  This is a very basic Sonicare model, but it definitely does a great job.  For the money, you can not do better than this toothbrush. The Sonicare vibrations in your mouth take some getting used to, but once familiar, you will never go back to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  I also opted for the Amazon packaging, which meant a custom made Amazon cardboard box, without the horrible, difficult to open plastic packaging. Excellent idea from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift (he&#x27;s obsessed with my sonicare toothbrush). I opened the package when it arrived and was disappointed that the packaging was all cardboard. I had bought mine at costco and received packaging with a picture of the toothbrush ect. This one was the original brown box that sonicare had mailed to amazon (the label was still attatched). So everything was cardboard and rugged. Besides that, I&#x27;m very pleased! Amazing toothbrush, and you can&#x27;t argue with the price.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is made to last. I bought this one for my daughter. I have had my own for a decade and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I started to love this but about 6 weeks (right after it cannot be returned) the motor went to about half its speed then it quit working altogether. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> As a user of a Sonicare toothbrush for many years I am pleased to report that you do not need all of the bells and whistles that the more expensive Sonicare models have.&lt;br /&gt;I am so used to the time it takes to complete a thorough brushing of the teeth that I don&#x27;t have to be prompted when to move to the next quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;Nice low price and rapid shipment.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth a lot more because of this and I&#x27;ve had it for over a month so it&#x27;s not getting old lol.</li>
            <li> Just to clarify, this is my 1st electronic toothbrush and I&#x27;m amazed at the results. Brushing my teeth with this toothbrush has made brushing fun again, and somewhat addictive! It leaves your mouth feeling tingly and clean in all hard to reach areas including the back of the tongue. For $35 I&#x27;d say this a steal when one realizes just how great of a product this is. I will definitely recommend this product to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want great results, white shiners and fresh smelling breath look no further than this bargai!</li>
            <li> My husband and I bought 2 and love them. Great product. I had a similar tooth brush to this and paid $160. There is no difference.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife.  She loves it.  I am ordering one for myself today.  She loves th built in timer that tells you to keep brushing.  kinda funny feature but its a known fact that most people dont brush long enough.</li>
            <li> I like the way my teeth feel after I use this toothbrush. I also love that it goes for 2 minutes then shuts itself off so you know you&#x27;re cleaning for the correct amount of time. Be careful however on not hitting your other teeth with it. It will vibrate the hell out of you. It&#x27;s worth a buy but the replacement heads are costly. This does NOT come with an extra toothbrush head. Just the one.</li>
            <li> Make sure this is what you are intending to order. I did not look carefully enough at the picture or at the replacement heads for this unit.  This product has the &amp;#34;older style&amp;#34; head with the large screw-on brush device. And the body is somewhat thicker.  Not what I had intended, but what I received is what is pictured.  We have used the newer style for several years and I was intending to replace one.  I&#x27;ll keep this anyway.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush, the vibration helps clean the food out between your teeth. It&#x27;s also good for your gums.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a similar Sonicare that I&#x27;ve had for years.Great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find a good electric toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;M.J.</li>
            <li> It feels like an old model and it is.  It&#x27;s not a bad price but it feels cheaply made and has this &amp;#34;going to break soon&amp;#34; vibe to it.  Sonicare is good but you gotta buy a more recent model, I think.</li>
            <li> The perfect toothbrush.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It does everything it says it suppose to do. Very happy.  I will buy another one if this ever dies.</li>
            <li> My OralB electric died after 9 years so I decided to purchase this unit based on infomercials when product first came into the market years ago.  I didn&#x27;t read any reviews and purchased because I had an amazon gift certificate that I couldn&#x27;t use elsewhere.  I tried for 2 months to use a regular toothbrush and wanted to go back to an electric.  I was surprised at how loud the unit is when on, but that is a minor distraction.  The unit really cleans your teeth and the brush bristles are real soft so you don&#x27;t get bleeding gums.  Even after drinking a cup of coffee, I run my tongue across my teeth and there is nothing, no food particles, no scum; just a clean feeling like you get after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  I noticed I have pockets and plaque build up on the upper molars so regular brushing always has my gums bleeding in this area even though I do floss.  Since using the Sonicare, I have not had any issues.  I hope this unit lasts as long if not longer than my OralB.  I am glad I purchased this unit.</li>
            <li> i used to manually brush my teeth before this and since getting this product my teeth have never felt so clean. the brushes last pretty long and the batteries on this last really long. i love it and l bought one for my lady and some for my parent and so far they love it to. this product is definitely recommendable</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the usability of this toothbrush.  My previous Sonicare lasted for a number of years, so I replaced it with this same model when the original finally failed.  THIS ONE did not last a year.  It stopped and will not recharge.  I will be looking for another brand.  Update - Phillips has very graciously promised to send me another handle.  (There was a 2-year warranty.)   I contacted them directly from their website with an online chat.   Thank you Phillips.</li>
            <li> Everybody should use Sonicare if you want to keep your teeth. I am 77 years old ant the old choppers are in great shape.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what my periodontist wanted me to purchase. It has a soft brush so that you can massage your gums as well as brush your teeth. The gum massage is very important to assure good gums after periodontal surgery. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with thuis purchase and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> good automatical toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! I can&#x27;t go back to manual. This toothbrush lasts a long time after one charge. I usually put the charger away for a month at a time (this is with using the brush twice a day). I will bring it out and let it charge for a day once the light starts blinking. Has a convenient 2-minute automatic shut-off feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to take the head off and rinse out the inside frequently or it will get kind of gross. A Q-tip is a good way to reach inside to clean it if needed.</li>
            <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I was getting periodontal problems so my dentist recommended I get this and it works great, my teeth are better than they&#x27;ve ever been, and it&#x27;s so easy, they are so clean the hygenist thinks I&#x27;m flossing when I&#x27;m not.  Guess I really should though, but this is the best thing ever for a toothbrush, and the heads last forever.  I&#x27;ve had it a couple years now without a problem.  I love it.</li>
            <li> great for the price still looking foe additional  replacement heads</li>
            <li> We have two of these and love them.  Teeth and mouth don&#x27;t feel clean if we don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Love this simple toothbrush</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this toothbrush compared to a traditional one. The timer is also great to make sure that I am brushing for the correct amount of time.</li>
            <li> ah, this elevated my life and my teeth! Somehow every time I use this thing I feel healthier already</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare toothbrush for about 8 years and it finally died on me, but still had replacement heads so I needed to find a new sonicare to use the same replacement heads and this one was perfect.  So happy to have an electric toothbrush back,  I would recommend this sonicare for sure! Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the head it comes with is great the replacement heads make alot of noise</li>
            <li> When I first got my e series I was really happy with it and would have given it 5 stars but when I went to change the toothbrush head there was what appeared to be black mold in the brush. I followed the directions on maintenance of the brush but there were no warnings about mold. This brush is a defective product and should be recalled. Mold is a serious health hazard. I have never posted a customer review before but it amazes me that this is a known product defect to the manufacturer and they still allow the brushes to be sold. If you do not believe me about this product defect there is a whole line of products that they sell on Amazon to stop the mold for this tooth brush model. Of course Amazon is not to blame for this. I cannot believe how much money I spent on a toothbrush that I just ended up throwing away after 2 months. I would rather go back to a $3 disposable.  Even though the $3 model doesn&#x27;t work as well it would still be better for my health.</li>
            <li> This electric Philips Sonicare toothbrush is great. Much better than&lt;br /&gt;the Spin tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Have used Philips Sonicare in the past and really enjoy and appreciate the rotation and the way it cleans both teeth and gums.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I used the Oral B prior and this toothbrush gets your teeth much cleaner!</li>
            <li> Works great last without recharging for the week when I&#x27;m gone, cleans well thanks for the coupon right away was great</li>
            <li> This Sonicare brush is missing the timer feature - the one after every 30 seconds.  It has the full timer so just move it around in your mouth.  I also found that sometimes it does not charge.  So I might have to use it - sit it on the charger - use it - sit it on the charger before it starts to charge.</li>
            <li> well I had many Philips products and this is good also.  I like the small head so you can reach the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> No timer but these brushes are great.</li>
            <li> Have been a sonicare fan for sometime now.The brush works well.Frustration free and geny\tle (not too harsh) on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall does the job well.Grat stuff</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for the current unit -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was happy with the original - so decided to stay with the same one -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon had the best price -</li>
            <li> it worked for what it was bought for and i am sure it will work for you too just do it</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  Our original Sonicare toothbrush finally gave out,  This one works great.  I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare.  My first was the same model but not rechareable.  Teeth feel very clean and rechargeable life is nearly 2 weeks if unplugging the base.  Always clean and remove the head as this head type allows a small amount of fluid to get into the unit, and if not careful it will rust internally prematurely.  (that is what happened to my other one).  The cleaning quality is great. It is light weight and comes with a really nice fabric zip case to store for travel.  Last one lasted 3 years, hope to get even longer life out of this one by always cleaning head area where it mates to unit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over the years - everyone a in awhile you do need to replace it. I liked the carrying case that came with it !!</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my old Sonicare (2+yrs) with a dead battery.  I was expecting the battery to last longer than that, so lets hope in this newer model it does.  It takes a rather long time to charge the first time, but after that it seems to hold the charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s a replacement for the one I&#x27;d had for many years (The battery just wouldn&#x27;t recharge any longer). This one is working great. Price is just fine. No problems.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, really gets teeth clean - my dentist noticed a difference! Only drawback is that the 2 minute timer feature is not included on this model.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for about 20 years.... I am now 81 and have a bright, shiny smile..  My sensational dentist gave me my first one and I have replaced it twice since then - says much for the longevity!..</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the toothbrush.  I bought it to replace my old one which was also a Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush so I was familiar with it.  My old one just quit on me all at once, but I had it for 3 years so that wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush met my expectations. For the price of it, it does exactly what you need an electric toothbrush to do.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush I&#x27;m sure it cleans just as well as the more expensive versions. Sonicare toothbrushes do a great job of cleaning your teeth. Before getting this toothbrush I had used other electric toothbrushes, although I thought they worked fine it was not until I got my first Sonicare that I saw a real improvement in cleaning. Before I started using Sonicare the dental assistants cleaning my teeth would ask me if I smoked(no) or if I drank a lot of coffee(yes). Now I don&#x27;t hear that anymore!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of electronic toothbrush for years.  I could not manage without it.  Phillips Sonicare is the best!</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it vibrates too much or something. I think her Spinbrush does. This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate my whole face like a Spinbrush does so my nose doesn&#x27;t itch. My teeth and gums are well cleaned for the time. Now, I just need an autoflosser. Preferably, one that I can use while I sleep. Is that too much to ask?</li>
            <li> My older Philips Sonicare toothbrush I started using on my tomato plants so flowers would set. I had had my old one for several years and didn&#x27;t realize how the battery was kind of worn down.  My new one is very peppy!  Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Great value for your money.</li>
            <li> Went with a new brand from what I have been using.  This one tickles a bit more but my teeth feel so much cleaner when I am finished.  I would recommend to people to purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is kind of hard to use, it brushes too hard and sometimes hurts my teeth, I have stop using it now and won&#x27;t buy it anymore</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. The only concern I have is the price you pay for replacement heads. But, overall the toothbrush works great and it has a two year warranty, more than any other manufacturer out there.</li>
            <li> This thing literally saved my teeth. I was having constant bleeding, swollen gums, plaque buildup, you name it. I refuse to go to the dentist, for no reason other than I&#x27;m stubborn and I hate it. Within about 5 days, my gums stopped bleeding, my plaque had melted away, and my gum&#x27;s swelling has been reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow this with an Orabrush, then floss-picks, and finally mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth is healed!</li>
            <li> Overall  a good sonic care toothbrush. Surprised how much I missed the quad pacing. A good basic toothbrush. Priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. A vast improvement on conventional manual brush. A good choice. I would buy this product again. Provides a much cleaner mouth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love it now but the first time I used it It was almost too ticklish in my mouth. It&#x27;s not as aggressive as other electric toothbrushes so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel like that. It works very well. It&#x27;s basic, not too fancy which is what I was looking for. It does a great job at getting at the back molars you can&#x27;t reach with a normal toothbrush. I&#x27;ll update this if the quality doesn&#x27;t hold up. But my teeth are nice and clean today.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  My teeth have never felt cleaner! I&#x27;ve used it only a few days, having just received it, but my teeth look whiter and it is even reaching plaque in places I could not even get floss to go.  It&#x27;s gentle on the gums and they even look healthier.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush. Really surpassed expectations, very different (and much more effective) compared to a traditional brush.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years with great results.  I am as pleased with this one as with past Sonicare bushes</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my sister after my daughter gave me one as a gift.  It&#x27;s pretty clear that it does a better job of cleaning than the average, battery-operated toothbrush.  The sonic aspect is pretty startling at first, but you quickly get used to it.  To save on frequency of teeth cleaning and general visits to the dentist, I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly decided to purchase an electric toothbrush upon the recommendation of my dentist, but I did NOT think I would like it. I was wrong. I LOVE it. The bristles are extremely soft and the handle is comfortable and easy to hold. After only 3 or 4 days of using, I cannot imagine returning to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This is completely worth the money. I feel gross knowing my teeth weren&#x27;t getting this clean before my Sonicare! My teeth are happy.</li>
            <li> I lost my charger for my first one (had that one since High School... a decade + ago) and decided to just get a whole new set, since it was on sale for about $10 more than just the charger. Very happy to have my smooth, clean teeth back. You won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been missing until you try a Sonicare. My boyfriend tried mine and immediately ordered their &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34;- the most expensive one. I&#x27;m happy with my cheaper one, thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush. My dentist who was a friend had previously bought me a $300 sonicare and it had a lot of trouble staying charged and finally broke after just a year of use. I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it. I was hesitant to order this as it was so cheap... but for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it. I give it 5 stars because for the price  it deserves 5 stars. It does not however come with different speeds.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while ago and it is still going strong. Easy to clean and use. I wouldn&#x27;t by another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I chose this model thinking I was replacing my old one which died when the battery would no longer charge. I was very disappointed when although it appeared to be identical, this model did not have the 30 second timer function. I now realize how convenient that is, and how much I had accostumed myself to the practical function it performs. The written ad content should be more specific in providing information as to which models have that added feature.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t love this more. My girlfriend and i each got one in the multi pack from Costco a couple years ago.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t ever go back to a brush.&lt;br /&gt;We love the Phillips products and no, we do not own stock or work for the company.&lt;br /&gt;The old way of brushing seems as if you were just rubbing your teeth with a stick like a caveman whereas this is actually cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 minute times that pauses every 30 seconds is handy. You won&#x27;t likely use any features beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;The ones with more lights and a smaller handle we&#x27;re more expensive and look neat, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t mind the bigger handle at all. Battery life is awesome. We charge maybe once every 3-4 weeks I think.&lt;br /&gt;Way cheaper than dental work!</li>
            <li> This might not be like the other toothbrushes with all the fancy lights and stuff, but this toothbrush does the job and some. Ive had this toothbrush for about 2 years and it works great the battery stays charged for at least a month still. So I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> OLD MAN WITH FREE CHECK UP TWICE A YEAR TAKES CARE OF ANY CLEANING AND HAVE 5 FALSE TEETH OK!!</li>
            <li> This is second Sonicare toothbrush we purchased - first one, set of 2 purchased at Costco, lasted 4 years with daily use.  Company has excellent customer service (replaced defective toothbrush purchased @ Costco quickly with no questions.</li>
            <li> Though this brush has good power and cleans teeth well, the head needs to be removed daily to clean inside otherwise it gets a build up of slime and grime making it super stinky and rather unsanitary to put back into the mouth. What a pain.&lt;br /&gt;Also the heads are expensive to replace. Come to think of it, the whole brush needs to be replaced because it&#x27;s annoying to maintain, making this a very expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is for brushing teeth, with electricity. Vibrates to remove plaque. Noise can confuse children, house guests and spouses. Best to explain ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Works well. Note: This model does not have the quad timer. The travel bag is &amp;#34;non-optimum.&amp;#34; Spring for the hard plastic molded case; it&#x27;s worth it and works better than the soft case included with this set.</li>
            <li> big bulky, awkward to hold while brushing, feels weird, not very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> My last sonicare was a cheap one (thought this was the same model) but it still beeped at you every 30 seconds. This one does not . That is such an important feature to have. Ill probably send this one back because I do not want to brush my teeth and count in my head or look at my watch while brushing my teeth. I want to brush my teeth not think about it and go.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time. Great packaging, complete with an anti-theft strip. The brush head vibrates faster than previously used electric tooth brushes. Definitely turn the device off before removing from your mouth or else you&#x27;ll get splashes of water on the mirror like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Battery stopped holding a charge in less than 6 months.. Not the quality you&#x27;d expect after paying $40 plus the cost of brush heads</li>
            <li> Brushes very well and battery is great!</li>
            <li> So far Its working out great.  I went to the dentist not to long before I bought this and she told me that it was a must have to have healthy teeth.  I haven&#x27;t any problems with it and for the price you can&#x27;t beat that.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, just wish it h ad the 30 second timer for each side of my teeth....however, Amazon did not stated that it did....I just read it in the directions , but they said it has it in certain models....</li>
            <li> Good product, works well and stays charged for a long time. Only wish it could be smaller.</li>
            <li> Using a Sonicare compared to all previous electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried are like you&#x27;re now driving a Ferrari after driving an Ford Pinto before. The difference using a Sonicare after using other toothbrushes is like night and day. .</li>
            <li> I am SO happy I bought this. After a recommendation from my dentist to go with Sonicare over the Oral-B, not only did I save money, but I love my toothbrush. I actually hate that I don&#x27;t have a little pocket one to bring to work because my teeth feel so clean in the morning that I want that great feeling after lunch...Perhaps I&#x27;ll have to order another! It is a little different from what you might expect, and it takes some getting use to, but I love it. I know my dentist is going to start seeing a difference in my teeth, I sure do!</li>
            <li> Product was as stated.  Excellent shipping time, thank you</li>
            <li> After 10 days of normal use, it stopped working.  Doesn&#x27;t get much crappier than that.</li>
            <li> I visited the dentist a couple of weeks ago and while I did not have a lot of plack build-up, I was still advised to get a electric Sonicare toothbrush.  I  did not purchase them because it was a bit pricey, instead I visited Amazon and found the Philips Sonicare for a much cheaper price so I decided to buy it.  I&#x27;m glad I invested in this toothbrush because it works just fine and removes more plack at a faster pace than my battery operated toothbrush.  Great Buy Love it, Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disappointment compared to the other model.  It is not as easy to keep all the groves clean and is not as easy to disassemble for travel. My old one just stopped one day, perhaps I&#x27;ll try another brand the next time.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I used my hole life</li>
            <li> Easy to use，Whitening effect。</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a real game changer. Once you use it, it&#x27;s hard to go back to a normal brush. It makes your teeth feel amazing and super clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the one with the built in two minute timer, this is not the one.  If you don&#x27;t need it, it is fine.  The toothbrush functions just like my old one, sans timer.</li>
            <li> Well made.  Have to wait until next visit to dentist to see how effective it is. Initial impression is favorable.</li>
            <li> These sonicare toothbrush are great with their vibration but the brush head are really cheap. They worn out so quickly and to replace it is very costly! If you buy this, make sure you have the money to buy their expensive replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> This model works perfect given the dentist&#x27;s approval during my last checkup. I think he spent two minutes cleaning only two areas with calcification (?) deposits and have never seen better gum health. I attribute this solely to electric mechanism vs manual.  I am not as vigilent as I would like, but this compensates for the forgetful brusher.  Am thoroughly pleased with this product for ease of use, battery longevity, and low cost. High recommend!</li>
            <li> It really helps when I brush teeth, at least I will remember to do it. Interesting and  full of fun.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean and it is so easy to use!! Highly recommend to everyone, you will feel the difference after one use</li>
            <li> The battery has lasted well i believe because I do not leave it plugged in all the time, just when it starts running slow.  I like the 2 minute timer so I just walk around with it getting my teeth clean til it shuts off.  I like it.</li>
            <li> For the price it works great. It runs for 120 seconds and you have to think when 30 seconds has passed to move to the next spot.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it.  I am glad I listened t him. I used it twice a day and I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased several for the whole family and won&#x27;t be looking back again! I previously had a Rotadent that I loved, but the battery would not last. I do recommend buying the sonic seal pack of 3 to keep mold out. My only complaint is Philips should fix this issue or supply the sonic seals.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of options out there with more features, but this basic model works great. Good buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the second Sonicare I have owned and I still love it. It is a great workout for your gums as well as the best overall tooth cleaner. It has completely corrected my gum problems and kept me from any cavaties or other major dental work since I started using it. My dentist loves that I use it and have done so for many years now. It is easy to use and sits nicely on its charger so it is ready to use at any time. It may be the lower cost one but it does everything it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Product itself works great. However, we&#x27;ve had this for less than a month and already it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. Initially, we would only plug it in the charger when it beeped and signaled low battery, which was about once a week. Lately, it beeps after one of us brushes our teeth. We then have to charge it all day, and at night when we go to brush our teeth, it is still blinking in the charger, whereas it previously would charge in less than 12 hours.  Now we have to go through the process of returning it for a replacement. We both like how well the product works, but we&#x27;re very reluctant to buy this again with an issue like this presenting itself less than a month after purchasing it.  Update: This has got to be a joke. We returned the original toothbrush that was defective and Amazon shipped us a new one, which was great. Two months later, and this one is doing the same thing. Since two of us use this toothbrush, it should last one week on a full charge as opposed to two weeks if only one person were using it. In addition to the battery not holding charge, it occasionally doesn&#x27;t even indicate that there is low battery. Earlier this week, I was brushing my teeth, and about one minute in, it just shut off. No blinking light, nothing. Just turned off. I thought maybe I accidentally pressed the power button so I pressed it again to make it turn on. It went on for a second or so and then turned off again.   I contacted Philips and explained that this is the second defective toothbrush we&#x27;ve gone through in only a few months, and they said since I&#x27;m still under the two year warranty that they will send me a new one and I can return the broken one. What is wrong with this made in China junk? We take great care of the product? After brushing our teeth, we make sure to remove the toothbrush head and we clean it out gently with a piece of toilet paper so mold or gunk or whatever it is that people on here have claimed appears won&#x27;t. We only charge it when it needs to be charged, which is when the light starts blinking. Per the manual, this should be two weeks on a full charge, but since both my wife and I use it, I would assume it should last one week.   I would never buy this toothbrush again. It works great, and I love how effective it is, but the fact that two different toothbrushes have broken on us within a few months is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 90 year old father.  I had given him the Sonicare product several years ago and the battery apparently gave out.  I surprised him by ordering another through Amazon.  The shipment went fine, although it took a couple more days than I expected, but when it arrived he was very pleased.  He&#x27;s thanked me repeatedly.  Trust me, it&#x27;s not easy pleasing him!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, it takes 24 hours to initially charge. Works very well. It has a 12 cycle start up phase to allow your mouth to get accustomed to the brush. After the 12 cycles the brush runs at full speed.</li>
            <li> Since my 15 year old pre-philips Sonicare toothbrush finally died I had to find a replacement.  Little did I know it would be so difficult to figure out a comparable Sonicare, especially since I had recently purchased several brush heads for the old one.  This Essence is just perfect.  I only hope it lasts as long as the last one did.</li>
            <li> This model Lacks 30 second timer. It is also very bulky it does brushe well. I wish thewish description was clearer</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. My husband has one and needed some new brushes. I went ahead and ordered myself one while I was at it. My teeth feel super clean! There was a bit of a learning curve with getting the toothpaste to stay on the brush and my mirror is also COVERED in toothpaste spray!</li>
            <li> Cheap, works just like my old one. Didn&#x27;t fit my old charger however it came with a new one so no worries. Happy teeth!</li>
            <li> Great product, price, and service.  Only drawback is that the case is a little small even for toothbrush. Would prefer that it have a little room, even for charger.</li>
            <li> love this Philips Soncare</li>
            <li> I have just about ran out of patience with Philips &amp; \\&quot;quality\\&quot; after owning 5 of this brand in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This time with the new \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; on which the charging light stays on 24/7 after 2 weeks of ownership. It is supposed to be on ONLY WHEN THE BATTERY IS BEING CHARGED. (So says Phillips)&lt;br /&gt;Have checked the new charger that came with the unit. It appears fine. Tried the charger from the old unit. It also appears fine.&lt;br /&gt;Ever tried to get a reply from Philips customer service on the Net?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer would recommend this brand even though I will continue to use until it (or I) die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not expected from Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> Great price! Thanks again.. A+ service. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> High tesh product, will recommend to many people!&lt;br /&gt;Has good regharging capacity and good speed. Not bulky,&lt;br /&gt;prefect for traveling!</li>
            <li> This product is a great investment in cavity prevention&lt;br /&gt;and gum health, especially if used three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;Reduce dental check ups and far less need for annual&lt;br /&gt;teeth cleaning for plaque buildup has also been observed.</li>
            <li> When I purchased, I thought it was the same as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;My old one had 4 stops so you knew when to switch from front to back and top to bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This one has the same amount of time but it doesn&#x27;t break it up so you have to decide when to move.&lt;br /&gt;I felt I had better brushing with my old one. I will purchase something better in the future.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean! this toothbrush is the  best! feels like i get a professional cleaning every time! holds a charge for a week +, i love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Sonicare products have been in use in my household for years.  These toothbrushes have improved our dental health.  I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> I reallyu enjoy this and am brushing for the time period they recommend.  It helps get into the back and crannies.</li>
            <li> When I first turned this toothbrush on, it was so loud, I thought it might be broken.  Turns out, it&#x27;s just very low quality.  The irony is, the toothbrush that this one was to replace became incredibly loud (and only started doing that in the last week of it&#x27;s 2 year life), and that&#x27;s why I was replacing it.  In addition to the noise, the base/ handle is so wide, it&#x27;s really not comfortable for a woman&#x27;s hands to get around.  All in all, I wasn&#x27;t happy, but I didn&#x27;t want to deal with Amazon, losing money for a &amp;#34;restock&amp;#34; fee, etc, so I kept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To nip it in the bud, only 4 days later, it stopped vibrating.  Now, I&#x27;m stuck with a loud toothbrush that does nothing and it&#x27;s not even a week old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve had an electric toothbrush before and know quality, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  For some who&#x27;ve never had an electric, this might be acceptable, especially at the cheap price...  But, as they say, cheap just buys you cheap.  In all honesty, I can&#x27;t even believe they&#x27;re selling this model at all.  It&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I like this rechargeable toothbrush but wish it had a bigger brush. I have used it about 2 weeks and am getting used to the motion of an electronic toothbrush. I do love the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> So far I love it. My first brush left my mouth feeling really clean and I love the minimal effort it requires. So far so good. Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> I fiance had an electric toothbrush that she got from her dentist, but that one went bad and she wanted a replacement. I had gotten a Sonicare E-Series a few years ago and suggested she get one herself. She got this one and said it was much better than the other, but the real plus to this is that she paid only half of what she paid for the old one, for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Sonicare line and think it should be considered first by anyone looking to get an electric tooth brush. There are others that are cheaper, but Amazon makes it so you can get an $80 brush for $40, and if your looking at one that&#x27;s priced between $20-$30 you should really consider the ultimate value of what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an original Sonicare toothbrush that I had for eight years or so; the battery on that one finally refused to recharge. My wife&#x27;s lasted almost as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how these toothbrushes make my teeth and gums clean, and I have been getting great reports from the dentist ever since I switched to them.</li>
            <li> My second sonicare, lighter and smaller footprint. Brush is also smaller, but that makes it easier to get in and around back molars. Feels like you&#x27;ve had a dentist&#x27;s cleaning if you use it for the full timed period. My dentist has noticed much less plaque over the years since I started using Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Bought this Sonicare to replace my old one that lasted 7 years.  Since I have been using my Sonicare trips to the dentist for cleaning are so much better.  I would recommend the Sonicare to everyone.  Our son and his family are now using Sonicare after my many praises and his dentist recommendation.</li>
            <li> The sonicare Essence is a good toothbrush especially if you are short on cash.  It does let you know when the 2 minute brush time is up by shutting off.  It worked well but  it did not have the quadpacer feature to tell me when to switch to another part of my mouth. My old sonicare the Advance had that feature and it kept by brushing time more on point. I was lost when I started brushing with the Essence.  Without the quadpacer I had to guess at how much time to spend on each part of my mouth.  I often went through the two minute brush time twice trying to make sure I got every part of my mouth clean.  The brush heads wore out kinda fast too. I don&#x27;t think my brush heads made it to the 3 month mark. In the end I would give it a good rating.  I believe in the Sonicare brand.  My dentist recommended it to me and I have never been disappointed.  I have sensitive teeth and this toothbrush was gentle to my teeth and gums.  This brush kept my teeth and gums pretty healthy. My mouth would always feel clean and fresh after brushing. I would recommend this toothbrush but I wish they would add the  timing feature to it. It&#x27;s a good toothbrush to try if you are new to Sonicare or electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has continued to produce a fine product.  I have used their products previously and bought this one as a replacement for an old one that died after nearly five years of daily no problem service.  This device makes teeth cleaning easy and does a great job (just talk to my dental hygienist).  I would buy another in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> i like this so so so so much&lt;br /&gt;and decide to buy more for my family !!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Product with good price!!!</li>
            <li> Firstly, credit where it is due.  This thing is amazing.  I bought the identical, previous version, about 6 months ago.  My most recent cleaning at the dentist was noticeably better.  Once you get used to the brush, it&#x27;s simple, and leave your teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a rebate on this brush when I purchased it as advertised by Amazon and Phillips on the product page. I filled out the information for the rebate exactly as described (I&#x27;m an experienced rebate claimer.) I got a postcard in the mail that the UPC code was not the correct one.  I still have the box and there isn&#x27;t another UPC code on it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some companies are awful at rebate and fight you tooth and nail to give you what they promised. Phillips seems to be one of these companies.  I&#x27;ll think twice before purchasing anything from them ever again that offers a rebate. BUYER BEWARE with them on this.</li>
            <li> The brush works well but the head bristles are very soft and it looks like I will need to change it very soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my wife&#x27;s old one. She loves it and wont use a regular self propelled tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say except there&#x27;s nothing that feels better on my teeth than a sonicare toothbrush.  I have always brushed too hard with a manual soft toothbrush.  The sonicare is gentler on my teeth and really makes them feel cleaner than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Great value for this toothbrush.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.  Teeth definitely feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> it is a fair product for this price. works well too.</li>
            <li> My son has been asking me for ages to purchase this for him, and so far so good, it has been working great and he is more motivated to brush (wants to brush like mom and dad do). This is an entry level Sonicare and perfect for a tween.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare wore out, and I bought what I thought was a replacement, but this unit does not have the quad-pacer timer like my old unit.  Philips does a VERY POOR job of describing the features on their products, and unless you know what you are looking for, you might miss the fact that they saved 30 cents by not including the beep every 30 seconds to signal moving on to the next quadrant while brushing.  A little thing, but if you have gotten used to it, not having it sucks, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning it.  The unit brushes perfectly though, just like my old one, and the battery lasts a long time (2 weeks).</li>
            <li> I had an old battery toothbrush for years and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I purchased the Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.  What a difference and I especially like the 2 minute timer that automatically shuts the toothbrush off.  There is an adjustment period built in for people like me who haven&#x27;t used a Sonicare product  before and I like that feature as well.  I recently took a 2 week trip and didn&#x27;t take the charger.  It was advertised as being able to work 2 weeks without a charge and it worked as adverised.</li>
            <li> This replaced a ten-year old Sonicare that finally died.  different design, different sized head.  I like this new design.  Wow, even more vigorous cleaning action.</li>
            <li> And it will be the only one I use! This product is wonderful. My teeth feel really clean after using it and the 2 min timer ensures that I am brushing for longer than I did with my regular toothbrush. The instructions are easy to understand and it doesn&#x27;t need constant charging. I&#x27;ve only had this for a week but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tooth brushes a person can use to keep the plack under control. And it&#x27;s portable , easy to take in a travel bag , and charges for a long time. I used it for travel and it was still working after 10 days . I like that it has its own bag to store to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt; It is a compact version of the regular size I have purchased in the past so it does not take up a lot of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;The price is much more affordable compared to the other size I have purchased in the past.. I have had this compact version for months, and use it daily. And it works exactly like my larger version . This is an excellent electric toothbrush .</li>
            <li> I should preface this review that this is the first real re-chargeable electric toothbrush I have owned.  I previously used a generic store brand Crest Spinbrush.  After going through several packs of batteries, I felt the time was right to &amp;#34;step-up&amp;#34; to a higher level.  Without a doubt, this was a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few cleans with this brush were immediately better than my older spinbrush.  I felt like the Sonicare brush did more of the work for me.  The automatic shut-off timer is an interesting feature.  I usually brush my teeth for longer than that period, so the timer doesn&#x27;t line up with how quickly I am cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush can hold its charge throughout multiple brushings; however, the speed does tend to decrease as the battery drains.  I have never used the travel bag that came with the brush.  The size of the brush has made me reluctant to bring it on longer trips.  The head will need to be replaced every so often depending on use (I have used mine for a few months at least.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The online price was also far better than in-store.  The comparison chart here on Amazon was helpful as well for a first time re-chargeable Sonicare brush buyer like me.</li>
            <li> Been using one for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush, always bought those cheaper $8 ones from the store and this thing is like having the dentist clean your teeth every morning.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush!  It definately leaves your teeth feeling like you just came from the dentist for a cleaning appointment.  Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This low price is about $60 lower than the stores around my home.  If you&#x27;re into this kind of oral dental care this brush can&#x27;t be beat.  And - very, very fast Prime delivery!</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare ran for 2 minutes, but in 30 seconds increments. I knew when to move on to the next section of my mouth. Also, the on/off switch is poorly placed. It&#x27;s too easy to accidentally turn it off and think that your 2 minutes are over.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare and I love it! i&#x27;ve wanted one for years, but never felt like I could afford it. I bought this one on Cyber Monday for less than the normal cost, but will not hesitate when it comes time to replace it. My whole mouth feels healther. A Sonicare is definitely an investment in your health.</li>
            <li> gave these as gifts to encourage good dental hygiene, brushes work&lt;br /&gt; for days when off the charger, easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> Great price for this but was disappointed with packaging, especially since it was a Christmas gift!.  It came in cardboard box, no &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; pacakaging.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at the recommendation of my dentist.  It reduced my plaque build up!  The whole family got one of these for Christmas and they love them!</li>
            <li> We have used Sonicare electric tooth brushes for over 20 years This one replaced one that I have had for so long I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it. It finally died. Ordered This in October 2012. It came ahead of schedule, was well packaged, worked right out of the box and is still working fine.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> It is what it is this was a gift and have heard no complaints. That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the cost is now but I got it on sale for about 30 bucks here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the more expensive one&#x27;s do but this one is basically the same as the one I bought for $90.</li>
            <li> This is the \\&quot;no bells and whistles\\&quot; version of the Sonicare.  It is very serviceable and I have few gripes about it.  I guess my main gripe is that eventually crud gets into the cavity inside the replaceable brush modules and gets kind of gross.  It would be nice if Philips would figure out a way to prevent this; it seems to me to be a trait of questionable hygienics.  Other than that, this is a simple, robust little device.  RJB.</li>
            <li> YEAH...Love this.  I am a rapid tarter producer and this has made a huge difference in my cleaning appointments!</li>
            <li> I wish it had the four 30 second timer feature. That is an integral part of the Sonic brushing process.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to keep this model clean - nasty stuff builds up quickly inside tiny difficult-to-reach crevices. It then leaks down overnight onto the base. I received no carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;When i complained to the company that shipped it - they told me it cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste money on this product!</li>
            <li> Short Life.  Mine only lasted 16 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second one I bought that the unit would not recharge.  The recharge light blinks constantly and will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean as visiting the dentist for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Except for the 30 second warning for each quadrant of the month is missing I would say this is a great brush.  Good head size.</li>
            <li> Finally wore out my first Sonicare brush after many years.........so not new to this.  The best way to clean teeth and save huge amounts of money at the dentist.........easy to use, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without a Sonicare................</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but doesn&#x27;t seem to have same features (specifically the 30 second indicator between the 4 cycles).  Has a good hand fit and easy to pack travel pack.</li>
            <li> I personally like the more expensive Sonicare brushes better, but my mom likes the original and it is a great price and works great! Her one prior to this last one I bought her last 10 years. Highly recommend any sonicare products!</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago we started using the Philips Sonicare product at the suggestion of our dentist and dental hygienist. Using this product has resulted in my 4 times a year visit to twice a year to their office.</li>
            <li> I love this Sonicare toothbrush.  Did not purchase the one w/the timer. I always take longer than 2 min. to brush, so didn&#x27;t need that.  It feels like I just got a dental cleaning on my teeth when done.  I will never use anything else.  Great product. :)</li>
            <li> First time trying one of these &#x27;sonic&#x27; tooth brushes.. I have to say, it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling like I just left the dentists. The auto off after 2 minutes of use is a great feature as well.</li>
            <li> As always, it is cheaper to buy through Amazon. The best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have had a sonic toothbrush before, but this one is great. It is annoying that the replacement heads are so expensive, but I figure I will use the heads a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge has worked well so far and my teeth feel so clean after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely didn&#x27;t mind not having the 30 second indicator, and will often brush longer than the 2 minute shut off time. This is awesome, at a great price. Well worth it, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever get the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> teeth/gum feel a lot cleaner, not sure about long term health of gum as some dentists don&#x27;t recommend such products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare for years and my daughter wanted one for Christmas.  She loved it!</li>
            <li> The rechargeable feature of this toothbrush makes it really good. Other electric toothbrush requires screwing and unscrewing but this one can be charged even after you used it.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, but wish it had interval timers.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! Best money I&#x27;ve spent this year! My teeth feel so clean after brushing, and even my gums feel great after. It took a few days to get used to the vibrations since I had been using a manual toothbrush prior to this. I like the 2 minute timer and the fact that it&#x27;s cordless with a 2 week battery life, this brush is just great.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended it. Takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> The battery in my Sonic died after many years of use.  Did not hesitate to order another Sonic that day from Amazon.  Got it  several days later.  Highly recommend this toothbrush.  Dental check-ups have been great since I switched from a manual toothbrush to the Sonic.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush as a gift for my daughter. She was unhappy with the one she was using. However, she loves this products. She&#x27;s very happy with its performance and with its ease of use. She also like the fact that she can easily replace brush heads since they are offered in so many retail outlets. I&#x27;m very happy that I chose this product for her -- she really does love it.</li>
            <li> great replacement for a 10 year old sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old Sonicare which we had used for years.  Because we still have a supply of E-series heads I decided not to upgrade.  This unit works, and my old heads work with it, but it only times for 2-minutes - not with pauses every thirty seconds.  As one who had used the previous E-Series model for about 15 years, and am accustomed to it pausing every 30 seconds to tell me to change &amp;#34;quadrants&amp;#34; - I find this extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li> Works great and brushes better than manual toothbrush. Can see and feel difference in my teeth since I started using this.</li>
            <li> Amazed at how well this product really works!  Definitely comparable to the more expensive models in terms of performance.</li>
            <li> This is the lowest end model, and does the job just fine. However, it does not have the 30-sec timer notification feature so it just runs for 2-minutes straight.</li>
            <li> This is the second Phillips Sony toothrush I have had and I think they are just as good as the original Sony and certasinly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Works great and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> We have been using the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for over 10 years now and wouldn&#x27;t use any other brush again. The only problem was that the toothbrush went on sale at local stores, after we purchased this one on-line and we ended up paying more for it than just buying at a local store. But definitely get this toothbrush, it cleans well. It does take a little while to get use to it, because it tickles, but it is well worth it, just keep it up.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush ok, but I prefer a round head. This one seems to splatter a bit more than a round head.</li>
            <li> not the best sonicare offered by philips</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is easy to use and I don&#x27;t brush too hard on my gums. I tended to brush too hard with the ordinary toothbrush, but when I use the Sonicare it leaves my teeth feeling like I just got a professional cleaning at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> bought for kids. really see a difference. great price. will purchase again for self.</li>
            <li> I guess it is good for what you pay, if I strictly talk about the brush functions, it works really well and I like the fact that it turns off automatically after two minutes of brushing, telling you the optimal time for a good clean. However I&#x27;m just rating this 3 stars due to the fact that it collects saliva and water inside, it gets really gross really fast. I now clean it after each use which is a hassle, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price.</li>
            <li> This was for my aunt whose current Sonicare finally bit the dust.  This works great as expected!  I have one as well and it was recommended by my dentist many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  When my friend got one of these and told me I should get one, I was like, &amp;#34;nah my toothbrush is totally fine.  I don&#x27;t need that.&amp;#34;  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got done using it for the first time, and I&#x27;M A BELIEVER.  There were these two spots on the back of my rear molars that I never felt like the dental hygienist really got when I&#x27;d go to get my teeth cleaned.  They were always kinda rough like there was plaque that just wasn&#x27;t coming off.  I just used this brush for two minutes and those spots are smoother than the last time I left the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.  INCREDIBLE.  I can tell with a few more uses it will only get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums are a bit angry, so go easy if you&#x27;re not used to an electric toothbrush... I got a little over-zealous and now my gums are a little swollen, so I can tell it will take a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is fantastic, though.  Highly recommend it.  A great investment in your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> This is a low-price (as those things go) unit, BUT deceiving because the brush heads for these babies are appx. $15.00 EACH and recommended change of brush heads every three months. That&#x27;s $60.00 a year in cost to operate PLUS $40.00 to buy the unit. I&#x27;m happy enough with the toothbrush, but not these added huge costs. I recommend you consider this before you purchase...I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It could be better than or as good as the Braun but I need to go to the Denti to see what the results are like. The action is different so cannot judge myself.  It works well so know coplaints there. My two Braun, both new , did not work with my old charger so gave up on Braun.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. My 2nd in 7 years. The first one lasted way longer than the MFR even expects it to, as I called their service when the 1st one stopped working, and the rep was surprised it lasted so much longer than the 3-or-so years they expect the battery to work for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also got a better price here than anywhere else, including with the generous coupon Phillips gave me off their company store prices when I called their service line.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonic--they are incredible at keeping tartar down and your teeth feeling clean.  I now have one upstairs and downstairs so that it is convenient to brush!</li>
            <li> Arrived new and as described.</li>
            <li> Cleans good and I am sure it will improve gum health, too</li>
            <li> A workhorse that keeps on running.  This replaces similar models with more that five years use.</li>
            <li> The only reason I even entertained the idea of purchasing an electric toothbrush was because of all of the positive reviews I read on them. I thought I was doing a fine job without one. After the first use, it was clear that this thing just does a superior job with cleaning your teeth. The first few times you use it, your mouth has to get used to the vibrations, but that quickly passes. The fact that you can take this toothbrush fully charged on vacation without the charging base is a great bonus, too. For those wondering (I see it in the questions a lot), it has a small head on it with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great.</li>
            <li> was missing the toothbrush head. sent back and bought one at wal-mart</li>
            <li> prompt delivery great product  thanks</li>
            <li> Works great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush.  First one lasted 11 years before battery died. My hygienist says Sonicare is the best.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works great!  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny--your teeth will feel like you just left the dentist.  This toothbrush is removing stains and keeping plaque buildup at bay.</li>
            <li> We replaced our original Sonic Care of many years duration with this product.  It&#x27;s a disappointed, comparing the two.  The handle of this model is enough bigger around that it is difficult for me to hold.  Also the &amp;#34;nut&amp;#34; mechanism that replaces the toothbrush has a chamber that is not water tight.  If not diligent to clean often, mold grows in that.  Just not happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great and arrived in a timely manner. I was especially pleased with the very low price.</li>
            <li> Feels like you just came from the dentist, every time.&lt;br /&gt;Probably great for gum health too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a store bought battery operated toothbrush for some time, the $10 kind . Not putting those down but for a little more money I now have an excellent toothbrush &amp; the best part is I don&#x27;t have to struggle taking it apart &amp; replace the batteries every 3 wks.</li>
            <li> Works well and charge lasts a long time.  My only complaint is the two minute timer where it auto shuts off cant be turned off.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine life without this product!  Have used it for years, and in this day and age of possible HIGH dentals costs, this product does its part to keep tarter build up down and also keeps teeth brighter which is a good thing especially when one is getting older and isn&#x27;t particularly fond of yellow teeth!  Please Note:  I also floss although you don&#x27;t need to as much due to the high performance of Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Philips Sonicare I&#x27;ve had in I can&#x27;t even remember how many years.  They last forever.  This one has a differently shaped base than the other one I had and that&#x27;s pretty much all I the difference I find in it.  I am very happy with it.  My teeth feel really clean after using it twice a day.  Holds a charge for around 2 weeks.  My other one started running out of a charge after small amounts of time (without using the charger, like when on vacation), which was my clue that it was &amp;#34;going&amp;#34;.  Then it just stopped, period.  The price for this one was reasonable as far as I am concerned and I have no CONS to give about it.  Everything is a PRO remark.  Love the Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had an older one that gave up the ghost after about 8 years!  I love these things and my dentist wishes he could do more deep teeth cleaning.... but he can&#x27;t because I have no &#x27;pockets&#x27; to speak of that would demand it.  I credit this brush with that amazing feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly.  Oh.. and I had an Oral B (also good) but this one seems to do a better job for what I need.</li>
            <li> Like the timer. Now I know when 2 minutes are up and it easy two use</li>
            <li> Worked great - for 2 weeks! Won&#x27;t hold a charge. Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush...I like the 2 minute timer which is about the time it takes to do a thorough job.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> best tooth brush i ever had Love it</li>
            <li> have not used it as old one somehow began working again???</li>
            <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;PROs - works good and hold battery for pretty long time! The brush has lasted me than 2 months, and it&#x27;s still working&lt;br /&gt;CONs- there is no sign of LOW battery.  I don&#x27;t have charger in my bathroom so I left it&#x27;s fully charged in my kitchen.  Once it&#x27;s full, I leave the toothbrush inside the bathroom and use it until it&#x27;s run out of battery.  I hated it when the toothbrush completely dead when I am in a middle of brushing!  The Brush is also very expensive, it&#x27;s same price as a whole set when they&#x27;re onsale.</li>
            <li> Love it. New.  No problem. Still working much later.</li>
            <li> Most amazing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  My mouth has never felt so clean....I wish I would have bought one years ago.  In recent years my gums have begun to recede so I bought this hoping to increase blood flow and clean better along the gum line.  It works!!!  Though I did just learn this particular model is being discontinued.  When I can no longer purchase replacement heads I&#x27;ll certainly buy a new model.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really notice the difference until you try to use a normal toothbrush. I think Oral-B&#x27;s give you a better clean, but sonicare&#x27;s not terrible. Make sure you don&#x27;t use the generic brush heads, they&#x27;re terrible.</li>
            <li> How did I live without this thing?  Makes brushing your teeth fun.</li>
            <li> This one was horrible. Collected saliva inside the brush like crazy. Got the okey to return this defective toothbrush and then forgot and threw it out before the return label came. But thanks Amazon for being responsible and offering to take it back.</li>
            <li> There was nothing in your description that said there was  NO  beeping at the end of each cycle.  Now I have to look at my watch to change positions after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it worked the first time.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Leaves your mouth feeling fresh all day long. Very durable amd comes with all you need.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is horrible!  Great the first month but then we noticed disgusting black mold all over the inside and around the edges.  We unscrewed our toothbrushes everyday after use to help with the build up of the black crap but it didn&#x27;t really help.  It is so gross and unsanitary and now I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  Don&#x27;t spend any money on this junk!  Wish I could return it and get my money back.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is very thorough in teeth care; I wouldn&#x27;t have any other brand.</li>
            <li> This is a product you are going to have to be patient and learn to like it.  When I used it the first time I hated it; it felt too much like a trip to the dentist.  But . . . read the directions fully and keep at it.  After about a month now I am used to it and I don&#x27;t mind it a bit.  It does a thorough job, used correctly, and my gums feel much better than they used to.  I use it more as a gum line massager and cleaner than as a tooth brush.  It runs in 2 minute cycles because that is all the time you are supposed to need to use it properly.  I like that feature.  It trains you to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried and great price!</li>
            <li> Love it! Battery charge has lasted me about a month or so without having to need to be re-charged yet. Great for traveling and the perfect size for my mouth. I have noticed a difference in the color of my teeth since having this toothbrush. It&#x27;s the first Sonicare I&#x27;ve had, but I&#x27;m totally loving it!</li>
            <li> Sonicare electric toothbrushes are great.</li>
            <li> Great product - except have to take the brush off each time so that it doesn&#x27;t leak onto the charger.</li>
            <li> This sonicare does everthing my dentist and I need.</li>
            <li> When I read reviews on this toothbrush I read a few times that the timer on this toothbrush is annoying, get the one that beeps etc..  I didn&#x27;t think of how this one timed you.  It turns off after 2 minutes.  That&#x27;s super, super annoying.  So while I&#x27;m brushing I&#x27;m preparing myself to turn the brush back on, as I tend to brush about 2:30 including gums, tongue etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush seems fine.  But the timer turning the brush off completely after 2 minutes is aggravating.  I&#x27;d really like to give this 3.5 stars but since I can&#x27;t do that it&#x27;s going to get 4 as 3 is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> My days are better with this.</li>
            <li> good price, works well.</li>
            <li> The brush head replacement are extremely expensive. Buy other electric toothbrush then save money!!!</li>
            <li> Great Price and I have always like Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush makes ya feel clean</li>
            <li> It takes a bit getting used to but once you do its great. Definitely a quality product. And my mouth never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> Works super and holds a charge for a very, very long time.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Only tooth brush you will ever need</li>
            <li> I like the vibration on my teeth.  I feel like it is really battling the plaque.  It is very easy to handle and I feel like I can get to each and every tooth and in between.  I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results with Sonicare.  This unit was purchased after my previous unit&#x27;s batteries would no longer hold a charge, after 8 years of use.</li>
            <li> came highly recommended by my dentist so I bought it.  It&#x27;s okay.  I don&#x27;t know what I expected.  I don&#x27;t dislike it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes and this was just a replacement for an old unit. I don&#x27;t think you can beat them.</li>
            <li> I wish it was one that didn&#x27;t need to stay on the charger, but it was cheap enough to charge my way and then get a new one.</li>
            <li> Would buy this toothbrush again. My wife and I both bought one and it cleans very well and is built well.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my mother for Christmas.  She had an e-series Sonicare Toothbrush from about 15 years ago that was finally dying.  I was pleased to find this as a replacement, and am doubly happy that it used the same kind of heads as her old brush!  Great product, fast shipping, my mother is very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this in July of last year. Followed the instructions for charging and didn&#x27;t do anything unusual, but the battery is shot now 7 months later. It charges but dies 30 seconds into brushing. Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> This one works just as well as the one we got in the Costco Two Pack.  No, it doesn&#x27;t beep, but it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I will only buy electric toothbrushes from now on. My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this and they stay cleaner for longer. I can&#x27;t believe Ive used a normal toothbrush for so long. I&#x27;ve even had people compliment me on how white my teeth are and this is the only thing in my oral hygiene routine that I&#x27;ve changed. I will continue buying this product for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush!  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do--clean teeth!&lt;br /&gt;I do think they should include an extra brush.</li>
            <li> I recently took apart a worn-out Sonicare to remove the NiCd batteries for disposal (Cadmium is a hazardous metal that should be disposed of properly).  It was very difficult.  I  am certain that very few people will go the effort I did to dispose of the batteries correctly. It is just irreponsible of Philips to make doing the right thing so hard.  I will not buy another Philips rechargable device until this problem is fixed.</li>
            <li> Will write to Phillips maybe they can help. It gets gross inside the toothbrush even tough we kept it dry</li>
            <li> I have been using the electric toothbrush for years until mine finally died.  I was glad to get it again at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Sonicare brushes.  This is an extremely poor one.  It tends to ooze some kind of gooey substance when not in use.  If I purchased it at a regular retailer I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t leave all that plaque on my teeth and this one does a good job. I wish it would stay cleaner on the shaft and main battery unit though, always build up &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34; and has to be cleaned thoroughly often.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare HX5610 Essence has the well-known leakage problem -- saliva, toothpaste and water accumulate within the handle&#x27;s chamber. This is due to the poor (nonexistent) seal from the rubber boot at the base of the brush stem. Consequently, fluids can leak out slowly down the handle, making it slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, this design flaw can be alleviated so simply with a rubber boot that fits tight around the brush stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying the Sonicare HX6511 Easy Clean, which is designed differently.</li>
            <li> I use my toothbrush daily and when i travel.  Works great!</li>
            <li> GREAT TOOTHBRUSH!!! Its worth every penny. I will never ho back to a manual brush again. Great for oral health in between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> this is a very good toothbrush usually my 11 year old son has difficulty brushing his teeth properly but with the use of this brush he doesn&#x27;t first time with a charm I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush and would buy it again 10 times over and whenever this toothbrush is no longer suitable I&#x27;ll replace it with another toothbrush I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! As usual another Ace product by Philips Sonicare!!</li>
            <li> This is my very first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; battery-operated toothbrush (replacing my rather abrasive Arm &amp; Hammer). It came fully-charged and with a travel carrying case. It works really well and after about a month of using it, I can tell that my gums look healthier and I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again. The heads are also easily replaceable at your local Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Plus they have a rebate typically. Not too shabby!</li>
            <li> sounds great, but i still didn&#x27;t use it, it is for father&#x27;s day gift. hope next time can company with some head for exchange easily.</li>
            <li> Thrilled.  Replaced one that had died.  My wife is quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Purchased this online instead of in store because the price including shipping was by far better---about $20 cheaper!! that&#x27;s a large savings in my mind.  My husband is adjusting to the new &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; mode of this tooth brush but says his teeth feel a lot cleaner and for longer after he uses it.  This was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift since my husband had been using the manual version his whole life previously.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist loves that I use Sonicare... keeps gum problems at bay for us older folks who want to keep our teeth. The only thing I miss in this model (excellent price, by the way) is the beep every 30 seconds to let you know it is time to move on to the next quadrant. Still, I&#x27;m loving the Sonicare tooth brushes. Everyone who values their teeth/gums should have one. (No, I&#x27;m not employed by Sonicare, nor do I have stock in the company! I&#x27;m just a consumer.)</li>
            <li> feels great when I brush, totally worth it. Love it!!! My dentist told me and its so true. love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a number of years now and my dentist says my teeth are in much better shape than they were when I used a regular brush.  It really gets them clean and helps with plaque.</li>
            <li> love love sonicare line. bought this one for my husband since other one died after 3+ years of having. any questions would be happy to answer. FYI think with all sonicare&#x27;s helps with battery life to charge tb up and then unplug and then recharge when it tells you to... it always tells you to charge after you have finished brushing so you never have to go with out a electric brush. what they use to tell you to do when first tb came out on the market and have just kept on doing</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I just had them polished at the dentist.  I use this brush once a day and still using the original brush. I just use a regular tooth brush at other times.</li>
            <li> Works great and have not had any problems with it</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is not sanitary.  Standing water and spit collect inside the brush.  You can see this when you remove the head.  The manual recommends cleaning inside the brush once a week!.  I stopped using the brush because I believe it can cause health problems.  I contacted customer service more than 5 times and they have not gotten back to me. They just give me the same line - that someone will get back to me in 2 days.  I&#x27;ll take the loss of $60 for the toothbrush and $25 for extra heads.  I&#x27;ll never purchase a Philips product again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I had to for this product. Like most individuals, before I buy a product I like to look at customer reviews. I scroll through the comments and try to get a general census of what individuals thought about the product. Having been a smoker for the past 4 years, and having forgotten to brush my teeth on all those drunken college nights, I decided to change my oral health care routine. I needed something that was going to give me a better brush. This toothbrush is everything I could ask for in an electronic toothbrush. Every time I brush my teeth I walk away smiling and thinking about how wonderfully clean my teeth are. I highly recommend this product. This is just my honest opinion, no games, no gimmicks, no tricks.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than before! It does a way better job than my hand. Def recommend buying this. Good price and good product.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to - one can definitely feel the cleaner teeth after brushing as opposed to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 15 years. I inherited bad teeth and have had many cavities despite careful tooth care. The number of cavities greatly diminished when I started using this brush, my teeth feel clean and nice and the hygienist always tells me I have good home care.&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this toothbrush a two because of a design flaw that allows water to leak in between the brushhead and the permanent, rechargeable part. It molds and stinks inside. I take the brush off overnight to allow it to dry and have to clean it out several times a week. This is at least my third Sonicare toothbrush. The last one leaked and stunk as well. The first one I purchased in high school did not leak or stink, even though it was a similar design.&lt;br /&gt;When this one wears out I will be switching brands.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare! My old one broke so I had to get a new one ASAP! I love that this was the easy open option. It didn&#x27;t come with all the obnoxious packaging! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had used a  sonicare toothbrush since the late 1980&#x27;s. It was highly recommended by my dentist and has proved to be the best toothbrush for my teeth I have ever used. I will always own and use a sonicare toothbrush .&lt;br /&gt;telmail</li>
            <li> This was a very affordable electric toothbrush and the price was excellent compared to brick and mortar pricing.  Easy to charge, clean and use.  The timer is neat as it shows you just how long you should brush your teeth.  No complaints about the product thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to warn that it comes with only one brush, they last for 3 months, but you have to buy a specific type.  So keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Worked well while I had it, broke after 4 months. Just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> Only has a benefit if you use it daily. It does work well as long as you take the time to go the entire two minutes, instead of just rushing it.</li>
            <li> This brush will leave your teeth feeling VERY clean but it tends to work a little hard on the gums. Takes a couple weeks to build a tolerance to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Sonicare that I purchased several years ago.  I didn&#x27;t know that Philips had introduced multiple models during those intervening years, so I incorrectly assumed that all models would have a pulse every 30 seconds as a signal to change where I&#x27;m brushing.  I should have done more homework before I bought this model, but I would also give Philips feedback that this is a basic feature that should be included on all models.</li>
            <li> it exceeds me expectation~ and I got it at a good price. the power and the shake are strong and impressive</li>
            <li> great product at a great price with a timely delivery</li>
            <li> I was impressed at the price, especially having received it and note very little difference in it and the usual ones I have had that were substantially more than this one.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the one I&#x27;d had for a long time, the old one simply stopped working.  If you have a lot of dental issues you must use a Sonicare...or even if you don&#x27;t!  I just wish the heads didn&#x27;t wear out.</li>
            <li> Best price I have seen over the Internet. Dentist recommended.  Passing on the word to my friends. A definite must.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a different version of Sonicare. I probably prefer the slimmer model to this one, but I do like this one. It is a good product that helps you keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this replacement for my older model Sonicare that finally refused to recharge.  I had recently bought replacement brushes and really didn&#x27;t want to throw them away unused.  I found this compatible model - almost identical to what I had before.  It&#x27;s working perfectly.  I saved money on the older model, can use my new replacement heads, and my teeth are once again feeling Soniclean!</li>
            <li> Although, the quality of the product is there, the presentation leaves a lot to be desire.  It was intended to be a Christmas present and it came in a cardbox that had to be desintegrated to open.  Disapointed with the covers.  It looked awfully chea[!</li>
            <li> Initially bought for my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend but his mom had already purchased one for him so I gave to my son. He loves it! No more guessing about time.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old one which the replacement brushes are very expenses&lt;br /&gt;I bought this newer model and it works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Philips Essence toothbrushes and love them.  My only complaint is that the rechargeable battery cannot be replaced when it gets old, so you have to buy a whole new brush.  The amazon price is very good.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare, and I always like how much cleaner my teeth get from using a sonciare than a regular toothbrush. Only thing I didn&#x27;t expect is I thought this was a model with the timer built in and it&#x27;s not, so I have to count to 30 seconds myself. No big deal, but if you want the timer, go for another brush.</li>
            <li> Works well and is less expensive than other models because it has fewer features - nothing fancy but it serves its purpose</li>
            <li> What else can I say? Just enough to get this up to the minimum of fifteen words, I guess. There...</li>
            <li> Works great and is perfectly easy to use. Charges fast and doesn&#x27;t need charging for many many many uses. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works great.</li>
            <li> It is the worst thing that I buy</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this model, it was working great, but the hand unit would turn off at time when brushing. it was over 15 years old, so it was time for a replacement. This unit is great, the stem is narrow, easy to reach for those back teeth, the stand is lighter and easier to dock the hand unit.. if you are looking for a new brush, get this one.. you will love it..!!</li>
            <li> This is really worth having and it is also cheaper than the ones that other stores offers.  Worth the money!  Must buy!</li>
            <li> Just buy it.  You&#x27;re teeth have never been this clean before, trust me.  You could brush for an hour with a normal toothbrush and not be as clean as this device makes them in 2 minutes.  Your teeth will feel like they do after the dentist cleans them, every single day.  Whiter, cleaner, smooth teeth.  Removes tartar/plaque and junk between your teeth.  Very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with the higher-priced models... the additional functionalities they have are just gimicks.  This model is all you need.  This is my second purchase because my wife kept stealing mine.</li>
            <li> Brush is too small, Sonic speed is irritating. Sorry I wasted the money for it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. Its amazing and quiet. My teeth feel great and it was a good price. Recommend this item</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years and like them for brushing my teeth and gums. Every model I have purchased including two of this model series has had a convenient feature whereby every 30 seconds the brush motor would pause and I would shift to another section of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some greedy executives at Phillips have decided to disable this function on some toothbrush submodels like this HX5610/30 so they can upcharge for it on their standard models. This is now called by Phillips &amp;#34;quadpacer&amp;#34; and you now need to pay extra for this basic functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips also makes a recharging base that is 110v AC only, one that is sold in Europe that is 220v AC only, and one that is 110/220v AC which can be used anywhere in the world with only a plug adapter. I had to buy the 110/220v charger base directly from Phillips for an extra $45 plus shipping. Phillips should provide this dual voltage base as the standard charger or at least make it readily available through the same merchants that sell their toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next electric toothbrush will not be a Sonicare. I can pay less and get more with other brands which have gotten better reviews from testers.</li>
            <li> This one replaces a similar model I had for over 10 years.  I am able to use the brushes from the previous model.  Before I used Sonicare, I usually had many calcium deposits on the back bottom teeth, but after using Sonicare daily, my dental caretaker has less work to do removing the few and little calcium deposits that the brush can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the plaque between the teeth and gums very easily at all. Rotary head may have been a more worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice  and affordable , delivery was fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this one. I used to have the elite model and it just died so I ordered a new handle and this is the one I got but it&#x27;s not the elite model. I didn&#x27;t find where I could order just an elite model handle because I guess they&#x27;re older. In any case it does not time 30 seconds per quadrant. I had the elite for years so I&#x27;m used to a subtle  reminder to change quadrants. So while this may be a good toothbrush I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Ellite.</li>
            <li> Cleans incredibly well, almost too well. Cant use it every day, seems like it is cleaning off more than it should. I use it every couple days, then the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush in-between.</li>
            <li> If is your first time with Electric Toothbrush this is the right product. I am so happy and is Phillips.</li>
            <li> Its ok of a tooth brush, not as good as the more expensive ones but better than a standard brush</li>
            <li> My old sonicare is dying. Ordered a new one here. Better price and an easy open box. Recieved earlier than promised. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Other Sonicare products performed very well, and lasted a long time.  That&#x27;s the reason I purchased another Philips product.  This unit lasted about 6 months and is now useless.  I will not purchase another Philips Sonicare product for a very long time.  I&#x27;m going to give their competition a chance to win me over.  You blew it Philips!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Nice ability to split apart for travel, which I have used twice.  Hold charge for a long time.  (2 weeks).  A good buy.</li>
            <li> have been using sonic toothbrushes and would not even consider another toothbrush-whole family uses this brand and all love them</li>
            <li> This never accepted a charge. I didn&#x27;t realize this until after the 30 day return window.</li>
            <li> It works and it is affordable. It is better than oral B. However, it is poorly designed because water gets in to grow mold.</li>
            <li> My last one died after 2 years and it&#x27;s battery charge was only for a coupledays. This one is working now- only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than my Oral B.</li>
            <li> Got this one for my boyfriend &amp; I already have one of my own.  It works well &amp; the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It fell apart after two weeks.  I have used Sonicare for years and this never happened before.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected and better than Oral B! great product.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace the exact model, after 3 years.  Love it  great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for 4 months and its been great. Its my first experience with an electric toothbrush and although this one is great I&#x27;m looking to upgrade</li>
            <li> Excellent product at good price compared to stores.</li>
            <li> One thing missing from this version versus the old one we had: the two-minute timer.  Not a big deal, but it was a nice feature.</li>
            <li> excellent product!  I have one for my son and myself.  My son used to hate to brush his teeth, now he loves it because this brush massages his gums!</li>
            <li> So far, works and reliable.</li>
            <li> My old one died and this was a great price and I am very happy with it. Flexible carrying case makes it easier to pack, and I took it on a one month trip and left the charger home and it stayed revved up the whole time! Get it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Brushing for dummies. Now when I go in for dental appointments I don&#x27;t need to get a lesson in how to brush my teeth correctly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 2-3 years now, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to an un-electric toothbrush. I usually take normal toothbrushes with me whenever I go on vacation, and after coming home and using this toothbrush again, it&#x27;s so clear how big the difference is. The bristles are soft and easy on your gums, but still keep your teeth clean. In fact, I find that my teeth are WAY cleaner when using an electric, soft-bristled toothbrush than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station makes it rather easy to recharge, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with batteries. The only downside is it takes up a bit of counter space, but it&#x27;s not too much. Definitely not more than a toothbrush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to buy new heads every 1-2 months&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaner feeling mouth and teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Easy on your gums&lt;br /&gt;-Timer to tell you when to stop brushing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-You need to clean it every 3-4 weeks or else gross buildup will happen&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit bulky to travel with, even with the small travel case</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare for years and it was time for a new one</li>
            <li> I turned it on for the first time and I was like &amp;#34;yoooo it&#x27;s like an earthquake in my mouth&amp;#34; but it cleans my teeth very well, and the timer is very useful. Carrying case rocks.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Three months in and it has been working fantastically!</li>
            <li> perfect!! i dont think i can ever go back to a normal tooth brush. the only thing i didnt like is it doesnt turn off if you push to hard liket he product says it does.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me to use it because I have dry mouth and resultant plaque build up.  I have good checkups.</li>
            <li> When it works it is awesome.  Mine lasted 5 weeks and shuts itself off in less than one mine and then runs for 5 seconds:(</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush. It has excellent battery life and cleans teeth very well. However, if you don&#x27;t take care to clean it regularly it get really nasty on the inside.</li>
            <li> Great pattern and colors!. Looks great on the patio table. I had to weigh it down with a heavy planter as it will not stay in place if it gets a bit windy.&lt;br /&gt;It would be a lot nicer and useful if it were a bit heavier but I still am enjoying it and feel that it is good value for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. You do need to take it apart and keep t clean to avoid nastiness</li>
            <li> man this feels good, this toothbrush is a steal. Makes me feel like a man again.</li>
            <li> My daughter said she loved this tooth brush and so did her Dentist. I already had one and so I wanted her to make sure she took good care of her teeth.</li>
            <li> Works as described my mouth feels cleaner</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a few months and I like it. It serves its purpose without all the fancy features that I don&#x27;t need. Good price and quality. Will buy it again when it is time for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth like no toothbrush could ever clean.  Feels like you just came from the dentist after a tooth cleaning.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an upgrade to a previous model I had for years that finally gave out.  Getting great checkups with the dentist!</li>
            <li> This replaces a previous model I had. Charges rapidly and beeper to let you know when two minutes has elapsed for thorough brushing time.</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisier than my old one but not that much.  It still does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Quite effective to clean teeth. Only thing bad is that I don&#x27;t understand the led indicator. The manual seems a little confusing to me.</li>
            <li> this model does not have the quad timer which I was under the impression it was part of 6the design.  Not happy with this model.  Thank you,</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Great price.</li>
            <li> it tightens my gums and I never have any bleeding when brushing my teeth and even teeth that felt loose are tight again due to the healthy gums.  I can only recommend it to everyone.  Thank you  Uta A. E. Carleno</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years after my dentist pointed out that I had really bad plaque. The improvement in using this toothbrush has been incredible - no more endless poking and scraping at the 6 month check up anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Essence line is the cheapest of the Sonicare line featuring only a 2 minute timer. I&#x27;m a little peeved that they&#x27;ve stripped the 30 second interval timer from the cheaper models (they do throw in a travel bag...which I tossed...). The replacement heads aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old ones either - the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; piece and narrow neck are more prone to breakage. But I&#x27;m loyal to this brand since it&#x27;s worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also comes with a charger and the standard size head...and I use the compact, so I had to purchase that separately.</li>
            <li> I use this electric toothbrush twice a day for good oral &amp; dental health. This model does a much better job because it has more flexibility.</li>
            <li> Love it. Recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> What can I say?other than I like it.</li>
            <li> gentle thorough toobrush- easy to assemble and charge</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the same item that I had for over 10 years.  Liked the first one and am enjoying this one.</li>
            <li> Great product and glad to be able to find it at a reasonable price.  My other wasn&#x27;t working anymore and needed to replace.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.  The travel case was very convenient.</li>
            <li> This is a typical Sonicare tooth brush, it&#x27;s built and functions well, and will for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;This model has the 2 minute timer, but does NOT have the 30 sec &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; timer that tells you how far through the cycle it is. I&#x27;m dissapointed that Sonicare removed this feature from their base model.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare toothbrush since 1995 and really like it. However, I didn&#x27;t realize one of their products doesn&#x27;t have the quadpacer (a beep after 30 seconds). This model doesn&#x27;t have that feature and I miss it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush but I prefer the more expensive model.  This one builds up gunk where it screws on.</li>
            <li> Can I leave more stars? I simply love it love it love it. I had my 6 moth deep cleaning at my dentist and the hygienist recommend it. I thought it was a little pricey but then I though: &amp;#34;hey how much does it cost to have a little cavity fixed?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and using everyday twice a day (I use a regular toothbrush for after lunch) and I love the feeling of having all my teeth clean I even feel them polished and brighter (Probably is not true but I feel like it) I really like it</li>
            <li> I purchased the first Sonicare toothbrush when they first were introduced, several years ago. I paid over $120 at that time. Happy to see the priced reduced, but the brush no longer provides an automatic timer during brushing.</li>
            <li> Good entry level electric toothbrush.  No bells or whistles.  Would be nice if it had more power.</li>
            <li> As someone who has never used an electric toothbrush, it took me approximately 2-3 cleanings to get used to it.  The first couple of times that I used it, it tickled too much that I had to switch to my manual toothbrush.  But I quickly became accustomed to it, and now love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush shuts off after 2 minutes, indicating that you&#x27;re good to go!  It fits comfortably.  It came charged and ready to use.  I&#x27;ve only had to recharge it once in 2 weeks time.  Will be great for travel as I won&#x27;t have to take the recharger.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean with very little effort at all. I don&#x27;t know why I have resisted this for so long. I and my teeth are very happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> This works well in that it automatically stops at exactly two minutes. If it is supposed to beep at 30 second intervals to let you know that you should move to a different section, then mine does not do that!</li>
            <li> Perfect price and quality and a nice travel pouch.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.. I would recommend if your in the market for an electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Great clean for whiter, brighter teeth!</li>
            <li> for one that I had had for several years and finally died.  Good product for the price point.  Didn&#x27;t really care about the travel option but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have it.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Works just like I expected. It is a little larger than I thought it&#x27;d be but no big deal.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare after my last one&#x27;s charger died. Even though it&#x27;s an older model I was able to buy the right charger to go with the 2 heads I had. Works great. Seems like I started noticing whiter teeth right away. I don&#x27;t use it every time, generally 1x a day or less, but it still makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Large akward handle/base part.  Even when fully charged it doesn&#x27;t really have the &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; I&#x27;d like.  I have the nicer sonicare unit that has a smaller handle part and significantly more intense &amp;#34;vibration&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have an electric toothbrush for superior dental care.  This one is probably superior to most. The replacement brush-heads are grossly overpriced so I recommend taking a mini-hacksaw and removing the worn brush near the top from the elec toothbrush and one from a new regular toothbrush and epoxying (gluing) the new brush-head from the regular toothbrush onto the electric toothbrush shaft.  Also, I had an older Sonicare that had died but I had kept the unused replacement brushheads.  When I bought this model, it said that my older brushheads were compatible.  But they weren&#x27;t. Amazon lied.  I had to use my hacksaw to remove the plastic tabs on the side of the old brushhead so it would fit in the new handle.  Phillips is devious about making new models that are incompatible with older brushes.  So the customer must get devious too with a hacksaw and glue.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush purchase and so far I am completely satisfied, nice product and this one appears to be easier top clean up than the last one as well.</li>
            <li> Not like regular electric brushes. Got another for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> For the cost of box of white strips you can get a toothbrush that will whiten your teeth everyday! After a couple weeks of use my teeth are noticeably whiter, and my teeth have always been white! Great for gum health; the 2 minute timer encourages you to brush for the full amount of time - no cheating here! For 35 bucks this is a steal.</li>
            <li> I had an ultrasonic that I used for 15 years before I just threw it out. The new models are a vast improvement over the original design.</li>
            <li> My oral B died and had to buy a new one. I liked the price and that this has a standard shape toothbrush. It works well, I think it is stronger than my old one that I had for 12 years! It is also quieter!  The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have found is the light...I need dark to sleep and this has a small light on it that I can see if I leave the master bath door open at night.</li>
            <li> Good product, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product at great $$. beats paying retail.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.  I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes in the past but none as good as this.  The quality is there and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Mother really likes it.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. The case is a nice added touch.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, but prefer a more deluxe model</li>
            <li> what a piece of crap this toothbrush didn&#x27;t even last a year it made really loud noises but the sonic part of it stopped working within 6 months I went back to my Oral B</li>
            <li> This thing is really heavy to hold compared to my prior Oral B brush.  And it is so thick that when it starts to slide out of my hand, i suddenly find that I&#x27;m gripping the vibrating end of the brush and I have an awkward time repositioning my hand around the body of the brush.  The jury is still out on this one for me.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description of this item well enough.  The price was low but it doesn&#x27;t have the features of the one I was replacing.</li>
            <li> very sharp, easy and convenient</li>
            <li> After a little over a year the battery quit charging rendering this tooth brush useless !&lt;br /&gt;The first  Sonicare I bought lasted 14 years! What a difference in quality.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought an Oral B after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Beware older model units the brush portion does not fit this new sonic are, comes with one new brush</li>
            <li> I wanted an inexpensive electric toothbrush and I found this. It does the job just fine. Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my office.  I have one at home, but wanted one that I could use between meals.  The price certainly was right</li>
            <li> Good price and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thie toothbrush replaces a similar one purchased many years ago.  The battery went bad and it had to be discarded.  This unit uses the same head,so I can use the ones that I have already bought.  .</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my old Sonicare that broke after several years of good service. I got the same one because the old one had served me well and I had some extra replacement brush heads to use. That last statement is fortunate because apparently this brush is sold WITHOUT the brush head. Very, very strange if you ask me. What is a toothbrush without the brush?? The heads do not come cheap. At least the enclosed a $4 off coupon to buy REPLACEMENT heads.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Everyone should be brushing with a sonicare. And this one does just as good of a job as their more expensive models.</li>
            <li> good product fast service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several months now and it works great for me. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love my Philips Sonicare.  I charge it only when I have to and that&#x27;s about once every 3 weeks or so.  Then I leave it plugged in for a day and I&#x27;m good.  I take it in the shower.  Nothing beats that Sonicare clean!  And my dentist has noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item! The price of this electric toothbrush is amazing! I ordered one for myself and one for my mom, and recieved them within a few days! love</li>
            <li> This is just like my old $200 Sonicare but without the adjustable speed. I would highly recommend this as an affordable option to the electric toothbrush. It comes with a nice travel pack too.</li>
            <li> Functions as promised. It works as well as the e-750 at one half the cost. The unit is easy to use but you have to turn it off after use for it to charge.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just careful to wipe down the stem before placing it back in the charger.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever! I lost one of these couple of weeks back and felt as if I didn&#x27;t brush for a long time. I ordered it and it feels good. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I ever bought. Affordable and efficient!</li>
            <li> it was a replacement for one 10 yrs. old that stopped charging. I love it!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, works perfect!!</li>
            <li> very good product as good as the higher priced one</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to the feel of this toothbrush but it feels absolutely great/clean after I used it.</li>
            <li> A replacement Sonicare. Think it&#x27;s a great product and happy with price, delivery, etc.</li>
            <li> I like it. i just wish the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so dang expensive though.     edit  Yellow mold or whatever it is grows inside the parts. It&#x27;s very hard to clean out and it stinks. I still use it but i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s safe :/. I would probably buy a different toothbrush next time.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement because the base of my other one &amp;#34;disappeared&amp;#34; during a road trip.  I shouldn&#x27;t have taken the base, but my old, 5?6? year old brush would no long hold a charge for more than a day.  I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> had one before, then tried another brand.  Glad to come back to this, plus my dentist is happy.l</li>
            <li> Very powerful. Hurts my teeth a little. But cleans very well</li>
            <li> I  bought one 10 years ago and  loved it....time for another one.  The price was great and so far it has worked perfectly well...&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy customer!  If I had to offer up a complaint, it would be the replacement brush heads are on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Been a Sonicare user for years. Best electric toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> Bought a Sonicare at recommendation of dental hygienist,  It does clean teeth well.  However, the casing and the charger get &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; very quickly even though I rinse the toothbrush every time I use it.  In order to keep it clean, you have to dismantle everything and clean once/week.  It&#x27;s way too much work.  I have used disposable electric toothbrushes in the past which seem to clean as well and do not need cleaning except for a rinse.  I will return to those.</li>
            <li> This one was for my husband, and he loves it.  Mine has the old style charger and case - think I&#x27;ll see if I can get him to trade!  We both like the Sonicare, and our dentist is really happy we got them.</li>
            <li> Purchased this when my previous one died. The battery in this one lasted less than two months. Love the product but in needs to function! A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. .....charges fast easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I just received my Sonicare today charged it for 24 hours,then tried it,wow this is one great toothbrush,its awesome,simple to use,I did notice my teeth cleaner,wont go back to Manuel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This works great. This is the second one we have purchased. The first one lasted about 18 years. Always get great comments about our gums and teeth from the dentist.</li>
            <li> not as good as the rotating brush. Also makes a big mess as paste sprays out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> For years my dentist suggested that I buy one of these, but  I resisted figuring a plain toothbrush was good enough.  About 6 or 7  years ago I gave in and bought one -- my teeth are super-sensitive and I found it was a lot more gentle on them than a toothbrush.  I liked it so much that  I bought a second for the bathroom on the first floor, and now I can&#x27;t stand brushing with a regular toothbrush.  The battery on my first finally gave out, and so  I bought this new Sonicare Essence.  I&#x27;ve found them to be considerably  less expensive than the newer models yet in my opinion they do just as good a job.  When they are relatively new, say a year or two old, they will go a week without having to recharge them - handy for not needing to pack the recharger when on vacation.  You can usually get good deals on multi-packs of the heads.  I love it!</li>
            <li> A Sonicare toothbrush gives you a dentist level of cleaning everyday. I think it made my teeth whiter. And I have not changing anything but my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great price! I was looking for a battery charger for my son&#x27;s sonicare (the model escapes me at the moment), but this actually costed a tad bit more than just a battery charger! Works great and now we have a backup toothbrush as well, because his other sonicare fits in the same charger. Very pleased and battery lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> very satisfied with this toothbrush, was starting with gum disease and no more problems. thanks.</li>
            <li> The last Sonicare I used (about six years ago) could never keep a charge and was not a good brush. So I moved on. After trying some manual ones and the Oral-B last year, I saw this at Target for 39.99. So, instead of buying new replacement heads for the Oral-B, I opted to give Sonicare a chance again.&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction was WOW, this is so much better than my old Sonicare ever was. It is not shaky at all but is wonderfully smooth. I love this thing. And I actually paid less for this than the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;It has a two minute timer. I don&#x27;t really need it. In fact, I brushed much longer than the two minutes because I enjoyed it. It had a great feel to it. This is a huge upgrade from my previous Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This thing is great . no more battery&#x27;s. Plug in charge. Batteries are to expensive. I love this model</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was a great price! Great item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for a long time and mine wore out so I thought I&#x27;d be ordering just an update model. However the old one &amp;#34;beeped&amp;#34; at 30 seconds so you knew when to switch and this one does not! I hate that because that&#x27;s what I loved the best about the sonicare.</li>
            <li> I generally like using the Sonicare, but I sometimes use this once a day and my regular, manual toothbrush once or twice.  Manual one seems to &#x27;deep clean&#x27; more (better reach).  Stores nicely in its dock.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Essence E5300 Power Toothbrush features unique dynamic cleaning action that gently and effectively reaches deep between teeth and along the gumline. The two-minute timer helps ensure the recommended brushing time. Get noticeable results and better check-ups in less than a month. Get all the power of Philips Power Toothbrush and get a brighter smile and fresher breath. There&#x27;s a reason that Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are the power toothbrush brand that is recommended by dental professionals more than any other. The Essence toothbrush, HX5610/01, helps remove more plaque than a manual toothbrush, because it uses patented sonic technology that will knock plaque right off enamel and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Sonicare Essence E5300 Power Toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  #1 recommended power toothbrush brand by dental professionals&lt;br /&gt;  Patented sonic technology&lt;br /&gt;  Removes more plaque than a manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;  Helps improve gum health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years until the battery finally died. As I was looking for a new one I read the reviews of Oral B toothbrushes and decided to give it a try to see if it might be even better. I used the Oral B for the past couple of years. It was fine but I noticed that my I was getting a lot of plaque buildup on my teeth and I was having to floss every single day without fail to keep up with it. My teeth also just started to not feel clean even after brushing. I noticed an ad a couple of weeks ago for a Sonicare toothbrush that was on sale and I decided to try Sonicare again. I was so shocked at the difference!! After the first use my teeth felt cleaner than they had in a long time, and the plaque isn&#x27;t a problem like before. It&#x27;s just amazing to me the difference between the two, and that&#x27;s why I wanted to share my story and give a review on this. Hope it helps!</li>
            <li> This is just a replacement for the same model.  I&#x27;ve owned this model for more than 5 years and it finally broke.  The dentist always says my teeth and gums are great.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the sonic care, my teeth have been in great shape and i feel peace of mind about my dental health.  So, I bought another.</li>
            <li> Loved my so much I bought one for each of my kids and my nephews. My son is 11 and his teeth often showed yellow. With this toothbrush I have yet to tell him to go back and brush his teeth again. Works awesome. Love it that I can go on a week long business trip and not have to worry about charging it. I don&#x27;t even carry the charger with me any more. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Its the most affordable of its kind and lasts a reasonable amount of time. HOWEVER, the one big drawback is that between the motor and the replacement head, water leaks in and inside forms a really gross gunk that has to be cleaned out from time to time. It is really unsanitary and disgusting. I am putting up with it until the thing dies and then investing in one of their more expensive models that from my recollection I had no problems of this kind. Sonicare is great though, I feel like my teeth get much much cleaner than with a conventional toothbrush. Its like a facial for your teeth. Sonicare needs to fix this issue though.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for about 8 years before it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore. I had to have one exactly like it! Love the sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Looks like it grows mold inside after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I wondered why 2 years after I bought my Grandma this toothbrush as a gift she was asking for another electric toothbrush.  I told her I just bought her one 2 Christmases ago, did she mean she needed new brush heads?  Nope.  She said the mechanics completely died and it&#x27;s a brick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY!?  Not even 2 full years?  We&#x27;ve had our Oral B for 5 years with no issues so I know which one I&#x27;ll be buying her this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Fantastic...new feature recommended you keep it plugged in at all times. Last one only lasted three years before I had to do that...maybe this one will last six years!</li>
            <li> Great Price, product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and an excellent value for a reliable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare because the battery on my first is not any longer holding a full charge. My teeth feel exceptionally clean after brushing, and my dental checkups are merely teeth cleaning. This is a really food preventative maintenance tool!</li>
            <li> First Sonicare purchase. Works well. Long battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;Great value compared to any other big box store offer.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> There are others but none can come close. This thing makes your mouth feel new. Your teeth will feel as if they have been scrubbed and polished. Great product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.  You don&#x27;t need the fancier models to get a great job done on your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it promises and I have had no mechanical issues with it at all.  If you have periodontal disease, this toothbrush can really help keep your mouth in good shape.</li>
            <li> what a great sonic toothbrush at a great price! Way to go Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare Advance toothbrush for several years and I am &#x27;hooked&#x27;.  When the Advance died on Tuesday of this past week I ordered this from Amazon and was sure glad for the fast shipping.  These make an amazing improvement and dentist appointments have fewer surprises these days!</li>
            <li> My husband seems to like this model. I recently just bought another one to replace one I bought for him 2 years ago.  The price was right as I purchased a brand new one for the same price 2 brush replacements are nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean for as long as they did with my spin brush.  Maybe it&#x27;s because the head is so small you can&#x27;t use as much tooth paste.</li>
            <li> it tickles but does a great job</li>
            <li> Although Sonicare brushes have served us well for years, I discovered after purchase that it does not have the &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; feature to help get the right coverage of each of the 4 tooth surface areas.</li>
            <li> It operated  exactly as described</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good performer.  I have had one for many years and bought this new one for my daughter.  I am very disappointed in the travel pouch.  She is heading off for college and will be using a plastic bag rather than the pouch since it doesn&#x27;t zip.  The zipper is installed so that the teeth don&#x27;t match up.  Can&#x27;t be fixed by even my super handyman Dad.  I emailed amazon about the problem, but didn&#x27;t get any response.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrush for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I replaced my very old one from Costco and it was not even close to the old one, so I bought this one and it is just as good:)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush came in the frustration free packaging.  That packaging was a pleasure, and recycled very easily.  I have been using the Sonicare toothbrushes for about five years, and had gotten used to the beep after every 30 seconds telling me to move to the next quarter of my mouth.  This unit does not have that feature - It brushes for 2 minutes and then turns off.  Now I need to use an external timer to tell me when to advance my brushing.  This is not a major hardship, but it strikes me as being a silly marketing move on Philips&#x27; part.  Otherwise, it is just what I expected, and it does a great job on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for myself just before the holidays.....and then someone bought me an Oral B that was twice as much for a gift. Feeling that I must follow the money...I put this one in reserve and switched to the Oral B. Now.....I am switching back. I just like the performance of this one far better. The vibration speed seems to be higher and it does a better job. Small pet peeve on both of them why such a bright d*mn light on the handle to indicate the charge level? I have to close my bathroom door to not see the blinking LED all night. I really don&#x27;t need 24/7 streaming intel on the status of my toothbrush charge. Otherwise...quite high marks.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Just wish it was a little quieter. Really does a great job cleaning your teeth. I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this item a long time ago</li>
            <li> I have experience with this product with a previous purchase and I&#x27;m still using it satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;The new purchase was meant as a gift to another person and I&#x27;m sure she will enjoy using it as I have been.</li>
            <li> I needed an upgrade and something to ensure I would not get a lecture from my dentist.  This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this device and I found it very useful for my teeth. It whitens (and brightens) my teeth in a couple of days of usage. The battery lasts long. The only problem I have is that it stops frequently right before I finish brushing; the timer of this electronic toothbrush needs improvement. This is a great product to buy at a cheap price compared to commercial battery-type brushes in the market.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush functions perfectly and I like the extended reach of the Essence 5000 series (didn&#x27;t think I would)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT does not include the 30 second intermediate timer function to tell you when to start brushing the next surface. 2 minute timer function is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple matter of a few lines of code in the microcontroller. Cheap bastards.</li>
            <li> the best toothbrush made! makes it effortless to feel clean every day! and my dentist likes it too!</li>
            <li> This is my third one of these in 10 years. I fried out my first when I plugged it into a European socket. I replaced it immediately and it&#x27;s lasted 8 years. It still works, but does not hold a charge for more than a couple days anymore. So I bought another one. Once you use this toothbrush, you won&#x27;t ever go back to a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush again. Get this: before I got the Sonicare, my dentist warned me not to brush so hard, as it was hastening the recession of my gums. After switching to the Sonicare, my gums are actually repairing themselves. I use the basic Sonicare: I don&#x27;t need the bells and whistles of the higher priced models. Get one: you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have had a Philips Sonicare for many years.  My second one has lasted over 5 years and the batteries were now not holding a charge for long.  I couldn&#x27;t afford a top model and found this one with no bells and whistles and decided to try it.  I am pleased with it.  It works just as well as my Elite model did.  I would recommend it.  Hope it lasts as long as my previous 2 models.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the handle is a bit thicker than my last models but I have adjusted to it.</li>
            <li> This brush works nicely, and is easy to charge and use, but the brush head is already falling apart, separating into two pieces.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold the charge as well as the old one did - otherwise it&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s all I have to say</li>
            <li> This was a replacement, as my previous purchase was a couple of years old and the battery finally gave out.  Other than that, I liked the toothbrush, so I ordered the same model.  It works quite well and is a good value.  The zippered travel case is also an improvement over the hard carrying case that came with my previous brush.</li>
            <li> i had one of these before and it dies after 12 years.  i couldn&#x27;t get this one fast enough. i like the new charger and the bit of color.  hope this one last 10+ years.  best toothbrush in the world</li>
            <li> i got it to replace my 5 year old soniccare. I just needed the basic model. It works well and I like it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had tears streaming down my cheeks. It tickles so much it&#x27;s almost unbearable! After the first use it was fine though. The 2 minute timer is great and the brush stays charged for a full week of brushing.</li>
            <li> Works well, however, I had a previous model that would buzz to alert you of when to switch to the next section of the mouth. This model does not do this, it does not stop on its own when the 2min are up either. Some people might think this is a plus, but in light of the fact that most people do not brush for long enough, keeping on brushing until the signal buzzes and toothbrush shuts down was a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I love the battery life on this device. First time you use it you feel the difference very nice.</li>
            <li> I initially gave this Sonicare toothbrush 3 stars because my experience with it was rather ticklish, plus I found that \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; with it is kind of a hassle.  With a typical non-motorized toothbrush I&#x27;m fond of wandering about when I brush.  That&#x27;s not recommended with this gizmo, since I&#x27;ve found it impossible to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; without foam dribbling down my chin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I found that the ticklish sensation has gone away -- this was more attributable to the \\&quot;learning phase\\&quot; than anything else.  Once the brush reached full speed it stopped feeling annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the Sonicare brush has kept tea stains down significantly -- which is why I purchased it -- so I&#x27;m quite happy about that.  I still don&#x27;t love the experience, but I do like it, especially the results!  4 stars!</li>
            <li> I like this design. The older model that I had for years was open to water and was getting black gook inside the machine. This one appear sealed. Nice grip. Leaves me with good test in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This was my second Sonicare.  The first one lasted a couple of years.  Bought the first one because my dentist recommended it and had a brochure on it.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever. Why didn&#x27;t I buy it many years ago?</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it!! Got a great price for the toothbrush and the accessories. The product met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love it.  This is my second Sonicare.  I have used them for years.  I only bought the second one because I blew my charger when I went to S. Africa.  So I thought I buy a new one.  I would recommend this to anyone who has teeth.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is wonderful.  Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.  This is a replacement for another one I had for years - and which finally wore out.  The only glitch:  when you first buy it, the vibrator motor is turned way down for the first 14 uses (to get newbies&#x27; gums acclimated to it, I discovered).  I thought there was some defect -- called their 800#...and a nice guy told me how to bypass that 14-day slow-vibration situation.  (It is in the manual - small type somewhere ion pg 14 or something - but who reads all that stuff when it&#x27;s just a toothbrush).  They should point this out on page 2 perhaps.</li>
            <li> Been a Sonicare user for better than a decade.  My third handle (eventually the batteries die).  This is no frills, basic, and cheap for Sonicare.  In our opinion, fancier models are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> You can see by the number of reviews for this toothbrush, that this is good stuff. I gave this five star reviews because I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare toothbrush for years, more than 8 years I think. The only thing you really need to do is replace the toothbrush head. It does the trick, obviously though it doesn&#x27;t replace the need for the dentist. But it&#x27;s the most durable, least irritating electric toothbrush out there. This will leave your teeth feeling very clean and taken care of.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicares.  They make your teeth feel so clean and are very durable.  You can really notice the difference between this and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My previous one had two speeds, this one has one, but I still like it and this is a good price</li>
            <li> So far I have been very satisfied with this toothbrush.  Those not accustomed to electric brushes might be surprised by the intensity of the vibration, however most people adapt quickly.</li>
            <li> Not the fanciest or most expensive, but does the job well.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush now like I never have! I have never been a great oral hygienist, but the auto time and the head movement are great for keeping me honest. My mouth feels great after brushing. I love it so much I bought two more for my parents...</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t take alot of space, charges up fast.  I am not using the carry case so far but I might some day</li>
            <li> Sonicare I previously owned pulsed every 30 sec. - this one does not.  Very, very disappointed.  Thought this Sonicare would pulse the same.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of adjusting, but the toothbrush works wonders and makes it really easy for you to brush properly. Came packaged wonderfully and I won&#x27;t go back to manual brushing again.</li>
            <li> I have used the sonic care tooth brushes for at least 5 years and my gums are in much better condition than before. They have improved the charger from earlier. I am traveling now without the charger and it is working great after a week.</li>
            <li> This replaced my original Sonicare the died after 15 years of use.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare works well, the only problem was that it is supposed to give a 30 second quick pause and it doesn&#x27;t. Outside of this, it works well.</li>
            <li> This model does a great job with brushing inthehard to reach areas.  The brush improvement and other added features are a nice step up from the basic Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> does a fantastic job.  a great value compared to more expensive models.  easy to use.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this toothbrush and think it does a great job of cleaning my teeth, I will, however, echo the cons of some other reviewers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I wish it had a quad-pacing timer to tell me when to change areas every 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;-Water, etc., gets into the section between the handle and the brush head and starts to smell. I unscrew the brush head from the handle and wipe it down after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I would pay more for a brush that keeps everything the same but eliminates those two problems.</li>
            <li> Great selller.....Arrived on time and was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This Philips Sonicare is perfect for my needs.  I have dental implants and I needed an electric toothbrush that would be both gentle and effective and this model if just right for me.</li>
            <li> I like this generation of Sonic better. My newer Sonicare started to buzz and not clean well. i think the old design is more robust.</li>
            <li> It works better than expected.</li>
            <li> I had the original version and wanted to replace it with a similar one. This is a high quality toothbrush that is easy to clean with. My dentist is very pleased with the results from the earlier version and this will continue the great chekups.</li>
            <li> It took some adjustment (after using only a regular toothbrush).  But my teeth do indeed appear to be cleaner and happier.</li>
            <li> My dentist has recommended I get a electric toothbrush forever because I was brushing too hard...wish I would have listened a long time ago!! After every brush I feel like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth cleaned. Loved it so much ordered 4 more for everyone else in my family!!</li>
