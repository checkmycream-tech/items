            <li>This is the best finish for curly hair.  </li>

            <li>Love this finishing spray.</li>
            <li>It is still my favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose somewhat, but ABBA&#x27;s Botanical Finish not only smelled great (I was told by many people how great my hair smelled), but it doesn&#x27;t hold nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>everything!&lt;br /&gt;A loyal customer now!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a decade and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>product is the only thing I have been able to get 2 days of good hair before having to wash again.  </li>
            <li>It was sticky and felt exactly like hairspray!</li>
            <li>I never use it after freshly washing and styling.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and followed up my Pure Prep (which I love) with Pure Finish.</li>
            <li>the curls are consistent again.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Pure Curl Finsh... not Curl Finsh.</li>
            <li>Found it to be a fine substuite for regular hair spray.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps my curls in tact and prevents frizz.</li>
            <li>This was very helpful for holding my curls in place.  </li>
            <li>This product has too much water in it.  </li>
            <li>you so much for</li>
            <li>Product is not what ordered and now cant return it... very disapointed.</li>
            <li>Which I think is great, a little goes a long way and in my hair that says a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.</li>
            <li>I previously ordered  Pure Finish Spray and love it.  </li>
            <li>I apply the Nourishing, then spritz with this Finish Spray, making sure I spray it on evenly but not too heavily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most mousse products.</li>
            <li>I have long super curly hair and wear it in a clip or pony a lot, and after having them in my hair all day it gets that crease</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it every day and my hairdresser is unable to get this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for having it available for me on line.</li>
            <li>And if you only use Abba products, I&#x27;d very much so consider this seller!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>This was called Instant Recall when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product to build lasting body</li>
            <li>Not sure if Pure Curl Finish Spray replaces Pure Finish Spray</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s old name) meaning it bounces back curls after they have lost shape.  </li>
            <li>I have long, naturally curly hair that is prone to dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li>It made it a whole sticky, frizzy mess.</li>

            <li> It made it a whole sticky, frizzy mess.</li>

            <li> A big waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I can spray and let it dry to be \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot; or blow it dry with a round brush for a softer look.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how bad this hairspray smells! And the smell lingers all day. I&#x27;ve only used the hairspray twice, and both times I didnt think it had any hold. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, I see people love it, but I hated it! It was sticky and felt exactly like hairspray! I have naturally curly hair and followed up my Pure Prep (which I love) with Pure Finish. It made it a whole sticky, frizzy mess. I wish I could love it, I just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a decade and it is fantastic.  I only use it on the 2nd day of my hair.  I never use it after freshly washing and styling.  I think that&#x27;s where some of the negative reviewers did it wrong.  It is instant recall (it&#x27;s old name) meaning it bounces back curls after they have lost shape.  I have long super curly hair and wear it in a clip or pony a lot, and after having them in my hair all day it gets that crease (you know what I mean) add a few spritz of this stuff then scrunch and the curls are consistent again.  To bounce back the ends of your curls, I suggest just hitting the ends and scrunching...you can definitely over do it with this stuff.  Which I think is great, a little goes a long way and in my hair that says a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only thing I have been able to get 2 days of good hair before having to wash again.  If you have curls and have never tried this, you must.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly hair that is prone to dryness and frizz. I use this with the Abba Nourishing Leave In Conditioner. After I wash my hair and it is still wet I apply the Nourishing, then spritz with this Finish Spray, making sure I spray it on evenly but not too heavily. It really keeps my curls in tact and prevents frizz. I have been using these two products for many years and get compliments on my hair all the time AND people are always asking me what products I use. It has a nice subtle fragrance. This was called Instant Recall when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it works well after I use a gel to my permed hair.  It helps hold the curl and holds down hair fizziness..</li>
            <li> It made my hair kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> This was very helpful for holding my curls in place.  I use it every day after I fix my hair.  Found it to be a fine substuite for regular hair spray.  The aroma is pleasent.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Thankfully I was able to find it online. Your service was timely and the hairspray arrived safe and sound!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it every day and my hairdresser is unable to get this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for having it available for me on line.</li>
            <li> This spray comes out in large sprays, to thick for hair spray. If I sprayed my hair all over wiht it, I would have a wet sticky mess. I tried using it 2 times before getting rid of of it. A big waste of my money.</li>

            <li> Fabulous product - have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> this is what i have used forever in my hair and cant find it in the beauty stores anymore--THANKYOU! you are a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> This product has too much water in it.  It does not work for me.  I previously ordered  Pure Finish Spray and love it.  Not sure if Pure Curl Finish Spray replaces Pure Finish Spray but the product is worthless as a hair spray.</li>
            <li> This is the best finish for curly hair.  It is also a revival for curls that have gone frizzy.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love this finishing spray. It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most mousse products. I can spray and let it dry to be \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot; or blow it dry with a round brush for a softer look.  Holds well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 plus yrs. It is still my favorite hair spray. I can not find any other hair spray that works as goood as Abba! Sometimes I can&#x27;t find it locally, so I turn to Amazon and there sellers.&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate this seller having this product! And I do appreciate the customer service! I look forward to ordering from this seller again! And if you only use Abba products, I&#x27;d very much so consider this seller!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for everything!&lt;br /&gt;A loyal customer now!</li>
            <li> Product is not what ordered and now cant return it... very disapointed. I ordered Pure Curl Finsh... not Curl Finsh. not the same product.</li>
            <li> This is the go to spray for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Although I like the product, in no way does it compare to ABBA&#x27;s Botanical Finish.  It serves the purpose somewhat, but ABBA&#x27;s Botanical Finish not only smelled great (I was told by many people how great my hair smelled), but it doesn&#x27;t hold nearly as well.  I have no idea why they stopped making it.  If you are ever in contact with the company, please tell them I am not the only one who feels this way.  Why, why did they stop making it?????&lt;br /&gt;Caryle Cirello</li>
