            <li>Fit great in my Philips Sonicare HX6711.</li>
            <li>Amazing price</li>
            <li>The price is amazing and the toothbrush heads work every bit as well as the name brand ones.</li>
            <li>Great fit too.</li>
            <li>Great, cheap replacement for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as nice as the name brand ones, but do the job.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the name brand but a good cheap alternative</li>
            <li>And the color rings are also nice accessories.</li>
            <li>Good price for quality brush head replacements, better price than BJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These are good for the price for sure, although I have noticed that they drop a bristle here and there in your mouth when brushing that the sonicare brand doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The Sonimart replacements are as good or better than the OEM brushes.</li>
            <li>Also, they have a wear indicator on the brush to tell you when you need to replace, so that&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I cannot tell a difference between the manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads and these heads.</li>
            <li>These are ok but not as good as the Sonicare ones.</li>
            <li>As good or better than Philips.....</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do much more than agree with most everyone who says this is a good company and a good product.</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the brand name but much more affordable</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference from the officially branded brush heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are absolutely THE best toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li>An excellent product that I highly recommend!</li>

            <li>I love these brush heads and am just about to order some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the quality of these brush heads.</li>
            <li>These seem better than the originals.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>There should be more alternatives</li>
            <li>Talk about price gouging, and they weren&#x27;t all that much better even here on amazon.</li>
            <li>These Sonimart brush heads are great and a whole lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Honestly better than the name brand.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an Oral B rechargeable that had seen better days and was in need of replacement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order them again when I need more.</li>
            <li>I was leery of knock-offs and some sellers seemed sketchy to me, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on these.</li>
            <li>The packages don&#x27;t show you the fitting.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find someone who showed and described what they looked like.</li>
            <li>They fit the slot correctly and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>Certainly better priced.</li>
            <li>Upon examination the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; looked more like fibers.  </li>
            <li>items seems to be OK otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I would also like to add that this company stands beside the product and more than guarantee satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Product duplicates the more expense Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>My replacement brushes came quite promptly after purchase, they were packed well to ensure their safe arrival</li>
            <li>Worked great and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Just like the name brand, but at a fantastic discount!</li>
            <li>Our family has been using Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I like them better than the ones made by Sonicare and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>These are great and are very inexpensive to the name brand.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I ordered these brush heads.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure these would work as well as the originals</li>
            <li>love the price</li>
            <li>I can afford to change brushes much more often now.</li>
            <li>Not quite the same quality as the brand name, but definitely a great alternative!</li>
            <li>Sonimart Premium Standard  Replacement heads are Great!!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better then the sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase, would replace again with this company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brush heads, on the contrary, are fantastic!</li>
            <li>They were ok.</li>
            <li>It is nice and cheap.</li>
            <li>Was even better than what the picture shows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect will definitely purchase again from vendor.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are even better than the name brand brusheads at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more to keep them stocked up for my family.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>My dentist can&#x27;t get over how healthy my gum tissue is (55)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten most of my friends using this toothbrush and loy a L to the brand as well.</li>
            <li>Pleased</li>
            <li>works better than Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>Great service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>Looks and works just as well as the Sonicare brand - great value, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They also come with color coded rings so if you have more than one toothbrush you can tell which is yours.</li>
            <li>Softer heads are probably better for enamel preservation anyway.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought these replacement toothbrush heads for my Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>They do a much better job of cleaning and keep their shape.  </li>
            <li>So, all in all, this is a great knock off but very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The best generic tooth brush heads I have used.</li>
            <li>And I love that it came with color coding bands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, and will definitely reorder when we need more.</li>
            <li>Better than the factory heads</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>so maybe they&#x27;re better than OEM?</li>
            <li>These brush heads are of Excellence Quality and Fit!</li>
            <li>, just need changed more often than a Sonicare branded toothbrush head</li>
            <li>Much better pricing than sonicare.</li>
            <li>I prefer to stiffer and more compact brush head.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with these replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>Im really glad</li>
            <li>The Sonimart Premium Standard  Replacement Toothbrush heads are an excellent  product.  </li>
            <li>When i called to get information from customer service on which of their many models i should consider, they could not have been more helpful on the phone.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I like these better than the one that came on the brush from the factory...</li>
            <li>I will return to buy more in 3 month.</li>
            <li>just tried the product and seems okay</li>
            <li>Seem to work as described at a much better price.</li>
            <li>No issues with them fitting whatsoever.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Best generic replacement heads I have found for Sonicare toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>I am okay with the stiffer bristles.  </li>
            <li>However, I must say I&#x27;m totally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>No reason to pay more for Sonicare brushes</li>
            <li>Love it... will always buy these.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with these non-panasonic brand brushes.</li>
            <li>I love my sonic toothbrush, but have always been upset with the cost of the toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This is the best set of generic brusheads</li>
            <li>but at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Better then the sink add one</li>
            <li>Better than I thought.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>This opens up more room for water to seep in, not a show stopper but have to deduct one star for this.</li>
            <li>I need mine to be firmer to be able to go under my gum line and nail tartar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love my SonicCare Flex+ brush but not the price of the brush heads to replace them.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying how much I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
            <li>purposely delayed writing this review because I wanted to make sure that some time had passed to see how the brush heads are holding up.</li>
            <li>Dare I say, with the way this brush head has been working, I think the quality might even be better than the originals.</li>
            <li>So glad I made the switch</li>
            <li>I am glad they are going to work out since I do like the efficiency of the toothbrush and the cleaning it provides.</li>
            <li>Bristles are softer than the Sonicare ones, but I think they feel better.  </li>
            <li>and I am enjoying using them.</li>
            <li>These are actually better than the brush heads that came with my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I like the shape better than the oem</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to sonicare for providing a quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and packed in very nice retail packaging.</li>
            <li>But now, I am so thrilled to find an affordable way to keep my family in fresh toothbrush heads that I will probably buy these forever!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>These are better than the one that came with the brush originally!  </li>
            <li>Better than the original brushes that came with the product!</li>
            <li>They might even be better than the original ones!</li>
            <li>I think the slightly higher price is fair for the better quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Great value and decent quality-what s not to like?</li>
            <li>These are great high quality replacement heads.</li>
            <li>These replacement toothbrushes are shaped slightly different than my original toothbrush but fit perfectly and are a nice substitute at a much better price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as good as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>These are just as good and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads feel like the original heads from Phillips!</li>
            <li>In fact, however, they fit perfectly, work just as well as the original, and came with clear information about determining when to replace.  </li>
            <li>works great on my new sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I made such a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to find fair pricing as I feel the toothbrush manufactures really gouge us on brush replacements.</li>
            <li>Replacement head fits perfectly and the bristles are just right (somewhere between medium and soft).</li>
            <li>Teeth are squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quick delivery of my Amazon order and more than satisfied with the use of my new&lt;br /&gt;series 5</li>
            <li>love it, better than original</li>
            <li>Awesome purchase &amp; saved money over the other brands :)</li>
            <li>The best buy better then any other brand I have brought will buy again</li>
            <li>If anything it just feels like a better quality build, and a better clean.</li>
            <li>I tried several &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brands, but they weren&#x27;t very good quality.  </li>
            <li>but they fit and work perfectly, at a huge savings!</li>
            <li>These are an amazing replacement and worth risking.</li>
            <li>These are not the supersoft brushes you&#x27;ll get from most cheap aftermarket suppliers</li>
            <li>Better yet, they fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li>Fit and finish is top shelf...</li>
            <li>So far they have been a great replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to have found a cheaper option as it let me &#x27;brush&#x27; off my Sonicare toothbrush and put it back to good use.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that these work great.</li>
            <li>So far they work great.</li>
            <li>They work great so far</li>
            <li>Good deal, thanks.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Philips heads, but at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never going back to the name brand brush heads again - the quality of these are just as good and saving a ton of money is always nice too :)</li>
            <li>These offer an excellent fit and are at least as good of a feel from a quality standpoint as the brand....</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as the real deal.</li>
            <li>Sonimart were to release a softer version, which better compares to the original, I would consider trying those out.</li>
            <li>Sonimart were to release a softer version, which better compares to the original, I would consider trying those out.</li>
            <li>Better value than original brush heads.</li>
            <li>What I can tell, just by looking at them, they are not  as substantial or for lack of a better term &amp;#34;beefy&amp;#34; as the original sonic care heads.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy the replacement brushes because they were so much more affordable compared to the original Sonicare cost.</li>
            <li>Much better value than original.</li>
            <li>These are much better than the cheapo ones I bought on Ebay, worth the upgrade in price!</li>
            <li>We always try to get the most out of each replacement because of the cost of the original Sonic Care brand heads.  </li>
            <li>I almost like this more than the original.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads themselves are of very good quality, especially compared to the set that is available on B@ngg@@d.  </li>
            <li>so my wife and I have a easy way to tell our brushes apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love my Sonicare - I have the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li>And they are so easy to replace on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to get burned.</li>
            <li>Holy cow are these tooth brush heads great!</li>
            <li>Easy set up.  </li>
            <li>sure if it&#x27;s worth buying extras and going through more heads.</li>
            <li>/vibratey when using them, than the Sonicare branded ones I&#x27;ve been using since I bought the brush, but I could easily abide that, given the price</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes arrived very quickly, and the package was undamaged.</li>
            <li>Liked them do much, I ordered more to stick up.</li>

            <li>These replacement brushes are as good as the new brushes.  </li>

            <li>They work fine.</li>

            <li>all seems to be working just fine and would recommend others to buy</li>
            <li>Nuances of toothbrush quality aside (seems fine), these toothbrush heads stayed in the Sonicare, and that was all I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>For this price, I would be fine changing each month.</li>
            <li>These work just fine with my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>but they stay on just fine.</li>

            <li>shipping was quick and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>These are great, fit perfectly, and don&#x27;t vibrate off as other cheaper generic brands do.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit my Flex toothbrush perfectly for half the cost of the name brand ones plus they arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Economical way to use a great toothbrush, I&#x27;ll be re-ordering these when i need new brush heads</li>

            <li>fit fine and do the job (buzzzzz)</li>
            <li>These brush heads fit fine and the bristles are comfortable.</li>
            <li>There was a slight defect in my original order, however, the company had excellent customer service and resolved the issue immediately.  </li>
            <li>A huge savings compared to the Sonicare brand, and these brushes (after 3 weeks) work just as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used one yet, but I checked them out (fit one on my toothbrush)</li>
            <li>Order was filled promptly, and arrived promptly.  </li>
            <li>The head is holding up great and assume we&#x27;d get several months use per replacement.  </li>
            <li>Is the Philips version worth $6 more per replacement brush head?</li>
            <li>And it is fit for HX6530, I bought 4 4-pack</li>
            <li>Sonimart is a fabulous solution.</li>
            <li>I hope they&#x27;re still available when I need to order some again.</li>
            <li>They fit my brush.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the quality of a third-party brush head and how well it would fit.  </li>
            <li>The heads fit my Sonitrol electric toothbrush as specified.  </li>
            <li>These were great especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>They fit well..</li>
            <li>Great generic replacement head for my sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy these again because they work and are a great value.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit quite well on our Diamond Care Sonic Care brush.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable bristle firmness.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I thought for the price, the product would be cheap.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been in the market for cheap replacement brushes for over a year.</li>
            <li>Brushes fit but do not know about color change with use</li>
            <li>These replacements heads work great but was amazes me, and what I was not expecting is that they are lasting longer than the originals.</li>
            <li>Love these, well worth the price and</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I slipped it on the stem of the device and it fit well, no looseness or anything.</li>
            <li>These are of great quality, just slightly smaller than OE sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>so you can add them to your Sonicare toothbrush for a snug(ger) fit on the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>These fit the Sonicare toothbrush that they are intended to fit.</li>
            <li>Fantastic replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Fits Philips Sonicare Easy Clean model HX6511.</li>
            <li>They fit both</li>
            <li>Cheap quality</li>
            <li>They fit they work  </li>
            <li>Fantastic replacement toothbrush heads</li>
            <li>Fit my toothbrush works just as well as the sonicare one.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend they feel great and get the job done.</li>
            <li>It works but it&#x27;s a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>These fit just like the originals.</li>
            <li>They work great and we would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as compared to a genuine sonicare head.</li>
            <li>mini cheap, plastic bristled hairbrushes, but for teeth.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and they fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The brushes fit the Sonicare power head correctly.</li>
            <li>They fit quite well but hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>They fit and work as well as the originals.</li>
            <li>Really good quality so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was told not to buy these because if they aren&#x27;t sonicare heads, they are going to buzz loudly and not be good quality.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Used these for a couple of days, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted Sonimart to be good as I&#x27;m not crazy about paying triple the price for these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>The Sonimart toothbrushes are far superior to the Sonicare ones.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly on my Sonicare which I bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Dentist says they must be doing as good a job as the old Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>Appear to be good so far.</li>
            <li>Assuming that changes I&#x27;ll update this review, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Original Manufacturers Item Replacement - works just as well as the original for half the price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced that with the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had actually bought two sets:</li>
            <li>Great value for an OEM quality replacement at only a portion of the original manufactures product.</li>
            <li>Great generic replacement for the original.</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are the same quality as the name brand and fit my older model perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Much appreciated!!!</li>
            <li>Brush bristles are stiffer than the original units, but are comfortable.</li>
            <li>Having heard good things about this one, however, I decided to give it a try - and now love it, hands down, better.  </li>
            <li>The generic sonicare heads are fully as good as the original OEM (Original equip manufacturer)!</li>
            <li>The brush bristles are comfortable and leave your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t fall out, they fit the toothbrush well, and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>received quickly, they fit, and seem to be just fine.</li>
            <li>It also seems to use high quality materials, as the brush heads feel nice and there is a metal ring where the brush head contacts the handle.</li>
            <li>A bit softer bristles than the original Phillips products but</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and works as well if not better than original products.  </li>
            <li>Started using one of these about a week ago and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>To me, they brush as well as my original brushheads.  </li>
            <li>Works just like the original at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>For now though, we will stick to the original brush heads -</li>
            <li>/&gt;EDIT: Forgot to mention that Sonimart sent me an email to encourage me to write a review.at with the original brush</li>
            <li>For now though, we will stick to the original brush heads -</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far</li>
            <li>Worth their price from Amazon!</li>
            <li>If Phillips thinks they have a captive audience, they had better think again, because these generic brush heads are great.</li>
            <li>These replacement toothbrush heads work just as well as the original one.  </li>
            <li>for a product that competes with an original manufacturer in a monopolising position.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks and it feels just like the original brush.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the original brush head that came with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Works as we&#x27;ll as the original at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>Better than the real Sonicare brush heads!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and toothbrushes seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are well made and function just like the original.</li>
            <li>No difference with the original Sonicare, works well with my Philips Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>The original Sonicare brushes are stiffer.</li>
            <li>Work as well as the original.</li>
            <li>better/ softer  than the original</li>
            <li>wrks as well as the original at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>They contacted me after the original review and sent me a replacement even though I hadn&#x27;t asked for a refund.</li>
            <li>They are identical to the original equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the original brushes that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>however they are a bit softer then the original head.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more and more!</li>
            <li>original review is listed below.</li>
            <li>Just like the original.</li>
            <li>The quality appears comparable to manufacturers product at a significant discount.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing the original anymore.</li>
            <li>Well for the price there is not lost, however, if I can afford the original ones, I will get them.</li>
            <li>I started using the Sonimart brush to replace the original Philips Series 2 brush about 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked the sensitive brush heads to have worked out because the price is great, but I will be going back to the brand name brush heads for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>I am glad that I tried them and very well packaged as well!  </li>
            <li>The original one from philips is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>fits just like the original Sonicare brush head.  </li>
            <li>Works well, compares to the original Philips heads.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine and good quality for the low price.</li>
            <li>These are very nice and affordable replacement heads for the Sonicare toothbrush system and seem to be just as good as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the one I&#x27;ve used so far - my only regret (and it&#x27;s probably my fault)</li>
            <li>I waited until I have used these for at least a month to tell you that they fit my model perfectly, and work well.</li>
            <li>its like when you are trying to clean a stain out of the carpet</li>
            <li>Works well with my sonicare platinum diamond clean toothbrush</li>
            <li>I hope Sonimart copies the Diamond Clean heads.</li>
            <li>Heads perfectly fit my Bright White Sonic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot tell the difference beyween the SonimRt brushes and OEM Philips brushes, which I have used daily for more than five years.</li>
            <li>Was concerned they might not work as well or be as nice as the expensive sonicare brushes, but we gave them a try and are very happy we did.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement heads at a great price, did not notice any difference between these and the expensive manufacture replacement heads.</li>
            <li>My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t get as clean as with the brand name.  </li>
            <li>However, this doesn&#x27;t seem to affect how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad when these showed up and after using them for a few weeks they are doing great.  </li>
            <li>The head is slightly bigger, and the brush is soft and performs great!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and seems as good as the ones that cost twice as much</li>
            <li>Well, I stumbled upon these when going to make my purchase and with so many positive reviews I decided to try once more, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose since they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>No problems so far, will probably order again in a year or two when I need more!</li>
            <li>They hold fast and are very secure.</li>
            <li>I received the right toothbrush refill very quickly.</li>
            <li>Kudos to Sonimart for getting it right!</li>
            <li>These replacements fit on my sonicare 2 plaque control just fine and seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>They work fine &amp; the price is right.</li>
            <li>Pretty good not too soft</li>
            <li>The contouring is great and they fit perfectly on the Sonicare toothbrush base.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed that Sonimart went the extra mile and actually offered me the opportunity to test theirs and Philips&#x27; softer brush heads free of charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We ended up returning the brush heads to Amazon, who gave us a full refund,</li>
            <li>/&gt;We ended up returning the brush heads to Amazon, who gave us a full refund,</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the much more expensive heads and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Just as good as standard brushes for any electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They were a good price but not the same brush head as on my Platinum set.</li>
            <li>It is a good replacement, but way cheaper than the actual Philips sonimart</li>
            <li>Overall good value.</li>
            <li>, no problems with extra noise and the bristle firmness is good.</li>
            <li>They come nicely packaged with the rubber rings and clear plastic brush covers just like the originals come with.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the full priced version.</li>
            <li>I will never pay full price again when I can buy this brand for my sonicare.</li>
            <li>i never contacted them but they sent me 2 four packs of soft bristle brush heads on there own.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought these and hope they are available in the future when I need more.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has a secure lock ring so that it won&#x27;t fall off easily.</li>
            <li>while there&#x27;s an obvious difference compared to the original sonicare (the cap from sonicare doesn&#x27;t fit these heads, but each brush comes with its own cap anyways), there&#x27;s no reduction in quality.</li>
            <li>It works just like the original, and so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>Fit my Sonic just right.</li>
            <li>They fit just right, bristles seem... like bristles.</li>
            <li>These fantastic little brush heads are a great product for the price that you pay.</li>
            <li>They work great at a fraction of the price of some other sellers.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;wear indicator&amp;#34;, but other than that they are great.  </li>
            <li>purchased these after all the many great reviews, thinking they would be more or less the same as the original Sonicare brushheads.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t falling apart and my teeth feel fresh and clean after every use.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was easy to open AND reclose for storage.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly softer than the OEM brush, but plenty of cleaning power... more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Even so, for the price of these I can afford to learn that lesson and still come out ahead fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>These replacement brushes seem to work and feel better particularly along the gum line than the originals.</li>
            <li>Once these wear out, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back for more.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Just checked on Amazon really quick and found this option</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>

            <li>they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>A replacement product was provided quickly.</li>
            <li>These are super.  </li>
            <li>After about a week of using these, however, the head has softened a bit and it&#x27;s become more natural-feeling to me (meaning - more similar to the Phillips brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t fall off, and there hasn&#x27;t been extraordinary wear that you might expect for an inexpensive product.  </li>
            <li>Have not used any of these replacements yet because the toothbrush was recently bought, but the price was right and they fit exactly like the factory heads, as well as the good price.</li>
            <li>The original ones, will last more than 6 months easily.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with them and hoping they last awhile.</li>
            <li>I am overall a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them yet as I am still using my last original sonic care head, so I can&#x27;t give an honest review.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price &amp; fast shipping for a quality product!</li>
            <li>No complaints here fit my toothbrush exactly and works well.</li>
            <li>These are an exact fit for the sonicare I have.</li>
            <li>Not too terribly impressed - main thing that sticks out is that the brush is not as firm as Sonicare brushes....</li>
            <li>The brushes work great and are less money than the name brand brushes.</li>
            <li>Great product for half the price.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived well packaged, slightly different from he Philips product, but pretty good nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I actually like them better than the Sonicare ones!</li>
            <li>They are just the same as name brand but even better because its way cheaper!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is!</li>
            <li>They are working exactly the way that the original heads did.  </li>
            <li>On the first use I was gagging on bristles that had come out!  </li>
            <li>Finally there are brush heads that fit my Sonicare that I can afford!!</li>
            <li>Same quality for a much better price!</li>
            <li>Be aware these are not Diamond Clean</li>
            <li>This turns out to be a great product, if not better than original brand</li>
            <li>As said before, the bristles are a bit stiffer that the real oem replacement heads, but that is fine by me.</li>
            <li>they fit great, can hardly tell the difference with the sonicare brand</li>
            <li>As good as the original, but at half the price.</li>
            <li>It is just not as positive a click as the original.</li>
            <li>The one gripe I have is that it doesn&#x27;t fit as snugly as the Philips version, but that doesn&#x27;t cause any real issues for me.</li>
            <li>Fabulous replacement and much cheaper than the name-brand replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Fit my sonic care toothbrush correctly, and had good firm bristles.</li>
            <li>These are cheaper and fit the Phillip&#x27;s sonicare toothbrushes very well.</li>
            <li>These replacement toothbrushes fit my Sonicare very well and feel like the originals.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, would recommend.</li>
            <li>The color bands are a nice touch in situations with multiple toothbrushes to differentiate whose is whose.  </li>
            <li>And the price for brush heads on online makes the purchase well worth it compared to anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Grea, economical substitue.</li>
            <li>So far I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re worth it</li>
            <li>These are as good or better than the much more expensive OEM brushes.</li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased with the value of this product so far.</li>
            <li>The different color rubber gasket set is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love our Sonicare toothrbrushes, but she always thought that the heads were too soft.</li>
            <li>(Rarely) It&#x27;s all because of Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try these brush heads since it&#x27;s rare to get an Off Brand that works as well as the Name Brand.</li>
            <li>We each have our own toothbrush head (using the different color rings that come with the package).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to know they care enough about their product to follow up like they did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These do save a bit of money, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li>Pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>These heads are narrower than I expected but they are good quality.</li>
            <li>I do not know why anyone would buy them name-brand kind for double the price.</li>
            <li>These fit my sonic flex care toothbrush nicely and work just as good as the expensive name brand replacement</li>
            <li>But, totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are offered at an economical price but the quality remains.</li>
            <li>Worth the saved money</li>
            <li>But then I was able to try out the sensitive Sonimart brush heads</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference, so that is good enough for me!</li>
            <li>but if you like them firmer this is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth getting if you don&#x27;t want or need diamond head quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice to support local.</li>
            <li>They fit the base perfectly, even better than the original head.  </li>
            <li>We ordered based on other user&#x27;s reviews and are most pleased.</li>
            <li>and they are close enough to the original Phillips that it makes it totally a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 and have clean, healthy gums and teeth in good condition -- considering a lifetime of poor dental care before the year 2000 wake up call.</li>
            <li>I have the Sonicare Healthy White brush and my husband has the Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews ARE TRUE.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than the original brush heads.</li>
            <li>They performed as well as the original Sonicare replacements at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>It is very close to original manufacturer quality.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are stiffer than the ones that come with the original, but not so much as o be a discomfort.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original, Philips brush heads, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>as fast as the original one.</li>
            <li>Fits right, can&#x27;t tell any difference from the name brand.</li>
            <li>Appears to be the right item.  </li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>and they were the right size and the right price ($30</li>
            <li>Sonimart was very quick to respond to my separated brush heads and sent out a new set.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat leery of purchasing these replacement heads for my Philips sonacare toothbrush because they were priced so much lower than the Diamond Clean heads.</li>
            <li>The brush heads clean very well.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are exactly what I was looking for and got much better than the old replacement ones I got.</li>
            <li>These are the best toothbrush heads because they are strong enough to remove placque where other brands are too soft to do this.</li>
            <li>The original ones cost so much more and do exactly the same job.</li>
            <li>While the Philips Sonicare Sensitive is a bit too soft for my taste, the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive is actually perfect!</li>
            <li>The cheap ones get soft really quick and do not hold up well.</li>
            <li>These certainly do feel and clean like the first gen Philips sonic heads.</li>
            <li>The bristles are all still straight and true so it is wearing well.  </li>
            <li>They also vibrate more violently because they arent a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>They fit and just a good as the more expensive Sonicare brand.  </li>
            <li>Not bad feels like the real thing</li>
            <li>So I am able to sort of manually brush the backs of my front teeth a little better.</li>
            <li>they did was to send me two new sets of brush heads - free of charge.</li>
            <li>Great product, just like more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Seem to be just as good as the brand-name Sonicare heads but substantially less in price.</li>
            <li>but then they became ultra soft very quickly.</li>
            <li>Good to know that this company takes its customers feedback to heart!my model of toothbrush, as well as a package of Sonicare branded extra soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very good - neither to stiff or soft.  </li>
            <li>They also seem to work as well as the real product, if not a little better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping the fact that I&#x27;ve used DiamondClean heads is enough information for anyone interested in getting great brush heads and an incredibly low price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sifted through the knock offs - the ones that are so soft they basically do nothing, the ones that fall apart right in your mouth, the ones that don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li>I do not think they will last more than 3 months, which it is the right time to replace them.</li>
            <li>Shipping from Amazon is very fast.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard to use soft brushes, so maybe this is fine.  </li>
            <li>Sonimart sensitive is a fine substitute for the namebrand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted to have a less expensive alternative that works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good little toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>If you like hard bristles, this would be great.</li>
            <li>Just bought a new sonicare and this replacement head work as well as the one that came with the toothbrush,  my teeth feel clean as if I had just had them cleaned at the dentist,  </li>
            <li>The bristles are a little stiffer than the original head that came with the unit, but fit my easyclean model of Philips Sonicare fine.</li>
            <li>Having those clear plastic head covers makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>glad to have extra brushes.</li>
            <li>These are the first replacements I&#x27;ve seen that match the originals.  </li>
            <li>I was wary about purchasing an off brand replacement head for my Sonicare but after making the jump I can say I am very happy I did.</li>
            <li>I actually like them better.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had plenty of the cheap imitators and this far surpasses them.</li>
            <li>Why pay $32 (retail) for four when you can get the same quality product for a much better price?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for my sonicare flexcare 900</li>
            <li>basically very well; worth the price.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare Healthy White rechargeable sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>No problem with fit, so far.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>High quality at an affordable price!!</li>
            <li>After reading the Amazon reviews, I was willing to give it a try</li>
            <li>Having finally gotten an electric toothbrush, I have actually enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>I have used my first Sonimart replacement brush head now for over a month.  </li>
            <li>They fit well and work well so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first one.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m really satisfied w/ these generic brushes.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>but these are actually softer and we like them better.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my  Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li>After the first week the bristles were coming out.</li>
            <li>I have Sonicare Healthy White model of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Revised Review:  SoniMart after my first review sent me their product AND sent the SoniCare brush head unit it matches.  </li>
            <li>They do the same as the others with a better price</li>
            <li>The product ordered was delivered as promised and is exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Sonimart!</li>
            <li>Will most definitely be a product that I order again.</li>
            <li>First time to try these.  </li>
            <li>Very well made product!  </li>
            <li>I have a Sonicare Healthy White HX6710.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>After I tested out the regular Sonimart brush heads, I was dissapointed as I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use this brand.  </li>
            <li>Product quality is much better than another generic brush</li>
            <li>and I have tried nearly all available for the Sonic toothbrush..</li>
            <li>I am using my first Sonimart replacement toothbrush head</li>
            <li>These look and feel exactly like the branded brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Sonimart!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>The contour is different from the Series 2 and it seems to work better cleaning out the coffee stain in between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well these replacements fit my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So my first instinct was to go online and read as many reviews as possible.</li>
            <li>Product appears consistent with Sonicare; time will tell.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first brush head</li>
            <li>Way better value than the sonicare heads, and work exactly the same!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Bristles falling out on first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use these replacement brushes, as I feel that they are the same quality as the name brand, and they are certainly a better price.</li>
            <li>very good replacement product, work as well as the original and a little bit harder , which i found nicer&lt;br /&gt;well packed and arrived fast&lt;br</li>
            <li>The old product served me well and the new one seems to be even better.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be near exact quality of the original Philips heads</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make these better is if they were offered in a soft brush head for more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I was an early user, recommended by dentist when I had significant plaque buildup and gum disease.</li>
            <li>I think the original one is too soft too.</li>
            <li>Close enough to the original brand that it doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li>Great value versus Sonicare&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced OEM brush.</li>
            <li>but with each use so far, a bristle comes off and floats around in my mouth as i clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble attaching my replacement and the feel and clean of it</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but with so many good reviews</li>
            <li>These brushes are JUST as good as the more expensive Phillips branded products.  </li>
            <li>The SoniMART brush heads are equivalent to the standard replacement brush heads from Sonicare and they are offered at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads  are just as good as the high priced Phillips heads at half the price.  </li>
            <li>we went back and got a clean bill of health regarding our gums !</li>
            <li>But the brush head does have a little more &amp;#34;wiggle room&amp;#34; than the original head.</li>
            <li>I have always purchased the Philips brand, but saw the positive reviews and gave them a try.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a bit softer than the DiamondClean heads (which I actually find to be a bit too hard), but they&#x27;re more than sufficient to give a really good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered - fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast shipping!</li>
            <li>All-in-all they appear to be an exact replacement for the Sonicare brushes which cost something around twice as much.</li>
            <li>Fast service and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>They may not last as long, but when you get (4) in a pack for the price you&#x27;d normally get 1 or 2 of the name brand ones, I think I&#x27;ll be happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more of the Sonicare replacement heads as long as I can purchase these.</li>
            <li>Good basic replacement for the standard manufacture brush at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>Work great - much higher quality than another generic head I tried previously.</li>
            <li>These are a little different than the stock replacements, but I think they clean just as good.  </li>
            <li>(it pops back together fairly easily) and it gets stuck on the handle and requires some force to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are long and soft and the increased area compared to the stock toothbrush head is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>for about half the price of Sonicare&#x27;s own product.</li>
            <li>Much lower cost per head that the Phillips versions, and the quality level is as good if not better.</li>
            <li>I like the colored rings that come with them to identify certain children&#x27;s brushes.  </li>
            <li>These are packaged smartly and hygenically.  </li>
            <li>At this price I&#x27;ll certainly buy them as my preferred replacement.</li>
            <li>In fact, my gums are pretty sensitive so these are actually even a bit better for me than the heads the brush came with.</li>
            <li>Brush heads seem more like original Sonicare ones, and they also come with the protective clear covers, as Sonicare&#x27;s does (some other generics don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>The whole toothbrush system gives amazing results with us having less cavities than ever.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality, maybe a little more stiff than the OEM brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have used only one and it works fine.</li>
            <li>These totally work fine</li>
            <li>Based on visual inspection, I expect them to work fine.</li>
            <li>These seem to be pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend it and thee replacement brushes highly to anyone who is interested in switching to a battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; version is also just as good, and the Phillips brand of compact head is hard to come by.</li>
            <li>The price  is so much more economical than other brushes too!!</li>
            <li>They seem to last longer and fit the brush very well.  </li>
            <li>The length of the bristles are the same as is the pattern (btw, I don&#x27;t really think the pattern--some tall, some short--really make a huge difference; also, I don&#x27;t change them every 3 months as the &amp;#34;dentists&amp;#34; recommend.</li>
            <li>Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Just like the real thing</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I bought another one for my son, and sent it to him.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Sonicmart Toothbrush heads work just as well as the Sonicare brand I use to buy, but much cheaper ($10.95).</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re super particular or noise sensitive, or if you can afford the price difference, maybe go with the real deal.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Quality of the brush heads was very comparable to the Sonicare brand.</li>
            <li>They fit properly too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They are very affordable and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I can fully understand that, and really appreciate their efforts to ensure customer satisfaction, as you will see below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much so, that my gums would feel &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; after brushing.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference between these and the ones I was paying twice as much for from Phillips.</li>
            <li>Brother really uses them With Sonicare brush</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend twice as much on the brand name.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;May your teeth be cleaned for a reasonable price.&amp;#34; Then he disappeared, as I knew my plaque and unsightly tartar buildup soon would.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for these and they splay out within 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>They are what they seem to be... i.e. replacement brushes that are much cheaper than the brand name versions.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>plus the price is much cheaper than store</li>
            <li>These looks and feel to be of the same quality as the genuine Philips brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for all the online reviews.</li>
            <li>They were very helpful in selecting this company and product.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the Phillips heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always grumbled about the cost of the brush heads and probably haven&#x27;t changed them as much as I should have.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d have to spend so much money replacing toothbrush heads for a family of five.</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; product as advertised</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>That being said, these brushes do the job and at a MUCH lower price than the Sonicare replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>My items were shipped fast and well packed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased non-Sonicare brush heads before and they were very noisy.  </li>
            <li>So reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>And isn&#x27;t that the whole point of having a Sonicare?  </li>
            <li>I have been using the diamond brushes that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell a difference, and will without a doubt be purchasing these from Sonimart from now on.  </li>
            <li>I bought cheap replacement brushes on Amazon a while back</li>
            <li>A quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sonimart</li>
            <li>Had to buy the real Sonicare brushes at Walmart for twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really cant tell the difference just like</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use my Amazon Prime Membership to order what I need rather than driving all over town looking for products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>There were also packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Fits well and works better than expected</li>
            <li>After I tried these brushes, I reordered enough so got free shipping,  😄</li>
            <li>I will use the rest of the heads rather than wasting money, but I&#x27;ll be buying the real deal from now on.</li>
            <li>but at a much reduced price.  </li>
            <li>These prices are much cheaper than the sonicare brand</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Have a years supply ready.</li>
            <li>I think is the number of my toothbrush which nothing really says whether it fits that line or not.</li>
            <li>Now I dont have to spend so much money.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Really quality generics to the OEM replacement heads.</li>
            <li>My whole family has used these for about three weeks now.  </li>
            <li>and they are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>honestly I didn&#x27;t feel much difference compared to the authentic (and expensive) one.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>In really like these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>and it is performing very well.  </li>
            <li>but, I always had a problem with the fit especially if the brush was seated on a ring....</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and came in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes worked very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing a quality brush at a reasonable price, with purchase via Amazonj.</li>
            <li>Just like the sonicare ones but much cheaper price</li>
            <li>Shipping was lightning fast.</li>
            <li>I find that it had worked very well.  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t want to give up quality.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>This is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Just pay the $$ for real thing.</li>
            <li>and they do the job just as well as the Philips heads -- at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>These feel of very comparable quality to the official ones that cost $12 apiece.</li>
            <li>Bristles are nice and firm and well attached.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this over the more expensive Philips own brand replacement heads anytime.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and the brush heads are comparable to the OEM, not quite as on par but close enough that if I end up replacing them more frequently because the cost is lower I will end up with healthier teeth.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I prefer the OEM bristles by a hair, as they start soft, and are probably slightly better for people with sensitive gums, or existing gum damage, but these also end up quite soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm and have stayed nice and straight.</li>
            <li>Looks like the original, works like the original, yet it&#x27;s half the price</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see much difference between these and the authentic Sonicare toothbrush replacement heads, other than tat</li>
            <li>I bought these hoping they were a quality product and was amazed- just as good if not better than the Phillips brushes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Sonimart sent me a new box thinking that my first shipment was defective.</li>
            <li>Read reviews before my purchase and just used my new replacement heads for the first time.  </li>
            <li>But even if they don&#x27;t last as long - it&#x27;s still a better buy!</li>
            <li>THe other ones leave my teeth feeling etra sensitive and these are really nice.  </li>
            <li>gentle enough that I don&#x27;t need the original over priced ones.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a new sonic electric brush and finally retired my very old version that i have had for many years.</li>
            <li>Certainly an improvement over the older models we owned.</li>
            <li>The actually vibrations on the my Diamond Clean are not as intense but the brushes vibrated way farther than the OEM from Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Quality appears to be the same as original equipment.  </li>
            <li>Better than other generics I have tried.</li>
            <li>Seems to be the same as the original.</li>
            <li>Just the same as the original.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product and this supplier fills their orders with new merchandise the same as you would buy in a store.</li>
            <li>Bottom line being my teeth just don&#x27;t get as clean using these generic brushes.  </li>
            <li>I actually think these fit BETTER than my previous Sonicare refills.</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far (after a few weeks).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to judge their durability, but so far I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>First time user of this product and so far, after 1st month, find these brushes comparable to the Sonicare brand in how they wear.  </li>
            <li>Order arrived early and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>At first they were soft</li>
            <li>is much better than other generic toothbrush heads in design and material, which makes it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a generic brand.</li>
            <li>They work well and fit my Sonicare, but they are pretty stiff at first.</li>
            <li>The bristles are slightly softer than the originals which is OK by me.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s a flaw with the particular head that i&#x27;m using</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I bought these for the low price, but these are great!  </li>
            <li>These are decent brushes for the Sonicare brush handle.</li>
            <li>Will be loyal customer in the future.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of the same.</li>
            <li>They are slightly smaller than the name brand heads but fit fine and brush as well as the much more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the replacement brushes are a little larger and they seem to get in between the teeth a lot better</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these without reservation</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These are the high quality aftermarket brush heads you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these without reservation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these Sonimart products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Sonicare quality without the high price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying them to replace your OEM Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I am astounded by this company&#x27;s high level of customer service.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>not much to say, they work fine.</li>
            <li>Seem to be good quality replacements, and fit on the little pegs on the charger (unlike other generic brands I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for quality replacement heads at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>Have only used them a few times, but seem to be good quality so far, and waaaay cheaper than the originals!</li>
            <li>kind of hard to avoid the noise in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little smaller than the heads that come with the Sonicare brushes, but the quality is very similar and they provide a great cleaning experience.</li>
            <li>yet these brushes feel gentle and soft on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonimart product was cheaper, what seems to be equal quality to the originals and not disappointing at all.</li>
            <li>The normal sized brush heads for me, and some of the compact brush heads for my wife.</li>
            <li>After using for a few weeks, I think I like them better.  </li>
            <li>Walking through Costco and had pretty much this same product in my cart</li>
            <li>and they even fit my base better than the genuine product!</li>
            <li>Not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but when removing the toothbrush head, the whole top comes off.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical first but decided to purchase one because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>no complaint</li>
            <li>They work quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly, isn&#x27;t loose and brushes just like the original.</li>
            <li>My husband, who is a dentist, knew right away that these were generic (without seeing the packaging) - but said these would be perfectly OK to use as long as they are replaced regularly (every 3 months).  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I found these brushes and can now pay a lot less for my brush heads!</li>
            <li>and so many replacement heads to place on it, multiple users for one single stand.</li>
            <li>Not quite as stiff as Sonicare replacements, but lovely for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s snaps right back on</li>
            <li>They fit tight and work very well.  </li>
            <li>We have also ordered other Sonimart brush products and found them to be fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that they would be harder than the original</li>
            <li>Bristles are harder than original, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative they do get the job done.</li>
            <li>I bought the tooth brush and replacement tips for it, recommended to my by my new dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see spending 1/3 the price of a new toothbrush every time I want to replace the heads.</li>
            <li>I had picked up my electric toothbrush around Christmas time, I picked one up for my brother and figured I&#x27;d get myself one too, then after a couple of months I noticed the color start to wear away on the bristles indicating the time to get a new head.</li>
            <li>I like supprt new company.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush since the New Year</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell the difference, and my toothbrush feels like new.</li>
            <li>Once I replaced that brush head the new one seems to work just as well as the OEM brush heads, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my new HX6730,and</li>
            <li>and it still looks new.</li>
            <li>Have used for a month now and still like new.</li>
            <li>I have not used the replacement brushes yet, as I received the SonicCare toothbrush for Christmas and the existing head is practically new.</li>
            <li>We will buy them again when we need new brushes.</li>
            <li>The reviews were completely accurate, and they match up to the much more expensive name brand heads.</li>
            <li>I, too, was skeptical given the huge price difference from the official &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; replacement heads, but I am so glad I ordered these.</li>
            <li>The old model used to get mold if I didn&#x27;t constantly clean and dry it, but this one requires practically no care at all, except replacing the heads, which all toothbrushes require.</li>
            <li>Big money saving thanks to the reviewers here and thanks to Sonimart.</li>
            <li>These same heads fit both my SonicCare toothbrush and my wife&#x27;s, which is a different model.  </li>
            <li>Them seem fine as replacements, maybe a little softer than my original brush was, so if you want a firmer bristle order a firm one, but I like there very much.</li>
            <li>Packaged very professionally.</li>
            <li>The day I received them I tested one side by side with a new Phillips brush head of the exact same size and type.  </li>
            <li>I would say that the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive are a little bit softer than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads, but they clean even better than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads in my case.</li>
            <li>Is it exactly the same as the Philips replacement heads?</li>
            <li>The sonimart repacement brushheads seem to be equal to the original manufacturers and at a big discount!&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for competion.</li>
            <li>(which would be a 25% FAIL even if all the other brushes are perfect),</li>
            <li>Way better than the other generic brand I ordered from Amazon before!!</li>
            <li>The size is exactly the same as the factory version.</li>
            <li>These heads operate the exact same way as the manufacturer&#x27;s heads at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Be aware It comes with smaller size brush head.</li>
            <li>I am surprised!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>First replacement brushes that work and that I&#x27;d actually buy again.</li>
            <li>The brush looks like the original item and the lettering (different from the &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34;) is in he same font so a cursory exam will likely fool you.</li>
            <li>and wow that price!</li>
            <li>If I had received these as a gift, not being aware that they are generic...</li>
            <li>Seems to work as well as the product brushes, maybe even lasting longer(still on first brush).</li>
            <li>Glad to support this small, Made in America business.</li>
            <li>they are completely compatible with our Sonicare!</li>
            <li>I had &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; ones last time (MORE expensive) and these Sonimart heads seem to have more ridges, which I like.</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised with these brush heads!</li>
            <li>Only comment is that the brush head is considerably larger then the original ones.</li>
            <li>These will work just fine; however, based on all the other reviews I was hoping that they&#x27;d be about the same as the real deal SoniCare heads.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was clean and undamaged as well, which isn&#x27;t always the case with other generics.</li>
            <li>Also, on top of being very firm, the way the bristles were cut remind me of when I used to cut my Barbie doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>so not sure how long it will last but happy so far.</li>
            <li>The sonicare brushes would start making noises due to the retaining ring breaking free and would not clean well or last more than a month.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time,  was exactly what I expected and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have also only used the first one in the pack, but so far the brush heads appear to be durable and well made.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Sonicare user for over 10 years and the only time I use a regular toothbrush is if I forget to pack my charger while on vacation.</li>
            <li>These brush heads seem to do the job just fine - although I do think that the bristles are a little on the soft side.  </li>
            <li>I would say they&#x27;re close to the original sonicare brushes but break down maybe %50 faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, these are far from a replacement, they are exactly what you are looking for and you likley won&#x27;t go back to the original brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially I thought is was a smashed bug like a large flea.  </li>
            <li>They do, however, fit a little looser on the handle but at this time this is not a problem.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the genuine ones, but the bristles are just a little stiffer than the &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; variety.</li>
            <li>I can usually get 4,  maybe 5 months out of a Sonicare-branded head, but by the end of that time, I&#x27;m really noticing that my teeth are not feeling as clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no better way to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little stiffer than the original perhaps, but not excessively so.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are SLIGHTLY lower quality than the Sonicare ones I used to buy, but the price difference makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li>The bristles might be a little harder than the originals that came with my toothbrush, but you can compensate by brushing more gently.</li>
            <li>packaging that these heads come in can be a little frustrating, but once you access these magical plaque killers you&#x27;ll be glad you bought them.</li>
            <li>A little larger and so far seem more durable.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a clear plastic cap with with each brush.</li>
            <li>There is brown material that looks like piece of ceiling fell onto the toothbrush head before the clear head cover was pushed onto it.  </li>
            <li>Clearly lots of folks like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>reason i put four stars instead of five is because it wasn&#x27;t clear on the page that this isn&#x27;t a sonicare-branded product.  </li>
            <li>After my initial week-long short stint of using the standard Sonicare brush head, I irritated a section of my gums and it took nearly 3 weeks for the irritation to subside while using the Sonicare sensitive brush heads that the company so generously shipped to me free of charge with the Phillips brand equivalent.</li>
            <li>Not as soft bristles</li>
            <li>Only much cheaper.</li>
            <li>And for people that day they are loud...</li>
            <li>The bristles feel comparable, and thus far seem to be holding up as well.</li>
            <li>As frequently as you need to replace the heads, I can&#x27;t see spending $$$$ when I can spend $$.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying the soft bristles to try out.</li>
            <li>I did not realize these were after-market replacement heads, I thought they were the real deal from SoniCare and initially was a bit bummed out</li>
            <li>Using a Sonicare toothbrush every night and a WaterPik machine, over the course of two years, my gum disease completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and  professionally packaged.</li>
            <li>bristles are not to soft and don&#x27;t break off while</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a soft brush though</li>
            <li>These ones are soft and dont hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li>My toothbrush has no number as it is old.</li>
            <li>So far I am living these Sonimart replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>I grabbed these because they were far cheaper than the namebrand brush heads.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>but so far I have used one for a month now</li>
            <li>My wife can take the 2 year old hair tie off</li>
            <li>So close to the name brand, these really surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by their quality.  </li>
            <li>Works on kids&#x27; version and adult.</li>
            <li>they tear up your mouth completely.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely continue to buy these in the future whenever I need replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>So far I cannot tell the difference between this brush and the OEM (Sonicare) brushes.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of experiencing with it, it fits with my teeth and makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>NOT the same quality as real Sonicare brush</li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t like these, is because I don&#x27;t trust them to be gentle enough.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting this, because I had not contacted them directly</li>
            <li>They are called Sonimart Premium Ultra Soft Sensitive Replacement Toothbrush Heads.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft on this model.  </li>
            <li>and they were a waste of money as they did not stay secure in the holder.</li>
            <li>So far has happened to 2 of the 4 brush</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Now, it does still work to brush my teeth, but I am completely missing the functionality of taking the head off the handle to place it in my UV light after brushing.</li>
            <li>Sonimart replacement head seem to be professionally designed.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>standard heads replacement for my proresults, gentle bristles, vibrate well, not noisy.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>I just feel like I need soft bristles for my teeth as the dentist suggests.</li>
            <li>No problems thus far with the brushing, and bristles fade in color with age.  </li>
            <li>These are softer, but not as soft as Sonicare soft brush heads.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace my old Sonicare brush head.  </li>
            <li>but they work just as well as far as I can see.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my gums seem to be on the verge of irritation even with the Sonicare sensitive brush heads--</li>
            <li>: I am upgrading my rating to 3 stars from 2 stars for now because the company sent me a set of their sensitive brush heads and two of the Sonicare brand brush heads to compare.</li>
            <li>I will update again in a month or so after trying out the sensitive brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive gums, but wow, these hurt.</li>
            <li>be prepared They&#x27;re not as soft</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ll never waste money on full-priced sonicare heads again.</li>
            <li>Good alternative to the ungodly expensive Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as expensive replacements.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re as appropriately tight as the ones that came with the original handle.</li>
            <li>They are small enough to reach the back of my mouth and large enough to get a nice surface area.  </li>
            <li>Slightly stiffer than the super soft Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, these are at least as nice as the name brand replacements, which are FAR more expensive.</li>
            <li>If you read the SoniCare labels for their brush heads they make various claims as to how much more plaque is removed than via ordinary brushing.  </li>
            <li>is the same, in my opinion to the main vendor brand.  </li>
            <li>They are a little smaller and overall seem ok so far.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend and we will be buying these again in the future.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using these and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>These seem to be high quality replacements very similar to the official proresults brushes.  </li>
            <li>High quality + low price&#x3D;high value.</li>
            <li>I am now using that same first new brush head from Sonimart, along with the other new one from Phillips and switching off every day.  </li>
            <li>The bottom of the new brushes even have the same mold markings and metal flange as the old ones.</li>
            <li>It was a worthy investment and I will be sticking with the brand for a long, long time to come.</li>
            <li>Great product, most generic Sonicare heads are terrible quality...</li>
            <li>/&gt;These arrived in usual Amazon time, and fit on my HealthyWhite Sonicare with no problems.</li>
            <li>Works as well and lasts as long as Philips brand, at much lower price.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and as long as this company keeps the price reasonable, I will continue to use their product.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as expected.  </li>
            <li>had actually bought two sets: The normal sized brush heads for me, and some of the compact brush heads for my wife.</li>
            <li>They seem to be about the same structural quality as the original brush heads, except being far too firm for my liking.</li>
            <li>They seem to be about the same structural quality as the original brush heads, except being far too firm for my liking.</li>
            <li>I especially like this new Sonicare toothbrush model.</li>
            <li>I will buy only these from now on when I need new ones.</li>
            <li>Bad in that they don&#x27;t feel like they cover as much area per stroke, but good in that they feel like they&#x27;ll stay firmer longer.</li>
            <li>I will be more likely to replace the head more often since these are less expensive.</li>
            <li>They are no different than the name brand as far as I can tell, so far.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they won&#x27;t last as long as the much higher priced ones -</li>
            <li>To me they feel exactly the same and have lasted just as long.</li>
            <li>Not excellent but good enough!</li>
            <li>That in itself is a major plus.  </li>
            <li>I was somewhat weary of buying a different type of brush head for my Sonicare Toothbrush, but must say I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Too hard - thought that I was getting soft bristles like my original.</li>
            <li>, while my review of the original Sonimart Standard brush heads hasn&#x27;t changed - I still think they&#x27;re too firm -</li>
            <li>The bristles feel right when you brush, they aren&#x27;t too stiff or too soft.</li>
            <li>I got a way better deal shopping on Amazon &amp; finding these replacement brush heads ofr less than half the price!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheaper than brand name and a little more expensive than some cheap knock offs I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Based on other positive reviews, I decided to give these a try</li>
            <li>Surprised to see only 9 out of 15</li>
            <li>In the package, they included a package of their Extra Soft brush heads for my model of toothbrush, as well as a package of Sonicare branded extra soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li>So once the head from the set I bought runs out its natural life, I will be testing out Sonimart&#x27;s extra soft version of this brush head, and reporting back.</li>
            <li>So once the head from the set I bought runs out its natural life, I will be testing out Sonimart&#x27;s extra soft version of this brush head, and reporting back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month and so far they are entirely indistinguishable from the official product --</li>
            <li>For me these brushes are simply too soft -- which is why lots of folks like them.  </li>
            <li>So far, I would definitely repurchase this product.</li>
            <li>Unexpectedly, I think these brushes are well-made, especially given the price.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am terrified to do the math regarding how much money I have spent on Sonicare brand replacement heads throughout the years.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put the new toothbrush head on, and subsequently tried taking it off, the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit stiff at first, but they calm down in a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>The heads clip on to the Sonimart body (there appears to a slight gap between the head and the body which doesn&#x27;t affect their use) and they appear to be  of suitable stiffness, which hasn&#x27;t changed over the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are a great and less expensive alternative to the name brand brush heads.</li>
            <li>One set was the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive brush heads, the other was the Philips Sonicare Sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li>Btw, you only need soft bristles, they clean plaques just as well while not abrading your enamel so hard.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, they are much cheaper than the official sonicare, at about half the cost (if not a little less).</li>
            <li>Product appears to have the same if not better integrity and quality of that of the orginal manufacturer with significant cost savings.</li>
            <li>Initially, they are a bit stiff, but soften quickly.</li>
            <li>When I go for a cleaning now, the hygienist can hardly even find buildup to clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all these reviewa, I went with this instead of other brand.</li>
            <li>I bought these due to being much cheaper than the sonicare replacements</li>
            <li>I had a little trouble fitting these brush heads onto my sonicare, however once I did get the brush heads on</li>
            <li>They seem a little bit more narrow than Phillip&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Not real stiff, but enough</li>
            <li>They are a bit firmer than the overly soft regular Sonicare standard heads.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between these and the far more expensive &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; versions.</li>
            <li>Even with multiple coupons at major retail outlets or on Amazon, just two can cost $30 upwards.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews of other products I&#x27;ve seen are usually stating how low quality those brush heads are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two pros: cheap (will keep as emergency backups) and hard enough to double as a tongue scraper.</li>
            <li>To give you a very brief description of my observations, I can say that the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive is slightly firmer than the Philips Sonicare Sensitive.</li>
            <li>extra* careful to brush gently since the standard brush head irritated a section of my gums.</li>
            <li>Made in the USA can&#x27;t come at the much of a premium, so maybe Phillips will come down on price to in order to justify buying USA-made brush heads.</li>
            <li>Better than the previous generic brushes I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of these brushes yet, but they look exactly like the originals, and the bristles feel as stiff as well.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly like the rip-off official ones - just at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They might be just a very slight bit stiffer bristles than the official Phillips brush head replacement when first used, but within two or three days there is no difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried generics before and was very disappointed, but the Sonimart replacement heads were just as good as the name brand - at a fraction of the cost!!  </li>
            <li>The fit isn&#x27;t quite right--a little tight.</li>
            <li>They are packaged well in a hard plastic package that can be opened &amp; closed easily for storing the extra brushes.  </li>
            <li>They hold their shape well and they seem to be the same composition as the regular Sonicare brushes, but they cost about half as much.</li>
            <li>Durability seems to be fine so far, but the price point of these makes it easier to replace them earlier than the expensive name brand heads.</li>
            <li>In fact, after putting this brush head on, it made a weird sound coming from my tooth brush (with the old head) stop.</li>

            <li> There should be more alternatives</li>
            <li> Talk about price gouging, and they weren&#x27;t all that much better even here on amazon.</li>
            <li> These Sonimart brush heads are great and a whole lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Honestly better than the name brand.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an Oral B rechargeable that had seen better days and was in need of replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order them again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I was leery of knock-offs and some sellers seemed sketchy to me, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on these.</li>
            <li> The packages don&#x27;t show you the fitting.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find someone who showed and described what they looked like.</li>
            <li> They fit the slot correctly and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> Certainly better priced.</li>
            <li> Upon examination the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; looked more like fibers.  </li>
            <li> items seems to be OK otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I would also like to add that this company stands beside the product and more than guarantee satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product duplicates the more expense Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> My replacement brushes came quite promptly after purchase, they were packed well to ensure their safe arrival</li>
            <li> Worked great and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Just like the name brand, but at a fantastic discount!</li>
            <li> Our family has been using Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I like them better than the ones made by Sonicare and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> These are great and are very inexpensive to the name brand.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I ordered these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure these would work as well as the originals</li>
            <li> love the price</li>
            <li> I can afford to change brushes much more often now.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same quality as the brand name, but definitely a great alternative!</li>
            <li> Sonimart Premium Standard  Replacement heads are Great!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better then the sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase, would replace again with this company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brush heads, on the contrary, are fantastic!</li>
            <li> They were ok.</li>
            <li> It is nice and cheap.</li>
            <li> Was even better than what the picture shows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect will definitely purchase again from vendor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are even better than the name brand brusheads at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more to keep them stocked up for my family.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> My dentist can&#x27;t get over how healthy my gum tissue is (55)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten most of my friends using this toothbrush and loy a L to the brand as well.</li>
            <li> Pleased</li>
            <li> works better than Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> Great service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> We love this product.</li>
            <li> Looks and works just as well as the Sonicare brand - great value, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They also come with color coded rings so if you have more than one toothbrush you can tell which is yours.</li>
            <li> Softer heads are probably better for enamel preservation anyway.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought these replacement toothbrush heads for my Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> They do a much better job of cleaning and keep their shape.  </li>
            <li> So, all in all, this is a great knock off but very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The best generic tooth brush heads I have used.</li>
            <li> And I love that it came with color coding bands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, and will definitely reorder when we need more.</li>
            <li> Better than the factory heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> so maybe they&#x27;re better than OEM?</li>
            <li> These brush heads are of Excellence Quality and Fit!</li>
            <li> , just need changed more often than a Sonicare branded toothbrush head</li>
            <li> Much better pricing than sonicare.</li>
            <li> I prefer to stiffer and more compact brush head.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with these replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Im really glad</li>
            <li> The Sonimart Premium Standard  Replacement Toothbrush heads are an excellent  product.  </li>
            <li> When i called to get information from customer service on which of their many models i should consider, they could not have been more helpful on the phone.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the one that came on the brush from the factory...</li>
            <li> I will return to buy more in 3 month.</li>
            <li> just tried the product and seems okay</li>
            <li> Seem to work as described at a much better price.</li>
            <li> No issues with them fitting whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Best generic replacement heads I have found for Sonicare toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> I am okay with the stiffer bristles.  </li>
            <li> However, I must say I&#x27;m totally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> No reason to pay more for Sonicare brushes</li>
            <li> Love it... will always buy these.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with these non-panasonic brand brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my sonic toothbrush, but have always been upset with the cost of the toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> This is the best set of generic brusheads</li>
            <li> but at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Better then the sink add one</li>
            <li> Better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> This opens up more room for water to seep in, not a show stopper but have to deduct one star for this.</li>
            <li> I need mine to be firmer to be able to go under my gum line and nail tartar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my SonicCare Flex+ brush but not the price of the brush heads to replace them.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying how much I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
            <li> purposely delayed writing this review because I wanted to make sure that some time had passed to see how the brush heads are holding up.</li>
            <li> Dare I say, with the way this brush head has been working, I think the quality might even be better than the originals.</li>
            <li> So glad I made the switch</li>
            <li> I am glad they are going to work out since I do like the efficiency of the toothbrush and the cleaning it provides.</li>
            <li> Bristles are softer than the Sonicare ones, but I think they feel better.  </li>
            <li> and I am enjoying using them.</li>
            <li> These are actually better than the brush heads that came with my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I like the shape better than the oem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to sonicare for providing a quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and packed in very nice retail packaging.</li>
            <li> But now, I am so thrilled to find an affordable way to keep my family in fresh toothbrush heads that I will probably buy these forever!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> These are better than the one that came with the brush originally!  </li>
            <li> Better than the original brushes that came with the product!</li>
            <li> They might even be better than the original ones!</li>
            <li> I think the slightly higher price is fair for the better quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Great value and decent quality-what s not to like?</li>
            <li> These are great high quality replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrushes are shaped slightly different than my original toothbrush but fit perfectly and are a nice substitute at a much better price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as good as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> These are just as good and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads feel like the original heads from Phillips!</li>
            <li> In fact, however, they fit perfectly, work just as well as the original, and came with clear information about determining when to replace.  </li>
            <li> works great on my new sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that I made such a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad to find fair pricing as I feel the toothbrush manufactures really gouge us on brush replacements.</li>
            <li> Replacement head fits perfectly and the bristles are just right (somewhere between medium and soft).</li>
            <li> Teeth are squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quick delivery of my Amazon order and more than satisfied with the use of my new&lt;br /&gt;series 5</li>
            <li> love it, better than original</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase &amp; saved money over the other brands :)</li>
            <li> The best buy better then any other brand I have brought will buy again</li>
            <li> If anything it just feels like a better quality build, and a better clean.</li>
            <li> I tried several &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brands, but they weren&#x27;t very good quality.  </li>
            <li> but they fit and work perfectly, at a huge savings!</li>
            <li> These are an amazing replacement and worth risking.</li>
            <li> These are not the supersoft brushes you&#x27;ll get from most cheap aftermarket suppliers</li>
            <li> Better yet, they fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li> Fit and finish is top shelf...</li>
            <li> So far they have been a great replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to have found a cheaper option as it let me &#x27;brush&#x27; off my Sonicare toothbrush and put it back to good use.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that these work great.</li>
            <li> So far they work great.</li>
            <li> They work great so far</li>
            <li> Good deal, thanks.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Philips heads, but at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to the name brand brush heads again - the quality of these are just as good and saving a ton of money is always nice too :)</li>
            <li> These offer an excellent fit and are at least as good of a feel from a quality standpoint as the brand....</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as the real deal.</li>
            <li> Sonimart were to release a softer version, which better compares to the original, I would consider trying those out.</li>
            <li> Sonimart were to release a softer version, which better compares to the original, I would consider trying those out.</li>
            <li> Better value than original brush heads.</li>
            <li> What I can tell, just by looking at them, they are not  as substantial or for lack of a better term &amp;#34;beefy&amp;#34; as the original sonic care heads.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy the replacement brushes because they were so much more affordable compared to the original Sonicare cost.</li>
            <li> Much better value than original.</li>
            <li> These are much better than the cheapo ones I bought on Ebay, worth the upgrade in price!</li>
            <li> We always try to get the most out of each replacement because of the cost of the original Sonic Care brand heads.  </li>
            <li> I almost like this more than the original.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads themselves are of very good quality, especially compared to the set that is available on B@ngg@@d.  </li>
            <li> so my wife and I have a easy way to tell our brushes apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love my Sonicare - I have the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> And they are so easy to replace on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to get burned.</li>
            <li> Holy cow are these tooth brush heads great!</li>
            <li> Easy set up.  </li>
            <li> sure if it&#x27;s worth buying extras and going through more heads.</li>
            <li> /vibratey when using them, than the Sonicare branded ones I&#x27;ve been using since I bought the brush, but I could easily abide that, given the price</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes arrived very quickly, and the package was undamaged.</li>
            <li> Liked them do much, I ordered more to stick up.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied and recommend these replacement heads as a really cost effective alternative.</li>
            <li> Almost too strong</li>
            <li> I think the magnets are just too strong.</li>
            <li> Fit right on my Sonic, Puckett split and just as nice as brand name.</li>
            <li> Believe me if you want to be able to afford your Soniccare Toothbrush then click on the link and buy them right now!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertized, at a good price, shipment arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Fit great in the toothbrush, the bristles aren&#x27;t hard, and they are a great size.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect fit for Sonicare and the heads are a bit more firm, which she likes.</li>
            <li> These heads fit my sonicare toothbrush as well or better than the original one.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are as good as the new brushes.  </li>
            <li> but they work just fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> This one works just fine.</li>
            <li> These seem to work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for 3 months and they are just fine.  </li>
            <li> but they are just fine.</li>
            <li> Once used to them, these are fine.</li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> softer than the originals but work fine</li>
            <li> A lot less money for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Should work fine.</li>
            <li> all seems to be working just fine and would recommend others to buy</li>
            <li> Nuances of toothbrush quality aside (seems fine), these toothbrush heads stayed in the Sonicare, and that was all I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> For this price, I would be fine changing each month.</li>
            <li> These work just fine with my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> but they stay on just fine.</li>

            <li> shipping was quick and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great, fit perfectly, and don&#x27;t vibrate off as other cheaper generic brands do.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my Flex toothbrush perfectly for half the cost of the name brand ones plus they arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Economical way to use a great toothbrush, I&#x27;ll be re-ordering these when i need new brush heads</li>

            <li> A huge savings compared to the Sonicare brand, and these brushes (after 3 weeks) work just as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used one yet, but I checked them out (fit one on my toothbrush)</li>
            <li> Order was filled promptly, and arrived promptly.  </li>
            <li> The head is holding up great and assume we&#x27;d get several months use per replacement.  </li>
            <li> Is the Philips version worth $6 more per replacement brush head?</li>
            <li> And it is fit for HX6530, I bought 4 4-pack</li>
            <li> Sonimart is a fabulous solution.</li>
            <li> I hope they&#x27;re still available when I need to order some again.</li>
            <li> They fit my brush.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the quality of a third-party brush head and how well it would fit.  </li>
            <li> The heads fit my Sonitrol electric toothbrush as specified.  </li>
            <li> These were great especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> They fit well..</li>
            <li> Great generic replacement head for my sonicare toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Comfortable bristle firmness.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I thought for the price, the product would be cheap.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been in the market for cheap replacement brushes for over a year.</li>
            <li> Brushes fit but do not know about color change with use</li>
            <li> These replacements heads work great but was amazes me, and what I was not expecting is that they are lasting longer than the originals.</li>
            <li> Love these, well worth the price and</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I slipped it on the stem of the device and it fit well, no looseness or anything.</li>
            <li> These are of great quality, just slightly smaller than OE sonicare heads.</li>

            <li> It works but it&#x27;s a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> These fit just like the originals.</li>
            <li> They work great and we would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as compared to a genuine sonicare head.</li>
            <li> mini cheap, plastic bristled hairbrushes, but for teeth.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and they fit the bill.</li>
            <li> The brushes fit the Sonicare power head correctly.</li>
            <li> They fit quite well but hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> They fit and work as well as the originals.</li>
            <li> Really good quality so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> I was told not to buy these because if they aren&#x27;t sonicare heads, they are going to buzz loudly and not be good quality.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Used these for a couple of days, so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted Sonimart to be good as I&#x27;m not crazy about paying triple the price for these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> The Sonimart toothbrushes are far superior to the Sonicare ones.  </li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my Sonicare which I bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Dentist says they must be doing as good a job as the old Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> Appear to be good so far.</li>
            <li> Assuming that changes I&#x27;ll update this review, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Excellent Original Manufacturers Item Replacement - works just as well as the original for half the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced that with the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had actually bought two sets:</li>
            <li> Great value for an OEM quality replacement at only a portion of the original manufactures product.</li>
            <li> Great generic replacement for the original.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are the same quality as the name brand and fit my older model perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Much appreciated!!!</li>
            <li> Brush bristles are stiffer than the original units, but are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Having heard good things about this one, however, I decided to give it a try - and now love it, hands down, better.  </li>
            <li> The generic sonicare heads are fully as good as the original OEM (Original equip manufacturer)!</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are comfortable and leave your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t fall out, they fit the toothbrush well, and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> received quickly, they fit, and seem to be just fine.</li>
            <li> It also seems to use high quality materials, as the brush heads feel nice and there is a metal ring where the brush head contacts the handle.</li>
            <li> A bit softer bristles than the original Phillips products but</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and works as well if not better than original products.  </li>
            <li> Started using one of these about a week ago and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> To me, they brush as well as my original brushheads.  </li>
            <li> Works just like the original at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> For now though, we will stick to the original brush heads -</li>
            <li> /&gt;EDIT: Forgot to mention that Sonimart sent me an email to encourage me to write a review.at with the original brush</li>
            <li> For now though, we will stick to the original brush heads -</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far</li>
            <li> Worth their price from Amazon!</li>
            <li> If Phillips thinks they have a captive audience, they had better think again, because these generic brush heads are great.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads work just as well as the original one.  </li>
            <li> for a product that competes with an original manufacturer in a monopolising position.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks and it feels just like the original brush.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the original brush head that came with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Works as we&#x27;ll as the original at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Better than the real Sonicare brush heads!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and toothbrushes seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are well made and function just like the original.</li>
            <li> No difference with the original Sonicare, works well with my Philips Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> The original Sonicare brushes are stiffer.</li>
            <li> Work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> better/ softer  than the original</li>
            <li> wrks as well as the original at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> They contacted me after the original review and sent me a replacement even though I hadn&#x27;t asked for a refund.</li>
            <li> They are identical to the original equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the original brushes that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> however they are a bit softer then the original head.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more and more!</li>
            <li> original review is listed below.</li>
            <li> Just like the original.</li>
            <li> The quality appears comparable to manufacturers product at a significant discount.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing the original anymore.</li>
            <li> Well for the price there is not lost, however, if I can afford the original ones, I will get them.</li>
            <li> I started using the Sonimart brush to replace the original Philips Series 2 brush about 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked the sensitive brush heads to have worked out because the price is great, but I will be going back to the brand name brush heads for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried them and very well packaged as well!  </li>
            <li> The original one from philips is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> fits just like the original Sonicare brush head.  </li>
            <li> Works well, compares to the original Philips heads.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine and good quality for the low price.</li>
            <li> These are very nice and affordable replacement heads for the Sonicare toothbrush system and seem to be just as good as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the one I&#x27;ve used so far - my only regret (and it&#x27;s probably my fault)</li>
            <li> I waited until I have used these for at least a month to tell you that they fit my model perfectly, and work well.</li>
            <li> its like when you are trying to clean a stain out of the carpet</li>
            <li> Works well with my sonicare platinum diamond clean toothbrush</li>
            <li> I hope Sonimart copies the Diamond Clean heads.</li>
            <li> Heads perfectly fit my Bright White Sonic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot tell the difference beyween the SonimRt brushes and OEM Philips brushes, which I have used daily for more than five years.</li>
            <li> Was concerned they might not work as well or be as nice as the expensive sonicare brushes, but we gave them a try and are very happy we did.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Great replacement heads at a great price, did not notice any difference between these and the expensive manufacture replacement heads.</li>
            <li> My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t get as clean as with the brand name.  </li>
            <li> However, this doesn&#x27;t seem to affect how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad when these showed up and after using them for a few weeks they are doing great.  </li>
            <li> The head is slightly bigger, and the brush is soft and performs great!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and seems as good as the ones that cost twice as much</li>
            <li> Well, I stumbled upon these when going to make my purchase and with so many positive reviews I decided to try once more, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose since they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> No problems so far, will probably order again in a year or two when I need more!</li>
            <li> They hold fast and are very secure.</li>
            <li> I received the right toothbrush refill very quickly.</li>
            <li> Kudos to Sonimart for getting it right!</li>
            <li> These replacements fit on my sonicare 2 plaque control just fine and seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> They work fine &amp; the price is right.</li>
            <li> Pretty good not too soft</li>
            <li> The contouring is great and they fit perfectly on the Sonicare toothbrush base.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed that Sonimart went the extra mile and actually offered me the opportunity to test theirs and Philips&#x27; softer brush heads free of charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We ended up returning the brush heads to Amazon, who gave us a full refund,</li>
            <li> /&gt;We ended up returning the brush heads to Amazon, who gave us a full refund,</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the much more expensive heads and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just as good as standard brushes for any electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They were a good price but not the same brush head as on my Platinum set.</li>
            <li> It is a good replacement, but way cheaper than the actual Philips sonimart</li>
            <li> Overall good value.</li>
            <li> , no problems with extra noise and the bristle firmness is good.</li>
            <li> They come nicely packaged with the rubber rings and clear plastic brush covers just like the originals come with.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the full priced version.</li>
            <li> I will never pay full price again when I can buy this brand for my sonicare.</li>
            <li> i never contacted them but they sent me 2 four packs of soft bristle brush heads on there own.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought these and hope they are available in the future when I need more.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a secure lock ring so that it won&#x27;t fall off easily.</li>
            <li> while there&#x27;s an obvious difference compared to the original sonicare (the cap from sonicare doesn&#x27;t fit these heads, but each brush comes with its own cap anyways), there&#x27;s no reduction in quality.</li>
            <li> It works just like the original, and so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Fit my Sonic just right.</li>
            <li> They fit just right, bristles seem... like bristles.</li>
            <li> These fantastic little brush heads are a great product for the price that you pay.</li>
            <li> They work great at a fraction of the price of some other sellers.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;wear indicator&amp;#34;, but other than that they are great.  </li>
            <li> purchased these after all the many great reviews, thinking they would be more or less the same as the original Sonicare brushheads.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t falling apart and my teeth feel fresh and clean after every use.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was easy to open AND reclose for storage.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly softer than the OEM brush, but plenty of cleaning power... more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Even so, for the price of these I can afford to learn that lesson and still come out ahead fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> These replacement brushes seem to work and feel better particularly along the gum line than the originals.</li>
            <li> Once these wear out, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back for more.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Just checked on Amazon really quick and found this option</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> A replacement product was provided quickly.</li>
            <li> These are super.  </li>
            <li> After about a week of using these, however, the head has softened a bit and it&#x27;s become more natural-feeling to me (meaning - more similar to the Phillips brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t fall off, and there hasn&#x27;t been extraordinary wear that you might expect for an inexpensive product.  </li>
            <li> Have not used any of these replacements yet because the toothbrush was recently bought, but the price was right and they fit exactly like the factory heads, as well as the good price.</li>
            <li> The original ones, will last more than 6 months easily.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with them and hoping they last awhile.</li>
            <li> I am overall a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them yet as I am still using my last original sonic care head, so I can&#x27;t give an honest review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price &amp; fast shipping for a quality product!</li>
            <li> No complaints here fit my toothbrush exactly and works well.</li>
            <li> These are an exact fit for the sonicare I have.</li>
            <li> Not too terribly impressed - main thing that sticks out is that the brush is not as firm as Sonicare brushes....</li>
            <li> The brushes work great and are less money than the name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product for half the price.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived well packaged, slightly different from he Philips product, but pretty good nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I actually like them better than the Sonicare ones!</li>
            <li> They are just the same as name brand but even better because its way cheaper!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is!</li>
            <li> They are working exactly the way that the original heads did.  </li>
            <li> On the first use I was gagging on bristles that had come out!  </li>
            <li> Finally there are brush heads that fit my Sonicare that I can afford!!</li>
            <li> Same quality for a much better price!</li>
            <li> Be aware these are not Diamond Clean</li>
            <li> This turns out to be a great product, if not better than original brand</li>
            <li> As said before, the bristles are a bit stiffer that the real oem replacement heads, but that is fine by me.</li>
            <li> they fit great, can hardly tell the difference with the sonicare brand</li>
            <li> As good as the original, but at half the price.</li>
            <li> It is just not as positive a click as the original.</li>
            <li> The one gripe I have is that it doesn&#x27;t fit as snugly as the Philips version, but that doesn&#x27;t cause any real issues for me.</li>
            <li> Fabulous replacement and much cheaper than the name-brand replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Fit my sonic care toothbrush correctly, and had good firm bristles.</li>
            <li> These are cheaper and fit the Phillip&#x27;s sonicare toothbrushes very well.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrushes fit my Sonicare very well and feel like the originals.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, would recommend.</li>
            <li> The color bands are a nice touch in situations with multiple toothbrushes to differentiate whose is whose.  </li>
            <li> And the price for brush heads on online makes the purchase well worth it compared to anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Grea, economical substitue.</li>
            <li> So far I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re worth it</li>
            <li> These are as good or better than the much more expensive OEM brushes.</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased with the value of this product so far.</li>
            <li> The different color rubber gasket set is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love our Sonicare toothrbrushes, but she always thought that the heads were too soft.</li>
            <li> (Rarely) It&#x27;s all because of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try these brush heads since it&#x27;s rare to get an Off Brand that works as well as the Name Brand.</li>
            <li> We each have our own toothbrush head (using the different color rings that come with the package).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to know they care enough about their product to follow up like they did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These do save a bit of money, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li> Pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> These heads are narrower than I expected but they are good quality.</li>
            <li> I do not know why anyone would buy them name-brand kind for double the price.</li>
            <li> These fit my sonic flex care toothbrush nicely and work just as good as the expensive name brand replacement</li>
            <li> But, totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are offered at an economical price but the quality remains.</li>
            <li> Worth the saved money</li>
            <li> But then I was able to try out the sensitive Sonimart brush heads</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference, so that is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> but if you like them firmer this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth getting if you don&#x27;t want or need diamond head quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice to support local.</li>
            <li> They fit the base perfectly, even better than the original head.  </li>
            <li> We ordered based on other user&#x27;s reviews and are most pleased.</li>
            <li> and they are close enough to the original Phillips that it makes it totally a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 and have clean, healthy gums and teeth in good condition -- considering a lifetime of poor dental care before the year 2000 wake up call.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare Healthy White brush and my husband has the Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews ARE TRUE.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than the original brush heads.</li>
            <li> They performed as well as the original Sonicare replacements at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> It is very close to original manufacturer quality.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are stiffer than the ones that come with the original, but not so much as o be a discomfort.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original, Philips brush heads, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> as fast as the original one.</li>
            <li> Fits right, can&#x27;t tell any difference from the name brand.</li>
            <li> Appears to be the right item.  </li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> and they were the right size and the right price ($30</li>
            <li> Sonimart was very quick to respond to my separated brush heads and sent out a new set.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat leery of purchasing these replacement heads for my Philips sonacare toothbrush because they were priced so much lower than the Diamond Clean heads.</li>
            <li> The brush heads clean very well.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are exactly what I was looking for and got much better than the old replacement ones I got.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrush heads because they are strong enough to remove placque where other brands are too soft to do this.</li>
            <li> The original ones cost so much more and do exactly the same job.</li>
            <li> While the Philips Sonicare Sensitive is a bit too soft for my taste, the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive is actually perfect!</li>
            <li> The cheap ones get soft really quick and do not hold up well.</li>
            <li> These certainly do feel and clean like the first gen Philips sonic heads.</li>
            <li> The bristles are all still straight and true so it is wearing well.  </li>
            <li> They also vibrate more violently because they arent a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> They fit and just a good as the more expensive Sonicare brand.  </li>
            <li> Not bad feels like the real thing</li>
            <li> So I am able to sort of manually brush the backs of my front teeth a little better.</li>
            <li> they did was to send me two new sets of brush heads - free of charge.</li>
            <li> Great product, just like more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Seem to be just as good as the brand-name Sonicare heads but substantially less in price.</li>
            <li> but then they became ultra soft very quickly.</li>
            <li> Good to know that this company takes its customers feedback to heart!my model of toothbrush, as well as a package of Sonicare branded extra soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very good - neither to stiff or soft.  </li>
            <li> They also seem to work as well as the real product, if not a little better.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping the fact that I&#x27;ve used DiamondClean heads is enough information for anyone interested in getting great brush heads and an incredibly low price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sifted through the knock offs - the ones that are so soft they basically do nothing, the ones that fall apart right in your mouth, the ones that don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li> I do not think they will last more than 3 months, which it is the right time to replace them.</li>
            <li> Shipping from Amazon is very fast.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard to use soft brushes, so maybe this is fine.  </li>
            <li> Sonimart sensitive is a fine substitute for the namebrand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted to have a less expensive alternative that works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good little toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> If you like hard bristles, this would be great.</li>
            <li> Just bought a new sonicare and this replacement head work as well as the one that came with the toothbrush,  my teeth feel clean as if I had just had them cleaned at the dentist,  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer than the original head that came with the unit, but fit my easyclean model of Philips Sonicare fine.</li>
            <li> Having those clear plastic head covers makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> glad to have extra brushes.</li>
            <li> These are the first replacements I&#x27;ve seen that match the originals.  </li>
            <li> I was wary about purchasing an off brand replacement head for my Sonicare but after making the jump I can say I am very happy I did.</li>
            <li> I actually like them better.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of the cheap imitators and this far surpasses them.</li>
            <li> Why pay $32 (retail) for four when you can get the same quality product for a much better price?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my sonicare flexcare 900</li>
            <li> basically very well; worth the price.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Healthy White rechargeable sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> No problem with fit, so far.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> High quality at an affordable price!!</li>
            <li> After reading the Amazon reviews, I was willing to give it a try</li>
            <li> Having finally gotten an electric toothbrush, I have actually enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> I have used my first Sonimart replacement brush head now for over a month.  </li>
            <li> They fit well and work well so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first one.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m really satisfied w/ these generic brushes.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> but these are actually softer and we like them better.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my  Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li> After the first week the bristles were coming out.</li>
            <li> I have Sonicare Healthy White model of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> But much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Revised Review:  SoniMart after my first review sent me their product AND sent the SoniCare brush head unit it matches.  </li>
            <li> They do the same as the others with a better price</li>
            <li> The product ordered was delivered as promised and is exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Sonimart!</li>
            <li> Will most definitely be a product that I order again.</li>
            <li> First time to try these.  </li>
            <li> Very well made product!  </li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare Healthy White HX6710.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> After I tested out the regular Sonimart brush heads, I was dissapointed as I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use this brand.  </li>
            <li> Product quality is much better than another generic brush</li>
            <li> and I have tried nearly all available for the Sonic toothbrush..</li>
            <li> I am using my first Sonimart replacement toothbrush head</li>
            <li> These look and feel exactly like the branded brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Sonimart!</li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> The contour is different from the Series 2 and it seems to work better cleaning out the coffee stain in between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well these replacements fit my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So my first instinct was to go online and read as many reviews as possible.</li>
            <li> Product appears consistent with Sonicare; time will tell.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first brush head</li>
            <li> Way better value than the sonicare heads, and work exactly the same!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Bristles falling out on first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these replacement brushes, as I feel that they are the same quality as the name brand, and they are certainly a better price.</li>
            <li> very good replacement product, work as well as the original and a little bit harder , which i found nicer&lt;br /&gt;well packed and arrived fast&lt;br</li>
            <li> The old product served me well and the new one seems to be even better.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be near exact quality of the original Philips heads</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make these better is if they were offered in a soft brush head for more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I was an early user, recommended by dentist when I had significant plaque buildup and gum disease.</li>
            <li> I think the original one is too soft too.</li>
            <li> Close enough to the original brand that it doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> Great value versus Sonicare&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced OEM brush.</li>
            <li> but with each use so far, a bristle comes off and floats around in my mouth as i clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble attaching my replacement and the feel and clean of it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but with so many good reviews</li>
            <li> These brushes are JUST as good as the more expensive Phillips branded products.  </li>
            <li> The SoniMART brush heads are equivalent to the standard replacement brush heads from Sonicare and they are offered at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads  are just as good as the high priced Phillips heads at half the price.  </li>
            <li> we went back and got a clean bill of health regarding our gums !</li>
            <li> But the brush head does have a little more &amp;#34;wiggle room&amp;#34; than the original head.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased the Philips brand, but saw the positive reviews and gave them a try.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a bit softer than the DiamondClean heads (which I actually find to be a bit too hard), but they&#x27;re more than sufficient to give a really good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered - fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast shipping!</li>
            <li> All-in-all they appear to be an exact replacement for the Sonicare brushes which cost something around twice as much.</li>
            <li> Fast service and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> They may not last as long, but when you get (4) in a pack for the price you&#x27;d normally get 1 or 2 of the name brand ones, I think I&#x27;ll be happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying more of the Sonicare replacement heads as long as I can purchase these.</li>
            <li> Good basic replacement for the standard manufacture brush at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Work great - much higher quality than another generic head I tried previously.</li>
            <li> These are a little different than the stock replacements, but I think they clean just as good.  </li>
            <li> (it pops back together fairly easily) and it gets stuck on the handle and requires some force to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are long and soft and the increased area compared to the stock toothbrush head is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> for about half the price of Sonicare&#x27;s own product.</li>
            <li> Much lower cost per head that the Phillips versions, and the quality level is as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I like the colored rings that come with them to identify certain children&#x27;s brushes.  </li>
            <li> These are packaged smartly and hygenically.  </li>
            <li> At this price I&#x27;ll certainly buy them as my preferred replacement.</li>
            <li> In fact, my gums are pretty sensitive so these are actually even a bit better for me than the heads the brush came with.</li>
            <li> Brush heads seem more like original Sonicare ones, and they also come with the protective clear covers, as Sonicare&#x27;s does (some other generics don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> The whole toothbrush system gives amazing results with us having less cavities than ever.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality, maybe a little more stiff than the OEM brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have used only one and it works fine.</li>
            <li> These totally work fine</li>
            <li> Based on visual inspection, I expect them to work fine.</li>
            <li> These seem to be pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend it and thee replacement brushes highly to anyone who is interested in switching to a battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; version is also just as good, and the Phillips brand of compact head is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> The price  is so much more economical than other brushes too!!</li>
            <li> They seem to last longer and fit the brush very well.  </li>
            <li> The length of the bristles are the same as is the pattern (btw, I don&#x27;t really think the pattern--some tall, some short--really make a huge difference; also, I don&#x27;t change them every 3 months as the &amp;#34;dentists&amp;#34; recommend.</li>
            <li> Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just like the real thing</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought another one for my son, and sent it to him.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Sonicmart Toothbrush heads work just as well as the Sonicare brand I use to buy, but much cheaper ($10.95).</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re super particular or noise sensitive, or if you can afford the price difference, maybe go with the real deal.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Quality of the brush heads was very comparable to the Sonicare brand.</li>
            <li> They fit properly too.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They are very affordable and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I can fully understand that, and really appreciate their efforts to ensure customer satisfaction, as you will see below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much so, that my gums would feel &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; after brushing.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between these and the ones I was paying twice as much for from Phillips.</li>
            <li> Brother really uses them With Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend twice as much on the brand name.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;May your teeth be cleaned for a reasonable price.&amp;#34; Then he disappeared, as I knew my plaque and unsightly tartar buildup soon would.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much for these and they splay out within 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are what they seem to be... i.e. replacement brushes that are much cheaper than the brand name versions.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> plus the price is much cheaper than store</li>
            <li> These looks and feel to be of the same quality as the genuine Philips brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for all the online reviews.</li>
            <li> They were very helpful in selecting this company and product.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the Phillips heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always grumbled about the cost of the brush heads and probably haven&#x27;t changed them as much as I should have.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d have to spend so much money replacing toothbrush heads for a family of five.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; product as advertised</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> That being said, these brushes do the job and at a MUCH lower price than the Sonicare replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> My items were shipped fast and well packed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased non-Sonicare brush heads before and they were very noisy.  </li>
            <li> So reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> And isn&#x27;t that the whole point of having a Sonicare?  </li>
            <li> I have been using the diamond brushes that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell a difference, and will without a doubt be purchasing these from Sonimart from now on.  </li>
            <li> I bought cheap replacement brushes on Amazon a while back</li>
            <li> A quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sonimart</li>
            <li> Had to buy the real Sonicare brushes at Walmart for twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really cant tell the difference just like</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use my Amazon Prime Membership to order what I need rather than driving all over town looking for products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> There were also packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Fits well and works better than expected</li>
            <li> After I tried these brushes, I reordered enough so got free shipping,  😄</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of the heads rather than wasting money, but I&#x27;ll be buying the real deal from now on.</li>
            <li> but at a much reduced price.  </li>
            <li> These prices are much cheaper than the sonicare brand</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Have a years supply ready.</li>
            <li> I think is the number of my toothbrush which nothing really says whether it fits that line or not.</li>
            <li> Now I dont have to spend so much money.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Really quality generics to the OEM replacement heads.</li>
            <li> My whole family has used these for about three weeks now.  </li>
            <li> and they are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> honestly I didn&#x27;t feel much difference compared to the authentic (and expensive) one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> In really like these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> and it is performing very well.  </li>
            <li> but, I always had a problem with the fit especially if the brush was seated on a ring....</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable and came in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes worked very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks for providing a quality brush at a reasonable price, with purchase via Amazonj.</li>
            <li> Just like the sonicare ones but much cheaper price</li>
            <li> Shipping was lightning fast.</li>
            <li> I find that it had worked very well.  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t want to give up quality.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They work very well</li>
            <li> This is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Just pay the $$ for real thing.</li>
            <li> and they do the job just as well as the Philips heads -- at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> These feel of very comparable quality to the official ones that cost $12 apiece.</li>
            <li> Bristles are nice and firm and well attached.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this over the more expensive Philips own brand replacement heads anytime.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and the brush heads are comparable to the OEM, not quite as on par but close enough that if I end up replacing them more frequently because the cost is lower I will end up with healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I prefer the OEM bristles by a hair, as they start soft, and are probably slightly better for people with sensitive gums, or existing gum damage, but these also end up quite soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm and have stayed nice and straight.</li>
            <li> Looks like the original, works like the original, yet it&#x27;s half the price</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much difference between these and the authentic Sonicare toothbrush replacement heads, other than tat</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping they were a quality product and was amazed- just as good if not better than the Phillips brushes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Sonimart sent me a new box thinking that my first shipment was defective.</li>
            <li> Read reviews before my purchase and just used my new replacement heads for the first time.  </li>
            <li> But even if they don&#x27;t last as long - it&#x27;s still a better buy!</li>
            <li> THe other ones leave my teeth feeling etra sensitive and these are really nice.  </li>
            <li> gentle enough that I don&#x27;t need the original over priced ones.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new sonic electric brush and finally retired my very old version that i have had for many years.</li>
            <li> Certainly an improvement over the older models we owned.</li>
            <li> The actually vibrations on the my Diamond Clean are not as intense but the brushes vibrated way farther than the OEM from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Quality appears to be the same as original equipment.  </li>
            <li> Better than other generics I have tried.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the same as the original.</li>
            <li> Just the same as the original.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product and this supplier fills their orders with new merchandise the same as you would buy in a store.</li>
            <li> Bottom line being my teeth just don&#x27;t get as clean using these generic brushes.  </li>
            <li> I actually think these fit BETTER than my previous Sonicare refills.</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far (after a few weeks).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to judge their durability, but so far I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> First time user of this product and so far, after 1st month, find these brushes comparable to the Sonicare brand in how they wear.  </li>
            <li> Order arrived early and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> At first they were soft</li>
            <li> is much better than other generic toothbrush heads in design and material, which makes it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a generic brand.</li>
            <li> They work well and fit my Sonicare, but they are pretty stiff at first.</li>
            <li> The bristles are slightly softer than the originals which is OK by me.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s a flaw with the particular head that i&#x27;m using</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought these for the low price, but these are great!  </li>
            <li> These are decent brushes for the Sonicare brush handle.</li>
            <li> Will be loyal customer in the future.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of the same.</li>
            <li> They are slightly smaller than the name brand heads but fit fine and brush as well as the much more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the replacement brushes are a little larger and they seem to get in between the teeth a lot better</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these without reservation</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> not much to say, they work fine.</li>
            <li> Seem to be good quality replacements, and fit on the little pegs on the charger (unlike other generic brands I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for quality replacement heads at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> Have only used them a few times, but seem to be good quality so far, and waaaay cheaper than the originals!</li>
            <li> kind of hard to avoid the noise in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little smaller than the heads that come with the Sonicare brushes, but the quality is very similar and they provide a great cleaning experience.</li>
            <li> yet these brushes feel gentle and soft on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonimart product was cheaper, what seems to be equal quality to the originals and not disappointing at all.</li>
            <li> The normal sized brush heads for me, and some of the compact brush heads for my wife.</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks, I think I like them better.  </li>
            <li> Walking through Costco and had pretty much this same product in my cart</li>
            <li> and they even fit my base better than the genuine product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but when removing the toothbrush head, the whole top comes off.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical first but decided to purchase one because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> no complaint</li>
            <li> They work quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly, isn&#x27;t loose and brushes just like the original.</li>
            <li> My husband, who is a dentist, knew right away that these were generic (without seeing the packaging) - but said these would be perfectly OK to use as long as they are replaced regularly (every 3 months).  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I found these brushes and can now pay a lot less for my brush heads!</li>
            <li> and so many replacement heads to place on it, multiple users for one single stand.</li>
            <li> Not quite as stiff as Sonicare replacements, but lovely for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snaps right back on</li>
            <li> They fit tight and work very well.  </li>
            <li> We have also ordered other Sonimart brush products and found them to be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they would be harder than the original</li>
            <li> Bristles are harder than original, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative they do get the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought the tooth brush and replacement tips for it, recommended to my by my new dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see spending 1/3 the price of a new toothbrush every time I want to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> I had picked up my electric toothbrush around Christmas time, I picked one up for my brother and figured I&#x27;d get myself one too, then after a couple of months I noticed the color start to wear away on the bristles indicating the time to get a new head.</li>
            <li> I like supprt new company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush since the New Year</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference, and my toothbrush feels like new.</li>
            <li> Once I replaced that brush head the new one seems to work just as well as the OEM brush heads, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my new HX6730,and</li>
            <li> and it still looks new.</li>
            <li> Have used for a month now and still like new.</li>
            <li> I have not used the replacement brushes yet, as I received the SonicCare toothbrush for Christmas and the existing head is practically new.</li>
            <li> We will buy them again when we need new brushes.</li>
            <li> The reviews were completely accurate, and they match up to the much more expensive name brand heads.</li>
            <li> I, too, was skeptical given the huge price difference from the official &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; replacement heads, but I am so glad I ordered these.</li>
            <li> The old model used to get mold if I didn&#x27;t constantly clean and dry it, but this one requires practically no care at all, except replacing the heads, which all toothbrushes require.</li>
            <li> Big money saving thanks to the reviewers here and thanks to Sonimart.</li>
            <li> These same heads fit both my SonicCare toothbrush and my wife&#x27;s, which is a different model.  </li>
            <li> Them seem fine as replacements, maybe a little softer than my original brush was, so if you want a firmer bristle order a firm one, but I like there very much.</li>
            <li> Packaged very professionally.</li>
            <li> The day I received them I tested one side by side with a new Phillips brush head of the exact same size and type.  </li>
            <li> I would say that the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive are a little bit softer than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads, but they clean even better than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads in my case.</li>
            <li> Is it exactly the same as the Philips replacement heads?</li>
            <li> The sonimart repacement brushheads seem to be equal to the original manufacturers and at a big discount!&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for competion.</li>
            <li> (which would be a 25% FAIL even if all the other brushes are perfect),</li>
            <li> Way better than the other generic brand I ordered from Amazon before!!</li>
            <li> The size is exactly the same as the factory version.</li>
            <li> These heads operate the exact same way as the manufacturer&#x27;s heads at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Be aware It comes with smaller size brush head.</li>
            <li> I am surprised!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> First replacement brushes that work and that I&#x27;d actually buy again.</li>
            <li> The brush looks like the original item and the lettering (different from the &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34;) is in he same font so a cursory exam will likely fool you.</li>
            <li> and wow that price!</li>
            <li> If I had received these as a gift, not being aware that they are generic...</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the product brushes, maybe even lasting longer(still on first brush).</li>
            <li> Glad to support this small, Made in America business.</li>
            <li> they are completely compatible with our Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I had &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; ones last time (MORE expensive) and these Sonimart heads seem to have more ridges, which I like.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised with these brush heads!</li>
            <li> Only comment is that the brush head is considerably larger then the original ones.</li>
            <li> These will work just fine; however, based on all the other reviews I was hoping that they&#x27;d be about the same as the real deal SoniCare heads.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was clean and undamaged as well, which isn&#x27;t always the case with other generics.</li>
            <li> Also, on top of being very firm, the way the bristles were cut remind me of when I used to cut my Barbie doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> so not sure how long it will last but happy so far.</li>
            <li> The sonicare brushes would start making noises due to the retaining ring breaking free and would not clean well or last more than a month.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time,  was exactly what I expected and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have also only used the first one in the pack, but so far the brush heads appear to be durable and well made.  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Sonicare user for over 10 years and the only time I use a regular toothbrush is if I forget to pack my charger while on vacation.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to do the job just fine - although I do think that the bristles are a little on the soft side.  </li>
            <li> I would say they&#x27;re close to the original sonicare brushes but break down maybe %50 faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, these are far from a replacement, they are exactly what you are looking for and you likley won&#x27;t go back to the original brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially I thought is was a smashed bug like a large flea.  </li>
            <li> They do, however, fit a little looser on the handle but at this time this is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the genuine ones, but the bristles are just a little stiffer than the &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; variety.</li>
            <li> I can usually get 4,  maybe 5 months out of a Sonicare-branded head, but by the end of that time, I&#x27;m really noticing that my teeth are not feeling as clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better way to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little stiffer than the original perhaps, but not excessively so.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are SLIGHTLY lower quality than the Sonicare ones I used to buy, but the price difference makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The bristles might be a little harder than the originals that came with my toothbrush, but you can compensate by brushing more gently.</li>
            <li> packaging that these heads come in can be a little frustrating, but once you access these magical plaque killers you&#x27;ll be glad you bought them.</li>
            <li> A little larger and so far seem more durable.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a clear plastic cap with with each brush.</li>
            <li> There is brown material that looks like piece of ceiling fell onto the toothbrush head before the clear head cover was pushed onto it.  </li>
            <li> Clearly lots of folks like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> reason i put four stars instead of five is because it wasn&#x27;t clear on the page that this isn&#x27;t a sonicare-branded product.  </li>
            <li> After my initial week-long short stint of using the standard Sonicare brush head, I irritated a section of my gums and it took nearly 3 weeks for the irritation to subside while using the Sonicare sensitive brush heads that the company so generously shipped to me free of charge with the Phillips brand equivalent.</li>
            <li> Not as soft bristles</li>
            <li> Only much cheaper.</li>
            <li> And for people that day they are loud...</li>
            <li> The bristles feel comparable, and thus far seem to be holding up as well.</li>
            <li> As frequently as you need to replace the heads, I can&#x27;t see spending $$$$ when I can spend $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying the soft bristles to try out.</li>
            <li> I did not realize these were after-market replacement heads, I thought they were the real deal from SoniCare and initially was a bit bummed out</li>
            <li> Using a Sonicare toothbrush every night and a WaterPik machine, over the course of two years, my gum disease completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and  professionally packaged.</li>
            <li> bristles are not to soft and don&#x27;t break off while</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a soft brush though</li>
            <li> These ones are soft and dont hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li> My toothbrush has no number as it is old.</li>
            <li> So far I am living these Sonimart replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I grabbed these because they were far cheaper than the namebrand brush heads.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> but so far I have used one for a month now</li>
            <li> My wife can take the 2 year old hair tie off</li>
            <li> So close to the name brand, these really surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by their quality.  </li>
            <li> Works on kids&#x27; version and adult.</li>
            <li> they tear up your mouth completely.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely continue to buy these in the future whenever I need replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> So far I cannot tell the difference between this brush and the OEM (Sonicare) brushes.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of experiencing with it, it fits with my teeth and makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> NOT the same quality as real Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t like these, is because I don&#x27;t trust them to be gentle enough.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this, because I had not contacted them directly</li>
            <li> They are called Sonimart Premium Ultra Soft Sensitive Replacement Toothbrush Heads.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft on this model.  </li>
            <li> and they were a waste of money as they did not stay secure in the holder.</li>
            <li> So far has happened to 2 of the 4 brush</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Now, it does still work to brush my teeth, but I am completely missing the functionality of taking the head off the handle to place it in my UV light after brushing.</li>
            <li> Sonimart replacement head seem to be professionally designed.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> standard heads replacement for my proresults, gentle bristles, vibrate well, not noisy.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> I just feel like I need soft bristles for my teeth as the dentist suggests.</li>
            <li> No problems thus far with the brushing, and bristles fade in color with age.  </li>
            <li> These are softer, but not as soft as Sonicare soft brush heads.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my old Sonicare brush head.  </li>
            <li> but they work just as well as far as I can see.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my gums seem to be on the verge of irritation even with the Sonicare sensitive brush heads--</li>
            <li> : I am upgrading my rating to 3 stars from 2 stars for now because the company sent me a set of their sensitive brush heads and two of the Sonicare brand brush heads to compare.</li>
            <li> I will update again in a month or so after trying out the sensitive brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive gums, but wow, these hurt.</li>
            <li> be prepared They&#x27;re not as soft</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ll never waste money on full-priced sonicare heads again.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to the ungodly expensive Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re as appropriately tight as the ones that came with the original handle.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to reach the back of my mouth and large enough to get a nice surface area.  </li>
            <li> Slightly stiffer than the super soft Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these are at least as nice as the name brand replacements, which are FAR more expensive.</li>
            <li> If you read the SoniCare labels for their brush heads they make various claims as to how much more plaque is removed than via ordinary brushing.  </li>
            <li> is the same, in my opinion to the main vendor brand.  </li>
            <li> They are a little smaller and overall seem ok so far.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend and we will be buying these again in the future.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using these and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These seem to be high quality replacements very similar to the official proresults brushes.  </li>
            <li> High quality + low price&#x3D;high value.</li>
            <li> I am now using that same first new brush head from Sonimart, along with the other new one from Phillips and switching off every day.  </li>
            <li> The bottom of the new brushes even have the same mold markings and metal flange as the old ones.</li>
            <li> It was a worthy investment and I will be sticking with the brand for a long, long time to come.</li>
            <li> Great product, most generic Sonicare heads are terrible quality...</li>
            <li> /&gt;These arrived in usual Amazon time, and fit on my HealthyWhite Sonicare with no problems.</li>
            <li> Works as well and lasts as long as Philips brand, at much lower price.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and as long as this company keeps the price reasonable, I will continue to use their product.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as expected.  </li>
            <li> had actually bought two sets: The normal sized brush heads for me, and some of the compact brush heads for my wife.</li>
            <li> They seem to be about the same structural quality as the original brush heads, except being far too firm for my liking.</li>
            <li> They seem to be about the same structural quality as the original brush heads, except being far too firm for my liking.</li>
            <li> I especially like this new Sonicare toothbrush model.</li>
            <li> I will buy only these from now on when I need new ones.</li>
            <li> Bad in that they don&#x27;t feel like they cover as much area per stroke, but good in that they feel like they&#x27;ll stay firmer longer.</li>
            <li> I will be more likely to replace the head more often since these are less expensive.</li>
            <li> They are no different than the name brand as far as I can tell, so far.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they won&#x27;t last as long as the much higher priced ones -</li>
            <li> To me they feel exactly the same and have lasted just as long.</li>
            <li> Not excellent but good enough!</li>
            <li> That in itself is a major plus.  </li>
            <li> I was somewhat weary of buying a different type of brush head for my Sonicare Toothbrush, but must say I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Too hard - thought that I was getting soft bristles like my original.</li>
            <li> , while my review of the original Sonimart Standard brush heads hasn&#x27;t changed - I still think they&#x27;re too firm -</li>
            <li> The bristles feel right when you brush, they aren&#x27;t too stiff or too soft.</li>
            <li> I got a way better deal shopping on Amazon &amp; finding these replacement brush heads ofr less than half the price!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheaper than brand name and a little more expensive than some cheap knock offs I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Based on other positive reviews, I decided to give these a try</li>
            <li> Surprised to see only 9 out of 15</li>
            <li> In the package, they included a package of their Extra Soft brush heads for my model of toothbrush, as well as a package of Sonicare branded extra soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li> So once the head from the set I bought runs out its natural life, I will be testing out Sonimart&#x27;s extra soft version of this brush head, and reporting back.</li>
            <li> So once the head from the set I bought runs out its natural life, I will be testing out Sonimart&#x27;s extra soft version of this brush head, and reporting back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month and so far they are entirely indistinguishable from the official product --</li>
            <li> For me these brushes are simply too soft -- which is why lots of folks like them.  </li>
            <li> So far, I would definitely repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly, I think these brushes are well-made, especially given the price.</li>
            <li> That being said, I am terrified to do the math regarding how much money I have spent on Sonicare brand replacement heads throughout the years.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put the new toothbrush head on, and subsequently tried taking it off, the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit stiff at first, but they calm down in a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> The heads clip on to the Sonimart body (there appears to a slight gap between the head and the body which doesn&#x27;t affect their use) and they appear to be  of suitable stiffness, which hasn&#x27;t changed over the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a great and less expensive alternative to the name brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> One set was the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive brush heads, the other was the Philips Sonicare Sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> Btw, you only need soft bristles, they clean plaques just as well while not abrading your enamel so hard.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, they are much cheaper than the official sonicare, at about half the cost (if not a little less).</li>
            <li> Product appears to have the same if not better integrity and quality of that of the orginal manufacturer with significant cost savings.</li>
            <li> Initially, they are a bit stiff, but soften quickly.</li>
            <li> When I go for a cleaning now, the hygienist can hardly even find buildup to clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all these reviewa, I went with this instead of other brand.</li>
            <li> I bought these due to being much cheaper than the sonicare replacements</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble fitting these brush heads onto my sonicare, however once I did get the brush heads on</li>
            <li> They seem a little bit more narrow than Phillip&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not real stiff, but enough</li>
            <li> They are a bit firmer than the overly soft regular Sonicare standard heads.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between these and the far more expensive &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; versions.</li>
            <li> Even with multiple coupons at major retail outlets or on Amazon, just two can cost $30 upwards.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews of other products I&#x27;ve seen are usually stating how low quality those brush heads are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two pros: cheap (will keep as emergency backups) and hard enough to double as a tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> To give you a very brief description of my observations, I can say that the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive is slightly firmer than the Philips Sonicare Sensitive.</li>
            <li> extra* careful to brush gently since the standard brush head irritated a section of my gums.</li>
            <li> Made in the USA can&#x27;t come at the much of a premium, so maybe Phillips will come down on price to in order to justify buying USA-made brush heads.</li>
            <li> Better than the previous generic brushes I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of these brushes yet, but they look exactly like the originals, and the bristles feel as stiff as well.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly like the rip-off official ones - just at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They might be just a very slight bit stiffer bristles than the official Phillips brush head replacement when first used, but within two or three days there is no difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried generics before and was very disappointed, but the Sonimart replacement heads were just as good as the name brand - at a fraction of the cost!!  </li>
            <li> The fit isn&#x27;t quite right--a little tight.</li>
            <li> They are packaged well in a hard plastic package that can be opened &amp; closed easily for storing the extra brushes.  </li>
            <li> They hold their shape well and they seem to be the same composition as the regular Sonicare brushes, but they cost about half as much.</li>
            <li> Durability seems to be fine so far, but the price point of these makes it easier to replace them earlier than the expensive name brand heads.</li>
            <li> In fact, after putting this brush head on, it made a weird sound coming from my tooth brush (with the old head) stop.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these, a bargain at 75% less than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other replacement toothbrushes and the quality of the Sonimart Premium Standard Replacement Toothbrush far surpasses them.  </li>
            <li> After using them for a couple of days - and before I had said anything about mine being too firm - my wife also commented on hers being too firm compared to the original brush heads</li>
            <li> After using them for a couple of days - and before I had said anything about mine being too firm - my wife also commented on hers being too firm compared to the original brush heads</li>
            <li> When these replacement heads came they were professionally packaged and looked like they any other brand name product.</li>
            <li> I knocked off one star due to the fact that I find them just a bit soft.</li>
            <li> When these first arrived, I was a bit skeptical, as these brushes are much softer than the Sonicare ones -</li>
            <li> The Sonicare handle and charger will last a long time, but the brush needs to be replaced regularly.</li>
            <li> The brushes fit tightly and works well with a price much cheaper than the expensive Sonicare brand, even from Costco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used off-brands in the past, and you were always off in quality compared to the original manufacturer, sometimes a little and sometimes a lot.  </li>
            <li> While the actual toothbrush portion of the toothbrush head is effective, and it does work with my Philips Sonicare handle, the head is nearly impossible to remove from the handle.</li>
            <li> So, if you are expecting a brush head that rmoves 6x or 7x as much plaque as ordinary brushing, then this is not the brush head for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the reviews on this are real, I&#x27;m dissapointed and I have never returned anything on amazon before.</li>
            <li> So long as Sonimart maintains their current level of quality, they can consider me a customer for life (or the life of my toothbrush, anyways).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to comment on how long they last before they start to splay out and need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I will buy them from now on as long as the quality remains the same.</li>
            <li> but I have not had it long enough to tell if they all work or not.</li>
            <li> They are softer than the originals, time will tell how long they last</li>
            <li> As claimed,  heads fit properly and work fine on the Sonicare HealthyWhite base I bought recently, for half the price of Sonicare replacmenet heads.</li>
            <li> These are really are as good as the Sonicare brushes; I have purchased generic ones made in China and they were terrible.  </li>
            <li> and you are supposed to do little circles and you do not press hard on to your teeth but lightly . .</li>
            <li> I would attribute this to the fact that the bristles are a little stiffer, though not painfully or excessively so.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packets of 4 heads each for far less than the name brand version would have cost.</li>
            <li> The only gripe that I have is that the head fits too loosely on the stem.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are equal or better than the Sonicare brushes and much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> worked just fine, don&#x27;t know why there so expensive in the store.</li>
            <li> obviously I&#x27;m afraid of swallowing any kind of foreign object.</li>
            <li> But a little too soft for me.</li>
            <li> , they are very similar to the standard head, perhaps a little bit short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll purchase the sensitive in the future, but steer away from the regular brush heads, they were just too hard for me.  </li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;non-official&amp;#34; replacement parts are cheaper, lower in quality and generally disappointing.</li>
            <li> Just aren&#x27;t as comfortable on my teeth/gums as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> When I realized these weren&#x27;t genuine Sonicare brush heads, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> The bizarre contour of the bristles makes brushing difficult</li>
            <li> Cheap as ever and could never tell the difference between these and the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> When I opened the review link it contained a rating and comment allegedly having been publicly posted by me.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes appear identical to those from Philips except for minor color differences.</li>
            <li> Not quite as firm as the Sonicare ones, but considerably cheaper and work just as well.</li>
            <li> but the brissles are so big and so rough</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time,  and makes a difference in tooth whiteness.</li>
            <li> These brush heads I wish I would have found them a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about buying generics because I have been using brand name for so long</li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;m on the first replacement brush from this set, and i am not impressed.</li>
            <li> So I am curious to see how long these last.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive and yet they are better.</li>
            <li> I actually preferred the stiffness of this one (slightly stiffer) to the standard.</li>
            <li> Not falling out, not too stiff or soft.</li>
            <li> Just like the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these brush heads are quite a bit firmer than the original product.</li>
            <li> AND they come with covers for each brush head, unlike other generic replacements for the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other generic toothbrush heads and the bristles would come out while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the same in design or materials as the &amp;#34;Phillips&amp;#34; brand,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fit the motor assembly as tightly as originals; base of first brush detached from shaft (snapped back on).</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare &amp;#34;Clean &amp; White&amp;#34; model a year ago, and it&#x27;s a great toothbrush -- unfortunately, I soon discovered Philips&#x27; replacement heads were a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m sure some will consider this to be a plus, I am very concerned because tooth enamel is rather difficult to rebuild once it is lost (some say impossible), and scrubbing it with too hard of a brush can rub it away rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The instant observation is these Sonismart Premium Standard brush heads are not quite as stiff as the Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> They last just as long at considerably less cost.</li>
            <li> They are small and compact also have soft bristles for the brush.</li>
            <li> 4 out of 5 is above average to me.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re pretty poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bit too hard of bristles for me at first, whereas the Phillips replacements are softer.  </li>
            <li> So I broke down and bought another set of Sonicare branded heads for my HealthyWhite, and will go back to paying through the nose, so that I can rest assured that I have bristles which were meant to be used with a tool of this</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, but hated the ridiculously high priced replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> If I could give an extra half star, I&#x27;d rate a 4.5.</li>
            <li> I think that slight difference perhaps makes a big difference in terms of the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> The big plus is they cost less.</li>
            <li> Same product for half the price.</li>
            <li> When we bought our new Sonicare, the brushes that were included were way to small for my liking!  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the heads feel a bit cheap, but they are definitely less expensive than the name brand Sonicare replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Actually they even feel a little firmer, which I would say is a positive/negative.</li>
            <li> One out of the four pack arrived broken, my head is only a week old and it sits loose on my battery and some bristles have fallen out</li>
            <li> The feel of the bristles is similar to that of the official Sonicare brushes, but the insertion hole is a little loose, as I had it fall out while brushing...but for the price, it&#x27;s still an unbeatable bargain!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brusheads are not too hard or too soft</li>
            <li> Hardly noticable, but if you have sensitive teeth, you may notice.</li>
            <li> They are not too soft or hard.  </li>
            <li> BUT that does not mean it is not a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes worked well just as the original and much less expensive</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads were so much less expensive, I had to give them a try, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Okay maybe not that bad</li>
            <li> but I can tell they will last just as long if not more.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Much harder bristles than the originals, which I like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Completely worth the cost vs the expensive OEM brand name heads.</li>
            <li> The item arrived as es expected.</li>
            <li> not only do they not really fit on the brush</li>
            <li> These worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> so, really no hesitation recommending.</li>
            <li> and then you have to pull more carefully, but it&#x27;s not simple to pull it off by the base.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps anyone who is curious.</li>
            <li> Where I have only been using the product for a few days, I cannot attest to the durability.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding  replacements for my Sonicare locally.  </li>
            <li> Fit on the base, bristles aren&#x27;t shedding, brush is soft.</li>
            <li> They include a nice additional feature of a colored plastic ring to add to the base of the brush to prevent vibration / rattles.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re still kind of crap.</li>
            <li> They are actually slightly softer than the Sonicare heads, which are very stiff when they are new.</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused whether or not they would work in my handle and charger/sanitizer due to the large number of models listed.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s super ridiculous if you ask me - I mean you&#x27;ve already paid $100+ for the toothbrush unit</li>
            <li> These are quite a compromise between hard and soft and still work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> While I never had gum bleeding or anything else, I suddenly realized the other day that I had been using the same brush head since late November</li>
            <li> They do not lose bristles and they have remained stiff after 2 weeks of regular use.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any difference at all, it&#x27;s certainly not commensurate with the difference in price.</li>
            <li> The only slight issue I&#x27;ve had is that the dust cap that covers the bristles grabs slightly tighter than the brush does to the handset.</li>
            <li> but I have a very small mouth for an adult</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for my electric toothbrush are so expensive, that I will not buy another one of the same brand, when I need a new one.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint, shaft hole may be a little deep, causing vibration when pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Although the bristles as a little softer then and it snap-on no as tight as Philips brand but overall a quality replacement.</li>
            <li> In other words, buy these because they work just as well as the ones you buy from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have used other off brand and almost lost my hearing.  </li>
            <li> even though they claim in their company notes and follow up requests, that &amp;#34;We&#x27;re a small, homegrown, American business&amp;#34; .....then make these in China.</li>
            <li> I usually buy original brand replacement brush but they are so expensive that I decided to give these guys a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other generics but they kept coming off while brushing.</li>
            <li> Only wish I had known about these sooner, could&#x27;ve saved a small fortune.</li>
            <li> This will be my go to replacement due to reduced cost and comparable quality.</li>
            <li> heads that ended up not fitting well and actually fell off the handle while I was brushing.  </li>
            <li> I also like that there are 4 in the package because I share the handset with my husband (the usual branded packages only contain 3 replacement heads).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I purchased these</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lower price than other replacements.</li>
            <li> and they are made by a small home grown American business.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten the non-oems for other brushes, and the bristles had a tendency to come out.  </li>
            <li> They seem a little softer (which isn&#x27;t a bad thing) from the OEM version, but for the price I feel I&#x27;m getting the same level of clean from them.</li>
            <li> and they fit to the toothbrush base with the same force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2nd Update: Unfortunately, even the Sonicare sensitive brush heads are not for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying a product that wasn&#x27;t from Philips itself, but after reading the positive reviews for this product, I decided to buy them.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because the original Sonicare replacement heads are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using the other brand the bristles were already worn down as if I&#x27;d been using it for a year.</li>
            <li> The brushes were a little harder than I wanted</li>
            <li> As others, I was contacted by Sonimart with the aim of ensuring customer satisfaction, and obviously in the hopes of getting rid of my negative review.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> Not worth the return shipping...</li>
            <li> Really cannot go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my old brush heads for too long because they are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> The bristles haven&#x27;t even begun to fray or wear down.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend buying these hands down.</li>
            <li> Not cheap like some other knockoff brands.</li>
            <li> I have encountered other supposedly compatible toothbrush heads that did not fit at all.</li>
            <li> Seem to work as well as the OEM tooth brushes at less then half the price.</li>
            <li> They are SLIGHTLY louder than the brand name brush heads, but nothing too noticeable.</li>
            <li> Less than half the price than the name brand.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t support changing a product and thinking you get to keep all the reviews on the previous version.  </li>
            <li> for about half the price.</li>
            <li> I took several packages back to Walmart because they were wrong.</li>
            <li> is when I sit my brush on the counter the head sits at a slight angle which can cause toothpaste to fall</li>
            <li> The brush heads are a bit softer although they are slightly longer</li>
            <li> Besides getting four for about $10 less than three of the name brand, the bristles are softer, and softer has always been recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> And cost less.</li>
            <li> However, there is a slight problem because my husband and I share a sonicare.</li>
            <li> The heads functioned as well as the brand name Sonicare heads that I previously used.  </li>
            <li> Fits the electric toothbrush holder for much less cost than anywhere else searched.  </li>
            <li> Cost is much less than the sonicare brand and work just as well.</li>
            <li> and of course sells for a lot less</li>
            <li> Previous purchase of store brand replacement heads would not stay attached during use.</li>
            <li> Bristles are slightly firmer than the sonicare</li>
            <li> One of the negatives of owning the high quality Philips Sonicare toothbrush is the expensive cost of replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rough with my brushes (usually brush 4 minutes).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth ruining your gums just to save a few bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth ruining your gums just to save a few bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased replacement Sonicare heads for years, every time in Sonicare packaging, but they were always too tight for the handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen comments about other imitation brands regarding packaging and broken brushes and hygene risks due to dirty brushes right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that these would be any good since off brands like this usually got bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was a little bit concerned about the quality of off brand brush heads, but now I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat narrower than brand name brush but not significant.</li>
            <li> They were a little bit louder</li>
            <li> Brushes are a little softer than I like, but they arrived ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li> I also--shocker--rip off the labels from mattresses, so I guess I am a little anti-establishment), and it seems to brush as well.</li>
            <li> I just wish there would have been a little firmer bristle, but that&#x27;s just my preference, so no reason to deduct stars.</li>
            <li> they are a little skinnier than the namebrand replacement</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell, but maybe a little softer than the official brush heads.</li>
            <li> This set came at a real bargain price and I was afraid that would show in its performance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> They firm and work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> since the brushes don&#x27;t mount firmly and without rattling around</li>
            <li> The brushes seem firm to me, but that&#x27;s what I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I have used these heads for my Philips Sonicare for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are about as firm as a month-old DiamondClean head.</li>
            <li> Wanted to get a few weeks into my use of these brushes before reviewing.</li>
            <li> No cheap brittle bristles or peeling plastic.</li>
            <li> They turned out to be poorly designed and had bristles that wore out with only 3 or 4 brushings.  </li>
            <li> For the one person saying it stops moving when pressed against ur teeth , your not supposed to press firmly against your teeth, I used to work at a dental office and we sold electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> loud, but they brush my teeth and aren&#x27;t expensive, so I can deal with a bit of noise for a few minutes per day.</li>
            <li> Half the price, too!</li>
            <li> These are just like the brand name ones, but at half the price!</li>
            <li> at roughly half the cost!  </li>
            <li> They snap right down close to the base and seem to make less noise than the Sonicare did.</li>
            <li> stiff bristles.update</li>
            <li> I just bought a Sonicare and the brush that was shipped seemed a little small.  </li>
            <li> Some time ago I bought some different, less expensive replacements.  </li>
            <li> That being said these aren&#x27;t nearly as bad as some other non-brand replacements which completely fall apart inside a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the quality of these toothbrush heads, as so many of the generics have bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I read existing reviews that have complained about one or both of the previous points.  </li>
            <li> They have lasted just as long as the Sonicare heads and are much less expensive, so I plan on using these from now on.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, as I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with other non-OEM brushes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about not getting actual Sonicare brush heads, but I can&#x27;t even tell the difference with these.</li>
            <li> Rather than spend the small fortune that it costs for Sonicare heads, I decided to give this brand a try.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t like companies that try to trick the public with these lies then build their product in China.</li>
            <li> My gums used to bleed but no more.  </li>
            <li> my sample size is small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that matters or not though.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that these do a cleaning as well as, if not better than, the manufacturer&#x27;s brushes.  </li>
            <li> These generic replacement brushes work just as well as the expensive Philips sonic brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus: Includes small plastic (rings)</li>
            <li> No more overpaying in the stores...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had our handle for a while now, and are past the warranty.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brushes for the past week</li>
            <li> These Sonimart replacement brush heads are virtually the same as the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> These have the metal disk in the base and the shaft is stiff enough to allow the brush to oscillate properly.  </li>
            <li> , continue looking; these are very firm and don&#x27;t have a lot of give.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small complaint, because it doesn&#x27;t render the head unusable.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about getting these &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34;, reviews of other off brands were very poor.</li>
            <li> Shocked at how expensive the brand name ones were and had trouble finding the right size in the stores .</li>
            <li> Very stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering these from now on since they are so well made and cost at least 60% less!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like hard bristles, then these are not for you.  </li>
            <li> I have cringed every time I have to get new heads for my Soniccare, and I&#x27;ve tried a few other generics, but they were terrible.  </li>
            <li> These work just as well as the Phillips and for close to 1/4 the price (at least when I purchases).</li>
            <li> No more will I spend almost $50 on 4 replacements!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to repeatedly trim bristles that come loose from the base, and some of them have come loose in my mouth while brushing -</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where these came in, for half the price of the three heads offered Phillips, you get 4 replacement heads, which also include different colored rings for the base in case</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have received a bad batch - but after using the brush head one time - the bristles are starting coming out in my mouth while using my toothbrush - not good.  </li>
            <li> you have purchased the poorly made and functioning brushes offered through Amazon in the past like I have, these are NOTHING like them.  </li>
            <li> After trying a different generic brand of replacement heads that were HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> and it was so much less expensive than the ones at Costco.</li>
            <li> I did experience one of the heads coming apart when I tried to take it off the base, however I popped it back on and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them since.</li>
            <li> The cost of replacing the heads are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare brushes would vibrate badly in their last month.</li>
            <li> not a good feeling at all.</li>
            <li> but a few of the brushes were useless.</li>
            <li> I was so sick of paying big bucks for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The brush heads were too hard and seemed to make my Sonicare vibrate so hard it was difficult to brush with.  </li>
            <li> Never ever use hard or even medium bristles!</li>
            <li> These were less expensive, are quiet on the base, work well along the gum-line</li>
            <li> The toothbrush fits tightly onto the base, other replacement brands I have purchased have fallen off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried &amp;#34;offbrand&amp;#34; brush replacements before, but they were usually very hard bristles.  </li>
            <li> I found a dead moth inside the bottom of one of the brush heads!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of non-brand toothbrush heads, and these certainly aren&#x27;t the worst, but they&#x27;re nowhere close to being equivalent to the Samsung brand variety.</li>
            <li> They come with a package if different color rings that snap onto the base of the brush unit for identifying who&#x27;s is who&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would not fit, but they do.  </li>
            <li> Decided to give these a shot after I got tired of paying $$$ for the OEM ones.</li>
            <li> at least every 4-6 weeks, so it gets expensive to use the brand name heads.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m having to write a relatively negative review for these, but read on, because you may not share my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not great as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Have had bad experience purchased from other vendors.</li>
            <li> That is not always the case as I have bought generic replacement heads in the past that have been horrible!</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, so the wrong size toothbrush can get very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> they are just like the name brand Sonicare replacement heads just way less expensive!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this for a fraction of the price as the name brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried using generic brush heads before and they were just terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical after trying out generic clarisonic brush heads by another vendor that were terrible.  </li>
            <li> Product performs as well as the expensive name brand.  </li>
            <li> works well considering all these heads  are way too expensive - OEM and these.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t hesitate to give these a try; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads, though, seemed almost prohibitively expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find an affordable replacement for sonicare  brush heads, which seem to be quite expensive.</li>
            <li> They are not perfect, though.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare replacement tooth brush heads are insanely expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when you go to pull this head off, it comes apart at the bottom disk.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong by making this purchase...</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly, never has any issues.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this buy.</li>
            <li> Bought fake sonicare replacement heads on Amazon before so I decided to try these instead.</li>
            <li> Sonicare replacements tend toward the expensive side, so I thought that I would give these a try.  </li>
            <li> Fits perfectly, no issues.  </li>
            <li> think these aren&#x27;t bad, but they&#x27;re not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought generic replacement heads before, and they have lost bristles and vibrated off of the base when brushing teeth, those were awful.  </li>
            <li> Very dishonest sonimart or toothco, whoever you are!?!?</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive buying these as I&#x27;ve had terrible luck with store brands in the past.</li>
            <li> Beats the heck out of spending the fortune the Phillips knuckleheads want to charge for a silly brush head!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to discern a difference between these and the ProResult heads.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> (Maybe we got a bad batch?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> (Maybe we got a bad batch?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> You should try them, don&#x27;t think you would be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both use them and we can attest that it works just as well as the expensive Sonicare brushes!!</li>
            <li> So, when you go to remove the cap, you pull the brush off the base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of putting my thumb around the base of the brush to keep it connected to the handset while I remove the cap.</li>
            <li> I take it withe traveling, and don&#x27;t need the charging base.</li>
            <li> annoying</li>
            <li> My SONICARE GOES BAD IN ABOUT A MONTH!!!</li>
            <li> these are TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Disgusting!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> Disgusting!  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brushes arrived promptly.  I haven&#x27;t used one yet, but I checked them out (fit one on my toothbrush): looks good.&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Seem to work as well as the OEM tooth brushes at less then half the price.</li>
            <li> Great product, just like more expensive brands. Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> The best generics I have found! Quiet and smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really good quality so far. Will most probably buy them again.</li>
            <li> In other words, buy these because they work just as well as the ones you buy from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for the name brand great price point.</li>
            <li> They make a good product and stand by their product.  They integrate will with the sonicare toothbrush system at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> As claimed,  heads fit properly and work fine on the Sonicare HealthyWhite base I bought recently, for half the price of Sonicare replacmenet heads.</li>
            <li> Just like the real thing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about not getting actual Sonicare brush heads, but I can&#x27;t even tell the difference with these. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not quite as nice as the name brand ones, but do the job.</li>
            <li> glad to have extra brushes.</li>
            <li> Works great and appears to perform just like the original.</li>
            <li> Rather than spend the small fortune that it costs for Sonicare heads, I decided to give this brand a try. Replacement head fits perfectly and the bristles are just right (somewhere between medium and soft). I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the name brand but a good cheap alternative</li>
            <li> Works great with our soniccare</li>
            <li> Have used the toothbrushes for about a week. They firm and work well. Great value!</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly in my Sonicare.  I don&#x27;t even realize they are not made by Sonicare.  Excellent alternative for a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Identical to the manufacturer&#x27;s product.  Highly recommend and we will be buying these again in the future.</li>
            <li> I think these are better than the brush that comes with the unit.</li>
            <li> Not as soft bristles but they work just fine for my needs. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this for a fraction of the price as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Good, prompt service.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a clear plastic cap with with each brush. A bit softer bristles than the original Phillips products but OK. I was prompted by an e-mail to write a review for my recent purchase. When I opened the review link it contained a rating and comment allegedly having been publicly posted by me. I have no recollection of having done so! It used words and grammar that are not like my writing style; so I have revised accordingly.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and works as well if not better than original products.  I will be reordering these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have purchased the poorly made and functioning brushes offered through Amazon in the past like I have, these are NOTHING like them.  These have the metal disk in the base and the shaft is stiff enough to allow the brush to oscillate properly.  The brush bristles are comfortable and leave your teeth feeling clean.  They come with a package if different color rings that snap onto the base of the brush unit for identifying who&#x27;s is who&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice replacement. I really like that it has a secure lock ring so that it won&#x27;t fall off easily. And the color rings are also nice accessories. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought the tooth brush and replacement tips for it, recommended to my by my new dentist.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is the product does a much better job cleaning your teeth all over.&lt;br /&gt;And one very important issue is that the tooth brush messages the gums and makes them healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I did not get a great check up because we had not been to the dentist in years.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Sonicare tooth brush for a month we went back and got a clean bill of health regarding our gums !&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with how clean it got our teeth I bought another one for my son, and sent it to him.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all of my friends !&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Brian</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too picky about my brush heads. These replacements fit on my sonicare 2 plaque control just fine and seem to work pretty well. Well worth the price, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works just like the Philips ones... Only much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Seem to be good quality replacements, and fit on the little pegs on the charger (unlike other generic brands I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t). Not the cheapest replacements out there, but I think the slightly higher price is fair for the better quality of the product.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly! I actually like them better than the Sonicare ones! They are slightly smaller and softer. Fantastic value!</li>
            <li> Not bad feels like the real thing</li>
            <li> These are just like the Sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li> Fits right, can&#x27;t tell any difference from the name brand. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much difference between these and the authentic Sonicare toothbrush replacement heads, other than tat they are a third of the price.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes worked well just as the original and much less expensive</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order off brand heads but they fit and work perfectly, at a huge savings!</li>
            <li> Started using one of these about a week ago and so far I am very pleased. The heads clip on to the Sonimart body (there appears to a slight gap between the head and the body which doesn&#x27;t affect their use) and they appear to be  of suitable stiffness, which hasn&#x27;t changed over the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> Sonimart is an awesome company.  They sent me a two packaged sample of SONICARE, THEN the same with SONIMART!  I LOVE Sonimart!  I&#x27;m rough with my brushes (usually brush 4 minutes).  My SONICARE GOES BAD IN ABOUT A MONTH!!! MY SONIMART LAST ALMOST MORE THEN TWO MONTHS.  And for people that day they are loud... I see no difference.  I have used other off brand and almost lost my hearing.  This company had the best customer service and this will be my new toothbrush head!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by these brush heads.  They do not lose bristles and they have remained stiff after 2 weeks of regular use.  I have tried using generic brush heads before and they were just terrible.  I was paying upwards of ten dollars a piece for the brand name brush heads.  These work just as well for a tiny fraction of the price.  They are SLIGHTLY louder than the brand name brush heads, but nothing too noticeable. I will continue buying these brush heads from now on, the value of them is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Phillips sonicare and love them! They are just the same as name brand but even better because its way cheaper!</li>
            <li> These are great.  I was skeptical after trying out generic clarisonic brush heads by another vendor that were terrible.  I would definitely buy these again.  They seem just like the name brand.</li>
            <li> Great product. Looks, feels, and works just as good as the Philips brand toothbrush heads. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The Sonicmart Toothbrush heads work just as well as the Sonicare brand I use to buy, but much cheaper ($10.95). The packaging was clean and undamaged as well, which isn&#x27;t always the case with other generics.</li>
            <li> After trying a different generic brand of replacement heads that were HORRIBLE I swore I would only buy name brand. Well, I stumbled upon these when going to make my purchase and with so many positive reviews I decided to try once more, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose since they were so cheap. I&#x27;m so glad I did; these are amazing! After a week of using the other brand the bristles were already worn down as if I&#x27;d been using it for a year. I&#x27;m on week three of the Sonimart and it&#x27;s still as good as the first time I used it. I will definitely keep using these and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Appears to be the right item.  Order was filled promptly, and arrived promptly.  Best price I could find, but still not inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I bought these for our Sonicare 2 Series Toothbrush, Plaque Control model.  These heads fits perfectly.  The plastic is well constructed.  The bristles are very good - neither to stiff or soft.  The color bands are a nice touch in situations with multiple toothbrushes to differentiate whose is whose.  The head is holding up great and assume we&#x27;d get several months use per replacement.  Very happy with the quality and the cost.</li>
            <li> Excellent low cost alternative to the Phillips brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> Bottom line:  they works as well as the Sonicare.  I&#x27;ve used off-brands in the past, and you were always off in quality compared to the original manufacturer, sometimes a little and sometimes a lot.  These are the first replacements I&#x27;ve seen that match the originals.  And the price is so much better, of course.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as expected.  Wish they were made in the U.S.A. instead of communist China, but oh well.</li>
            <li> Is it exactly the same as the Philips replacement heads? No. Is the Philips version worth $6 more per replacement brush head? Heck no. This one works just fine. The bristles feel comparable, and thus far seem to be holding up as well. The one gripe I have is that it doesn&#x27;t fit as snugly as the Philips version, but that doesn&#x27;t cause any real issues for me. As some reviewers pointed out, this might be a bit noisier, but I find this brush noisy regardless.  It&#x27;s vibrating around in your head... kind of hard to avoid the noise in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re super particular or noise sensitive, or if you can afford the price difference, maybe go with the real deal. I was happy with this slightly more budget-friendly option. I can&#x27;t see spending 1/3 the price of a new toothbrush every time I want to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> We used these to replace the ProResults heads. They appear to work great. We&#x27;ve had them for several weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any issues. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out, they fit the toothbrush well, and my teeth feel clean. What else do you need?</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Quality of the brush heads was very comparable to the Sonicare brand. They fit properly too.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with out new oral care toothbrush! I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price! Received as quickly as Chinese food!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for my Sonicare toothbrush.  I was a bit confused whether or not they would work in my handle and charger/sanitizer due to the large number of models listed.  The worked great in my handle which has HX6930 stamped on the bottom and the charger/sanitizer (model HX6150) I recently purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement brush heads for the Phillips.  Much harder bristles than the originals, which I like.  If you don&#x27;t like hard bristles, then these are not for you.  Fit on the toothbrush is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than the original brush heads. And it is fit for HX6530, I bought 4 4-pack befor I came to my mother land</li>
            <li> These seem to be high quality replacements very similar to the official proresults brushes.  I&#x27;m very happy with the one I&#x27;ve used so far - my only regret (and it&#x27;s probably my fault) is that the bristles seem like they may be a bit stiffer than the official bristles - so next time I&#x27;ll be ordering the soft/sensitive Sonimarts rather than these.  Even so, for the price of these I can afford to learn that lesson and still come out ahead fairly quickly.  If the soft version is as high-quality as these are, I&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li> One of the negatives of owning the high quality Philips Sonicare toothbrush is the expensive cost of replacement brush heads. Even with multiple coupons at major retail outlets or on Amazon, just two can cost $30 upwards. Sonimart is a fabulous solution. I bought 2 packets of 4 heads each for far less than the name brand version would have cost. I waited until I have used these for at least a month to tell you that they fit my model perfectly, and work well. The bristles might be a little harder than the originals that came with my toothbrush, but you can compensate by brushing more gently. I am totally satisfied and recommend these replacement heads as a really cost effective alternative. So I&#x27;m happy with both the brush itself and these replacements.</li>
            <li> Great replacement brush heads, and an awesome price too! I hope they&#x27;re still available when I need to order some again.</li>
            <li> A month in and we are pleased. Exceeds expectations. Great value!</li>
            <li> We ordered based on other user&#x27;s reviews and are most pleased. Quality appears to be the same as original equipment.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I was told not to buy these because if they aren&#x27;t sonicare heads, they are going to buzz loudly and not be good quality.  I beg to differ.  These are great.  Less than half the price than the name brand.  Definitely glad I got this instead.</li>
            <li> These work great, they are very similar to the standard head, perhaps a little bit short. These will be my go to head replacements!</li>
            <li> The price is nice but over time they tend to fall off easily.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads were so much less expensive, I had to give them a try, and I was not disappointed. As frequently as you need to replace the heads, I can&#x27;t see spending $$$$ when I can spend $$.</li>
            <li> cant beat the price, works just as well as sonicare</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with these replacements.  I was afraid they would not fit, but they do.  To me, they brush as well as my original brushheads.  I will purchase them again and recommend them to friends.</li>
            <li> Just like the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the quality to be this great but it is.  Buy these.  They are very affordable and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Good product that performs well....even though they claim in their company notes and follow up requests, that &amp;#34;We&#x27;re a small, homegrown, American business&amp;#34; .....then make these in China. Sorry, I don&#x27;t like companies that try to trick the public with these lies then build their product in China.</li>
            <li> I was wary about purchasing an off brand replacement head for my Sonicare but after making the jump I can say I am very happy I did. These are great quality and I notice no difference from the original head the brush came with.  No reason spending huge amounts on name brand replacements when you can save with these! You won&#x27;t regret giving them a try!</li>
            <li> Brushes were as good as advertised. Very pleased with them and hoping they last awhile.</li>
            <li> As good as original brushes and for the price these are an easy choice.  I like the color coded rings so my wife and I have a easy way to tell our brushes apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, product changed.  Word is they are cheaper quality.  Wouldn&#x27;t know because it&#x27;s not what I bought but I can&#x27;t support changing a product and thinking you get to keep all the reviews on the previous version.  That&#x27;s not how this works.  Very dishonest sonimart or toothco, whoever you are!?!?</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the cost of these brushes since my grandson wears them out very quickly because of his braces</li>
            <li> Fabulous replacement and much cheaper than the name-brand replacement heads. It fits perfectly, isn&#x27;t loose and brushes just like the original.</li>
            <li> These work perfect with our sonicare pro. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and saved a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t perform as well but my fears were unfounded.  Definitely earned a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original at a cheaper price.  Would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.  Great replacement.  Perfect price!</li>
            <li> Fit my sonic care toothbrush correctly, and had good firm bristles. Much lower cost per head that the Phillips versions, and the quality level is as good if not better. I will continue to order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Just like originals, fits perfect, cleans as well. So good I&#x27;m buying the soft bristles to try out. Btw, you only need soft bristles, they clean plaques just as well while not abrading your enamel so hard. Never ever use hard or even medium bristles!</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush. My teeth feel so much better after using it. And the price for brush heads on online makes the purchase well worth it compared to anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I did not realize these were after-market replacement heads, I thought they were the real deal from SoniCare and initially was a bit bummed out but I thought I would try them.  I actually like them better.  They fit perfectly and have a better feel on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Brush heads for days &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Good product, works just as good as original heads that came with it and great pricing.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, for perfect. Not cheap like some other knockoff brands. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes worked perfectly. They performed as well as the original Sonicare replacements at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and exactly as advertised. Been using Sonicare sonic toothbrush for about 15 years. I was an early user, recommended by dentist when I had significant plaque buildup and gum disease. Using a Sonicare toothbrush every night and a WaterPik machine, over the course of two years, my gum disease completely disappeared. When I go for a cleaning now, the hygienist can hardly even find buildup to clean. My gums used to bleed but no more.  This is a fine product and this supplier fills their orders with new merchandise the same as you would buy in a store. Saved me from the loss of teeth. I&#x27;m 68 and have clean, healthy gums and teeth in good condition -- considering a lifetime of poor dental care before the year 2000 wake up call. I especially like this new Sonicare toothbrush model. The old model used to get mold if I didn&#x27;t constantly clean and dry it, but this one requires practically no care at all, except replacing the heads, which all toothbrushes require.</li>
            <li> These are great high quality replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;non-official&amp;#34; replacement parts are cheaper, lower in quality and generally disappointing. The Sonimart product was cheaper, what seems to be equal quality to the originals and not disappointing at all. They arrived on time and  professionally packaged. Great product, indeed.</li>
            <li> Work great, just like they say they do. Good quality too.</li>
            <li> love these replacement brushes. maybe better or just as good than original. Fits HX6910</li>
            <li> Very good. better than the brand name/logo that came with Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Fit my Sonic just right.</li>
            <li> I usually buy original brand replacement brush but they are so expensive that I decided to give these guys a try and I don&#x27;t regret it a bit it&#x27;s a very good product very close if not as good as original. Keep it up</li>
            <li> I bought these with some misgivings.  They were too inexpensive.  Turns out, they were great.  Will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads!!  I&#x27;ve bought generic replacement heads before, and they have lost bristles and vibrated off of the base when brushing teeth, those were awful.  But these are perfect - a fraction of the cost and just as good of quality!</li>
            <li> UPDATE (July 11, 2015):  Surprised to see only 9 out of 15 finding this review helpful. Hopefully the following update will help. As others, I was contacted by Sonimart with the aim of ensuring customer satisfaction, and obviously in the hopes of getting rid of my negative review. I can fully understand that, and really appreciate their efforts to ensure customer satisfaction, as you will see below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they did was to send me two new sets of brush heads - free of charge. One set was the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive brush heads, the other was the Philips Sonicare Sensitive brush heads. To give you a very brief description of my observations, I can say that the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive is slightly firmer than the Philips Sonicare Sensitive. While the Philips Sonicare Sensitive is a bit too soft for my taste, the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive is actually perfect! I love these brush heads and am just about to order some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while my review of the original Sonimart Standard brush heads hasn&#x27;t changed - I still think they&#x27;re too firm - I am very impressed that Sonimart went the extra mile and actually offered me the opportunity to test theirs and Philips&#x27; softer brush heads free of charge. I would say that the Sonimart Ultra Soft Sensitive are a little bit softer than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads, but they clean even better than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads in my case. So it&#x27;s a win-win, where I save money and protect my gums, while getting even cleaner teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to upgrade my rating to 3 out of 5 in recognition of their amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these after all the many great reviews, thinking they would be more or less the same as the original Sonicare brushheads. Unfortunately, these brush heads are quite a bit firmer than the original product. So much so, that my gums would feel &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; after brushing. I haven&#x27;t experienced that with the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had actually bought two sets: The normal sized brush heads for me, and some of the compact brush heads for my wife. After using them for a couple of days - and before I had said anything about mine being too firm - my wife also commented on hers being too firm compared to the original brush heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad these didn&#x27;t work out. They seem to be about the same structural quality as the original brush heads, except being far too firm for my liking. (Maybe we got a bad batch?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Sonimart were to release a softer version, which better compares to the original, I would consider trying those out. For now though, we will stick to the original brush heads - it&#x27;s not worth ruining your gums just to save a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up returning the brush heads to Amazon, who gave us a full refund, no questions asked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Forgot to mention that Sonimart sent me an email to encourage me to write a review.at with the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had actually bought two sets: The normal sized brush heads for me, and some of the compact brush heads for my wife.

            <li> These heads are as close to the Sonicare brand as possible. I&#x27;ve had plenty of the cheap imitators and this far surpasses them.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week. Works perfect. Grea, economical substitue.</li>
            <li> We like using the electric dental care brushes.  I hope we can continue to get replacement toothbrush heads!  Wouldn&#x27;t go back to the handheld brush!!!!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes seem to work and feel better particularly along the gum line than the originals.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these replacement brushes.  They are no different than the name brand as far as I can tell, so far.  I&#x27;ve been using them a few weeks now.  Maybe they won&#x27;t last as long as the much higher priced ones - only time will tell.  But even if they don&#x27;t last as long - it&#x27;s still a better buy!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality and value of these over the phillips brand.  WIll keep purchasing there replacements.</li>
            <li> Very good replacement toothbrush head. They work great.</li>
            <li> Fits my ProResults perfectly! Great alternative to the overpriced Sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re toothbrush heads. They fit my brush.</li>
            <li> Tons cheaper then name brand and seem just as good</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between these and the ones I was paying twice as much for from Phillips.</li>
            <li> Have only used them a few times, but seem to be good quality so far, and waaaay cheaper than the originals!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product, can not tell the difference between these and the name brand brushes.  Happy with the price as well, makes it so much more affordable to use a sonicare without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes seem to be of very good quality for a fraction of a cost of the name brand. Very pleased so far and the wife approves too!</li>
            <li> My wife loves changes these every 3 months. Worth their price from Amazon!</li>
            <li> These are as good as the original ones! I am glad I bought them. The original ones cost so much more and do exactly the same job.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the quality of these brush heads. They work just as well as the much more expensive heads and fit perfectly. Try them and save!</li>
            <li> Brother really uses them With Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> No complaints. Better value than original brush heads. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Work great.  Awesome inexpensive alternative to the sonicare heads. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the Phillips and for close to 1/4 the price (at least when I purchases). If Phillips thinks they have a captive audience, they had better think again, because these generic brush heads are great. My only problem is that they are made in China, whereas the actual Phillips brush heads are made in the USA. Made in the USA can&#x27;t come at the much of a premium, so maybe Phillips will come down on price to in order to justify buying USA-made brush heads.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the quality of a third-party brush head and how well it would fit.  These were a perfect fit with Sonicare HealthyWhite HX6750 brush system I bought from costco.  Bristles are nice and firm and well attached.  Very happy with the product and the price!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are surprisingly good quality. Not quite the same as the name brand but similar enough. They hold up well and do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. I will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit fine and the bristles are comfortable.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads work just as well as the original one.  Great to have one stand and so many replacement heads to place on it, multiple users for one single stand.</li>
            <li> Great Buy.  I would have preferred if they came in a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; version.&lt;br /&gt;Company seems to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;Rare for a product that competes with an original manufacturer in a monopolising position.</li>
            <li> These seem better than the originals.  They are a bit firmer than the overly soft regular Sonicare standard heads.  They seem to last longer and fit the brush very well.  High quality + low price&#x3D;high value.</li>
            <li> Decided to give these a shot after I got tired of paying $$$ for the OEM ones. They seem a little softer (which isn&#x27;t a bad thing) from the OEM version, but for the price I feel I&#x27;m getting the same level of clean from them.</li>
            <li> So Glad !  you had these replacement brushes for my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush fits tightly onto the base, other replacement brands I have purchased have fallen off.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are not to soft and don&#x27;t break off while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;They are a great value and alternative for name brand heads.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as the real ones, no difference at all , very satisfied, and you get more for your money,</li>
            <li> Not too terribly impressed - main thing that sticks out is that the brush is not as firm as Sonicare brushes....its like when you are trying to clean a stain out of the carpet and you are using your finger instead of an actual brush. Plus they still rattle like the sonicare brushes do, which I throw in as a design fault by Sonicare....since the brushes don&#x27;t mount firmly and without rattling around</li>
            <li> The heads fit my Sonitrol electric toothbrush as specified.  Great price and delivery.</li>
            <li> Good price for quality brush head replacements, better price than BJ&#x27;s. Good deal, thanks.</li>
            <li> Why pay $32 (retail) for four when you can get the same quality product for a much better price?&lt;br /&gt;I love my Sonicare - I have the Diamond Clean. But why should I pay $8-$11 apiece for brush heads? That&#x27;s super ridiculous if you ask me - I mean you&#x27;ve already paid $100+ for the toothbrush unit alone!&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve sifted through the knock offs - the ones that are so soft they basically do nothing, the ones that fall apart right in your mouth, the ones that don&#x27;t fit correctly. And then I stumbled upon this one. The positive reviews ARE TRUE. These are fantastic! They&#x27;re just like the brand name ones without the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying these exclusively from now on.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a soft brush though, continue looking; these are very firm and don&#x27;t have a lot of give.</li>
            <li> Great off brand alternatives, why pay more than you have to for something that works just as good? There should be more alternatives too all goods and these are a perfect example of saving money by trying an off brand.</li>
            <li> Better than the previous generic brushes I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  These also work on our HX6530 model.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks and it feels just like the original brush. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Sonicare HX6511/50</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend twice as much on the brand name. These are just as good and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> These were great especially for the price.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These heads are just as good as the one that came with my toothbrush, but for a fraction of the cost of the name brand replacement heads. I had picked up my electric toothbrush around Christmas time, I picked one up for my brother and figured I&#x27;d get myself one too, then after a couple of months I noticed the color start to wear away on the bristles indicating the time to get a new head. So while I was out running errands I figured I&#x27;d drop into a bestbuy and check out the heads, $30 for three replacement heads!?!?!?!?!?! Talk about price gouging, and they weren&#x27;t all that much better even here on amazon. That&#x27;s where these came in, for half the price of the three heads offered Phillips, you get 4 replacement heads, which also include different colored rings for the base in case multiple people use the same tooth brush. Save yourself some money, and get these.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the original brush head that came with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These will work just fine; however, based on all the other reviews I was hoping that they&#x27;d be about the same as the real deal SoniCare heads.  They are a little smaller and overall seem ok so far.  Next time I will buy the Sonicares.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought, very satisfied. Just as same as the Philips&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit concerned about the quality of off brand brush heads, but now I&#x27;m sold.  These Sonimart brush heads are great and a whole lot cheaper.  I will buy only these from now on when I need new ones.</li>
            <li> These are a great price and fir perfectly with our sonicare toothbrushes. Also, it&#x27;s cheaper than buying replacements at places like Costco.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought, very satisfied. Just as same as the Philips</li>
            <li> Quality product that delivers what it promises. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my sonicare flexcare 900+. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> The price is right and they certainly look the same though I&#x27;m sorry to say we have not yet given them a try. Will report back when we do.</li>
            <li> Works as we&#x27;ll as the original at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Fit great in the toothbrush, the bristles aren&#x27;t hard, and they are a great size.  I have a small mouth, so the wrong size toothbrush can get very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the original</li>
            <li> Better than the real Sonicare brush heads!</li>
            <li> Honestly better than the name brand.  These ones are soft and dont hurt my gums.  THe other ones leave my teeth feeling etra sensitive and these are really nice.  Plus its 1/4 of the price!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying a product that wasn&#x27;t from Philips itself, but after reading the positive reviews for this product, I decided to buy them. When these replacement heads came they were professionally packaged and looked like they any other brand name product. The heads work great - perhaps even better than the head that originally came with my Sonicare. I would attribute this to the fact that the bristles are a little stiffer, though not painfully or excessively so. If anything it just feels like a better quality build, and a better clean. Once these wear out, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back for more.</li>
            <li> I though i&#x27;ll give thsee a try and it turned out to be as good as the Philips brand. Although the bristles as a little softer then and it snap-on no as tight as Philips brand but overall a quality replacement. Thanks to all these reviewa, I went with this instead of other brand.</li>
            <li> First time user of this product and so far, after 1st month, find these brushes comparable to the Sonicare brand in how they wear.  They include a nice additional feature of a colored plastic ring to add to the base of the brush to prevent vibration / rattles.  My Sonicare brushes would vibrate badly in their last month. The price is really excellent.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time,  was exactly what I expected and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used only one and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Great value using for sonics care diamond clean without a problem. They fit well..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  These brushes are great. I cannot tell a different in the ones that came with my brush and these. I will definitely order again</li>
            <li> As good as the original, but at half the price. Our order was delivered in record time! As soon as I hit the order button the doorbell rang. My wife and I exchanged glances. Peering through the glass in the door, I saw standing there before me, a man dressed all in brown. As I opened the door, he thrust a box into my outstretched hand. &amp;#34;Go,&amp;#34; he said. &amp;#34;May your teeth be cleaned for a reasonable price.&amp;#34; Then he disappeared, as I knew my plaque and unsightly tartar buildup soon would.</li>
            <li> Great value great price</li>
            <li> These are every bit as good as the Sonicare replacement heads. for about half the price.</li>
            <li> they fit great, can hardly tell the difference with the sonicare brand</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 3 weeks, and they work just like the name brand brush heads on my Sonicare FlexCare+ (HX6950 model).</li>
            <li> These are better than the one that came with the brush originally!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for original Sonicare brushes at a fraction of the cost.  As good as the brushes that came with the toothbrush.  I highly recommend these without reservation</li>
            <li> basically very well; worth the price. fits my Philips Sonicare HX6511/50</li>
            <li> These are good for the price for sure, although I have noticed that they drop a bristle here and there in your mouth when brushing that the sonicare brand doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great quality at good price.</li>
            <li> I had been using an Oral B rechargeable that had seen better days and was in need of replacement.  Having heard good things about this one, however, I decided to give it a try - and now love it, hands down, better.  It was a worthy investment and I will be sticking with the brand for a long, long time to come.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes appear identical to those from Philips except for minor color differences. Very good quality. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Comparable quality for a fraction of the price. Bristles are stiffer than the Sonicare brand, but otherwise very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t pay much for these and they splay out within 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The Sonimart replacements are as good or better than the OEM brushes. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fit the motor assembly as tightly as originals; base of first brush detached from shaft (snapped back on). Concerned that the &amp;#34;slop&amp;#34; in the linkage is wasting motion that should be scrubbing teeth.</li>
            <li> It... cleans... good.</li>
            <li> I like supprt new company. Don&#x27;t ask me why, it&#x27;s my hobby.</li>
            <li> perfect and just as promised!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with our SonicCare toothbrush bases.</li>
            <li> Received these toothbrush heads last week.  They fit the base perfectly, even better than the original head.  I&#x27;ll order them again when I need more.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these are at least as nice as the name brand replacements, which are FAR more expensive. I was leery of knock-offs and some sellers seemed sketchy to me, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on these.</li>
            <li> Great generic replacement head for my sonicare toothbrush. I&#x27;ve ordered other generics but they kept coming off while brushing. These are just as good as the name brand and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I took several packages back to Walmart because they were wrong. The packages don&#x27;t show you the fitting. I was so glad to find someone who showed and described what they looked like. My toothbrush has no number as it is old. I&#x27;m using them. They fit the slot correctly and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> Better than the original brushes that came with the product!</li>
            <li> So far I am living these Sonimart replacement brushes. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between these Sonicare&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good product and it was delivered on time</li>
            <li> My husband says it does an excellent job of cleaning his teeth. He is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as I was hoping for a cheaper alternative to the Phillips heads and I am very happy with my decision to buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative i have found with these is when I sit my brush on the counter the head sits at a slight angle which can cause toothpaste to fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely worth the cost vs the expensive OEM brand name heads.</li>
            <li> I switched to Sonicare toothbrushes a couple of years ago.  I have been very happy with mine. These new replacement brushes work well and clean perfectly.  And they are so easy to replace on the toothbrush.  That in itself is a major plus.  I like using Sonicare.  I recommend it and thee replacement brushes highly to anyone who is interested in switching to a battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They are what they seem to be... i.e. replacement brushes that are much cheaper than the brand name versions. What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s all good.  Quick delivery and toothbrushes seem to work fine.  Great to be able to get them at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. The brushes seem firm to me, but that&#x27;s what I like. I would recommend to anyone wanting to save some money off the manufactures (Sonicare) product brushes.</li>
            <li> Great value and great price! I purchased replacements for my Sonicare and I would buy from them again! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These brushes are well made and function just like the original.</li>
            <li> Product performs as well as the expensive name brand.  Only wish I had known about these sooner, could&#x27;ve saved a small fortune.</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads. Better than other generics I have tried.</li>
            <li> The sonimart repacement brushheads seem to be equal to the original manufacturers and at a big discount!&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for competion.</li>
            <li> I grabbed these because they were far cheaper than the namebrand brush heads. I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the brush head that came with my Sonicare Flexcare Plus, which I think is great.. So long as Sonimart maintains their current level of quality, they can consider me a customer for life (or the life of my toothbrush, anyways).</li>
            <li> These are very nice and affordable replacement heads for the Sonicare toothbrush system and seem to be just as good as the more expensive ones.  They all begin to show wear in about the same amount of use so with these you can afford to replace them even more often and that is great for your teeth. This company seems to take an interest in their customers and that means a lot to me as well.</li>
            <li> Product works well. Certainly better priced. Equal to originals. Good shipping time.</li>
            <li> these and they work like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered - fast shipping. I cannot find a difference from those made by Philips - except these are cheaper. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Sinicare brand.I am surprisingly very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that these wouldn&#x27;t fit my original Sonic Care, but they fit perfectly! And they are an excellent bargain compared to the &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; heads. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> They fit my brush perfectly, are a fraction of the cost of name-brand replacements and come with a convenient colored circle which lets my husband mark his brush head.  An excellent buy,</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Sonimart replacement heads. I have always purchased the Philips brand, but saw the positive reviews and gave them a try. They are excellent quality at a great price. I will continue to buy replacement heads from Sonimart.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, good value</li>
            <li> There is brown material that looks like piece of ceiling fell onto the toothbrush head before the clear head cover was pushed onto it.  Initially I thought is was a smashed bug like a large flea.  Upon examination the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; looked more like fibers.  This was on one head of the four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items seems to be OK otherwise.  My advice - sanitize the heads before putting them in your mouth!</li>
            <li> Fits my sonicare, works fine, great price.</li>
            <li> Works well with my sonicare platinum diamond clean toothbrush</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not quite a nice as the Sonicare replacement heads, but they&#x27;re pretty good.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  I have had no problems whatsoever and the bristles are sturdy.</li>
            <li> Its good, works as advertised.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Work just as good as the original brushes but at a lower price.  Economical way to use a great toothbrush, I&#x27;ll be re-ordering these when i need new brush heads</li>
            <li> Good alternative to the ungodly expensive Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> Solid replacement for my Sonicare toothbrush.  Fits great,  does its job.  The brush heads are a bit softer although they are slightly longer so I think it balances out well.  Solid buy.</li>
            <li> they fit and work great. plus the price is much cheaper than store</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not buy replacement brush heads for my Sonicare Plaque Control 2 series toothbrush at the super-duper discount store at $30 for 6! I got a way better deal shopping on Amazon &amp; finding these replacement brush heads ofr less than half the price!!!&lt;br /&gt; They fit perfectly &amp; do a great job cleaning my teeth, I hope, they are still available when I need more!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Great replacement for the Philips Sonicare HX6910. Fits perfectly.  Will definitely buy these again.  Works like advertised.  Pricing is great.</li>
            <li> Good quality replacement.  Fits well and works as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I think these work great!  I&#x27;ve been using one for a few weeks now and it seems just as good as the original that came with my Sonicare toothbrush, and I only paid a fraction of the price of the official Sonicare replacement brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush since the New Year and it seems to work just as well as the Phillips OEM head for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Great product - great price - thank you!</li>
            <li> I was somewhat leery of purchasing these replacement heads for my Philips sonacare toothbrush because they were priced so much lower than the Diamond Clean heads. It&#x27;s so easy to get burned. I read rave &#x27;re views and against the advice of my son, I ordered them. Besides getting four for about $10 less than three of the name brand, the bristles are softer, and softer has always been recommended by my dentist. I&#x27;m thrilled that I made such a great purchase. Now I&#x27;m telling my son he should make the switch!</li>
            <li> Best replacement brushes on market!</li>
            <li> I have used these heads for my Philips Sonicare for a few weeks now.  These looks and feel to be of the same quality as the genuine Philips brush heads.  They fit tight and work very well.  I am please with this purchase and will purchase these again!</li>
            <li> This is a quality replacement tooth brush head for the Philips sonicare.  So far I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly as the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Great off brand version. Brush head is a bit flimsy so I assume I&#x27;ll go through them a bit more quickly but it fits the toothbrush like a glove. It comes with color exchangers as well so if you share the toothbrush with another person you know which head is yours.  Exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> Just like an actual sonicare brush head! Will definitely be buying this product again and again. Sonicare sort of has a monopoly on the ultrasonic toothbrush and it&#x27;s awesome to be able to get an off brand replacement head without having to pay for the Sonicare brand name.</li>
            <li> great service.  The item arrived as es expected.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly like the rip-off official ones - just at a reasonable price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought these to go with the Philips Sonicare, and they fit perfectly and are are a cost-effective solution to buying name brand toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND they&#x27;re American made!!</li>
            <li> These are an identical replacement and compare favorably to Philips ProResults HX6013/64. Identical no, but effectiveness and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what we are talking about here, is on par. From shaft rigidity to the stiffness of the bristles. It&#x27;s impossible to discern a difference between these and the ProResult heads. Be aware these are not Diamond Clean HX6063/64  replacement heads but the softer ProResult head. I hope Sonimart copies the Diamond Clean heads. These are an amazing replacement and worth risking. I would also like to add that this company stands beside the product and more than guarantee satisfaction. If you like the softer ProResult heads these are the way to go. Great company too.</li>
            <li> I received the right toothbrush refill very quickly. I am quite impressed with their services.</li>
            <li> These are great!  They fit perfectly on the handle and the bristles are nice and soft so they get between the teeth well.</li>
            <li> Very good replacement for the original.  Works as advertised.  Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads feel like the original heads from Phillips! I can&#x27;t tell the difference, and my toothbrush feels like new.</li>
            <li> Great product, most generic Sonicare heads are terrible quality... These are as good as the originals. Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> Fits my son&#x27;s Sonicare ProResults electric brush perfectly. Great price.</li>
            <li> I just bought a Sonicare and the brush that was shipped seemed a little small.  Luckily the replacement brushes are a little larger and they seem to get in between the teeth a lot better I feel.  Also, they have a wear indicator on the brush to tell you when you need to replace, so that&#x27;s nice.  Shipped quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase. But the brush head does have a little more &amp;#34;wiggle room&amp;#34; than the original head.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and appears to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> A great replacement for the Philips heads at a great savings</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quick delivery of my Amazon order and more than satisfied with the use of my new&lt;br /&gt;series 5 Philips Sonicare Healthy White rechargeable sonic toothbrush.  H. Feltman</li>
            <li> They do the job and are an excellent price. I will definitely buy these again because they work and are a great value. Very glad to find them.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far. Somewhat narrower than brand name brush but not significant. No problem with fit, so far.</li>
            <li> No difference with the original Sonicare, works well with my Philips Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;m on the first replacement brush from this set, and i am not impressed. maybe it&#x27;s a flaw with the particular head that i&#x27;m using (which would be a 25% FAIL even if all the other brushes are perfect), but with each use so far, a bristle comes off and floats around in my mouth as i clean my teeth. not a good feeling at all. would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Holy cow are these tooth brush heads great! I&#x27;ll be purchasing my replacements from here going forward! So happy I tried them!</li>
            <li> Not quite as firm as the Sonicare ones, but considerably cheaper and work just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these a month or so but they fit my brush handle perfectly and seem to work great. I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to comment on how long they last before they start to splay out and need to be replaced. At this point, I have no issues or problems with them. I&#x27;m just glad to find fair pricing as I feel the toothbrush manufactures really gouge us on brush replacements.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Using these with a sonicare diamond care. These totally work fine but they&#x27;re pretty poorly constructed.  The one I&#x27;m using comes apart every time I take it off (it pops back together fairly easily) and it gets stuck on the handle and requires some force to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $3 a head I think they&#x27;re worth it but they&#x27;re still kind of crap.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly with my sonicare</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit quite well on our Diamond Care Sonic Care brush.  I like the colored rings that come with them to identify certain children&#x27;s brushes.  The price ROCKS!  Shipping and packaging were great and we will order again.&lt;br /&gt;  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great service.</li>
            <li> These are as good or better than the much more expensive OEM brushes. I was pleasantly surprised, as I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with other non-OEM brushes.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit with my Sonicare and a fraction of the cost of the brand name replacements.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m delighted to have a less expensive alternative that works perfectly. Thanks for all the online reviews. They were very helpful in selecting this company and product.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit to my Sonicare toothbrush - better than original!</li>
            <li> These seem to work just fine. Best price I could find.</li>
            <li> These brushes perform as well as OEM. Good fit and finish. Comfortable bristle firmness. Good value. If I could give an extra half star, I&#x27;d rate a 4.5. The only slight issue I&#x27;ve had is that the dust cap that covers the bristles grabs slightly tighter than the brush does to the handset. So, when you go to remove the cap, you pull the brush off the base. I&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of putting my thumb around the base of the brush to keep it connected to the handset while I remove the cap. It&#x27;s possible that this is an anomaly with the first brush out of the box, but this small issue is the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star rating. All said, I&#x27;ll buy these again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  Perfect replacement brushes!</li>
            <li> Product duplicates the more expense Sonicare brushes.  Seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> Just as good as standard brushes for any electronic toothbrush. Haven&#x27;t had any problems and they were delivered on-time.</li>
            <li> My replacement brushes came quite promptly after purchase, they were packed well to ensure their safe arrival and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the pricing! I am overall a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet. They were a good price but not the same brush head as on my Platinum set. Gave them a 4 star on price.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly - delivered exactly on time. Wish they would also make the smaller head!</li>
            <li> These heads fit perfectly on my Sonicare Flexcare.  I&#x27;ve been using the same head for a month now, twice a day on the &amp;#34;Max Care&amp;#34; setting. The bristles haven&#x27;t even begun to fray or wear down.  I am beyond pleased with the value of this product so far.</li>
            <li> These are really are as good as the Sonicare brushes; I have purchased generic ones made in China and they were terrible.  These are great.  They hold their shape well and they seem to be the same composition as the regular Sonicare brushes, but they cost about half as much.</li>
            <li> Best of generics-comp. to brand!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely fabulous.  Feels great on my gums and cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> As described. Worked great and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Great quality product and excellent value. Very happy with this purchase and saved tons of money too!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are as good as the new brushes.  I have been using them for 3 months and they are just fine.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Heads perfectly fit my Bright White Sonic Toothbrush. Much cheaper than the Phillips heads. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. As described.</li>
            <li> Wonderful..perfect replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Way better than the other generic brand I ordered from Amazon before!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between these and the far more expensive &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; versions.</li>
            <li> The skinny:&lt;br /&gt;1. The bristles are about as firm as a month-old DiamondClean head. These are not the supersoft brushes you&#x27;ll get from most cheap aftermarket suppliers&lt;br /&gt;2. The size is exactly the same as the factory version. Fitment onto the handle is perfect. Length is perfect. No issues at all&lt;br /&gt;3. These are the high quality aftermarket brush heads you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li> Works great with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> seem like a very good product.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel the same.  The brush-head vibrates the same way attached to the brush.  Before purchasing, I read existing reviews that have complained about one or both of the previous points.  Granted my sample size is small but so far I have used one for a month now and I have no complaints as of yet.  This will be my go to replacement due to reduced cost and comparable quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the heads feel a bit cheap, but they are definitely less expensive than the name brand Sonicare replacement heads.  A bit of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for here&amp;#34;, but the brush heads after a month of use still hold up great!  Just aren&#x27;t as comfortable on my teeth/gums as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Product is good. I didn&#x27;t realize these head are not made by sonicare, but the quality seems good. The different color rubber gasket set is a nice touch. My wife can take the 2 year old hair tie off and we can still tell them apart.</li>
            <li> When I realized these weren&#x27;t genuine Sonicare brush heads, I was skeptical.  After using for a few weeks, I think I like them better.  Not only do they work, they actually go on and off the brush head easier.</li>
            <li> So close to the name brand, these really surprised me.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering these again!  Half the price, too!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought these for the low price, but these are great!  I wouldn&amp;#34;&amp;#34;t hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> These fantastic little brush heads are a great product for the price that you pay. I can honestly say that I cannot tell a difference between the manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads and these heads. I&#x27;ve gone through two of the manufacturer&#x27;s heads and I am now on my second head from this Sonimart Replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging that these heads come in can be a little frustrating, but once you access these magical plaque killers you&#x27;ll be glad you bought them. These heads operate the exact same way as the manufacturer&#x27;s heads at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the originals</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mom. She says they work great!</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Philips heads, but at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love our Sonicare toothrbrushes, but she always thought that the heads were too soft. This is a perfect fit for Sonicare and the heads are a bit more firm, which she likes. They have lasted just as long as the Sonicare heads and are much less expensive, so I plan on using these from now on.</li>
            <li> They work great at a fraction of the price of some other sellers. I just had a periodontal checkup, and my teeth, and gums are in excellent shape. I have used these heads for a month now and they are the same quality as the one that came with my Plaque Control Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Just like the name brand, but at a fantastic discount!</li>
            <li> not much to say, they work fine.</li>
            <li> 10 star! can&#x27;t tell the differ from the market brand!!</li>
            <li> It is a good replacement, but way cheaper than the actual Philips sonimart</li>
            <li> Seem to be just as good as the brand-name Sonicare heads but substantially less in price.</li>
            <li> Not quite as stiff as Sonicare replacements, but lovely for the price.</li>
            <li> These are ok but not as good as the Sonicare ones.</li>
            <li> Walking through Costco and had pretty much this same product in my cart but it was the brand name. Just checked on Amazon really quick and found this option and it was so much less expensive than the ones at Costco. To me they feel exactly the same and have lasted just as long. No more will I spend almost $50 on 4 replacements!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality! As good or better than Philips.....</li>
            <li> I  purchased these replacement brush heads for our Sonicare toothbrushes.  I have been pleasantly surprised by their quality.  I thought for the price, the product would be cheap.  Not true.  It is very close to original manufacturer quality.  The only gripe that I have is that the head fits too loosely on the stem.  The notch is too big.  Otherwise, I intend to purchase additional brush heads from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> Order arrived early and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Work great - much higher quality than another generic head I tried previously.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a lot softer than the DiamondClean ones from Sonicare.  I&#x27;m not sure that matters or not though.  I&#x27;ve always heard to use soft brushes, so maybe this is fine.  I don&#x27;t think it makes a big difference in the end.  They&#x27;re definitely cheaper, so we&#x27;ll likely stick with these.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than brand name and a little more expensive than some cheap knock offs I&#x27;ve seen. The cheap ones get soft really quick and do not hold up well. These are on par with the brand name ones that are about $10 a head at a fraction of that cost.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Shipped quickly.  Easy set up.  Certainly an improvement over the older models we owned.</li>
            <li> as good as the phillips ones</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does....works well at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> works well considering all these heads  are way too expensive - OEM and these.  Works on kids&#x27; version and adult.</li>
            <li> Wanted to get a few weeks into my use of these brushes before reviewing. I honestly cannot tell the difference beyween the SonimRt brushes and OEM Philips brushes, which I have used daily for more than five years. I highly recommend these without reservation.</li>
            <li> These heads fit my sonicare toothbrush as well or better than the original one.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  There are 5 of us in the family, and now Grandma, making 6.  Let me tell you, that&#x27;s a lot of toothbrush heads.  I&#x27;ve always grumbled about the cost of the brush heads and probably haven&#x27;t changed them as much as I should have.  But now, I am so thrilled to find an affordable way to keep my family in fresh toothbrush heads that I will probably buy these forever!  I&#x27;m happy that they are made in America, and they work every bit as well as the original ones.  Please don&#x27;t hesitate to give these a try; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Great value for an OEM quality replacement at only a portion of the original manufactures product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just as well--looks the same as--the originals and replacements from Phillips.  And cost less.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. They&#x27;re a little stiffer than the original perhaps, but not excessively so. I&#x27;ll buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Fairly close to original.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush heads - I like them better than the ones made by Sonicare and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> These are great and are very inexpensive to the name brand. Great deal and great product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do much more than agree with most everyone who says this is a good company and a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping they were a quality product and was amazed- just as good if not better than the Phillips brushes! I have already repurchased them!!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads  are just as good as the high priced Phillips heads at half the price.  We have also ordered other Sonimart brush products and found them to be fantastic. We&#x27;ll never buy another brand.  I highly recommend these Sonimart products.</li>
            <li> awesome toothbrush head replacements. while there&#x27;s an obvious difference compared to the original sonicare (the cap from sonicare doesn&#x27;t fit these heads, but each brush comes with its own cap anyways), there&#x27;s no reduction in quality. my teeth feel so nice and clean!</li>
            <li> Great brush heads, great price. Fit my Sonicare perfect.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I ordered these brush heads. They work perfectly on my diamond clean brush, and are great value for money, being a fraction of the cost of the sonicare heads. I will definitely be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price great buy.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure these would work as well as the originals but they do!  I replace my brush head at least every 4-6 weeks, so it gets expensive to use the brand name heads.  I tried these and they work great!</li>
            <li> They work well! Good price</li>
            <li> Great value for the replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Great quality and value.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my Flex toothbrush perfectly for half the cost of the name brand ones plus they arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for quality replacement heads at a reasonable price!! I have finally found them!! High quality at an affordable price!!</li>

            <li> Very satisfied and impressed with these sonicare knock off brush heads.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues with bristles falling out etc.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Better the the ones from Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - Verypleased!</li>
            <li> Be aware It comes with smaller size brush head. It is noisier than my last one. But you get use to it. Overall good value. Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. I did my research before buying and knew the reviews were the great for Sonimart Replacement toothbrushes. Company &amp; Product lived up to it&#x27;s reputation. And was Prime-eligible!</li>
            <li> Great price and great replacement heads works just as well as the name brand</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrushes are shaped slightly different than my original toothbrush but fit perfectly and are a nice substitute at a much better price. I was concerned that they would be harder than the original but they are just fine. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  Just as good as the OEM product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with these heads.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a month. They are slightly smaller than the name brand heads but fit fine and brush as well as the much more expensive ones.  I can afford to change brushes much more often now.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Every bit as good as expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference between these and much-higher-priced brands.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the brand name but much more affordable</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my original Sonicare perfectly.  Great quality and good packaging.  I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same quality as the brand name, but definitely a great alternative! This is a really excellent savings!! Will definitely be buying these again.</li>
            <li> love it, better than original</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Sonicare. No cheap brittle bristles or peeling plastic. Quality is on par with brand name and at 1/2 the cost! I plan to buy again next year</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads work great!  The bristles are long and soft and the increased area compared to the stock toothbrush head is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Excellent fit and work great.</li>
            <li> Sonimart Premium Standard  Replacement heads are Great!! They lived up to my expectations in every way! They are small and compact also have soft bristles for the brush. Which is recommended from our dentist. The price  is so much more economical than other brushes too!! Knowing they are made in the USA is also a great plus!! Its a win win in my book! Thank you Sonimart!! Im glad I tried these! We will buy more!</li>
            <li> Very impressed.  Thought I&#x27;d have to spend so much money replacing toothbrush heads for a family of five. Thank goodness for this product. Cannot tell the difference as they are virtually identical. Cleans teeth as well as the brand name. Awesome savings!!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush heads! It&#x27;s like I just went to the dentist after every brushing!</li>
            <li> Needs to come with metal ring as well</li>
            <li> fits fine as replacement, works as well as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;, as best as I can tell...</li>
            <li> When we bought our new Sonicare, the brushes that were included were way to small for my liking!  I found these replacements on Amazon and they were delivered in two days.  Much, much better!!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better then the sonicare brushes. Good price great product!</li>
            <li> Perfect match for the Philips Sonicare toothbrush, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES HAVE BEEN OUT FOR YEARS but the Sonicare system is awesome and the best I have ever tried.  Keep up the great work..</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; good quality! Was concerned they might not work as well or be as nice as the expensive sonicare brushes, but we gave them a try and are very happy we did.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> these are TERRIBLE. not only do they not really fit on the brush but the brissles are so big and so rough they tear up your mouth completely.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive buying these as I&#x27;ve had terrible luck with store brands in the past. After reading the Amazon reviews, I was willing to give it a try and I sure am happy I did. I&#x27;m never going back to the name brand brush heads again - the quality of these are just as good and saving a ton of money is always nice too :)</li>
            <li> Having finally gotten an electric toothbrush, I have actually enjoyed using it.  Replacement heads, though, seemed almost prohibitively expensive.  This set came at a real bargain price and I was afraid that would show in its performance.  In fact, however, they fit perfectly, work just as well as the original, and came with clear information about determining when to replace.  Pleased with purchase, would replace again with this company.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been in the market for cheap replacement brushes for over a year. I&#x27;ve been trying to find an affordable replacement for sonicare  brush heads, which seem to be quite expensive. Most of the reviews of other products I&#x27;ve seen are usually stating how low quality those brush heads are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads, on the contrary, are fantastic! First and foremost, they are much cheaper than the official sonicare, at about half the cost (if not a little less). They also seem to work as well as the real product, if not a little better. In fact, after putting this brush head on, it made a weird sound coming from my tooth brush (with the old head) stop. It also seems to use high quality materials, as the brush heads feel nice and there is a metal ring where the brush head contacts the handle. I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference from the officially branded brush heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;-works well&lt;br /&gt;-high quality materials&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not the official product</li>
            <li> Product was as described. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference between the official Phillips Sonicare products (they seem to perform just as well as them), but there&#x27;s definitely a difference in price. Will absolutely continue to buy these in the future whenever I need replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; product as advertised</li>
            <li> I have used my first Sonimart replacement brush head now for over a month.  So far I cannot tell the difference between this brush and the OEM (Sonicare) brushes.  The feel while brushing is excellent.  The bristles are all still straight and true so it is wearing well.  My teeth feel clean after brushing.  The Sonimart brushes appear to be just as good as the Sonicare brushes but are significantly cheaper.  I can&#x27;t think of any negatives.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  As described and works great.</li>
            <li> They were ok. At first they were soft but then they became ultra soft very quickly. I would say they&#x27;re close to the original sonicare brushes but break down maybe %50 faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s worth buying extras and going through more heads.</li>
            <li> It is nice and cheap. After a few days of experiencing with it, it fits with my teeth and makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them yet as I am still using my last original sonic care head, so I can&#x27;t give an honest review. What I can tell, just by looking at them, they are not  as substantial or for lack of a better term &amp;#34;beefy&amp;#34; as the original sonic care heads. I am giving 3 stars because of the low price. Time will tell if I reorder or not.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality! These are just like the brand name ones, but at half the price! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are decent brushes for the Sonicare brush handle. I knocked off one star due to the fact that I find them just a bit soft. The original Sonicare brushes are stiffer. That being said, these brushes do the job and at a MUCH lower price than the Sonicare replacement brushes. Once used to them, these are fine. I will probably buy them again.</li>
            <li> Customer service flawless. Order handled without issue and arrived on or prior to stated delivery date. Product appears to have the same if not better integrity and quality of that of the orginal manufacturer with significant cost savings.</li>
            <li> Was even better than what the picture shows. It&#x27;s perfect will definitely purchase again from vendor.</li>
            <li> These brushes are equal or better than the Sonicare brushes and much less expensive.  They work fine.</li>
            <li> works great on my new sonicare brush. great value!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a steal.  I&#x27;ve been buying/using DiamondClean heads which run about $25 a pair.  I was a bit reluctant at first due to the price and the fact that I&#x27;ve purchased other &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; heads that ended up not fitting well and actually fell off the handle while I was brushing.  Based on other positive reviews, I decided to give these a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I got 4 of these for about $15, while 4 DiamondClean heads would&#x27;ve cost me closer to $50.  These brushes are a bit softer than the DiamondClean heads (which I actually find to be a bit too hard), but they&#x27;re more than sufficient to give a really good cleaning.  Better yet, they fit like a glove.  No worries at all with the brush falling off while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for not knowing the Sonicare model # I have, but I&#x27;m hoping the fact that I&#x27;ve used DiamondClean heads is enough information for anyone interested in getting great brush heads and an incredibly low price.  I will wholeheartedly be buying these and only these from now on.</li>
            <li> These are a little different than the stock replacements, but I think they clean just as good.  I have not had any problems with them coming off or shredding.</li>
            <li> These Sonicare replacement heads seem to be just as good as those made by Philips. They last just as long at considerably less cost. They are actually slightly softer than the Sonicare heads, which are very stiff when they are new.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality product, which surprised me. I would recommend this over the more expensive Philips own brand replacement heads anytime. You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be ordering these again. Great value and a great product. In fact, my gums are pretty sensitive so these are actually even a bit better for me than the heads the brush came with.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads at a great price, did not notice any difference between these and the expensive manufacture replacement heads.</li>
            <li> They fit well and work well so far, no problems with extra noise and the bristle firmness is good. Quite happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The price is great for these replacement toothbrush heads and I am very pleased with them.  I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat weary of buying a different type of brush head for my Sonicare Toothbrush, but must say I was pleasantly surprised! These brush heads are even better than the name brand brusheads at a fraction of the cost. My items were shipped fast and well packed.&lt;br /&gt;These brusheads are not too hard or too soft they are perfect and wear well. I will be ordering more to keep them stocked up for my family.&lt;br /&gt;Try them, your teeth will thank you.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and seems as good as the ones that cost twice as much</li>
            <li> Used these for a couple of days, so far so good.  WAY cheaper than the Philips equivalents and they even fit my base better than the genuine product!</li>
            <li> Brushes fit but do not know about color change with use</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, performed as well as the original at a fair price. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Great value, works just fine. I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the ones from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve eve used. We love it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased non-Sonicare brush heads before and they were very noisy.  NOT the same quality as real Sonicare brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;That said, these Sonimart replacement heads seem identical in every way to the Sonicare, except the price.  I was very impressed.  I will buy them from now on as long as the quality remains the same.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Works with my current sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great value and decent quality-what s not to like?</li>
            <li> excellent replacement brush !</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare! It&#x27;s not my first one. They are absolutely THE best toothbrushes on the market. My dentist can&#x27;t get over how healthy my gum tissue is (55) and he thinks I floss religiously. (Rarely) It&#x27;s all because of Sonicare. I&#x27;ve gotten most of my friends using this toothbrush and loy a L to the brand as well. My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean without it. It holds a charge for a long time,  and makes a difference in tooth whiteness. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without one. I take it withe traveling, and don&#x27;t need the charging base. Great customer service from this seller. I&#x27;d give ten starts if i could.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on my Phillips Sonicare and the price is much cheaper than the original replacement from Phillips. I&#x27;m defenitely pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Work as well as the original. Arrived on time &amp; well packaged. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best replacement heads I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Seems to work great and very fast shipment!</li>
            <li> I was AMAZED at the quality of these replacement heads!!  I&#x27;ve tried generics before and was very disappointed, but the Sonimart replacement heads were just as good as the name brand - at a fraction of the cost!!  Now I can afford to replace my toothbrush heads every 3 months - as recommended by the American Dental Association!  An excellent product that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fit right on my Sonic, Puckett split and just as nice as brand name. Superb value! Pleased</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy the replacement brushes because they were so much more affordable compared to the original Sonicare cost. Well,much to my delight they fit my Sonicare  brush perfectly and my teeth look just as good as they did with the brand name</li>
            <li> Great product! works better than Sonicare heads. Can&#x27;t beat the price. You keep making them and I&#x27;ll keep buying them. Go with this seller.  A PLUS++++++++++++</li>
            <li> very good price, delivery quick and product is just as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Work great with Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes for my Sonic Diamond clean. So reasonably priced. Thanks for fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. Works just as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Had some concerns about this product but when I shared that with the manufacturer, they replied promptly and resolved all issues, I could not be happier. This turns out to be a great product, if not better than original brand and it is a great price... Go for it</li>
            <li> My wife  loves this type tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and is as described. It fits perfectly in my Soniccare system and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> These heads work great!</li>
            <li> Good price and perfectly flawless transaction!</li>
            <li> Great service and fast shipping. Would definitely recommend and I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> I really wanted Sonimart to be good as I&#x27;m not crazy about paying triple the price for these replacement brushes. But I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m really satisfied w/ these generic brushes.  The connection just isn&#x27;t perfect between my Sonicare and these Sonimart heads.  I think that slight difference perhaps makes a big difference in terms of the vibrations.  Bottom line being my teeth just don&#x27;t get as clean using these generic brushes.  And isn&#x27;t that the whole point of having a Sonicare?  I think it&#x27;s like driving a Porsche but having the used tires from a Pinto.  Okay maybe not that bad but you get my point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about 4 weeks now, and I&#x27;ve found that they may even be superior to the brushes that came with my Sonicare Series 2 Electric Toothbrush.  When these first arrived, I was a bit skeptical, as these brushes are much softer than the Sonicare ones - but I&#x27;ve found that these do a cleaning as well as, if not better than, the manufacturer&#x27;s brushes.  And the cost savings, of course, are excellent.</li>
            <li> Sonicare quality without the high price.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Phillips Sonicare.  A quality prodoct at a great price</li>
            <li> We love this product. I can tell no difference at all from the over priced name brand item. I will be ordering these from now on since they are so well made and cost at least 60% less!!</li>
            <li> Looks and works just as well as the Sonicare brand - great value, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for... and they work great!</li>
            <li> I am surprised! These replacements heads work great but was amazes me, and what I was not expecting is that they are lasting longer than the originals. Much less expensive and yet they are better. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Wow!  I was surprised.  These work beautifully on my Philips Sonicare at a fraction the cost.  I&#x27;m hooked.  The brush heads clean very well.  I will be purchasing these again &amp; again.  HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Good product at a fair price</li>
            <li> First replacement brushes that work and that I&#x27;d actually buy again. Almost too strong but I&#x27;d take that over weaker ones. Get em and stick it to Phillips and they&#x27;re overpriced replacements.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the same as the original.</li>
            <li> very good replacement product, work as well as the original and a little bit harder , which i found nicer&lt;br /&gt;well packed and arrived fast&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 5 STARS+++</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes for my handle. Quick delivery. Great price. Will reorder when these need replacement.</li>
            <li> Bristles are softer.  My teeth don&#x27;t get as clean as with the brand name.  You can&#x27;t beat the price, though.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Much better value than original.</li>
            <li> Quite comparable to the (overpriced) brush heads from Sonicare. Will purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Working perfectly and great deal. I also like that there are 4 in the package because I share the handset with my husband (the usual branded packages only contain 3 replacement heads).</li>
            <li> better/ softer  than the original</li>
            <li> Great brush heads and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Seems to have similar quality to the much more expensive brand name ones.  They also come with color coded rings so if you have more than one toothbrush you can tell which is yours.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of the product, the price, and the prompt delivery.  I will order more!</li>
            <li> softer than the originals but work fine</li>
            <li> Seems like a solid deal on replacement brush heads.  They fit snug and are a good size.</li>
            <li> Seems as good as the original Phillips toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used up until now.. Very happy with them &amp; with the service from the seller. I&#x27;ll be buying these from now on!</li>
            <li> wrks as well as the original at a fraction of the price.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the compact model</li>
            <li> fits better than name brand, works just as excellently</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m having to write a relatively negative review for these, but read on, because you may not share my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrived in usual Amazon time, and fit on my HealthyWhite Sonicare with no problems. They were a little bit louder/vibratey when using them, than the Sonicare branded ones I&#x27;ve been using since I bought the brush, but I could easily abide that, given the price difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t like these, is because I don&#x27;t trust them to be gentle enough. While I never had gum bleeding or anything else, I suddenly realized the other day that I had been using the same brush head since late November (it&#x27;s now mid-April as I write this), and have not noticed ANY diminution of hardness in the bristles. I also checked the &amp;#34;indicator&amp;#34; (blue color) bristles, and they are not showing any wear or fading at all. I can usually get 4,  maybe 5 months out of a Sonicare-branded head, but by the end of that time, I&#x27;m really noticing that my teeth are not feeling as clean after brushing. I swear the bristles on this one feel the same as the day I started using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m sure some will consider this to be a plus, I am very concerned because tooth enamel is rather difficult to rebuild once it is lost (some say impossible), and scrubbing it with too hard of a brush can rub it away rather quickly. Given the speed and mechanics of how Sonicare brushes work, I imagine this effect would only be amplified. So I broke down and bought another set of Sonicare branded heads for my HealthyWhite, and will go back to paying through the nose, so that I can rest assured that I have bristles which were meant to be used with a tool of this power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________UPDATE________&lt;br /&gt;After submitting this review, I received a package in the mail from Sonimart. I was not expecting this, because I had not contacted them directly, only left the above review here. In the package, they included a package of their Extra Soft brush heads for my model of toothbrush, as well as a package of Sonicare branded extra soft brush heads.  So once the head from the set I bought runs out its natural life, I will be testing out Sonimart&#x27;s extra soft version of this brush head, and reporting back. Good to know that this company takes its customers feedback to heart!my model of toothbrush, as well as a package of Sonicare branded extra soft brush heads.  So once the head from the set I bought runs out its natural life, I will be testing out Sonimart&#x27;s extra soft version of this brush head, and reporting back. Good to know that this company takes its customers feedback to heart!</li>
            <li> Product is as described...fits our EasyClean perfectly...will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, and really excellent customer service. If you prefer softer brush heads, they also make those too. They are called Sonimart Premium Ultra Soft Sensitive Replacement Toothbrush Heads.</li>
            <li> These generic replacement brushes work just as well as the expensive Philips sonic brand.  I have been using the diamond brushes that cost twice as much.  The bristles are soft on this model.  I run my sonic on the highest speed yet these brushes feel gentle and soft on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are great value and I would recommend buying this brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> Delivery On time and exellent quality</li>
            <li> The instant observation is these Sonismart Premium Standard brush heads are not quite as stiff as the Sonicare brushes. However, this doesn&#x27;t seem to affect how clean my teeth feel.  Softer heads are probably better for enamel preservation anyway. They come nicely packaged with the rubber rings and clear plastic brush covers just like the originals come with. For the difference in price, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought these replacement toothbrush heads for my Philips Sonicare. They fit perfectly, do a great job and I saved money!</li>
            <li> These are superb!  I am thrilled to have found this product.  In every way they are perfect.  The day I received them I tested one side by side with a new Phillips brush head of the exact same size and type.  I could tell no difference.  They might be just a very slight bit stiffer bristles than the official Phillips brush head replacement when first used, but within two or three days there is no difference.  And this just may be my imagination.  They are that close.  What a great deal for these.  I am now using that same first new brush head from Sonimart, along with the other new one from Phillips and switching off every day.  I really can&#x27;t tell a difference, and will without a doubt be purchasing these from Sonimart from now on.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is!</li>
            <li> work even better then the ones the unit came with!</li>
            <li> They work well and fit my Sonicare, but they are pretty stiff at first. Otherwise, great price, so I can&#x27;t complain much!</li>
            <li> The Sonimart toothbrushes are far superior to the Sonicare ones.  They do a much better job of cleaning and keep their shape.  The sonicare brushes would start making noises due to the retaining ring breaking free and would not clean well or last more than a month.  The Sonimart toothbrushes have none of these problems.  The big plus is they cost less.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Fit my sonicare toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great service getting everything quickly with follow up to ensure we were satisfied. Item itself is as it should be. good quality. The whole toothbrush system gives amazing results with us having less cavities than ever.</li>
            <li> A month in the heads seem to last well enough. No problems so far, will probably order again in a year or two when I need more!</li>
            <li> Have been using these for a while now and seem of good quality. I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but with so many good reviews I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. The brushes work great and are less money than the name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> They work fine &amp; the price is right. Bristles do come off while in use. Once I replaced that brush head the new one seems to work just as well as the OEM brush heads, for a fraction of the cost. I will say that their customer service is awesome! They contacted me after the original review and sent me a replacement even though I hadn&#x27;t asked for a refund. I will do business with them again.</li>
            <li> Love these, well worth the price and gentle enough that I don&#x27;t need the original over priced ones.</li>
            <li> Works as well and lasts as long as Philips brand, at much lower price.</li>
            <li> Brushes are a little softer than I like, but they arrived ahead of schedule.  5 stars for service. Much appreciated!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertized, at a good price, shipment arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Very good brush if you like a softer brush. The price is very good and fits as good as a sonic brush.</li>
            <li> worked perfect, fit perfect, winner!!</li>
            <li> The Sonimart replacement tooth brush heads seem to me indistiguishable from the Sonicare brushes - except for the price!  Some time ago I bought some different, less expensive replacements.  They turned out to be poorly designed and had bristles that wore out with only 3 or 4 brushings.  The Sonimart replacement brushes are nothing like that and I&#x27;ll continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I bought cheap replacement brushes on Amazon a while back and they were a waste of money as they did not stay secure in the holder. Not so with these, they are perfect, absolutely satisfied with these brushes!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and quality product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that these would be any good since off brands like this usually got bad reviews.  I was so glad when these showed up and after using them for a few weeks they are doing great.  They aren&#x27;t falling apart and my teeth feel fresh and clean after every use.  This is definitely a great money saver</li>
            <li> The work great on our pro-white models</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It works just like the original, and so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good not too soft</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are a great value AND they come with covers for each brush head, unlike other generic replacements for the Sonicare. Having those clear plastic head covers makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> A lot less money for an excellent product. I&#x27;ve found my toothbrush &amp;#34;supplier. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great value and product performs as advertised.  I will continue to purchase these replacements in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this head for about three weeks and am very happy with the quality. Fit and finish is top shelf...so, really no hesitation recommending.</li>
            <li> They will do the job for the price.</li>
            <li> A quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and well made heads. Should work fine.</li>
            <li> A huge savings compared to the Sonicare brand, and these brushes (after 3 weeks) work just as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price &amp; fast shipping for a quality product!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I purchased these but the price was excellent and the reviews were mostly positive.  So far they have been a great replacement brush head.  They are working exactly the way that the original heads did.  They are not any noisier and there is no extra vibration.  I like that they came with colored bands to differentiate them as well.  The brush pattern is simpler than what shipped with the toothbrush but these are actually softer and we like them better.  I highly recommend buying them to replace your OEM Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> If you use Sonicare, get these replacement heads.They are identical to the original equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win for your teeth, and, a win for your wallet.</li>
            <li> These are quality replacements for my Sonicare. Not as good as the Diamond Sonicare brushes I was using before but overall very good and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Excellent Original Manufacturers Item Replacement - works just as well as the original for half the price.</li>
            <li> The item arrived well packaged, slightly different from he Philips product, but pretty good nonetheless. The brush looks like the original item and the lettering (different from the &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34;) is in he same font so a cursory exam will likely fool you. It says something else. Anyhow, I slipped it on the stem of the device and it fit well, no looseness or anything. The brush head feels no different by hand or when used in the mouth. The length of the bristles are the same as is the pattern (btw, I don&#x27;t really think the pattern--some tall, some short--really make a huge difference; also, I don&#x27;t change them every 3 months as the &amp;#34;dentists&amp;#34; recommend. I also--shocker--rip off the labels from mattresses, so I guess I am a little anti-establishment), and it seems to brush as well. So, all in all, this is a great knock off but very inexpensive. Go for it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the brand name brush heads. If there&#x27;s any difference at all, it&#x27;s certainly not commensurate with the difference in price. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for weeks now.  They work great in my sonicare.  I feel like they&#x27;re lasting longer than the more expensive sonicare brand heads.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Shipping prompt</li>
            <li> great!  Same product for half the price.</li>
            <li> Good price and my teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> These are great brushes without having to pay for name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> Price and quality very good.  No Problems.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaging was fine. Not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but when removing the toothbrush head, the whole top comes off. So far has happened to 2 of the 4 brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Updated review. Sonimart was very quick to respond to my separated brush heads and sent out a new set. I received and have been using for two days without issue. Thanks Sonimart</li>
            <li> These brush heads are not made of the same plastic material as the Sonicare. The vibration that carries up through the bristles is weak compared to the original brand. Ordered Sonicare Brush heads and threw these away.</li>
            <li> Perfect, fits correct, price great, received on time.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great, so-far, replacement brush head.</li>
            <li> I found a dead moth inside the bottom of one of the brush heads!!! Disgusting!</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrush heads because they are strong enough to remove placque where other brands are too soft to do this.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have received a bad batch - but after using the brush head one time - the bristles are starting coming out in my mouth while using my toothbrush - not good.  Not worth the return shipping... throwing the others in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I received a phone call, email, and mailed letter regarding my concern over the quality of the brushed.  A replacement product was provided quickly.</li>
            <li> Work well and last longer than the official heads. They are a bit noisier though.</li>
            <li> quick service and good product</li>
            <li> These work great for a fraction of the price of the Sonicare version, great buy.</li>
            <li> The first one fit perfectly on the Philips Sonicare and worked with no problems. I would give it five stars but I have not had it long enough to tell if they all work or not. If I do not post again in three months then they were good and you can assume it should get 5. I will post again if I have problems.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my  Sonicare Healthy White. After the first week the bristles were coming out. Had to buy the real Sonicare brushes at Walmart for twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I was contacted by Sonimart the day after I posted ths review. They appoigized for the problem with their brushes. They offered to replace the product, but since I had already bought Sonicare replaceents, they refunded my purchase. I was impressed with their followup. I may try these again when I need brushes again</li>
            <li> The best generic tooth brush heads I have used. I really cant tell the difference just like all the reviews said. I will buy this again. I still haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet. Perfect fit, extras rings for the bottom of the heads.</li>
            <li> One out of the four pack arrived broken, my head is only a week old and it sits loose on my battery and some bristles have fallen out</li>
            <li> Great fit. Good quality.  Fast shipment. And I love that it came with color coding bands.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, well priced and a perfect fit for my Waterpik Waterflosser. It&#x27;s so much easier to use my Amazon Prime Membership to order what I need rather than driving all over town looking for products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> These work great and are a much better price than some. Glad I chose them!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the original brushes that came with the toothbrush. Oh, except for the price. Great product.</li>
            <li> very good! and also good service.</li>
            <li> I have Sonicare Healthy White model of toothbrush.  I love my Sonicare, but hated the ridiculously high priced replacement brushes.  I tried several &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brands, but they weren&#x27;t very good quality.  After reading good reviews, I ordered these Sonimart replacement brushes.  They are packaged well in a hard plastic package that can be opened &amp; closed easily for storing the extra brushes.  They fit &amp; work perfectly.  They seem to be very good quality.  I dare you to tell the difference between these brushes and Sonicare brushes.  The best thing is you will save a LOT of money.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> These are of great quality, just slightly smaller than OE sonicare heads. Will definitely buy again. There were also packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Work great! As a dental hygienist I wanted something quality but even with my discount the sonicare replacement heads are pricy. These work perfect. Fit on the base, bristles aren&#x27;t shedding, brush is soft. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the same quality compared to sonicare blister pack that you need a knife to open.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, and will definitely reorder when we need more. I only wish they also made &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush heads!</li>
            <li> Better than the factory heads and wow that price!</li>
            <li> Fits well and works better than expected</li>
            <li> I bought it for my new HX6730,and it&#x27;s perfect fit for it.But the color code ring is not fasten with the brush head.It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Arrived on time!!</li>
            <li> These are super.  Just bought a new sonicare and this replacement head work as well as the one that came with the toothbrush,  my teeth feel clean as if I had just had them cleaned at the dentist,  After I tried these brushes, I reordered enough so got free shipping,  😄</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast delivery, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great value. Just as good as the Sonicaire brushes.</li>
            <li> These are really good for generics!  I was pleasantly surprised.  They are not perfect, though.  They&#x27;re a little bit too hard of bristles for me at first, whereas the Phillips replacements are softer.  Not real stiff, but enough so that it was noticeable to me.  Still, for the price, these are wonderful!  I have cringed every time I have to get new heads for my Soniccare, and I&#x27;ve tried a few other generics, but they were terrible.  After about a week of using these, however, the head has softened a bit and it&#x27;s become more natural-feeling to me (meaning - more similar to the Phillips brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying these from now on as my replacement heads. Really cannot go wrong with the price and they are close enough to the original Phillips that it makes it totally a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> loud, but they brush my teeth and aren&#x27;t expensive, so I can deal with a bit of noise for a few minutes per day.</li>
            <li> These work great with my Sonicare brush. The bristles are stiffer than the ones that come with the original, but not so much as o be a discomfort. They hold fast and are very secure. You can&#x27;t beat the price and as long as this company keeps the price reasonable, I will continue to use their product. Five Stars, the highest rating I have ever given ANY product.</li>
            <li> Perfect... working Great.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly with the Sonic Care at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between the Phillips brand heads and the Sonimart! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer than the original head that came with the unit, but fit my easyclean model of Philips Sonicare fine. Seems to work fine and good quality for the low price.</li>
            <li> Great product! No need to spend your money on more expensive one.</li>
            <li> These brushes are JUST as good as the more expensive Phillips branded products.  I was very pleased to have found a cheaper option as it let me &#x27;brush&#x27; off my Sonicare toothbrush and put it back to good use.  If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, these are far from a replacement, they are exactly what you are looking for and you likley won&#x27;t go back to the original brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen comments about other imitation brands regarding packaging and broken brushes and hygene risks due to dirty brushes right out of the package.  These are packaged smartly and hygenically.  Kudos to Sonimart for getting it right!</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised. Fits well. Packaged very professionally. The only question will be the heads&#x27; durability.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Fits perfectly. I just wish there would have been a little firmer bristle, but that&#x27;s just my preference, so no reason to deduct stars. Excellent, excellent product. I will be purchasing these every time My heads need replaced.</li>
            <li> While the actual toothbrush portion of the toothbrush head is effective, and it does work with my Philips Sonicare handle, the head is nearly impossible to remove from the handle. It stuck on so snugly that I pulled the toothbrush head apart. Now, it does still work to brush my teeth, but I am completely missing the functionality of taking the head off the handle to place it in my UV light after brushing. I will use the rest of the heads rather than wasting money, but I&#x27;ll be buying the real deal from now on. No knock-offs for this product purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sonimart sent me a new box thinking that my first shipment was defective. As soon as I put the new toothbrush head on, and subsequently tried taking it off, the same thing happened. I think the magnets are just too strong. So, I&#x27;ve updated the rating to 3 stars because the brush works, I just can&#x27;t take it off after every brushing like I want to. If you don&#x27;t remove your toothbrush head from the handle after every use, these will be a great purchase for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month and so far they are entirely indistinguishable from the official product -- but at a much reduced price.  They fit my toothbrush handle perfectly.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works well however they are a bit softer then the original head.</li>
            <li> Not an exact replica of the sonicare heads, but for the price it is a very good substitute. They are softer than the originals, time will tell how long they last</li>
            <li> Received there a couple of days after ordering them. Them seem fine as replacements, maybe a little softer than my original brush was, so if you want a firmer bristle order a firm one, but I like there very much.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better way to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> These are cheaper and fit the Phillip&#x27;s sonicare toothbrushes very well. Great product.</li>
            <li> Terrible! On the first use I was gagging on bristles that had come out!  Disgusting!  You get what you pay for with this one...I would not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble fitting these brush heads onto my sonicare, however once I did get the brush heads on they work just as good as the sonicare brand. These prices are much cheaper than the sonicare brand and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a cheaper alternative. I have noticed no difference in the quality of these brushes compared to the sonicare brand. I am glad that I found these brushes and can now pay a lot less for my brush heads!</li>
            <li> So far so good! Fits like a charm. I did experience one of the heads coming apart when I tried to take it off the base, however I popped it back on and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them since.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened this package yet but have used them before.  They are great. Reasonable price.  Have a years supply ready.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about getting these &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34;, reviews of other off brands were very poor. Fitment issues, bristles falling out, overall quality issues. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these work great. They fit just right, bristles seem... like bristles. Not falling out, not too stiff or soft. Might as well be Philips name brand. But much cheaper! And now that I think about it, I haven&#x27;t had any of the &amp;#34;cheek pinching&amp;#34; I used to get with the originals that came with my Sonicare... so maybe they&#x27;re better than OEM?</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try these brush heads since it&#x27;s rare to get an Off Brand that works as well as the Name Brand. I am so glad that I took the chance! These brush heads are of Excellence Quality and Fit! If I had received these as a gift, not being aware that they are generic...I would never have known! As I said, the Quality, Fit and Price are an Amazing ! I will be back for more and more!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a month. They fit perfectly on my Sonicare which I bought a few years ago. The bristles appear to be same as the manufacturer&#x27;s regarding softness/hardness. The blue wear bristles also appear to fade over the same amount of time. All-in-all they appear to be an exact replacement for the Sonicare brushes which cost something around twice as much.</li>
            <li> Just as good of quality as the &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; toothbrush heads! Love these and love that I can save money by using them versus the more expressive ones!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved my Sonic toothbrush. The cost of replacing the heads are ridiculous. My prayers have been answered with the Sonimart replacement heads. I still have 2 left. They feel the same. The look a bit different. Believe me if you want to be able to afford your Soniccare Toothbrush then click on the link and buy them right now!</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are every bit as good as the original manufacturer supplied brushes, but at a fraction of the price.  I would order them again.</li>
            <li> cheaper than brand name and just as good…will buy again</li>
            <li> Great generic replacement for the original. They seem a little bit more narrow than Phillip&#x27;s but I can tell they will last just as long if not more. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Sonicare replacement tooth brush heads are insanely expensive. I saw these on Amazon and on a whim gave them a try. Fit great, work well, just need changed more often than a Sonicare branded toothbrush head replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: Includes small plastic (rings) so you can add them to your Sonicare toothbrush for a snug(ger) fit on the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> The generic sonicare heads are fully as good as the original OEM (Original equip manufacturer)!</li>
            <li> No complaints here fit my toothbrush exactly and works well. Hx6930 I think is the number of my toothbrush which nothing really says whether it fits that line or not.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the product brushes, maybe even lasting longer(still on first brush). Only complaint, shaft hole may be a little deep, causing vibration when pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Descent quality brush heads. Much better pricing than sonicare. So far they work great.</li>
            <li> These are great, fit perfectly, and don&#x27;t vibrate off as other cheaper generic brands do. Brush heads seem more like original Sonicare ones, and they also come with the protective clear covers, as Sonicare&#x27;s does (some other generics don&#x27;t). I highly recommend these, a bargain at 75% less than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Very well, the service is very good also</li>
            <li> These fit and work perfectly on my FlexCare Plus. Great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Worked great, saved a lot of money too. Now I don&#x27;t have to use the brushes until there&#x27;s only a bristle left.</li>
            <li> I was so sick of paying big bucks for the replacement heads. These are the perfect alternative!!!! I&#x27;m very picky and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like them but I was beyond impressed</li>
            <li> Revised Review:  SoniMart after my first review sent me their product AND sent the SoniCare brush head unit it matches.  For me these brushes are simply too soft -- which is why lots of folks like them.  BUT they do mirror the corresponding SoniCare brush head they are replacing.  If you read the SoniCare labels for their brush heads they make various claims as to how much more plaque is removed than via ordinary brushing.  Some say 6X.  Some say 7X.  This sonicare brush head says 2X.  So, if you are expecting a brush head that rmoves 6x or 7x as much plaque as ordinary brushing, then this is not the brush head for you.  BUT that does not mean it is not a good choice.  Clearly lots of folks like it a lot.  I prefer to stiffer and more compact brush head.  Hence the three stars.</li>
            <li> Great replacement. Cant see any downsides of these. Used for about a month now, three times a day and it still looks new.</li>
            <li> These fit the Sonicare toothbrush that they are intended to fit. The bristles feel right when you brush, they aren&#x27;t too stiff or too soft. However, there is a slight problem because my husband and I share a sonicare. We each have our own toothbrush head (using the different color rings that come with the package). Unfortunately, when you go to pull this head off, it comes apart at the bottom disk. It&#x27;s snaps right back on and then you have to pull more carefully, but it&#x27;s not simple to pull it off by the base. It&#x27;s a small complaint, because it doesn&#x27;t render the head unusable.  The price was great for four toothbrush heads, but I wish they wouldn&#x27;t come apart.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of the product after a month in use.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use them and we can attest that it works just as well as the expensive Sonicare brushes!!</li>
            <li> of course, i haven&#x27;t needed these yet because the ones that came with the toothbrush are still good. but I&#x27;m sure these are wonderful and I look forward to attaching them and sticking them in my mouth.</li>
            <li> work perfectly - good buy</li>
            <li> Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review is listed below. I was contacted by Sonimart shortly thereafter apologizing for the defective product. Sonimart refunded me the purchase price and also shipped me a set of replacement toothbrushes to ask if I would give them a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes I have now work properly and have not had and shedding issues. I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with them and it&#x27;s nice to know they care enough about their product to follow up like they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these aren&#x27;t bad, but they&#x27;re not great. I&#x27;ve used a number of non-brand toothbrush heads, and these certainly aren&#x27;t the worst, but they&#x27;re nowhere close to being equivalent to the Samsung brand variety. I&#x27;ve had to repeatedly trim bristles that come loose from the base, and some of them have come loose in my mouth while brushing - obviously I&#x27;m afraid of swallowing any kind of foreign object. That being said these aren&#x27;t nearly as bad as some other non-brand replacements which completely fall apart inside a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately it&#x27;s up to you. These do save a bit of money, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the price. There&#x27;s no reason for manufacturing to be so lax that people have to worry about swallowing parts of their brush head.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. Great company to deal with.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as depicted.  The heads functioned as well as the brand name Sonicare heads that I previously used.  After 2 weeks of use, my toothbrush head would not remain seated on the Sonicare unit.  I contacted the company by email regarding the problem,  and I was promptly sent a replacement head.  Neither my wife nor I have have had any further problem with the heads, which function perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, excellent product, great price, and prompt service from Sonimart (if the need should arise).  Five Stars *****</li>
            <li> If they had a Subscribe button I&#x27;d use it.  Got a great quality product and basically a one year supply for $11.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> A good inexpensive replacement for Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> The best replacement heads ever.  Now I dont have to spend so much money.  They do the same as the others with a better price</li>
            <li> No issues, arrived on time and as advertised.  Great price and included interchangeable color bands for each head.</li>
            <li> I try to replace the toothbrush head on my Sonicare every 3 months. These replacements from Sonimart are a good value for this purpose.</li>
            <li> The closest thing to OEM part at a third of the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product all the way from Korea. It&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li> These brush heads are SLIGHTLY lower quality than the Sonicare ones I used to buy, but the price difference makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The product ordered was delivered as promised and is exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> On par with Sonicare&#x27;s own replacement heads, the sensitive teeth replacement heads are great as well and will save you a great deal of money.</li>
            <li> These are identical to the originals at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a non-OEM option for replacement brushes for my Sonicare toothbrush.  Save for the brand name printed on the neck, you would never know the difference.</li>
            <li> These are much better than the cheapo ones I bought on Ebay, worth the upgrade in price!</li>
            <li> seems like they works well.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Lasts 3 times what the Sonicare brushes last.  Slightly stiffer than the super soft Sonicare brushes.  Dentist says they must be doing as good a job as the old Sonicare brushes.  I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I&#x27;ll be buying these from now on!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with the Sonicare Flexpro. No noise or vibration issues at all. Perfect firmness, and dentist-clean teeth. . . for about half the price of Sonicare&#x27;s own product. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with these replacement toothbrush heads. They work perfectly with my Sonicare toothbrush. Last year I had bought another brand, and they were quite unsatisfactory. The bristles were prickly and I couldn&#x27;t get it off my Sonicare toothbrush. The Sonimart Standard Replacement Toothbrush Heads are the ones I&#x27;ll buy in the future. The price is great, and best of all they work perfectly!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Finally there are brush heads that fit my Sonicare that I can afford!! No more overpaying in the stores...now I get 4 for $10.95 instead of 2 or 3 for almost $40!! These brush heads are excellent quality and fit on my Sonicare Diamond Clean brush better than the original manufacturer brush heads. You cannot go wrong by making this purchase...you definitely will not regret it!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic replacement heads. They might even be better than the original ones!</li>
            <li> Pleased so far.  I can&#x27;t seem to tell the different in quality, and the price is way cheaper than the standard toothbrush heads.  We shall see how they hold up over time.  But, as of now, I recommend giving them a try!</li>
            <li> Im really glad I found these brush heads,  I&#x27;ve been using my old brush heads for too long because they are so expensive.  These are working great and and they come at an excellent price,  I definitely buy these form now on for my Soniccare brush.</li>
            <li> Really quality generics to the OEM replacement heads. They work great and I&#x27;d recommend buying these hands down.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great shipping!  Great price!  Beats the heck out of spending the fortune the Phillips knuckleheads want to charge for a silly brush head!  Thanks, Sonimart!</li>
            <li> An excellent alternative to the brand name. Fits and operates perfectly. Glad to support this small, Made in America business. Will most definitely be a product that I order again. Fits Philips Sonicare Easy Clean model HX6511.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and a price that is affordable when compared to what the brand name ones cost.  I cannot tell any difference in quality and will buying these brush heads this way from now on.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Just what I need</li>
            <li> Fit great in my Philips Sonicare HX6711.</li>
            <li> These are good quality for the price.  I have the Sonicare Healthy White brush and my husband has the Diamond Clean.  They fit both just right.  These brush heads seem to do the job just fine - although I do think that the bristles are a little on the soft side.  My husband, who is a dentist, knew right away that these were generic (without seeing the packaging) - but said these would be perfectly OK to use as long as they are replaced regularly (every 3 months).  For the price, this is a no brainer - 4 for $15 or 3 for $25.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Yes, they surprisingly work great. I was shocked. The actually vibrations on the my Diamond Clean are not as intense but the brushes vibrated way farther than the OEM from Sonicare. So I am able to sort of manually brush the backs of my front teeth a little better. And I get four!, very happy</li>
            <li> Great price and they are completely compatible with our Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I was worried about size - since there are so many choices out there! and they were the right size and the right price ($30+ in the stores and these were $14) Yeah!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical first but decided to purchase one because of the good reviews. It arrived fast and packed in very nice retail packaging. It works great on my flexcare. Big money saving thanks to the reviewers here and thanks to Sonimart.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Bristles are harder than original, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative they do get the job done. Had an issue with them sticking to the brush and coming apart when I took the head off the brush. Cheap quality</li>
            <li> Get these brushes!  They work great!</li>
            <li> Cost effective replacement heads. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush head, worked perfectly with hx6511 easy clean toothbrush. I actually preferred the stiffness of this one (slightly stiffer) to the standard. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They fit they work  well i&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product and saves me a ton of cash! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> After only a couple of weeks, these brushes appear to be doing as well as the Sonicare. They do, however, fit a little looser on the handle but at this time this is not a problem. It is just not as positive a click as the original. I will have to see what the longevity of the brush is to see whether or not they will be a reorder.</li>
            <li> Was very happy when I got them. They even come with caps!</li>
            <li> worked just fine, don&#x27;t know why there so expensive in the store.</li>
            <li> Fit my Sonicare toothbrush fine and work well for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> My whole family has used these for about three weeks now.  They feel the same as the name brand brush heads.  Durability seems to be fine so far, but the price point of these makes it easier to replace them earlier than the expensive name brand heads.</li>
            <li> The Sonimart Premium Standard  Replacement Toothbrush heads are an excellent  product.  My order was handled efficiently and delivery was prompt.  I&#x27;m especially proud that this product was &amp;#34;Made in America&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No issues. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing price&lt;br /&gt;They are great</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;wear indicator&amp;#34;, but other than that they are great.  They do seem to hold up well and I can&#x27;t tell a difference between them...</li>
            <li> My delivery came the next day.  Awesome turn around time.  The brush heads themselves are of very good quality, especially compared to the set that is available on B@ngg@@d.  As said before, the bristles are a bit stiffer that the real oem replacement heads, but that is fine by me.</li>
            <li> Item was on time and fits my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Very happy fit my sonicare perfectly!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used but seems good</li>
            <li> Fit my sonic care perfectly!</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new sonic electric brush and finally retired my very old version that i have had for many years. The old product served me well and the new one seems to be even better.  When i called to get information from customer service on which of their many models i should consider, they could not have been more helpful on the phone.  I love the product. Excellent quality and value and first class customer service.</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality! The only thing that would make these better is if they were offered in a soft brush head for more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the brand name heads and they are much cheaper. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> POS. The fit isn&#x27;t quite right--a little tight. They fell apart when I tried to remove it from the handle.</li>
            <li> How did I not know you could buy heads for your electric toothbrush for a fraction of the cost?  Do they work as well?  YES!&lt;br /&gt;I have a Phillips Sonicare EasyClean brush and these work just like the head it came with from the manufacturer.  Save $$ and order these!</li>
            <li> Great product, and didn&#x27;t have to wait forever to get it!! Thank you</li>
            <li> These are great they are just like the name brand Sonicare replacement heads just way less expensive!! That is not always the case as I have bought generic replacement heads in the past that have been horrible!</li>
            <li> First time to try these.  Appear to be good so far.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are good and cheap.</li>
            <li> I have tried &amp;#34;offbrand&amp;#34; brush replacements before, but they were usually very hard bristles.  These are quite a compromise between hard and soft and still work extremely well.  Very well made product!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works just like original, best replacements I have tried.</li>
            <li> not as good fit as the originals, but work ok</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the genuine ones, but the bristles are just a little stiffer than the &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; variety.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the one that came on the brush from the factory...A little larger and so far seem more durable.</li>
            <li> Fits the electric toothbrush holder for much less cost than anywhere else searched.  Arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> These are high-quality lower cost after-market brush heads that fit my Sonicare HX 6950 perfectly, and do a fantastic job.  I will definitely be buying these again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> As good as the originals and for a great price</li>
            <li> You know the differences only when you tried. Have had bad experience purchased from other vendors. The brush bristles become deformed within a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonimart replacement head seem to be professionally designed. The bristles not too firm that cause my dad&#x27;s sensitive gum blead either not too soft that won&#x27;t chage shape in couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, the customer services are well trained who were helpful and patient. Thank you guys. Will be loyal customer in the future.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and the brush heads are comparable to the OEM, not quite as on par but close enough that if I end up replacing them more frequently because the cost is lower I will end up with healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real thing.  But work well enough for the money.  4 out of 5 is above average to me.</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase &amp; saved money over the other brands :)</li>
            <li> These alternative brush heads work properly on our EasyClean and Flexcare+ handles. The quality is good and the packaging is nice. I will return to buy more in 3 month.</li>
            <li> Just like the original. I have a Sonicare Healthy White HX6710.</li>
            <li> The feel of the bristles is similar to that of the official Sonicare brushes, but the insertion hole is a little loose, as I had it fall out while brushing...but for the price, it&#x27;s still an unbeatable bargain!</li>
            <li> These heads are narrower than I expected but they are good quality.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the quality of these toothbrush heads, as so many of the generics have bad reviews. The Sonimart toothbrush heads are great, though. They&#x27;re a little smaller than the heads that come with the Sonicare brushes, but the quality is very similar and they provide a great cleaning experience. And the bristles stay put...no shedding! They&#x27;re really a great value.</li>
            <li> standard heads replacement for my proresults, gentle bristles, vibrate well, not noisy. no complaint</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement brush head for my Sonicare. It fits perfectly, never has any issues.</li>
            <li> These are great.  We always try to get the most out of each replacement because of the cost of the original Sonic Care brand heads.  These work great and are a very reasonably priced option.  We can&#x27;t tell the difference from the originals.</li>
            <li> I am a happy customer. These brushes work great. They seem to be just a bit firmer than the OEM brushes. But I like that. I will buy them again!</li>
            <li> Tried this product from another mfg. but a few of the brushes were useless. This product is as good as the original mfg. I would repeat buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly in excellent condition. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> These works great! I do not know why anyone would buy them name-brand kind for double the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for OEM...thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and honestly I didn&#x27;t feel much difference compared to the authentic (and expensive) one. The head is slightly bigger, and the brush is soft and performs great! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These fit my sonic flex care toothbrush nicely and work just as good as the expensive name brand replacement they are a little skinnier than the namebrand replacement but I have a very small mouth for an adult so they are the perfect size I will buy again when I need replacement I am very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Fantastic replacement toothbrush heads - they fit perfectly and they&#x27;re performing as well as the originals. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love them, great quality and the best price. I am not planing to go back to the name brand</li>
            <li> just tried the product and seems okay and the price was good to. if there are any problems will get back for further reviews if necessary.  SO FAR SO GOOD  all seems to be working just fine and would recommend others to buy</li>
            <li> The bottom of the new brushes even have the same mold markings and metal flange as the old ones. The bristles are cut to the same shape and seem to be the same stiffness and have a colored wear indicator. Physically the head is the same length and width, the brush head is the same size and they fit to the toothbrush base with the same force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win Win.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product.  They fit perfect and work very well.  I will purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Works like to Philips Sonacare but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Seem to work as described at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Have used for a month now and still like new. Amazing price and work just as good as OEM brand name, will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I, too, was skeptical given the huge price difference from the official &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; replacement heads, but I am so glad I ordered these. They work just as well as the full priced version. No issues with them fitting whatsoever. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These are great. They fit my sonicare brush perfectly. I bought these due to being much cheaper than the sonicare replacements and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Not great as I thought they would be. But, totally worth the price. I was used to the &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; head brushes. These certainly do feel and clean like the first gen Philips sonic heads. Not excellent but good enough!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  This is what I ordered</li>
            <li> I have purchased other replacement toothbrushes and the quality of the Sonimart Premium Standard Replacement Toothbrush far surpasses them.  I was thrilled to find Sonimart. They are offered at an economical price but the quality remains. I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Worked great. Worth the saved money</li>
            <li> These seem to be pretty decent quality. The texture of the heads is different than the OEM version. For the price, I think they&#x27;re an acceptable replacement.</li>
            <li> Fast service and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Fit my toothbrush works just as well as the sonicare one. For the one person saying it stops moving when pressed against ur teeth , your not supposed to press firmly against your teeth, I used to work at a dental office and we sold electric toothbrushes that&#x27;s where I got mine but anyways we used to have monthly meetings with the sonicare rep and you are supposed to do little circles and you do not press hard on to your teeth but lightly . . Hope this helps anyone who is curious.</li>
            <li> Nuances of toothbrush quality aside (seems fine), these toothbrush heads stayed in the Sonicare, and that was all I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I have never bought a generic brand refill for my Sonicare (only because no one sells them around here). I actually think these fit BETTER than my previous Sonicare refills. They snap right down close to the base and seem to make less noise than the Sonicare did. I like the bristles. I had &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; ones last time (MORE expensive) and these Sonimart heads seem to have more ridges, which I like. They work great so far and I am very pleased. I had to change the Sonicare ones each month....as they just wore out. Even though the package says 3 months. So I am curious to see how long these last. For this price, I would be fine changing each month.</li>
            <li> After I tested out the regular Sonimart brush heads, I was dissapointed as I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use this brand.  The brush heads were too hard and seemed to make my Sonicare vibrate so hard it was difficult to brush with.  But then I was able to try out the sensitive Sonimart brush heads and I can say I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the namebrand and these.  I&#x27;ll purchase the sensitive in the future, but steer away from the regular brush heads, they were just too hard for me.  Sonimart sensitive is a fine substitute for the namebrand.</li>
            <li> Close enough to the original brand that it doesn&#x27;t bother me! Fits great, doesn&#x27;t fall off and bristles are correct firmness.  Happy to save the money!  I have EasyClean model.</li>
            <li> Similar quality to the brand model.  It fits our Sonicare well and we are very pleased.</li>
            <li> Buy these replacement heads.  Cost is much less than the sonicare brand and work just as well.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for sonicare. Works well and of course sells for a lot less</li>
            <li> Works just like the original, Philips brush heads, but much cheaper. I haven&#x27;t had any quality issues (been using it for a month now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice was that the bristles are a bit tougher than Philips, by like 5%. Hardly noticable, but if you have sensitive teeth, you may notice.</li>
            <li> I bought the sonic care toothbrush 6 months ago and these are refills for the toothbrush. These work great and price is great. Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I can not tell the difference between these and the OM product.</li>
            <li> Good product, good service..</li>
            <li> These work great.  The SoniCare Phillips heads seem pricey so these are a great alternative.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference, so that is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Brushes are exactly what I was looking for and got much better than the old replacement ones I got. These are an exact fit for the sonicare I have. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes arrived very quickly, and the package was undamaged. I have not used the replacement brushes yet, as I received the SonicCare toothbrush for Christmas and the existing head is practically new. I do like the idea that the bristles will fade when a replacement head is warranted. I do not expect problems and like the shape of the bristle head.</li>
            <li> Best generic replacement heads I have found for Sonicare toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Good Packaiging. Product quality is much better than another generic brush I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this toothbrush again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice quality and great price, I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than other generic toothbrush heads in design and material, which makes it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> In really like these toothbrush heads. They are allot cheaper in price , but still good quality. I will buy again</li>
            <li> The brushes were a little harder than I wanted but great otherwise!</li>
            <li> Great replacement brush for my sonic brush.</li>
            <li> excellent quality.  reason i put four stars instead of five is because it wasn&#x27;t clear on the page that this isn&#x27;t a sonicare-branded product.  annoying but  now that i&#x27;ve used it, i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, very good quality. Will buy again everytime I need replacements.</li>
            <li> Previous purchase of store brand replacement heads would not stay attached during use. No issues of that sort with Sonimart. Bristles are firmer then Phillips brand but not inferior, just different.  Personally, I happen to like it that way.</li>
            <li> Just as there is a price difference between this head and the OEM, there is a definite quality difference with the bristles.  I am okay with the stiffer bristles.  Where I have only been using the product for a few days, I cannot attest to the durability.</li>
            <li> Work great.  Will be making a purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> These bristles are way rougher than the name brand. They also vibrate more violently because they arent a perfect fit. I just feel like I need soft bristles for my teeth as the dentist suggests. If you like hard bristles, this would be great. I&#x27;m not sure if the reviews on this are real, I&#x27;m dissapointed and I have never returned anything on amazon before.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Cant tell difference or performance from OEM.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was leary of using something off brand for my teeth which I dearly value! However, I must say I&#x27;m totally pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost three weeks and it is performing very well.  I&#x27;ve been only using the Sonicare brand until now....but, I always had a problem with the fit especially if the brush was seated on a ring....so I stopped using the rings with them.  These offer an excellent fit and are at least as good of a feel from a quality standpoint as the brand....at roughly half the cost!  They are neatly and well packaged.  I&#x27;d recommend them to a friend and will continue to purchase them for myself&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> It fits my phillips sonic care perfect. Price is reasonable and came in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Looks like the original, works like the original, yet it&#x27;s half the price, what&#x27;s not to like.  The replacement brushes worked very well.</li>
            <li> Update: I had to drop this to 3 stars as the linkage between the brush head &amp; the Sonicare has become &#x27;fused&#x27; &amp; the head would not come off without almost breaking the head itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lower price than other replacements. Very good quality. I can&#x27;t speak to durability yet as I&#x27;ve not used one for 2 months yet.</li>
            <li> Bristles are slightly firmer than the sonicare but if you like them firmer this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, I am very satisfied, changed the traditional way of brushing your teeth, I make teeth cleaner</li>
            <li> Great product,great price. No reason to pay more for Sonicare brushes</li>
            <li> The quality appears comparable to manufacturers product at a significant discount. So far, I would definitely repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> These do quite a great job, for generics.  Comes with colored bands like the name brand brushes.  No problems thus far with the brushing, and bristles fade in color with age.  I would still prefer the Philips brushes, but will buy these for price advantage and negligible differences.</li>
            <li> Great deal, feel as good as the factory heads, fit well on the Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li> These are the best replacement brushes I have ever used and I have tried nearly all available for the Sonic toothbrush..</li>
            <li> Great company great product! very happy</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the original brand. No noticeable change in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> These work just fine with my Sonicare.  I&#x27;m happy and will buy again!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare handle and charger will last a long time, but the brush needs to be replaced regularly. Thanks for providing a quality brush at a reasonable price, with purchase via Amazonj. All so easy!!</li>
            <li> my wife loved these,and the price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> As good as the ones Sonicare sells but without the price tag!</li>
            <li> excellent value for the money</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the originals.</li>
            <li> They work great!  Teeth are squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other generic toothbrush heads and the bristles would come out while brushing my teeth. Not so with these guys, they&#x27;re just as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I would totally recommend they feel great and get the job done. The price is great compared to the brand name sonicare heads. Definitely will be buying these from now on</li>
            <li> I am so grateful that I found these.  They work just great and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I can&#x27;t see myself buying three replacements for close to $30.  I had no trouble attaching my replacement and the feel and clean of it is the same, in my opinion to the main vendor brand.  You should try them, don&#x27;t think you would be disappointed.  And, with the price they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Love it... will always buy these. great buy</li>
            <li> These are quite good as replacements. Initially, they are a bit stiff, but soften quickly. I have to say that I prefer the OEM bristles by a hair, as they start soft, and are probably slightly better for people with sensitive gums, or existing gum damage, but these also end up quite soft. They also don&#x27;t cost 20 bucks per head...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product. The price is amazing and the toothbrush heads work every bit as well as the name brand ones. I will definitely be purchasing more of the same.</li>
            <li> As the title says, I prefer these to the actual Pro Results brush heads. Braun&#x27;s Pro Results heads are firmer than necessary and irritated my gums. These are softer, but not as soft as Sonicare soft brush heads. For me these are the perfect firmness combined  with the Pro Results design.&lt;br /&gt;Unless something unforseen happens I&#x27;ll stick with these.</li>
            <li> Works like the factory originals!</li>
            <li> Just the same as the original.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this buy.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly with my Sonicare toothbrush. I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with these non-panasonic brand brushes. I figured if I found a good supplier I&#x27;d save money, otherwise I would just have to keep getting scalped for the name-brand ones. Unexpectedly, I think these brushes are well-made, especially given the price.</li>
            <li> Great price - great brushes - all good.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush heads and the price is also a very good deal. Will by&lt;br /&gt;them from now on!</li>
            <li> I love my sonic toothbrush, but have always been upset with the cost of the toothbrush heads.  I am using my first Sonimart replacement toothbrush head and I am very pleased with the feel and function of the brush.  The price can&#x27;t be beat and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Just like the sonicare ones but much cheaper price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased replacement Sonicare heads for years, every time in Sonicare packaging, but they were always too tight for the handle. We&#x27;ve actually had handles break because of it.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes we received through Sonimart are perfect. they&#x27;re as appropriately tight as the ones that came with the original handle. We&#x27;ve had our handle for a while now, and are past the warranty. We&#x27;re very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for philips sonicare.. Love it</li>
            <li> Stop looking. This is the best set of generic brusheads you&#x27;re gonna find. They&#x27;re just as good as the originals but at a much better price.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great. They are just as good as the real deal. I will never pay full price again when I can buy this brand for my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good value</li>
            <li> Better then the sink add one</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the brand name for how they make my teeth feel. I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to judge their durability, but so far I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a generic brand. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought. Love them.</li>
            <li> To me these have no discernible difference from the much more expensive name brand ones. I&#x27;ll definitely be using these in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my old Sonicare brush head.  These look and feel exactly like the branded brush heads.  They might be a bit softer than the originals, but that might also be my perception.  I have also only used the first one in the pack, but so far the brush heads appear to be durable and well made.  Assuming that changes I&#x27;ll update this review, but so far so good.  In terms of bang for your buck, these brush heads are a truly great value.</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit perfectly and work wonderfully!  I know where I&#x27;m going to be purchasing my replacement heads in the future!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Same quality for a much better price!</li>
            <li> Nice replacement heads. Seems to be near exact quality of the original Philips heads but I notice a bigger gap in the front towards the connection to the actual toothbrush device. This opens up more room for water to seep in, not a show stopper but have to deduct one star for this. Worth getting if you don&#x27;t want or need diamond head quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the same in design or materials as the &amp;#34;Phillips&amp;#34; brand, but they work just as well as far as I can see. The &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; version is also just as good, and the Phillips brand of compact head is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> Great value. I use my electric toothbrush three times a day so I go through lots of heads. Glad that I found these and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Have not used any of these replacements yet because the toothbrush was recently bought, but the price was right and they fit exactly like the factory heads, as well as the good price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing the original anymore. These are just as good and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s a bit cheap. Some times bristles come out but you get what you pay for.it&#x27;s acceptable for the price and you get 4 so not really a big prob.</li>
            <li> These are a great and less expensive alternative to the name brand brush heads. I&#x27;ve been using mine for months now and they work the same.  They may not last as long, but when you get (4) in a pack for the price you&#x27;d normally get 1 or 2 of the name brand ones, I think I&#x27;ll be happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These fit just like the originals. The bristles are slightly softer than the originals which is OK by me. Shipping was lightning fast. Packaging requires&lt;br /&gt;strong scissors unless you can shuck oysters barehanded. LOL. They are the best bang for the buck. Thanks Sonimart!</li>
            <li> Well for the price there is not lost, however, if I can afford the original ones, I will get them. The quality of the brush is different. Softer and very different materials. I do not think they will last more than 3 months, which it is the right time to replace them. The original ones, will last more than 6 months easily. It fits perfectly my Phillips sonicare HX6930.</li>
            <li> Good little toothbrush heads. Don&#x27;t quite fit on the body perfectly but they stay on just fine.</li>
            <li> We could not tell a difference with these brushes. They work great and we would definitely buy again. Great fit too.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Fits great.  I have encountered other supposedly compatible toothbrush heads that did not fit at all. Very pleased so far (after a few weeks).</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the originals.</li>
            <li> Great Seller !!! Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, fraction of the cost. No compromise that I have noticed.</li>
            <li> I started using the Sonimart brush to replace the original Philips Series 2 brush about 6 weeks ago.  I find that it had worked very well.  The contour is different from the Series 2 and it seems to work better cleaning out the coffee stain in between the teeth.  The difference is quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly onto the Philips Series 2 brush.  Shipping from Amazon is very fast.</li>
            <li> Works great at a great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and much more economical than the sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price. seems well made, durable and fits well. Fraction of the price of the Sonicare branded heads</li>
            <li> These replacement brushheads work great that we cannot tell any difference.</li>
            <li> stiff bristles.update march 16 2015,sonimart went beyond what they should have. i never contacted them but they sent me 2 four packs of soft bristle brush heads on there own. thank you very much. Jay</li>
            <li> I just received these replacement brush heads yesterday. It works with my Sonicare toothbrush. I am very pleased with the product. I&#x27;m very happy I read the reviews before purchasing the Sonimart replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brushes for the past week and I am very pleased with their efficiency, almost as good as the original DiamondClean brush.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted; nice price</li>
            <li> Bought fake sonicare replacement heads on Amazon before so I decided to try these instead. They work just as well as compared to a genuine sonicare head. Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The best buy better then any other brand I have brought will buy again</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well these replacements fit my Sonicare toothbrush.  Sonicare replacements tend toward the expensive side, so I thought that I would give these a try.  The bristles are a bit stiff at first, but they calm down in a couple weeks.  I will be more likely to replace the head more often since these are less expensive.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for my electric toothbrush are so expensive, that I will not buy another one of the same brand, when I need a new one.  These Sonimart replacement brush heads are virtually the same as the expensive ones.  I will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great value versus Sonicare&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced OEM brush. But a little too soft for me. I need mine to be firmer to be able to go under my gum line and nail tartar.</li>
            <li> Works great as inexpensive, but high-quality replacements!</li>
            <li> Works fine as replacement to sonicare brushes.  No issues with them.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the price and delivery time.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly. I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> 2nd Update: Unfortunately, even the Sonicare sensitive brush heads are not for me. I have used the brand name brush heads with gum irritation for years. After my initial week-long short stint of using the standard Sonicare brush head, I irritated a section of my gums and it took nearly 3 weeks for the irritation to subside while using the Sonicare sensitive brush heads that the company so generously shipped to me free of charge with the Phillips brand equivalent. I have noticed that my gums seem to be on the verge of irritation even with the Sonicare sensitive brush heads--and I have been *extra* careful to brush gently since the standard brush head irritated a section of my gums. I would have liked the sensitive brush heads to have worked out because the price is great, but I will be going back to the brand name brush heads for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am upgrading my rating to 3 stars from 2 stars for now because the company sent me a set of their sensitive brush heads and two of the Sonicare brand brush heads to compare. I am astounded by this company&#x27;s high level of customer service. I will update again in a month or so after trying out the sensitive brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like mini cheap, plastic bristled hairbrushes, but for teeth. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive gums, but wow, these hurt. Also, on top of being very firm, the way the bristles were cut remind me of when I used to cut my Barbie doll&#x27;s hair. Two pros: cheap (will keep as emergency backups) and hard enough to double as a tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> These brush heads I wish I would have found them a long time ago.  I love my SonicCare Flex+ brush but not the price of the brush heads to replace them.  These look like quality brushes and I am glad that I tried them and very well packaged as well!  Thank you Sonimart for these great brushes...</li>
            <li> match to OEM at a good price. Packaging was easy to open AND reclose for storage.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly softer than the OEM brush, but plenty of cleaning power... more comfortable.</li>
            <li> great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist and I was looking for a replacement head for my Pro Sonicare. Shocked at how expensive the brand name ones were and had trouble finding the right size in the stores . These were perfect. And I couldn&#x27;t believe the savings. Arrived on time and they fit the bill. They are quality made and I would recommend</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised with these brush heads! The reviews were completely accurate, and they match up to the much more expensive name brand heads. I don&#x27;t see a need to go back to the name brand. Thanks!</li>
            <li> We bought the brushes as a low-cost substitution for name brand Sonicare brushes. The brushes fit the Sonicare power head correctly. Brush bristles are stiffer than the original units, but are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Well made equivalent product at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying how much I love my Sonicare toothbrush. I have been a loyal Sonicare user for over 10 years and the only time I use a regular toothbrush is if I forget to pack my charger while on vacation. That being said, I am terrified to do the math regarding how much money I have spent on Sonicare brand replacement heads throughout the years. Recently the prices have increased to the point that I just had to consider my options. I was concerned about buying generics because I have been using brand name for so long and I really didn&#x27;t want to give up quality. So my first instinct was to go online and read as many reviews as possible. I finally settled on the Sonimart and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purposely delayed writing this review because I wanted to make sure that some time had passed to see how the brush heads are holding up. Its been over a month now that I have been using the Sonimart replacement heads and the quality of the bristles is excellent. The bristles are firm and have stayed nice and straight. Also, the attachment fits perfectly to my handle. Dare I say, with the way this brush head has been working, I think the quality might even be better than the originals. I will be buying Sonimart brush heads from now on. So glad I made the switch and I recommend you give them a try as well.</li>
            <li> They fit quite well but hurt like hell. The bizarre contour of the bristles makes brushing difficult</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the $. So glad I bought these and hope they are available in the future when I need more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product great price</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and works well. Liked them do much, I ordered more to stick up.</li>
            <li> The SoniMART brush heads are equivalent to the standard replacement brush heads from Sonicare and they are offered at a much more reasonable price. I saw the price of the Sonicare replacement brush heads after I had bought the Sonicare toothbrush; $30 -That&#x27;s THIRTY DOLLARS !!! for TWO brush heads. I was going to return the toothbrush before I decided to give the Sonimart replacement brushes a chance. I am glad they are going to work out since I do like the efficiency of the toothbrush and the cleaning it provides. Vote with your dollars and send a message to Sonicare that you are not going to put up with this sort of price gouging where they sell you a product then overcharge for the related consumables.</li>
            <li> Works with our Sonicare HX6710. Great price. Can&#x27;t tell, but maybe a little softer than the official brush heads.</li>
            <li> Product appears consistent with Sonicare; time will tell.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Service was good and the brushes are just what we wanted.  We will buy them again when we need new brushes.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Just as good as original at a better price.</li>
            <li> These are nice, inexpensive substitutes for the OEM product.  I&#x27;ve used these for a couple of months now, and the bristles, which are of medium firmness, have held up well.  The bristles don&#x27;t fall off, and there hasn&#x27;t been extraordinary wear that you might expect for an inexpensive product.  These same heads fit both my SonicCare toothbrush and my wife&#x27;s, which is a different model.  I&#x27;m very happy with these for the price.</li>
            <li> works great and nice price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes. Fast delivery. They fit and work as well as the originals. Will stick with Sonimart and never pay a fortune for the Phillips brushes again.</li>
            <li> These are great, very happy with the quality. Best part is they are about 1/2 the cost of the OEM version. Thank you for this alternative.</li>
            <li> works fine and a great value by comparison to the name brand. will buy them again..</li>
            <li> These are great!  They fit and just a good as the more expensive Sonicare brand.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great deal! I cannot tell the difference between these and the name brand that cost double!</li>
            <li> these brush heads are great! I was reluctant to purchase them but they&#x27;re every bit as good as the name brand. be prepared They&#x27;re not as soft but you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Brushes were excellent and worked like orginals</li>
            <li> Read reviews before my purchase and just used my new replacement heads for the first time.  The contouring is great and they fit perfectly on the Sonicare toothbrush base.  These were less expensive, are quiet on the base, work well along the gum-line and they are made by a small home grown American business.  Nice to support local.</li>
            <li> But at a bargain price.  Fits HealthyWhite Sonicare perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I almost like this more than the original.  Works great, strong bristles and fits well on the sonicare unit.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush heads. Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality, maybe a little more stiff than the OEM brush heads. At this price I&#x27;ll certainly buy them as my preferred replacement.</li>
            <li> Great product for half the price.  Fits perfectly, no issues.  Bristles are softer than the Sonicare ones, but I think they feel better.  Nicely packaged.  I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than the Sonicare brush heads and built just as well. I&#x27;m still on my first brush head but it seems to be holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> These brushes have proven to be equal in quality to the brand name replacements. I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads on line.  They work very well and I will definitely purchase them again.  They are small enough to reach the back of my mouth and large enough to get a nice surface area.  They are not too soft or hard.  They are the perfect size and I am enjoying using them.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Acceptable replacement for the Phillips originals.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrushes fit my Sonicare very well and feel like the originals. I plan to buy more!</li>
            <li> This is very affordable. The original one from philips is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good too and it does not wear out(?) as fast as the original one. I think the original one is too soft too.</li>
            <li> The brushes fit tightly and works well with a price much cheaper than the expensive Sonicare brand, even from Costco.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great! Cheap as ever and could never tell the difference between these and the expensive ones. I got these for my Philips SOnicare and I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> fits just like the original Sonicare brush head.  I&#x27;ve only had it 2 weeks so not sure how long it will last but happy so far.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and excellent product.  These toothbrush heads are the same quality as the name brand and fit my older model perfectly.  I&#x27;m so glad that I found this company and will buy from them again!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush heads.  I was having trouble finding  replacements for my Sonicare locally.  I was delighted to find these.  They perform wonderfully and are a good bargain.</li>
            <li> These are actually better than the brush heads that came with my Sonicare.  These are great, low cost items that will greatly improve your Sonciare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Awesome alternative to the high priced name brand.  Do it!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Way better value than the sonicare heads, and work exactly the same!</li>
            <li> Great, cheap replacement for my toothbrush.  I have gotten the non-oems for other brushes, and the bristles had a tendency to come out.  Not with these.  I like the shape better than the oem, they&#x27;re holding up well, and were a happy purchase.</li>
            <li> Good basic replacement for the standard manufacture brush at a much lower cost. Only comment is that the brush head is considerably larger then the original ones. Not a problem, just is.</li>
            <li> Stop looking at all the rest of the generic brands. This is the best available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks, although these are not a genuine philips product - they are of reasonable quality and performance.</li>
            <li> i like these brushheads for my eseries. They work quiet and powerful. It has very good torque and the magnet at the bottom is well designed. Just as good as philips</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and price.</li>
            <li> So far very good product.</li>
            <li> Its a good replacement brush head. shipping was quick and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> perfect fit for my sonicare toothbrush. really good price! thanks!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are awesome. They fit perfectly and the price is great!  I won&#x27;t be buying more of the Sonicare replacement heads as long as I can purchase these.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Bristles falling out on first use. Very stiff bristles.  Just pay the $$ for real thing.</li>
            <li> loved it, fit my sonicare toothbrush perfectly</li>
            <li> Works well, compares to the original Philips heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for cheaper replacement brushes for my Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush and these work great!! These stay on the brush and look just like the sonicare brand brushes. The price is great and they work well. I will definitely purchase theses again.</li>
            <li> fit fine and do the job (buzzzzz)</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare &amp;#34;Clean &amp; White&amp;#34; model a year ago, and it&#x27;s a great toothbrush -- unfortunately, I soon discovered Philips&#x27; replacement heads were a bit expensive.  When I saw these Sonimart heads on Amazon, I figured they were inexpensive enough to give them a try.  So glad I found them!  They fit onto my Sonicare perfectly and they do the job just as well as the Philips heads -- at a much lower price.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for our Sonicare. Don&#x27;t pay inflated prices for your replacement brush heads when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they perform just as well.</li>
            <li> Too hard - thought that I was getting soft bristles like my original.</li>
            <li> Great price and works well.  I see no difference between this one and the more expensive ones besides price.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Quality replacements heads for a great price! Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of these brushes yet, but they look exactly like the originals, and the bristles feel as stiff as well. Based on visual inspection, I expect them to work fine.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and sonicare&#x27;s version but cheaper.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because the original Sonicare replacement heads are very expensive.  These are a fraction of the cost and work just as well.  There was a slight defect in my original order, however, the company had excellent customer service and resolved the issue immediately.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These feel of very comparable quality to the official ones that cost $12 apiece. Actually they even feel a little firmer, which I would say is a positive/negative. Bad in that they don&#x27;t feel like they cover as much area per stroke, but good in that they feel like they&#x27;ll stay firmer longer. I will exclusively be buying these for my HX6710 from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this product.  I will continue to use these replacement brushes, as I feel that they are the same quality as the name brand, and they are certainly a better price.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Philips Sonicare at a fraction of the price as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just like the brand ones.</li>
            <li> great product and quality</li>
            <li> I cannot see any material difference between this and the much more expensive Philips product.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are great, and comparable to sonicare. In fact, I&#x27;ll never waste money on full-priced sonicare heads again. Thanks to sonicare for providing a quality product at a great price.</li>
