            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect matte highlight for under my brows.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I bought is powder to use as a highlighter for when I&#x27;m contouring my face and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this over a very fair cream for a porcelain effect.</li>
            <li>Although I am very fair skinned, I&#x27;m not going for a geisha look whatsover.</li>
            <li>I used this for Morticia Addams makeup and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>Beautiful undead tone.  </li>
            <li>Great for Halloween makeup.</li>
            <li>great and didn&#x27;t arrive broke or busted</li>
            <li>It is great that it has a mirror and a drawer for the sponge.</li>
            <li>Very nice product</li>
            <li>Excellent product, very smooth powder</li>
            <li>If I was using this as an all over product, it would stay in place and even have a good amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>But for a costume it was good.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a cheap highlighting powder and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This goes on very smooth and its just as described in color.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and is much more opaque than this one.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more coverage though.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, wrapped in cute tissue paper, and even had a hand written note on the receipt thanking me for buying from them.</li>
            <li>I love this powder and will defiantly order again when I run out</li>
            <li>my cheek bones have never been this defined :)</li>
            <li>I am usually very critical of cheap makeup, but this is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>And silky smooth.. just be sure to apply with a brush.</li>
            <li>Rubs off easily though if you are prone to touch your face a lot.</li>
            <li>The sponge works nicely for me, for a very light pale face.</li>
            <li>I bought this alongside with  Manic Panic&#x27;s &amp;#34;Virgin&amp;#34; Pressed White Powder which is 100x better.</li>
            <li>First of all, the product says press powder</li>
            <li>I love the white to balance out my contouring.</li>
            <li>will be back for more soon</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a light shade that would naturally blend with my skin.</li>
            <li>thank you for that my son buoght this and other stuff with his own money</li>
            <li>My face is super freckled but it managed to cover them almost completely.</li>
            <li>and it was very flakey, and I lost a lot of product that way.</li>
            <li>Worked really well for my Harley Quinn cosplay.</li>
            <li>It made my face super white which was the point</li>
            <li>I initially bought this to help pale out my already fair complexion for a Halloween look.</li>
            <li>If you have really dense sections of freckles on your face, it might not disappear them completely without using something else on them before applying this powder.</li>
            <li>I only use it to blend, its a little work to blend, but if your buying it for its intended purpose, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>you are looking for a new sealed package of pressed powder, do not buy this.</li>
            <li>It works well and really comes out white.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented, and takes just a little bit to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>Definitely Made our Halloween looks complete!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy with either the applicator or a brush and is a solid pale white.</li>
            <li>You really need to use a lot to get the desired look, and even then it looks like you are covered in powder, even if you do a wet application.</li>
            <li>It is good, and very creepy to use, but I just wish it would apply easier, rather than putting multiple coats on.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s such a big container compared to an eyeshadow, so it&#x27;s going to last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Would not use it on a daily basis was not very flattering for the skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you are looking for a very light, transparent, pressed powder this is the one for you, but this was not suitable for my needs as dramatic costume makeup.</li>
            <li> but it makes you skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Not for the average person, this stuff is WHITE.</li>
            <li> but I was sent loose powder.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> The product arrived entirely crushed in the container.</li>
            <li> This is my new beauty secret</li>
            <li> I feel like the powder is too hard and feels low quality.</li>
            <li> This powder is as white as the zinc lifeguards wear on their noses, seriously.</li>
            <li> The one I usually bought had a price increase to $20+</li>
            <li> Very uneven coverage</li>
            <li> My skin is very pale</li>
            <li> but it looked insanely powdery and accentuated any patches of dry skin.</li>

            <li> I bought the &amp;#34;Supernatural Pressed Powder&amp;#34; in &amp;#34;Spectral&amp;#34; for costume makeup. I feel like the powder is too hard and feels low quality. You really need to use a lot to get the desired look, and even then it looks like you are covered in powder, even if you do a wet application. I bought this alongside with  Manic Panic&#x27;s &amp;#34;Virgin&amp;#34; Pressed White Powder which is 100x better. It goes on very smooth and is much more opaque than this one. If you are looking for a white facial powder I recommend buying that one instead of this. Perhaps if you are looking for a very light, transparent, pressed powder this is the one for you, but this was not suitable for my needs as dramatic costume makeup.</li>
            <li> I used this for Morticia Addams makeup and it worked beautifully. Goes on easy with either the applicator or a brush and is a solid pale white. My face is super freckled but it managed to cover them almost completely. It tends to set in after wearing it awhile so they would start to show through again but when I used a primer before applying, the coverage was unbroken. Rubs off easily though if you are prone to touch your face a lot. If you have really dense sections of freckles on your face, it might not disappear them completely without using something else on them before applying this powder.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a white contour powder. The one I usually bought had a price increase to $20+ and it was very flakey, and I lost a lot of product that way. This goes on very smooth and its just as described in color. White!! If I was using this as an all over product, it would stay in place and even have a good amount of coverage. I only use it to blend, its a little work to blend, but if your buying it for its intended purpose, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> First of all, the product says press powder but I was sent loose powder. The powder container  wasn&#x27;t even sealed in any way, so it could have been used for all I know. Last but not least,it was shipped from the seller not Amazon: seller just wrapped it in a plastic bag in a mailer envelope so it came open during shipping and the package was a powdery mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new sealed package of pressed powder, do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I love the white to balance out my contouring. I wish it had more coverage though.</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween makeup. My skin is very pale so I tried to use it as regular makeup but it looked insanely powdery and accentuated any patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very uneven coverage and it gets cakey and gross on your face in the heat. This product did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> It is good, and very creepy to use, but I just wish it would apply easier, rather than putting multiple coats on.</li>
            <li> The product arrived entirely crushed in the container. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Not for the average person, this stuff is WHITE. And silky smooth.. just be sure to apply with a brush.</li>
            <li> Beautiful undead tone.  I recommend this over a very fair cream for a porcelain effect. Can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very smooth powder</li>
            <li> I am usually very critical of cheap makeup, but this is AMAZING!!!! It is very pigmented, and takes just a little bit to cover your whole face. It arrived on time, wrapped in cute tissue paper, and even had a hand written note on the receipt thanking me for buying from them. Best powder I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Arrived smashed to pieces when I opened it all of the powder fell all over the place.</li>
            <li> great and didn&#x27;t arrive broke or busted thank you for that my son buoght this and other stuff with his own money will be back for more soon</li>
            <li> Looked and worked as advertised. Would definitely order again!  Keep up the good work. Definitely Made our Halloween looks complete!</li>
            <li> I initially bought this to help pale out my already fair complexion for a Halloween look. As time went on I decided to try it as an eyeshadow. It&#x27;s the perfect matte highlight for under my brows. I use it 90% of the time. It&#x27;s such a big container compared to an eyeshadow, so it&#x27;s going to last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> So, this powder is not meant to be used as an everyday makeup,  unless you&#x27;re straight gothin it up. The picture is not just of the compact, but the portion underneath the poof is actually that white. Although I am very fair skinned, I&#x27;m not going for a geisha look whatsover. I was hoping for a light shade that would naturally blend with my skin. This powder is as white as the zinc lifeguards wear on their noses, seriously.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product !!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my goth look. The sponge works nicely for me, for a very light pale face. It is great that it has a mirror and a drawer for the sponge. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last. Lasts through the day</li>
            <li> Perfect. Worked really well for my Harley Quinn cosplay.</li>
            <li> Very nice product I used this for my costume on Halloween. It works well and really comes out white.</li>
            <li> I bought is powder to use as a highlighter for when I&#x27;m contouring my face and this works perfectly. I love this powder and will defiantly order again when I run out</li>
            <li> It made my face super white which was the point but it makes you skin dry and flaky. Would not use it on a daily basis was not very flattering for the skin. But for a costume it was good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a cheap highlighting powder and it works perfectly! This is my new beauty secret my cheek bones have never been this defined :)</li>
