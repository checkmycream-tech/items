    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li>I found it to be excellent.  </li>
            <li>Nothing prevented it, at best it treated the symptoms, but it wasn&#x27;t solving the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is the best.</li>
            <li>AMAZING!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>the results are wonderful for my combination skin type.</li>
            <li>Great product, very happy with my results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great soap to use.</li>
            <li>The smell is great as well.</li>
            <li>There is also a nano cleanser for acne prone skin which is also great when needed.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This Nano silver soap is good but not a miracle maker for this price.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>While it did do a nice job of fading brown spots, it made me break out which is why I will have to stop using this.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing feeling to be able to count on my skin looking presentable.</li>
            <li>That said, I do feel you get a good clean from the soap</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it and have never used a product that works so well.</li>
            <li>I am IN LOVE with this face wash.</li>
            <li>You know this one is potent because you can feel it tingling on the skin..</li>
            <li>This product does everything it claims to and more.  </li>
            <li>and I have never felt better about the way my skin feels on my face.</li>
            <li>Magic would be another word for this product.</li>
            <li>After reading so many rave reviews of how this soap has cleared even cystic acne, I decided to give it a whirl to see if it could help with my spate of midlife acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I was able to find this soap online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but once you get a routine down it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I have been using nano cyclic soap for two weeks now, and my skin feels so smooth and</li>
            <li>After I wash my face, it makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It refines your skin to clean and moisturize all in one.  </li>
            <li>Compared to Cor, Cyclic is \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; and somewhat greasy and just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting my skin as clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my face clear and healthy!</li>
            <li>But in its special case.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require special handling</li>
            <li>Does dissolve quickly.  </li>
            <li>now and it has lightened up the melasma and fading tremendously.</li>
            <li>Takes a few times to master the application - but it is great.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh, and you can noticeably tell it works by how your skin feels just after one wash.    </li>
            <li>I use it for my face (some people use it for other problem areas, and maybe Cyclic is good for that, but not so much for the face).  </li>
            <li>recommeded this item to several friends and they love it as well</li>
            <li>noticed results within the first week of using this.</li>
            <li>I wasted some good $$ on Cyclic that I could have applied to my Cor purchase.  </li>
            <li>I do have to use a more emollient moisturizer at night to keep my skin from becoming too dry, but who cares, my skin is finally clear.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle, foams really well and gets all my makeup off.</li>
            <li>This cleanser really helped take care of that.  </li>
            <li>It really helps stop the blemish in its tracks and reduces the redness.</li>
            <li>, I think I have expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>While I liked the way it felt and smelled, after a few weeks I was getting blackheads that would become inflamed.  </li>
            <li>The two stubborn cycstic zits were completely gone by the end of the first week.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to buy any product to help your skin, I highly suggest buying Cyclic nano cleanser.</li>
            <li>So about 2 months ago I had bought the trial size of one of these to combat my acne and oilyness, the first day I used it I broke out a little on my cheek but the redness in my face was immediately reduced and my skin felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>It really helped clear up my skin from breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and helped clear up my middle aged acne flair-up - and without having to pay hundreds of dollars on facials.  </li>
            <li>But the extra effort is worth it as my skin,and my rosacea, is under control and looks radiant.</li>
            <li>Just DO NOT rub it in skin like a normal soap.  </li>
            <li>The store that I normally purchased it from went out of business.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Reordering a new one now...</li>
            <li>so if you have tried all the other acne products and prescriptions from dermatologists without success please try this!</li>
            <li>My skin was clear while using this (trial size lasted a month)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, I did not attribute this completely to the cleanser, I thought the supplements were the miracle.</li>
            <li>And it has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>By the end of the first month I had only gotten one tiny clogged pore pimple around that time of the month.  </li>
            <li>It had been several months since my skin had been clear, and being in my early 30&#x27;s with a professional job that requires a lot of social interaction I was humiliated by skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 42 year old female, oily to normal skin, asian.</li>
            <li>I do still get a 1 or 2 small and quick to disappear zits a month during my period, but that&#x27;s it, and</li>
            <li>Cor made my face feel squeaky clean, whereas the Cyclic soap made my face feel like it was coated with something, even long after it dried.  </li>
            <li>The results I got were honestly no better than the ones I have had using Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean cream.</li>
            <li>After a week my skin was completely rid of acne, I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and no new breakouts, no oil</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t do this it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> products are expensive, so don&#x27;t be cheap like me and just spend the extra $$ and get the Cor.</li>
            <li> After a single application of Cyclic, the redness diminished and within a week the entire thing seemed like it had never happened.</li>
            <li> I kept in the dish in a dry place, but simply lathering seemed to make it melt away WAY faster than other soaps, even other clear glycerine soaps.</li>
            <li> I tried both the sample size pink and silver for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I always take it out of the shower and rest it on a soap rack with slats to allow it to dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin well with absolutely no drying out but beware--if you leave it in the shower it will melt away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and have been using another product - it cleared up my skin but dried it out and didn&#x27;t control the oil (and bleached all my towels).</li>
            <li> I have tried several other priducts that have made my skin worse but this soap has made my skin come back AWSOME!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got them to fade brown spots since this is common for asian skin.</li>
            <li> Now there is few other brands who sell nano silver soap for less than half of this price.</li>
            <li> my break outs are getting less.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year and half.  </li>
            <li> I use Paula&#x27;s Choice bha 9 on those little ones and they disappear in a day.  </li>
            <li> Even as an overnight blemish or pimple zapper you just put a little of the foam on problem areas and in the morning its almost gone.</li>
            <li> but this cleanser left my skin radiant without irritating it.</li>
            <li> so you know you are not getting heavy toxins on your skin.</li>
            <li> So, I tried \\&quot;Cyclic\\&quot; and was disappointed right out of the gate.  </li>
            <li> When i finally stumbled upon this I had been in bad shape for a while with two giant cystic zits that had been there for weeks.  </li>
            <li> After I developed rosacea from medications I was a very unhappy person.</li>
            <li> to not have to worry about big unsightly painful lumps cropping up at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using Cor silver soap but didn&#x27;t like how expensive it was.  </li>
            <li> , wrong!</li>
            <li> The redness and itchy painful rash was making me crazy.</li>
            <li> a year ago my skin was so bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using nano cyclic soap for two weeks now, and my skin feels so smooth and my break outs are getting less. It&#x27;s a great soap to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! After I developed rosacea from medications I was a very unhappy person. The redness and itchy painful rash was making me crazy. After a single application of Cyclic, the redness diminished and within a week the entire thing seemed like it had never happened. This is an expensive product and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleans my skin well with absolutely no drying out but beware--if you leave it in the shower it will melt away. I always take it out of the shower and rest it on a soap rack with slats to allow it to dry thoroughly. If you don&#x27;t do this it won&#x27;t last long. But the extra effort is worth it as my skin,and my rosacea, is under control and looks radiant.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! It is so gentle, foams really well and gets all my makeup off. It really helped clear up my skin from breakouts. I used to suffer from  clogged pores, blackheads and cystic acne. This cleanser really helped take care of that.  If I see a blemish developing I use the cleanser as a spot treatment and leave it on for  5 minutes or so. It really helps stop the blemish in its tracks and reduces the redness. I got my sister hooked on this stuff too!</li>
            <li> I wish I could comment on the cumulative effects of this product on my skin, but it melted away in about 5 uses. I kept in the dish in a dry place, but simply lathering seemed to make it melt away WAY faster than other soaps, even other clear glycerine soaps. At this price, it should last a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have had to deal with breakouts my entire life. I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and have been using another product - it cleared up my skin but dried it out and didn&#x27;t control the oil (and bleached all my towels). This cleanser is different. My skin looks fantastic! It drastically reduced my oily-shine and shrunk my pores. I love it and have never used a product that works so well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!! After I wash my face, it makes my skin silky smooth. The smell is great as well. Definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but this cleanser left my skin radiant without irritating it. Just DO NOT rub it in skin like a normal soap.  And avoid the eye area. Awesome product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I used this for two months.  While I liked the way it felt and smelled, after a few weeks I was getting blackheads that would become inflamed.  I stopped using it and they went away.</li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE with this face wash. I use to purchase it off another website over a year ago but its double the price compared to buying it off amazon. I have oily skin and I find a lot of cleansers don&#x27;t get to the root of the problem with my breakouts. I had to go on accutane over a year ago my skin was so bad. I did not use this product while on accutane because it was too drying on my skin, but now that I&#x27;ve been off it for a year I am using it again. It smells fresh, and you can noticeably tell it works by how your skin feels just after one wash.    If you are going to buy any product to help your skin, I highly suggest buying Cyclic nano cleanser. It is something I don&#x27;t think I can go without ever again!</li>
            <li> You know this one is potent because you can feel it tingling on the skin..</li>
            <li> So about 2 months ago I had bought the trial size of one of these to combat my acne and oilyness, the first day I used it I broke out a little on my cheek but the redness in my face was immediately reduced and my skin felt so smooth. I also began using different supplements at the time too. After a week my skin was completely rid of acne, I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and no new breakouts, no oil, I did not attribute this completely to the cleanser, I thought the supplements were the miracle. My skin was clear while using this (trial size lasted a month) and I am the type of person to get cystic acne. Well I used up the trial size and didn&#x27;t reorder it because I thought the supplements were what helped my acne, wrong! My face started getting oily again and breaking out! Reordering a new one now... so if you have tried all the other acne products and prescriptions from dermatologists without success please try this!</li>
            <li> This product does everything it claims to and more.  I found it to be excellent.  It refines your skin to clean and moisturize all in one.  And it has all natural ingredients so you know you are not getting heavy toxins on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was using Cor silver soap but didn&#x27;t like how expensive it was.  So, I tried \\&quot;Cyclic\\&quot; and was disappointed right out of the gate.  Compared to Cor, Cyclic is \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; and somewhat greasy and just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting my skin as clean. I use it for my face (some people use it for other problem areas, and maybe Cyclic is good for that, but not so much for the face).  Cor made my face feel squeaky clean, whereas the Cyclic soap made my face feel like it was coated with something, even long after it dried.  Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products are expensive, so don&#x27;t be cheap like me and just spend the extra $$ and get the Cor. I wasted some good $$ on Cyclic that I could have applied to my Cor purchase.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> This Nano silver soap is good but not a miracle maker for this price. Now there is few other brands who sell nano silver soap for less than half of this price. I have tried Cyclic for 1 month and it helped my skin just a bit, I think I have expected more from this product.</li>
            <li> recommeded this item to several friends and they love it as well</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year and half.  When i finally stumbled upon this I had been in bad shape for a while with two giant cystic zits that had been there for weeks.  It had been several months since my skin had been clear, and being in my early 30&#x27;s with a professional job that requires a lot of social interaction I was humiliated by skin.  I had tried everything including seeing a dermatologist and going on extended antibiotics, putting benzyl peroxide and salicylic acid on my skin every day. Nothing prevented it, at best it treated the symptoms, but it wasn&#x27;t solving the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed results within the first week of using this. The two stubborn cycstic zits were completely gone by the end of the first week.  By the end of the first month I had only gotten one tiny clogged pore pimple around that time of the month.  I haven&#x27;t had another cystic zit since October of 2012.  I do still get a 1 or 2 small and quick to disappear zits a month during my period, but that&#x27;s it, and I use Paula&#x27;s Choice bha 9 on those little ones and they disappear in a day.  It is an amazing feeling to be able to count on my skin looking presentable. to not have to worry about big unsightly painful lumps cropping up at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this 2xs a day, morning and night, for about 1 minute per session.  I do have to use a more emollient moisturizer at night to keep my skin from becoming too dry, but who cares, my skin is finally clear.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nano cyclic for over 2 years and I have never felt better about the way my skin feels on my face. Even as an overnight blemish or pimple zapper you just put a little of the foam on problem areas and in the morning its almost gone. Magic would be another word for this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy with my results. We&#x27;ll be buying this product again</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!  It is amazing and helped clear up my middle aged acne flair-up - and without having to pay hundreds of dollars on facials.  Takes a few times to master the application - but it is great.  Does dissolve quickly.  So store properly.  NOT IN SHOWER.  But in its special case.</li>
            <li> I am 42 year old female, oily to normal skin, asian. I tried both the sample size pink and silver for several weeks. I got them to fade brown spots since this is common for asian skin. While it did do a nice job of fading brown spots, it made me break out which is why I will have to stop using this.</li>
            <li> I have melasma and have been using this soap for about 6mo. now and it has lightened up the melasma and fading tremendously. I have tried several other priducts that have made my skin worse but this soap has made my skin come back AWSOME!!!!!!! product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for almost 10 years now. It is the best. It doesn&#x27;t require special handling but once you get a routine down it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> One word... AMAZING!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading so many rave reviews of how this soap has cleared even cystic acne, I decided to give it a whirl to see if it could help with my spate of midlife acne. The results I got were honestly no better than the ones I have had using Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean cream. That said, I do feel you get a good clean from the soap and I think there has been improvement in the evenness of my skin tone after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I was able to find this soap online at a reasonable price. The store that I normally purchased it from went out of business.&lt;br /&gt;This soap thoroughly cleans your face and when combined with my Clarisonic Mia 2 facial brush...the results are wonderful for my combination skin type. There is also a nano cleanser for acne prone skin which is also great when needed.</li>
            <li> Makes my face clear and healthy!</li>
