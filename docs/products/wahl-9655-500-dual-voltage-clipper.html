    <ol>
            <li>the best clipper i have ever owned!!!</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s a pro since ideally I would never adjust the length on that(skin</li>
            <li>This product preformed great.</li>
            <li>good  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;just would have liked it to be be wireless-</li>
            <li>If there is ever a problem with these clippers, I&#x27;ll be sure to pick up another one.</li>
            <li>This machine is strictly for haircuts on the top of your head.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: it&#x27;s okay for travel or occassional use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light for a travel clipper, but I&#x27;m not convinced I get as good a trim as with my heavier, more professional model at home.</li>
            <li>It runs and sounds fine.</li>
            <li>great for travel, works with different currents</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for many years and I have used lots of different trimmers.</li>
            <li>: It stopped working after a month, Amazon was kind enough to refund !</li>
            <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>No having to select the right voltage and worrying about blowing it up.</li>
            <li>I have owned a wahl clipper for over 15 years and has always performed perfectly, but lately it has unsharpened and thus I sought to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li>Super light ,sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>eager to find out how many years will this last</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very quiet and my favorite part is its dual voltage.</li>
            <li>Works ok but seems like it is a bit underpowered, especially when trying to cut thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I expected more from Wahl.  </li>
            <li>The product works in that respect but does not cut hair very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clperis very noisy once operated and doesn&#x27;t cut the hair evenly.</li>
            <li>I usually cut my own hair, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>Its work good for 10 Seconds only , then it start to not cut hair at all and leave my son crying from pain.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are dual voltage (110-220v, 50-60Hz) which is nice, and a lot quieter than when I put 110v clippers on a voltage step down transformer back home.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was pleased with a single voltage beard trimmer I bought from the same company.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, although this product comes with many, many trimming guides, none of them trim short enough to be useful for beard work.</li>
            <li>If I had it to do again I would spend the money for better 110 volt clippers and would have gone to Radio Shack and spent $30 for the voltage transformer to use overseas when necessary.</li>
            <li>I have even been able to use it on my kids hair and they usually give me problems when we go to a professional barber shop.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay device for trimming but not suitable for head shaving.</li>
            <li>It has to be frequently oiled to cut at all and feels and looks so cheap that I doubt it will last very long.</li>
            <li>Haircut was professional and quick.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>When it arrived the first thing I noticed were all the plastic accesories were of a very inferior quality than my previous clipper.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I travel frequently overseas and wanted duel-voltage clippers that I could plug directly into my outlet converter without needing the use of a current voltage transformer.</li>
            <li>Cut very sharp and fast.</li>
            <li>Plastic accesories arrived with comb edges twisted, made of a very cheap plastic.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay device for trimming but not suitable for head shaving.</li>
            <li> Initially got these to replace some I left back home. I usually cut my own hair, nothing fancy. These clippers are dual voltage (110-220v, 50-60Hz) which is nice, and a lot quieter than when I put 110v clippers on a voltage step down transformer back home. There is no adjustment for the depth of the clipper, but there are a variety of guards and guides you can add on. For me, it&#x27;s a pro since ideally I would never adjust the length on that(skin the head all around), but for some other people, it might be a feature you are looking for that isn&#x27;t there.  Compared to some other hair cutting kits, its a little lacking, no scissors, or a bib/cape for hair, but overall, I enjoy it. If there is ever a problem with these clippers, I&#x27;ll be sure to pick up another one.</li>
            <li> It runs and sounds fine.But will not cut any hair,not one strand.Blades are very sharp but for some reason they do not cut at all.</li>
            <li> Super light ,sharp and easy to use.Haircut was professional and quick.&lt;br /&gt;Just eager to find out how many years will this last but the product quality looks ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It stopped working after a month, Amazon was kind enough to refund !</li>
            <li> Cut very sharp and fast. No noise.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived on time and can work on both voltage.&lt;br /&gt;Bad is the lubrication needed.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son because he will be traveling abroad.  He tried it out on his face to buzz down his beard and it barely took anything off.  This was on the lowest setting without any guards.  He had to go over the same spot over a few times to get anything off.  I returned and will be looking for a different clipper for him.</li>
            <li> 6 months and they already broke. I expected more from Wahl.  I bought some from costco before and they lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was pleased with a single voltage beard trimmer I bought from the same company. I needed a dual voltage unit for international travel, so I ordered this one. Unfortunately, although this product comes with many, many trimming guides, none of them trim short enough to be useful for beard work. This machine is strictly for haircuts on the top of your head.</li>
            <li> the best clipper i have ever owned!!!</li>
            <li> Its work good for 10 Seconds only , then it start to not cut hair at all and leave my son crying from pain.  In addition, Made in china not USA.   Big name but bad item, dont buy.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for many years and I have used lots of different trimmers. This one is by far my favorite. It cuts well, it&#x27;s very quiet and my favorite part is its dual voltage. And auto-selecting dual voltage at that! No having to select the right voltage and worrying about blowing it up. I have even been able to use it on my kids hair and they usually give me problems when we go to a professional barber shop.  I would definitely buy this again if anything happens to the one I currently have.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I travel frequently overseas and wanted duel-voltage clippers that I could plug directly into my outlet converter without needing the use of a current voltage transformer. This is required for countries that use 220v vs: 110v such as England and Ireland. The product works in that respect but does not cut hair very well. It has to be frequently oiled to cut at all and feels and looks so cheap that I doubt it will last very long. I would not buy another. If I had it to do again I would spend the money for better 110 volt clippers and would have gone to Radio Shack and spent $30 for the voltage transformer to use overseas when necessary.</li>
            <li> WAHL IS KNOWN FOR PRODUCING HAIR CLIPPERS, IN THE PAST THEY HAVE BEEN VERY LOUD, THIS MODEL HAS A SLIM LOOK, IS VERY QUIET, HAS DUAL VOLTAGE SO IT CAN BE USED WHERE EVER I AM, IN THE STATES AND EUROPE.&lt;br /&gt;IT MEETS ALL EXPECTATIONS...WOULD RECOMMENDED TO ALL MY FRIENDS...THANK YOU WAHL</li>
            <li> Have had this clipper for about six months and used it twice a week for four weeks in the UK. It&#x27;s nice and light for a travel clipper, but I&#x27;m not convinced I get as good a trim as with my heavier, more professional model at home. Bottom line: it&#x27;s okay for travel or occassional use.</li>
            <li> This product preformed great. Hard to vind dual voltage clippers in this country, but these preformed as well the the 110V clippers I used for years.</li>
            <li> good  i like it&lt;br /&gt;works well&lt;br /&gt;just would have liked it to be be wireless- thats will be for next time</li>
            <li> I have owned a wahl clipper for over 15 years and has always performed perfectly, but lately it has unsharpened and thus I sought to replace it with a new one. When it arrived the first thing I noticed were all the plastic accesories were of a very inferior quality than my previous clipper. Plastic accesories arrived with comb edges twisted, made of a very cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt; Other than this, the machine perfomed well, although I don&#x27;t expect it to last for nearly as long as my previous clipper.</li>
            <li> This clipper qualifies to be the cheapest on the market. the plastic is all crooked up. The blades hardly fit on the trimmer and the intruction manual could not be worse, generic to almost all products they have and does not help you at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clperis very noisy once operated and doesn&#x27;t cut the hair evenly. The 3 mm blade cut my hair at about 5 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying a Wahl product, I should have got Remington. I would have returned it except that I had to use the day i got it, couldn&#x27;t wait on a hair cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m traveling and come from an area where 120V is the norm. But where I&#x27;m at now for a couple months uses 220V. These clippers let me cut my hair without having to haul around a clunky converter, or risk burning out the 120V clippers I already have.</li>
            <li> great for travel, works with different currents</li>
            <li> These clippers are good in the fact that they are dual voltage, however they are very bad for cutting a military style cut. The blade does not move so you cannot get close to the skin. Would not recommend purchasing if you are in the military seeking a tight cut. For anyone else then this product might work for you.</li>
            <li> Works ok but seems like it is a bit underpowered, especially when trying to cut thicker hair.</li>
