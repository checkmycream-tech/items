            <li>Really good facial brush.</li>

            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t seem to lose bristles- even after multiple washes) and its nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>

            <li>Nice brush but its a bit too harsh to use on my face</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem sturdy and and really get your facial cleaner/soap/whatever to lather very very well.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for the more delicate parts of my body when I drybrush in the morning- mainly my ears and</li>
            <li>For the first use, it felt a little harsh and stiff even though I was applying no pressure, but it was mostly on the more sensitive areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I should like it too because it has hard bristles but holds up better.</li>

            <li> I really like this brush. A lot. It works great and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would break easily like another one I purchased on here. The bristles seem sturdy and and really get your facial cleaner/soap/whatever to lather very very well. I am impressed that such a lowcost item works better than a lot of more expensive ones. I highly recommend this brush. It leaves your skin feeling soft too. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face again!</li>
            <li> It cracked after a few days :(</li>
            <li> Nice brush but its a bit too harsh to use on my face which is what I bought it for. Not meant to get wet as it is wood and will start to rot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wood, it&#x27;s solid, it works. I would love to see a string or hole on the handle side of this brush so that I can easily hang it from my shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small size of this brush also makes it useful as a bath brush for hands, feet, and cuticle areas.</li>
            <li> Had a plastic brush before with nylon bristles which was alright.  It eventually broke and so I found this one.  The price is the best I could find online, and the quality is great.  I was afraid it was going to be soft like a shaving brush but it is a real sturdy &#x27;scratchy&#x27; brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it everynight, and so far she likes it, has not caused any problems to her skin. It exfolliates and brushes nicely, depending on the force you give it of course. It is good quality and great price.</li>
            <li> Ok I love face brushes and I love them even better when the bristles are stiff and not too soft...this brush is that! It was almost too hard at first but just start off gentle and it will work itself out. It really cleans my face and pores and I feel like it really exfoliates! The only problem is that soon as I got the brush, it was shedding and plus after the first use, some of the bristles were smushed down! I was trying to be cheap going for a good bristle brush but I went ahead and invested in the Bass natural bristle brush for $13. I should like it too because it has hard bristles but holds up better.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use it every now and then after washing and drying my face to get rid off some of the extra, dead skin cells. It doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin, it&#x27;s gentle and firm at the same time. My skin is really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Love using this brush .... but was a little disappointed on its small size, but it gets the job done .. just takes a little longer</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting.  If I were to make a circle by touching my thumb to my pointer finger, that is about how big the brush part of it is.  It is good quality.  Very practical.  The only thing that threw me off is I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the boar bristles.  But that is just me and I got used to it.  I have had it about a month and I half.  Its still working well.</li>
            <li> I was so exited to receive this brush for the intention of using it on my face. Once I got the product i used it that night, and the bristles were so hard it hurt to use. The worst part, the next day the wood on the brush handle was already getting moldy! Eww! Don&#x27;t recommend this buy!</li>
            <li> Really good facial brush. Deep cleans but study no hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush for the price. I have noticed some of the bristles coming out; not enough to make a difference but it speaks about the quality of the brush. However for 6 bucks one can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for a few weeks now and I really like it.  I would be careful using it if you have very sensitive skin as it&#x27;s a little rough.  I do use it in the shower wet and haven&#x27;t had any problems yet.  I actually run it through the dishwasher once a week to disinfect.  I only use a few times a week mainly after working out as my face always feels really gross after.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts.</li>
            <li> This facial brush has the perfect amount of stiffness in the bristles to give my face a good scrub and open up my pores before deeply moisturizing. Just what  I have been looking for. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for the more delicate parts of my body when I drybrush in the morning- mainly my ears and breasts.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very sturdy (it doesn&#x27;t seem to lose bristles- even after multiple washes) and its nice and gentle. Love it.</li>
            <li> This brush came so fast, I ordered in on Tuesday and it arrived on Thursday from California to Connecticut! It fits very comfortably in my hand so I have no problems controlling the brush and getting to all areas of my face. For the first use, it felt a little harsh and stiff even though I was applying no pressure, but it was mostly on the more sensitive areas of my face. It exfoliated very well and my skin was very smooth and supple after using the brush. Worth the 4 bucks, and with free shipping you can&#x27;t really lose.</li>
            <li> using this brush cause my skin to become rough and scaly I had to stop and now I&#x27;m using the Clarisonic brush which is improve my skin</li>
            <li> Nice and firm, but gentle on face. My skin looks great after just a few weeks of use. A few bristles were lose and some had fallen out in the package, but I believe this is normal shedding of a new product with natural bristles...it doesn&#x27;t shed now and is holding up well.</li>
