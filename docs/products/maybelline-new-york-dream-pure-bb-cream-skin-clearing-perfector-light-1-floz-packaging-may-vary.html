            <li>Goes on smoothly, stays on all day and works perfect with my makeup</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I thought it was magic!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>nice product..</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup that i own.</li>
            <li>Btw, I have the light shade (Which I thought was surprising because I have always believed I was light/medium).</li>
            <li>This makeup is perfect, I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so blending in is very important.</li>
            <li>Smooth and does it&#x27;s job !</li>
            <li>lOve.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Caused more breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Caused face</li>
            <li>to be more oily</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Maybelline&#x27;s BB cream.</li>
            <li>The color was terrific,the coverage also good,and they might be could reduce acne,however they don&#x27;t have any sun protect,so you need more sunscreen to protect the sun harm.</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>I love how the stuff helps out with your breakouts instead of just covering it up.</li>
            <li>LOVE THAT.</li>
            <li>But it had gotten better and it works as a spot treatment/concealer for blemishes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will always be my go to light coverage foundation!</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;honestly, coverage-wise, I would rather wear my revlon colorstay foundation just because it looks better than this when on my skin</li>
            <li>The coverage is light, but you can layer more on to intensify coverage.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but this is just as good as the high end products I use.</li>
            <li>I liked this at first, I had no problems but as time went on my skin became irritated</li>
            <li>product is not totally bad, it just needs more improvement.</li>
            <li>but once i blended it in it worked fine</li>
            <li>Anyway, the color matched and the coverage at first is great, but with someone who has really oily skin</li>
            <li>light coverage</li>
            <li>goes on so smooth and light, but evens out skin so well.</li>
            <li>The coverage is light.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth what you pay for it, and I paid much more for it at CVS.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I go through it rather quickly and the coverage is light.</li>
            <li>so, being someone with mild acne problems, I was excited to run across this product.</li>
            <li>I suspect the need to apply more than once would come up if I was being active, but as a just chillin&#x27; kind of day, it was great in an only once application.</li>
            <li>This actually has pretty good coverage and feels really light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, goes on smooth, and blends really well.</li>
            <li>will definitely be buying more when this tube runs out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Pure BB cream with sunscreen in it for years</li>
            <li>I bought medium and the match was perfect compared to the medium/deep I use with other regular maybelline bb cream.  </li>
            <li>Like the other product, it&#x27;s nice and lightweight and matches my light skintone</li>
            <li>light, not thick or goopy feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li>nice light coverage, true blend to skin tone, no breaking out, and just enough moisturizing, I will definitely be ordering this again.  </li>
            <li>As much as I would like to say I love this product, I actually found myself getting more oily with this product on my face, and I even got more acne though I figure that is due to the acne fighting ingredient pulling my dirt to the surface.</li>
            <li>Things like bareminerals and Laura Geller are very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I had an okay experience overall with this product, if you have oily to combination skin like I do here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The acne medicine in it made me break out at first.</li>
            <li>My first ever foundation is this exact type.</li>
            <li>,it looks like some one threw a pot of hot water on my face</li>
            <li>I loved the coverage, although I believe it is a light-medium type coverage, so if you&#x27;re looking for something heavy, I would go with something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing clears zits with two uses and really blends for a light clean feeling but is very small</li>
            <li>So far this is the foundation that has worked best for me (limited time to get ready), my location (hot and humid) and my skin type (oil central).</li>
            <li>depending on how much coverage I want, I use the right one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice that it helps my acne, but I don&#x27;t think it makes it worse, which is good!</li>
            <li>Like this a lot, very light application and easy but enough coverage for me (like it to be very natural but enough to blur blemishes, etc).</li>
            <li>I saw this one and wanted to see if it really works.</li>
            <li>Blends into my skin really well.  </li>
            <li>It also covers up the redness in my skin REALLY well, which is something I hadn&#x27;t found in a BB cream until now.</li>
            <li>Covers redness very well.</li>
            <li>It also matches my skin tone and blends really well.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t reflective of any product, my skin is just that much of a pain.</li>
            <li>My face also looks much smoother, even in daylight:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to wear alone for everyday and under foundation for nights out.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter loves this product for an everyday, natural look (great for school days).</li>
            <li>I use 2 layers now because I am having a little bit more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally get cystic acne before or during my cycle and haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my new go to makeup choice.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin,dermatitis and eczema</li>
            <li>It is pretty lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey film like a lot of regular foundations.</li>
            <li>its pretty sheer coverage (it is a bb cream not a foundation) but it lasts all day &amp; it cancels out redness</li>
            <li>I apply this in the morning with a wet sponge, this way it doesn&#x27;t go on cakey, and I prefer a more natural look since makeup does inevitably melt away by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>However,  check prices at your local drugstore first.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty accurate and not super sheer.</li>
            <li>I have minor, occasional breakouts, and my skin is not all that smooth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Finally found a lightweight foundation that is actually helping clear up acne with a smooth non-noticeable overall even color.</li>
            <li>, i know i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Evens out the skin tone but still looks natural.</li>
            <li>I am an extremely pale person, and many foundations turn orange or yellow tinted on me, but this one did not.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be keeping this in my makeup case; it&#x27;s a new staple!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, again with the wet sponge, or it will get cakey, lasts a good bit of time, and I overall like it.</li>
            <li>I find that later in the day I go back and see that it has oxidized and created a very tacky appearance.</li>
            <li>I make this even thinner by mixing it with moisturizer for a natural daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li>The thickness of this BB cream is in between a concealer and foundation thickness which works well for me because it is not too thick and not too light.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed it making my acne worse like most makeup does, so</li>
            <li>One star off just because if you are outside sweating in very hot weather, it does get a little oily.</li>
            <li>color is a really great match for my skintone, and is also helping to control the small amount of blemishes I usually get due to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>and this does not dry me out.</li>
            <li>I had a recent breakout, and the minor blemishes I had yesterday are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>It has just enough coverage for minor blemishes---it&#x27;s not a solution for concealing major breakouts.</li>

            <li> I highly suggest you purchase something that doesn&#x27;t have all of the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the price on amazon changes much, but when I bought this it was way cheaper than at my drugstore</li>
            <li> No new break outs either.  </li>
            <li> This foundation lasts nearly all day, if I required a touch up, it would probably be around dinner time, but I can get away with just blotting and brushing some loose powder on usually.</li>
            <li> I bought this for about $2 less than the current advertised price ($8.99)</li>
            <li> Any extra can be covered by a little powder</li>
            <li> but it was lighter than i expected</li>
            <li> Coverage is minimal</li>
            <li> but the first time i thought it was my wax that i applied on my facial hairs and have gotten a bad rash on my face around the nose, above my lips and chin</li>
            <li> I usually use the regular one with no salicylic acid in it.</li>
            <li> I prefer to mix a small bit into my regular non-tinted face lotion.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other brand.</li>
            <li> That said, this one doesn&#x27;t do what all sorts of other foundations, BB creams, CC creams, etc do.</li>
            <li> I can hardly feel it on my skin and it does seem to help the occasional acne I get on my face.</li>
            <li> Works well so far, doesn&#x27;t cover very well and mixes badly with green concealer.</li>
            <li> As for the acne fighting element, I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping, but I then don&#x27;t wear it very often (usually only when I&#x27;m having a bad outbreak)</li>
            <li> Dewy as the day goes on but not super oily.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t blend into the dryer areas of my skin nearly as well and ends up looking cakey in places, a problem I never had with the other cream.</li>
            <li> but no matter how little I use, it looks cakey.</li>
            <li> hate seeing young girls with overdone, caked-on foundation, and she hates going out barefaced when she has blemishes: this BB cream is a compromise we can both live with.</li>
            <li> My acne cleared up within a few days of using this product.</li>
            <li> one of the few things that work with my face</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I need a simple and quick morning routine, but I also have seriously oily skin that usually makes any foundation worthless.</li>
            <li> And the Add-On program on Amazon has it around $5.00 which is cheaper than anywhere else in-store (at least where I live).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is light, so my face doesn&#x27;t feel disgusting and dirty all day long.</li>
            <li> When this was on my face it sate weird and became itchy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of a drug store brand</li>
            <li> and I hate the feeling of heavy makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> and I broke out really bad.</li>
            <li> it hurts and itches really bad</li>
            <li> but i never had an experience like this :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooth and does it&#x27;s job !</li>
            <li> Like this a lot, very light application and easy but enough coverage for me (like it to be very natural but enough to blur blemishes, etc). Dewy as the day goes on but not super oily.</li>
            <li> I Just bought this at Target for$7.49  I usually use the regular one with no salicylic acid in it. I saw this one and wanted to see if it really works. I bought medium and the match was perfect compared to the medium/deep I use with other regular maybelline bb cream.  so far so good. No complaints. I have very sensitive skin,dermatitis and eczema and this does not dry me out. No new break outs either.  I normally get cystic acne before or during my cycle and haven&#x27;t. This product is amazing! lOve.  MAYBELLINE.</li>
            <li> nice light coverage, true blend to skin tone, no breaking out, and just enough moisturizing, I will definitely be ordering this again.  I also use another BB cream I like a lot, it&#x27;s a bit heavier so depending on how much coverage I want, I use the right one.  This is a good price and a good cream.</li>
            <li> I like it but no matter how little I use, it looks cakey. I prefer to mix a small bit into my regular non-tinted face lotion.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. I like the product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Blends into my skin really well.  I only use under my eyes and around my nose,  so blending in is very important.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is great and looks good. The thickness of this BB cream is in between a concealer and foundation thickness which works well for me because it is not too thick and not too light. I can hardly feel it on my skin and it does seem to help the occasional acne I get on my face. I will be buying my friend some of this for her birthday and would recommend this product. It is a good product and is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I had an okay experience overall with this product, if you have oily to combination skin like I do here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Matches skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Matte finish&lt;br /&gt;Good light coverage&lt;br /&gt;Non-drying&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes pores&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Not good for oily to combination skin&lt;br /&gt;Caused more breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Caused face to be more oily&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes clogs pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not totally bad, it just needs more improvement.</li>
            <li> I go through it rather quickly and the coverage is light. I don&#x27;t notice that it helps my acne, but I don&#x27;t think it makes it worse, which is good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It is pretty lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey film like a lot of regular foundations. I make this even thinner by mixing it with moisturizer for a natural daily makeup routine. When I go out I mix this with the NYX &amp;#34;born to glow&amp;#34; illuminators and it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m not sure if the price on amazon changes much, but when I bought this it was way cheaper than at my drugstore so it was a great deal too.</li>
            <li> I find that later in the day I go back and see that it has oxidized and created a very tacky appearance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Maybelline&#x27;s BB cream. I have acne prone skin, so this is a GREAT base for my makeup. It&#x27;s light, goes on smooth, and blends really well. It also covers up the redness in my skin REALLY well, which is something I hadn&#x27;t found in a BB cream until now. I will definitely be keeping this in my makeup case; it&#x27;s a new staple!</li>
            <li> This make up is terrific.  goes on so smooth and light, but evens out skin so well.</li>
            <li> I liked this at first, I had no problems but as time went on my skin became irritated and I broke out really bad. When this was on my face it sate weird and became itchy. I have oily acne pron skin so I was hoping that this would have helped me. I highly suggest you purchase something that doesn&#x27;t have all of the harsh chemicals. Things like bareminerals and Laura Geller are very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> it is a good BB cream but it was lighter than i expected but once i blended it in it worked fine</li>
            <li> I used to buy 2 items,tend to cover acne mark on my back and shoulders.The color was terrific,the coverage also good,and they might be could reduce acne,however they don&#x27;t have any sun protect,so you need more sunscreen to protect the sun harm.I prefer buy bb cream or cc cream could replace sunscreen</li>
            <li> This is not a reflection on the seller, but the product. As much as I would like to say I love this product, I actually found myself getting more oily with this product on my face, and I even got more acne though I figure that is due to the acne fighting ingredient pulling my dirt to the surface. Anyway, the color matched and the coverage at first is great, but with someone who has really oily skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others who suffer from lots of oil.</li>
            <li> Amazing clears zits with two uses and really blends for a light clean feeling but is very small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Pure BB cream with sunscreen in it for years and I love it, so, being someone with mild acne problems, I was excited to run across this product. Like the other product, it&#x27;s nice and lightweight and matches my light skintone well. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t blend into the dryer areas of my skin nearly as well and ends up looking cakey in places, a problem I never had with the other cream. As for the acne fighting element, I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping, but I then don&#x27;t wear it very often (usually only when I&#x27;m having a bad outbreak) and I haven&#x27;t noticed it making my acne worse like most makeup does, so I&#x27;ll call that a plus.</li>
            <li> Great formula, not greasy.  I have sensitive acne prone skin and this works great.  The color match is perfect.  I was skeptical of a drug store brand but this is just as good as the high end products I use.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lightweight foundation that is actually helping clear up acne with a smooth non-noticeable overall even color. Covers redness very well. I will be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> This is now my go to BB cream! Before trying this one I had been trying out another cream that I ended up returning because it was causing me to break out (ugh). After 3 days of using the maybelline, the breakout had cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a really great match for my skintone, and is also helping to control the small amount of blemishes I usually get due to oily skin.  The coverage is light, but you can layer more on to intensify coverage. It also does a good job of keeping skin hydrated while controlling oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more when this tube runs out!</li>
            <li> I love how the stuff helps out with your breakouts instead of just covering it up. It also matches my skin tone and blends really well.</li>
            <li> I suspect the need to apply more than once would come up if I was being active, but as a just chillin&#x27; kind of day, it was great in an only once application. I am an extremely pale person, and many foundations turn orange or yellow tinted on me, but this one did not. LOVE THAT.</li>
            <li> My acne cleared up within a few days of using this product. My favorite makeup that i own. Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> My teen daughter loves this product for an everyday, natural look (great for school days). It has just enough coverage for minor blemishes---it&#x27;s not a solution for concealing major breakouts. She has normal/dry skin, and this formula doesn&#x27;t cause any peeling or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate seeing young girls with overdone, caked-on foundation, and she hates going out barefaced when she has blemishes: this BB cream is a compromise we can both live with. One star off just because if you are outside sweating in very hot weather, it does get a little oily.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, stays on all day and works perfect with my makeup</li>
            <li> The acne medicine in it made me break out at first. But it had gotten better and it works as a spot treatment/concealer for blemishes. I have somewhat oily skin and this makes it get oily faster but it seems to be helping my problem skin. Coverage is minimal so it&#x27;s nice to wear alone for everyday and under foundation for nights out.</li>
            <li> Great product - great price - good quality good coverage</li>
            <li> My first ever foundation is this exact type. I got in back when I believe I was 13. I thought it was magic! lol. I loved the coverage, although I believe it is a light-medium type coverage, so if you&#x27;re looking for something heavy, I would go with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for school ever since. Btw, I have the light shade (Which I thought was surprising because I have always believed I was light/medium). I use 2 layers now because I am having a little bit more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will always be my go to light coverage foundation!</li>
            <li> nice product.. \\&quot;update\\&quot; i used twice but the first time i thought it was my wax that i applied on my facial hairs and have gotten a bad rash on my face around the nose, above my lips and chin it hurts and itches really bad,it looks like some one threw a pot of hot water on my face, i know i have sensitive skin but i never had an experience like this :(</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this product for peoples who suffer from ACNE.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other brand. This is light, so my face doesn&#x27;t feel disgusting and dirty all day long. It is the only face makeup I have EVER come across that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I mix this with my daily moisturizer and pat it on all over my face instead of wiping it, and it manages to cover majority of any inflammation that I have. Any extra can be covered by a little powder and I&#x27;m good to go. I won&#x27;t go back to another product after this. Ever. And the Add-On program on Amazon has it around $5.00 which is cheaper than anywhere else in-store (at least where I live).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend! When I pass by it in stores I call it out and praise it to whoever I&#x27;m with!</li>
            <li> I love it!  light, not thick or goopy feeling on my skin.  Evens out the skin tone but still looks natural. Like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li> its pretty sheer coverage (it is a bb cream not a foundation) but it lasts all day &amp; it cancels out redness and i just use concealer on spots.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I need a simple and quick morning routine, but I also have seriously oily skin that usually makes any foundation worthless. This is an exception. I apply this in the morning with a wet sponge, this way it doesn&#x27;t go on cakey, and I prefer a more natural look since makeup does inevitably melt away by the end of the day. This isn&#x27;t reflective of any product, my skin is just that much of a pain. This foundation lasts nearly all day, if I required a touch up, it would probably be around dinner time, but I can get away with just blotting and brushing some loose powder on usually. That said, this one doesn&#x27;t do what all sorts of other foundations, BB creams, CC creams, etc do. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, stain clothing or make up tools, slide off before lunch, or cause an allergic reaction. A little goes a long way, again with the wet sponge, or it will get cakey, lasts a good bit of time, and I overall like it. So far this is the foundation that has worked best for me (limited time to get ready), my location (hot and humid) and my skin type (oil central).</li>
            <li> I have minor, occasional breakouts, and my skin is not all that smooth. After using this product for 1 day, I already notice a difference. I had a recent breakout, and the minor blemishes I had yesterday are nearly gone. My face also looks much smoother, even in daylight:)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for sure. However,  check prices at your local drugstore first. I bought this for about $2 less than the current advertised price ($8.99)</li>
            <li> This makeup is perfect, I have extremely sensitive skin and I hate the feeling of heavy makeup on my face. This actually has pretty good coverage and feels really light. It&#x27;s definitely my new go to makeup choice.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. The coverage is light. This is what I use when I don&#x27;t go all-out on my makeup. It is definitely worth what you pay for it, and I paid much more for it at CVS. I&#x27;ll be buying it from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> love this. one of the few things that work with my face</li>
            <li> Covered AND cleared up my face!</li>
            <li> Works well so far, doesn&#x27;t cover very well and mixes badly with green concealer. Makes it run and won&#x27;t stay where you had put it. The color is pretty accurate and not super sheer.</li>
            <li> greasy and doesn&#x27;t last as well as my foundation,&lt;br /&gt;honestly, coverage-wise, I would rather wear my revlon colorstay foundation just because it looks better than this when on my skin</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product. I was worried by the reviews saying the product would not blend well when putting it on. I have had no problem with it blending. It feels great after applying it to my face. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. Would definitely purchase again</li>
