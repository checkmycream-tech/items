            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years as an esthetician.</li>
            <li>Better ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Than</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very nice spray and works very well.</li>
            <li>and it works pretty good for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The mist itself IS refreshing, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing, prepares my face for my makeup, has a light scent, and sets my makeup.</li>
            <li>I just love the light scent.</li>
            <li>In a hot day it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is nice and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>, they do the same and are loving it too.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to see rosewater and glycerin available again.  </li>
            <li>Easy to spray and use</li>
            <li>This does the trick with no breakouts or strong scents.</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I use many of their products, and find them to be of high quality and effective.</li>
            <li>I also using it on my fine curly hair to revive and refresh my curls...</li>
            <li>After a quick spray on my face, the pimple and scarring around it virtually disappeared overnight!</li>
            <li>In the 1950s, every drug store had their own label on pure glycerine and rosewater, and also glycerin and rosewater hand creams.</li>
            <li>Reviva products dont get as much attention as &amp;#34;fancy pretty packaged high end brands&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and has a lot of amount.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and soaks in well</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It provides a very nice facial mist that smells great, and it is loaded with a lot of helpful ingredients for the skin, including Hyaluronic Acid (which is listed on the bottle, but not on the description above).</li>
            <li>Smell like real roses!!!</li>
            <li>I am seein a significant Chang in my skin elasticity.  </li>
            <li>The new ingredients list doesn&#x27;t say rose anywhere.</li>
            <li>I fly a lot and it makes my skin dry</li>
            <li>works well,use it after I clean my face before I use retinol &amp; moisterizer.</li>
            <li>It is also great before using any serum as it allows more even coverage without product waste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I see any positive effects from it, but I love the smell, the coolness, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>It is  better than comparable products that cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li>I use it after cleansing my face as a toner and also as a cool pick-me-up when I need to cool off.  </li>
            <li>I have one TSA bottle in my fridge for when I need a cool spritz on my face or neck</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying so many skin products that I was ready to give up.</li>
            <li>I expected more rose odor</li>
            <li>For that reason I am a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite facial spray, I love everything about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it makes my face look real soft and refreshed</li>
            <li>The soft rose scent is is lovely, but doesn&#x27;t linger (for those with sensitive noses.)</li>
            <li>I finally heard about rose water and saw how cheap it was, so I decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I have received quite a few compliments on how beautiful my skin appears.</li>
            <li>They technically can&#x27;t call it rose water anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any kind of setting something for my skin - but sometimes in the middle of the day I feel like I just want to be re freshened.</li>
            <li>I want to try rose water spray of a different brand, but I have a feeling</li>
            <li>Feels great and keeps my skin tight, smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I like to use it right after taking a shower and immediately after washing my face.</li>
            <li>I immediately spray this rosewater on my face right after washing it, then put on a moisturizing cream to seal it in.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why, I have used many rose sprays before.</li>
            <li>smells so fresh and really moisturizes your skin all over!</li>
            <li>Felt very good on my skin the only draw back was that I found the rose scent a little overpowering</li>
            <li>That means they don&#x27;t experiment on animals for my own vanity (and that doensnt just mean rats like most people think)</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle in my bathroom and a bottle in the gym bag;)</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it at tjmaxx and tried it out</li>
            <li>Nothing I have ever tried has had that fast of an effect!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love this spray, it&#x27;s my third bottle.</li>
            <li>Even one spray will be more than enough.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time thanks!</li>
            <li>It was wrapped in its own plastic bag but still spilled and leaked on my other things.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and puts moisture back into my skin using natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>just a quick tip: don&#x27;t open your eyes right after you spray, if any gets in your eyes they will BURN.</li>
            <li>I poured this into a smaller spray bottle since the spray part just drenched my face instead of lightly misting it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>I actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After i finish make up , i got water too much on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this facial spray for a number of years, now, and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever really liked.</li>
            <li>, I have the original bottle on my bathroom sink and another TSA approved bottle to save for my next trip.</li>
            <li>Usually a product like this, I question the content of the rose water.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I live this stuff!</li>
            <li>Works great and my skin feels soft, but it does dry a little too fast.</li>
            <li>For less money and smalls like roses love it.</li>
            <li>Its also a larger size than most facial sprays-</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Helps makeup settle and blend into the skin for a natural skin-like finish, while plumping fine lines and relieving patchy, dry spots.</li>
            <li>I have spent $20 or more on things that never work, or only work temporarily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first and last thing on my face in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong</li>
            <li>I looked at other brands, and some were full of junk.  </li>
            <li>They will not be ordering it any longer either because the reason they all bought it was because of sensitive skin that can&#x27;t use perfume.</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, moist and glowing.</li>
            <li>Not as refreshing as I thought and has no rose smell</li>
            <li>Just try to use as far as you can.</li>
            <li>Also, my face is really soft now.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and the rosewater makes me feel nostalgic, romantic and clean</li>
            <li>and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve used anything out of the bottle.</li>

            <li> Reviva products dont get as much attention as &amp;#34;fancy pretty packaged high end brands&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and has a lot of amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and soaks in well</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It provides a very nice facial mist that smells great, and it is loaded with a lot of helpful ingredients for the skin, including Hyaluronic Acid (which is listed on the bottle, but not on the description above).</li>
            <li> Smell like real roses!!!</li>
            <li> I am seein a significant Chang in my skin elasticity.  </li>
            <li> The new ingredients list doesn&#x27;t say rose anywhere.</li>
            <li> I fly a lot and it makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> works well,use it after I clean my face before I use retinol &amp; moisterizer.</li>
            <li> It is also great before using any serum as it allows more even coverage without product waste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I see any positive effects from it, but I love the smell, the coolness, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It is  better than comparable products that cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li> I use it after cleansing my face as a toner and also as a cool pick-me-up when I need to cool off.  </li>
            <li> I have one TSA bottle in my fridge for when I need a cool spritz on my face or neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so many skin products that I was ready to give up.</li>
            <li> I expected more rose odor</li>
            <li> For that reason I am a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite facial spray, I love everything about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it makes my face look real soft and refreshed</li>
            <li> The soft rose scent is is lovely, but doesn&#x27;t linger (for those with sensitive noses.)</li>
            <li> I finally heard about rose water and saw how cheap it was, so I decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have received quite a few compliments on how beautiful my skin appears.</li>
            <li> They technically can&#x27;t call it rose water anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any kind of setting something for my skin - but sometimes in the middle of the day I feel like I just want to be re freshened.</li>
            <li> I want to try rose water spray of a different brand, but I have a feeling</li>
            <li> Feels great and keeps my skin tight, smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I like to use it right after taking a shower and immediately after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I immediately spray this rosewater on my face right after washing it, then put on a moisturizing cream to seal it in.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why, I have used many rose sprays before.</li>
            <li> smells so fresh and really moisturizes your skin all over!</li>
            <li> Felt very good on my skin the only draw back was that I found the rose scent a little overpowering</li>
            <li> That means they don&#x27;t experiment on animals for my own vanity (and that doensnt just mean rats like most people think)</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle in my bathroom and a bottle in the gym bag;)</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it at tjmaxx and tried it out</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever tried has had that fast of an effect!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love this spray, it&#x27;s my third bottle.</li>
            <li> Even one spray will be more than enough.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time thanks!</li>
            <li> It was wrapped in its own plastic bag but still spilled and leaked on my other things.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and puts moisture back into my skin using natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> just a quick tip: don&#x27;t open your eyes right after you spray, if any gets in your eyes they will BURN.</li>
            <li> I poured this into a smaller spray bottle since the spray part just drenched my face instead of lightly misting it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> I actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After i finish make up , i got water too much on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial spray for a number of years, now, and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever really liked.</li>
            <li> , I have the original bottle on my bathroom sink and another TSA approved bottle to save for my next trip.</li>
            <li> Usually a product like this, I question the content of the rose water.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> I live this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works great and my skin feels soft, but it does dry a little too fast.</li>
            <li> For less money and smalls like roses love it.</li>
            <li> Its also a larger size than most facial sprays-</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Helps makeup settle and blend into the skin for a natural skin-like finish, while plumping fine lines and relieving patchy, dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have spent $20 or more on things that never work, or only work temporarily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first and last thing on my face in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> I looked at other brands, and some were full of junk.  </li>
            <li> They will not be ordering it any longer either because the reason they all bought it was because of sensitive skin that can&#x27;t use perfume.</li>
            <li> for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, moist and glowing.</li>
            <li> Not as refreshing as I thought and has no rose smell</li>
            <li> Just try to use as far as you can.</li>
            <li> Also, my face is really soft now.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and the rosewater makes me feel nostalgic, romantic and clean</li>
            <li> and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve used anything out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many bad reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I have three other similar facial sprays, but I like this one</li>
            <li> and it definitely gives the face a little extra boost.</li>
            <li> This was completely unethical and dishonest of the company to do.</li>
            <li> I wish it was weaker and wide</li>
            <li> But other than that, i like the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li> I do not use any other moisturizer other than virgin coconut oil from time to time before bed.</li>
            <li> I also mist a little over my face and neck, when I am feeling dry, or when I need a pick me up.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry tight feeling skin, but this spray fixes that!  </li>
            <li> Also has the least amount of extra not needed ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I can feel a slight tingle.</li>
            <li> so I like to take a little bottle to spray my face with.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was specified before I went through the trouble of ordering it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with my last order as some how the way it was packed, all the product had leaked out and all I got was an empty bottle.  </li>
            <li> But, the spray is kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> I am heart broken by their dishonesty.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say that I have to change my review.</li>
            <li> I am really sad that I can no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> but they are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad this item was discontinued !</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this rose water. Smells so good and it is really refreshing. Love it. Was recommended to me by Faces of Omega on YT.</li>
            <li> Definitely love the way this smells. I spray on my beauty blender and blend out concealer w/this stuff.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and pore tightening equals perfect way to begin your beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years. I think it is wonderfully hydrating. I like to use it right after taking a shower and immediately after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I buy this annually for my niece as a Christmas gift.  She loves it!!</li>
            <li> My second order of this product.  It is  better than comparable products that cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li> I fly a lot and it makes my skin dry so I like to take a little bottle to spray my face with.  This is a good price for the amount of spray you get and it feels very moisturizing and smells wonderful.  I pour it in a tiny spray bottle to travel with.  I like this better than the body shop face spray and it&#x27;s way cheaper.  I&#x27;ve tried almost all the face sprays on the market and this is a nice spray.  I also like dermalogica and kinerase but they are very expensive.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I totally love the smell of this product. It only took a couple of days o get here after I ordered so I was very happy about that.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and the people selling it!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance...felt a bit more perfumey than my face likes (though no official perfume added)</li>
            <li> I love it makes my face look real soft and refreshed</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Rose spray! I use it after cleansing my face as a toner and also as a cool pick-me-up when I need to cool off.  I also using it on my fine curly hair to revive and refresh my curls...I couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I&#x27;m happy with the list of ingredients.  I looked at other brands, and some were full of junk.  This is nice and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> works well,use it after I clean my face before I use retinol &amp; moisterizer. Then after I finish my makeup to set it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell really nice:)</li>
            <li> I bought before a vacation flight to keep my skin moist. That was several months ago and I still have it. I have one TSA bottle in my fridge for when I need a cool spritz on my face or neck, I have the original bottle on my bathroom sink and another TSA approved bottle to save for my next trip. It is refreshing and the rosewater makes me feel nostalgic, romantic and clean I will order it again</li>
            <li> I am sad to say that I have to change my review. This is what I used to say.  Love the way the Rose Water works, smells and makes me feel. I use it on ever part of me. In my hair; on my face; and I freshen up my under arms when the get a bit sweaty smelling. I am also using it with a natureful hyaluronic acid +C serum and shea moisture camomil  baby lotion for my face. I am seein a significant Chang in my skin elasticity.  Also has the least amount of extra not needed ingredients. And I can swallow the price being under $10. Best feel and quality.  The reason I changed my review is because they took out the rose. It is no longer a rose water. They replaced the rose extract for a perfume. It caused my echzama to become instantly inflamed because of the change. This product used to help me keep it under controll. They technically can&#x27;t call it rose water anymore. The new ingredients list doesn&#x27;t say rose anywhere. Just perfume. I am really sad that I can no longer use this product. I use to rave about it to all my friends and acquaintances and they all became permanent customers. They will not be ordering it any longer either because the reason they all bought it was because of sensitive skin that can&#x27;t use perfume. This was close to 100 people that I had referred to this product and I will be informing each of them of this problem. I noticed that it was different as soon as I spayed it once and could smell the difference immediately. The wool can&#x27;t be pulled over my eyes on something like this. This was completely unethical and dishonest of the company to do. My hope un changing my review is that they would go back to the way it was. It was perfect. I will try to put up pictures showing the differences and changes as soon as I can. I am heart broken by their dishonesty.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It does amazing things for my skin I can tell when I use it regularly and when I don&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve had it forever and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve used anything out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! It is refreshing, prepares my face for my makeup, has a light scent, and sets my makeup. I will definitely repurchase!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with it! I use it in the morning and night. My skin appears clearer. I just love the light scent. I poured this into a smaller spray bottle since the spray part just drenched my face instead of lightly misting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial spray for a number of years, now, and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever really liked. It leaves my skin soft, moist and glowing. The soft rose scent is is lovely, but doesn&#x27;t linger (for those with sensitive noses.) It preps my skin perfectly for the rest of my moisturizing routine, blending in smooth and light.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues. Somedays my skin just does not need a moisturizer and this is enough to get me through the day (I spot moisturize around my eyes). It is also great before using any serum as it allows more even coverage without product waste. I am on my 2nd bottle and this has made the cut in my regime. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this! Use it on all of my clients to rehydrate and refresh skin before and after makeup. Helps makeup settle and blend into the skin for a natural skin-like finish, while plumping fine lines and relieving patchy, dry spots. Everyone asks what it is and where they can get it!</li>
            <li> Love this Rose spray. I use it throughout the day to refresh my skin. Can spray after cleansing or after makeup is applied. Feels great and keeps my skin tight, smooth and soft! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I expected more rose odor</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Cool and refreshing and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Works great and my skin feels soft, but it does dry a little too fast.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff as a setting spray for my make up. I also put it on after washing my face and before I use my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the smell, but that&#x27;s just personal. It was wrapped in its own plastic bag but still spilled and leaked on my other things.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! It deels so good when you spray it and your face feels so smooth afterwards.  My skin even looks better.  I also use itto set my makeup when Im done.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Miracle product! I use it in the morning, afternoon as a pick me up, and under my moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> Just an excellent product. Been using it for about 2 years now. Reviva products dont get as much attention as &amp;#34;fancy pretty packaged high end brands&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s awesome. I use it to set my makeup, refresh at the gym, after my oils before bed. I keep a bottle in my bathroom and a bottle in the gym bag;) Its also a larger size than most facial sprays- more bang for the $. Also, Read your ingredients ladies! Pure and best of all CRUELTY FREE!!! That means they don&#x27;t experiment on animals for my own vanity (and that doensnt just mean rats like most people think) For that reason I am a loyal customer. Forever.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it at tjmaxx and tried it out and I can honestly say made my make up looking beautiful and flawless just like what Mac finish spray did for me!!! For less money and smalls like roses love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so many skin products that I was ready to give up. I have spent $20 or more on things that never work, or only work temporarily. I finally heard about rose water and saw how cheap it was, so I decided it was worth a shot. I may be jumping the gun a bit since I got this yesterday, but I already see a huge improvement in my skin! I had this big pimple on my chin, and my pimples take about a week to heal. Well guess what?? After a quick spray on my face, the pimple and scarring around it virtually disappeared overnight! Nothing I have ever tried has had that fast of an effect! I have back acne too, so I&#x27;m hoping it helps with that too in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the rosy scent, it&#x27;s not too overpowering. The mist itself IS refreshing, and dries very quickly. I&#x27;ll try this as a make up setter and give an updated review later.</li>
            <li> Not as refreshing as I thought and has no rose smell</li>
            <li> Hydrates, softens, beautiful light fragrance. I&#x27;ve never used any kind of setting something for my skin - but sometimes in the middle of the day I feel like I just want to be re freshened. This does the trick with no breakouts or strong scents.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. Happy with product</li>
            <li> I like how refreshing it is on my face. The scent is a little strong but I got over it now.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use this facial spray, to set my makeup. I also mist a little over my face and neck, when I am feeling dry, or when I need a pick me up. It is refreshing and smells so good. This is a great product and affordable!</li>
            <li> Love this spray! Smell like real roses!!! In a hot day it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this company. I use many of their products, and find them to be of high quality and effective. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is really nice rosewater. It smells like vintage roses and feels nice and refreshing on the skin. Will be using it a lot come summer time. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this stuff. I have acne prone skin and it works pretty good for a moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Felt very good on my skin the only draw back was that I found the rose scent a little overpowering</li>
            <li> I love this toner! I have been using it for years and this retailer has it for the lowest price I have ever found. Would&#x27;ve given 5 stars but when my package arrived the bottle had leaked out some of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this spray, it&#x27;s my third bottle. I spritz my face after I wash it in the am and the pm;  I also spritz my face with it some times during the day. It has a wonderful faint smell of roses, and feels delightful when spritzing it on my face, neck, and hair too. The price is also a good one, I just hope they keep it at that price.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and has a lot of amount. But, the spray is kinda sucks. It sprays too strongly on specific spot - so it does not cover all face well. I wish it was weaker and wide spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After i finish make up , i got water too much on my face so i had to do make again. Even one spray will be more than enough. Just try to use as far as you can. But other than that, i like the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell and amount , price everything.</li>
            <li> smells so fresh and really moisturizes your skin all over! i use it before i put on moisturizer and to set my makeup. just a quick tip: don&#x27;t open your eyes right after you spray, if any gets in your eyes they will BURN.</li>
            <li> I live this stuff! It smells nice and puts moisture back into my skin using natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this!! After I apply my makeup, I spritz this on and it gives me a dewy, glow finish</li>
            <li> love it great for skin. must have :)</li>
            <li> This spray smells SO good!!!  And there isn&#x27;t any fragrance in the ingredients which I won&#x27;t use. Also, my face is really soft now. I have a problem with dry tight feeling skin, but this spray fixes that!  I do not use any other moisturizer other than virgin coconut oil from time to time before bed. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great price - refreshing mist. Used it while vacationing in Miami! It&#x27;s out of stock now soo I can&#x27;t. But it at this price again soo I&#x27;ll move on to a product that doesn&#x27;t sell out for same price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite awhile.  It&#x27;s the first and last thing on my face in the mornings.  Prior to applying moisturizer and then to set my powder.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s light and soaks in well and I feel it heals my irritated skin.  I was so disappointed with my last order as some how the way it was packed, all the product had leaked out and all I got was an empty bottle.  But the box was an Amazon box so I think they are the ones that screwed up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad this item was discontinued ! I wish it was specified before I went through the trouble of ordering it.</li>
            <li> Very nice spray and works very well. Smells fabulous.  Leaked a bit during travel because it froze solid since it&#x27;s winter.</li>
            <li> very nice product. smells nice</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a good rose spray, this however irritated skin. Not sure why, I have used many rose sprays before.</li>
            <li> Great product,  I really enjoy this in the summertime,  spritz on face and body to refresh ,  the product smells so good it is uplifting.</li>
            <li> Love it. Arrived on time thanks!</li>
            <li> After using a facial toner from the same company I use this on my face. It give it an instant glow and I can feel a slight tingle. spOverall it is a great product to try. Easy to spray and use and it definitely gives the face a little extra boost.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have received quite a few compliments on how beautiful my skin appears.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Smells fabulous and always leaves me feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was a little disappointed. The product was leaking somehow so I had to put it in a different spray bottle. It smells amazing. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it as a toner and to set my makeup.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite facial spray, I love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years as an esthetician. Better ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Than most!</li>
            <li> I immediately spray this rosewater on my face right after washing it, then put on a moisturizing cream to seal it in.  I bought this for both of my daughter-laws, they do the same and are loving it too.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to see rosewater and glycerin available again.  In the 1950s, every drug store had their own label on pure glycerine and rosewater, and also glycerin and rosewater hand creams.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know if I see any positive effects from it, but I love the smell, the coolness, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many bad reviews for this product. I use it every morning, and before bed. It provides a very nice facial mist that smells great, and it is loaded with a lot of helpful ingredients for the skin, including Hyaluronic Acid (which is listed on the bottle, but not on the description above). I have three other similar facial sprays, but I like this one the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering another bottle, and plan to continuing using it.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff... I even spray it in my hair for texture and scent.</li>
            <li> Usually a product like this, I question the content of the rose water.  But regardless, it&#x27;s so moisturizing for me.  I&#x27;ve been using this every day in the morning and in the evening.  This is my second bottle and will definitely repurchase.  I want to try rose water spray of a different brand, but I have a feeling I&#x27;ll come back to this one.</li>
