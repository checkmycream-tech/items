            <li> the hair felt real and it was thick and it was everything I expected and more</li>
            <li> I really wanted to believe, since I know that presented product may vary in quality, same product can be ordered few times and you can get few different quality products, since its not always the same seller, no matter this is honeywin&#x27;s page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, you need to go ahead and order two because the model is wearing two in the pics, unless you already have long hair.</li>
            <li> Per single hair clipings too long for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived a few weeks early than expected given time frame.</li>
            <li> Uuuuuuuh is fine but not that crazy</li>
            <li> The color is lighter than I expected and it is shedding.</li>
            <li> It isn´t human hair, my sister washed it and put him stiff as a doll hair</li>
            <li> This itnin not only took for ever to arrive, but once I received it it was nothing like the picture shows, it doesnt cover the area that its suppose to, very small definitely not 21&amp;#34; and the clips were all damaged...</li>
            <li> It is waaaaay to dark.</li>
            <li> was too dark gave it  away.</li>
            <li> Seem to tangle rather easily, a little staticky.  </li>
            <li> but I looked it up and discovered all you need is a little spray of some water and/or heat resistant spray.</li>
            <li> It is a very dark brown.</li>
            <li> half the size like it is on the picture, and it is not as thick in hair like presented</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thin, very dark,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is EXTREMELY poor</li>
            <li> Bad don&#x27;t waist your time or money...</li>
            <li> bad quality</li>
            <li> very disappointed...</li>

            <li> Tangles easily other than that, it looks natural, and clips in perfectly.  Recieve so many compliments, I braid it and wear to the side.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Per single hair clipings too long for me.</li>
            <li> Uuuuuuuh is fine but not that crazy</li>
            <li> Seem to tangle rather easily, a little staticky.  Other than those issues, fabulous color and true to life. Easy to work with, easily clip right in and hold tight. Very natural looking.</li>

            <li> True to picture! Arrived a few weeks early than expected given time frame. Color was slightly darker but that actually worked out best for me. I love this item and will continue to order here once I need new extensions! I would highly recommend, just make sure you know your hair type and whether or not it will match and blend with your hair.</li>
            <li> Bad don&#x27;t waist your time or money...bad quality</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re okay frizzed up really fast</li>
            <li> I really wanted to believe, since I know that presented product may vary in quality, same product can be ordered few times and you can get few different quality products, since its not always the same seller, no matter this is honeywin&#x27;s page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product arrived today and it looks NOTHING like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It is thin, very dark, half the size like it is on the picture, and it is not as thick in hair like presented here.&lt;br /&gt;It is EXTREMELY poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;I touched it to feel it after unpacking and literally dosens of hair fell off.&lt;br /&gt;It is very fragile, I cannot see myself wearing this more then once. Its like one time use.</li>
            <li> This product looks nothing like the picture.  It is waaaaay to dark.</li>
            <li> I ordered human hair extensions but received synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> Does this or doesn&#x27;t it say  Remy &amp;#34;HUMAN HAIR&amp;#34; extensions? I received synthetic hair not at all what I was expecting. But it did wash up real nice.</li>
            <li> Too straight and heavy not curly enough need lightly color ends. I have the same color ones you sent me and can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> It isn´t human hair, my sister washed it and put him stiff as a doll hair</li>
            <li> The color is lighter than I expected and it is shedding.</li>
            <li> This itnin not only took for ever to arrive, but once I received it it was nothing like the picture shows, it doesnt cover the area that its suppose to, very small definitely not 21&amp;#34; and the clips were all damaged...I willnguve it t my niece to play with...if it wasnt fo the fact that I woul b aging more to ship it back than keep it I would....very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl or straighten the way it should but I looked it up and discovered all you need is a little spray of some water and/or heat resistant spray. Really pretty and long like they said!</li>
            <li> was too dark gave it  away.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to put this hairpiece in but it finally worked. I like wearing it with a cowboy or baseball hat.</li>
            <li> Really cute, it matched my hair and it feels really nice after having it for a couple months. It&#x27;s super long but I just cut it myself and it looked fine because it curled.</li>
            <li> Love this synthetic... It&#x27;s fun and easy to maintain!  A must for hair product accessories!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister in law and she really like it.</li>
            <li> Nice curls and easy to clip in, hardly able to tell. Good for thick hair types or create a thicker hair effect.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made product. However it is NOT the color of the one in the pic. It is a very dark brown. Also, you need to go ahead and order two because the model is wearing two in the pics, unless you already have long hair.</li>
