            <li>Whatever, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Bonus-- I can get it on Amazon a fair bit cheaper!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this years ago when a coworker was selling it and was happy to see it on amazon.</li>
            <li>and it works great with my skin.</li>

            <li>Works great and does not take a lot</li>
            <li>I researched many places to find the best price and SeaBotique Inc..</li>
            <li>Love this product, and it arrived nicely packaged and pronto!!!!  </li>
            <li>Great face wash with an amazing scent.  </li>
            <li>, Avon is still a good product.</li>
            <li>I loved it then</li>
            <li>oh so good.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin which is acne-prone.</li>
            <li>I got this when I bought the matching day and night creams, which are awesome in their own right.</li>
            <li>I like this and have been using it for many years!  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I break out very easily and am picky abt what I put on my face,,,love</li>
            <li>It has a very nice mild fragrance..</li>
            <li>I did not find ONE Avon cleanser (including this one) that I liked better than my Olay cleansers.</li>
            <li>For many years I used Neutrogena and liked the results - but I realized that it was also bleaching the hair around the side of my face.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this my face felt rejuvenated as it was tingly, clean, and just an awesome feeling.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell</li>
            <li>As an Avon rep (I&#x27;m not any more), I tried everything I could.</li>
            <li>But if not, almost any Olay tube cleanser will sub for the Avon in your skincare routine and will fit in nicely.</li>
            <li>This is the best product, simple to work and set-up!</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay to let it sit on your face; it doesn&#x27;t burn; and it isn&#x27;t a scrub.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product works.</li>
            <li>It removes most of my mascara without drying my face.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>She love it as i gave as a gift basket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product@</li>
            <li>Enjoyed, thank u, would purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I love it now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love Avon products.</li>
            <li>love the way it feels on the skin and removes all traces of dirt</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers.</li>
            <li>I had NO expectation that this cleanser would do anything more than any of the others--</li>
            <li>Works as good as the higher priced cleansing gels.</li>
            <li>smell great, clean very nicely, not greasy at all, made face feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>It takes both eye and face makeup off easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin and fine lines...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for around 9 months now and have to say this is a great cleanser for the price (especially if you catch it on sale).  </li>
            <li>Light weight nonabrasive cleanser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall how much it is with Avon , but I found the price to be reasonable here on Amazon and with my Prime membership, free shipping and a great value.  </li>
            <li>It was basically free, so what the heck, I tried it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth a try, you might find one you like!</li>
            <li>This bottle lasts a long time, making it a great value.</li>
            <li>, that is extremely temperamental with any change in product, however my skin loved these products from day one!</li>
            <li>I should have bought it for myself, but the recipients said they really appreciated and enjoyed the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and does not strip my skin, but still feels very clean.</li>
            <li>Happy to see I can get my Avon and other products on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li>Very economical in that you do not have to use very much.  </li>
            <li>I feel and see a difference in my skin the first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
            <li>If you want a great cleanser that does what it says without being harsh on your skin, this is your cleanser.</li>
            <li>Why not, when you get such nice incentive deals and packages?&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>When you use this, it feels like you are getting a nice facial.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better and I its not harsh.</li>
            <li>Price is right and it leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for deep clean and ease to remove black head.</li>
            <li>It makes my face hot after I use it, too.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure that I would recommend to others, however, I have only used the gel for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>My skin really likes this face wash, it has little scrubber beads that good too.</li>
            <li>I usually dont by facial products this cheap, and only go for the best, but this is on par with the most expensive, and is great with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>this just means the cleanser is really working and your skin is getting use to it..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>THIS cleanser, for whatever reason, really improves the situation.</li>
            <li>This cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and removes make-up easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them all for a little over a month and love them so far... love the smell of the cleanser and the Smoothing Fluid too!</li>
            <li>and my face feels the exact right amount of clean without being too harsh on my sensitive rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>This is a clear gel which has microbeads in it for gentle cleansing and added texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side normally, but I&#x27;m done with worrying about the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny of the regular Avon price.</li>
            <li>I love ANEW products for the most part (see all my glowing reviews), but there wasn&#x27;t one single Avon cleanser that wowed me into leaving my Olay behind.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my skin always looks so clean and refreshed and it also puts a little color in my cheeks which means the toner in it really works..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I put on and the last thing I wash off.</li>
            <li>I also know you can use it for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Make your face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and did not have any problems.</li>
            <li>My skin is also quite sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, but does not leave skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Pretty smell, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m acne prone, and just prone to generally looking like crud.</li>
            <li>offers a money back guarantee for their customers</li>
            <li>It has single handedly put a stop to a couple of break outs, when I had ran out of my normal creams/treatments and ALL I had was this stuff lying around.</li>
            <li>It does work well with the other products in this particular line of Avon products.  </li>

            <li> It has single handedly put a stop to a couple of break outs, when I had ran out of my normal creams/treatments and ALL I had was this stuff lying around.</li>
            <li> It does work well with the other products in this particular line of Avon products.  </li>
            <li> and it has these little green like spores in them which when used they break on your face to make it clean deep into the skins surface..</li>
            <li> but even if you get a few small breakouts this is normal at first and will go a away in a day or two..</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this item from my Avon rep directly.  </li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough that my face doesn&#x27;t have a poor reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my older acne scars are slowly fading</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients to help scrub any dead skin cells off, so I occasionally use an apricot scrub to do that.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, too.  </li>
            <li> a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I say I tried every cleanser they sell, I mean that yes I had a giant box of Avon cleansers (they make a LOT OF THEM!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> It takes at least 10 min.</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s what I think they are.....</li>
            <li> Big nasty pores, just generally congested skin all the time.</li>
            <li> If you are already using an ANEW cleansing set but not happy with your Avon cleanser, try subbing for the Olay.</li>
            <li> That makes for a poor combination.</li>
            <li> although not perfect.</li>
            <li> try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed at least I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> recommended for anybody dealing with oily skin or dirty pores.</li>
            <li> It doesnt froth a lot, so you will be disappointed if that is something you desire.</li>
            <li> Hate that it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I break out very easily and am picky abt what I put on my face,,,love this product! It doesnt froth a lot, so you will be disappointed if that is something you desire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for around 9 months now and have to say this is a great cleanser for the price (especially if you catch it on sale).  I LOVE the smell and my face feels the exact right amount of clean without being too harsh on my sensitive rosacea skin.  I think it has actually even helped the redness of my skin over time.  If you want a great cleanser that does what it says without being harsh on your skin, this is your cleanser.</li>
            <li> As an Avon rep (I&#x27;m not any more), I tried everything I could. Why not, when you get such nice incentive deals and packages?&lt;br /&gt;As a result of that I did not find ONE Avon cleanser (including this one) that I liked better than my Olay cleansers. I love ANEW products for the most part (see all my glowing reviews), but there wasn&#x27;t one single Avon cleanser that wowed me into leaving my Olay behind. When I say I tried every cleanser they sell, I mean that yes I had a giant box of Avon cleansers (they make a LOT OF THEM!) that I didn&#x27;t like well enough to toss my Olay into the garbage for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avon offers a money back guarantee for their customers so it&#x27;s worth a try, you might find one you like! But if not, almost any Olay tube cleanser will sub for the Avon in your skincare routine and will fit in nicely. If you are already using an ANEW cleansing set but not happy with your Avon cleanser, try subbing for the Olay.</li>
            <li> This is the best product, simple to work and set-up!</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago when a coworker was selling it and was happy to see it on amazon. I usually dont by facial products this cheap, and only go for the best, but this is on par with the most expensive, and is great with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and removes make-up easily.  One of the reason I keep using it, is because it removes my mascara too.  I don&#x27;t have to use a seperate product to take my mascara off.  This product does it all in one washing.</li>
            <li> i love this and it works great with my skin. i have sensitive/ combo skin.  a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great face wash with an amazing scent.  A little bit goes a long way, too.  This bottle lasts a long time, making it a great value.</li>
            <li> This is the line in Avon that is used in 30 years of age up to 40. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I&#x27;m impressed by it. It minimizes pores enough that I can notice it, but not as well that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. It&#x27;s pretty gentle on the skin and you don&#x27;t have to use alot to get you by; about a dime to a nickel size amount. I place it on my face, massage it in, and let it sit while wash I&#x27;m in the shower. It&#x27;s the first thing I put on and the last thing I wash off. It takes at least 10 min. to activate. It has age defying beads. At least, that&#x27;s what I think they are..... I have sensitive skin so I can tell you It&#x27;s okay to let it sit on your face; it doesn&#x27;t burn; and it isn&#x27;t a scrub. It doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients to help scrub any dead skin cells off, so I occasionally use an apricot scrub to do that.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my face red for whatever reason.  It makes my face hot after I use it, too.  Strange.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works. It removes most of my mascara without drying my face. I think that it is the best Anew product.</li>
            <li> Excellent wash for the price. I use it with my clarisonic. Pretty smell, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry either. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When you use this, it feels like you are getting a nice facial. I like it, Avon is still a good product.</li>
            <li> like it a lot will buy another one</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, that is extremely temperamental with any change in product, however my skin loved these products from day one! This product is fantastic! Light weight nonabrasive cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for deep clean and ease to remove black head. She love it as i gave as a gift basket.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser. It takes both eye and face makeup off easily. The tube is great for travel ease ...</li>
            <li> Bought this to go along with the  Avon Anew Clinical Derma-Full Facial Filling Cream and the Avon Anew Clinical Resurfacing Expert Smoothing Fluid. I&#x27;ve been using them all for a little over a month and love them so far... love the smell of the cleanser and the Smoothing Fluid too! I&#x27;ve noticed that my older acne scars are slowly fading so it looks like the combo is working.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better and I its not harsh. I have sensitive skin and did not have any problems. thanks</li>
            <li> Avon Anew Rejuvenate works wonders. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin and fine lines...although not perfect. The first time I used this my face felt rejuvenated as it was tingly, clean, and just an awesome feeling. I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product@</li>
            <li> great product. My skin feels so silky after using this and the tone of my skin has evened out . I researched many places to find the best price and SeaBotique Inc.. had a price that was un beatable .</li>
            <li> Product just as ordered.  Avon is the best product I have ever used - been using it for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> I like all of the Anew Rejuvinate products that I have tried. My skin really likes this face wash, it has little scrubber beads that good too.</li>
            <li> smell great, clean very nicely, not greasy at all, made face feels wonderful. pores seem to reduce some, will order and use this cleanser again.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed, thank u, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Hate that it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this item from my Avon rep directly.  I loved it then and I love it now.  I don&#x27;t recall how much it is with Avon , but I found the price to be reasonable here on Amazon and with my Prime membership, free shipping and a great value.  Happy to see I can get my Avon and other products on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this Avon skin cleanser.  Price is right and it leaves my skin feeling oh so good.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin which is acne-prone. My skin is also quite sensitive to chemicals. That makes for a poor combination. For many years I used Neutrogena and liked the results - but I realized that it was also bleaching the hair around the side of my face. Once I realized that, I stopped using it and had to find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anew Rejuvenate 2-in-1 Gel Cleanser I tried a variety of products, with less-than-great results, before I came across Avon&#x27;s Anew Rejuvenate. This is a clear gel which has microbeads in it for gentle cleansing and added texture. I use this once a day when I shower. I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. It&#x27;s gentle enough that my face doesn&#x27;t have a poor reaction to it. It removes the oils and clears my pores. My skin is definitely cleaner and fresher feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well recommended for anybody dealing with oily skin or dirty pores.</li>
            <li> I should have bought it for myself, but the recipients said they really appreciated and enjoyed the cleanser.  I love Avon products.</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Been using this for years.  A Great cleanser and moisturizer in one. I Will continue to use. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and it arrived nicely packaged and pronto!!!!  I can&#x27;t believe you won&#x27;t accept my summary because it lacks 10 words...There, now it &#x27;fits your requirement&#x27;...</li>
            <li> love the way it feels on the skin and removes all traces of dirt</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser both morning and night. It is gentle and does not strip my skin, but still feels very clean. It smells great and is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> This gel cleanser works well.  Very economical in that you do not have to use very much.  I gave the product four stars based on the lack of moisturizing components.  It cleans well, but does not leave skin feeling soft.  It does work well with the other products in this particular line of Avon products.  Not so sure that I would recommend to others, however, I have only used the gel for two weeks.  My opinion may change after a month or so using the gel.</li>
            <li> Wife swears by this stuff. I like it but it leaves my face oiler than I like.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the higher priced cleansing gels.</li>
            <li> I like this and have been using it for many years!  Works great and does not take a lot so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This cleanser... I got this when I bought the matching day and night creams, which are awesome in their own right. It was basically free, so what the heck, I tried it. This stuff-- I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, maybe fairy dust and rainbows?? Whatever, this stuff is awesome. I have persistently crappy skin. I&#x27;m acne prone, and just prone to generally looking like crud. Big nasty pores, just generally congested skin all the time. THIS cleanser, for whatever reason, really improves the situation. Dramatically improves it! I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers. Acne cleansers, regular cleansers, scrubs, etc. I had NO expectation that this cleanser would do anything more than any of the others-- but it DID. It has single handedly put a stop to a couple of break outs, when I had ran out of my normal creams/treatments and ALL I had was this stuff lying around. Amazing. It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side normally, but I&#x27;m done with worrying about the cost. It&#x27;s worth every penny of the regular Avon price. Bonus-- I can get it on Amazon a fair bit cheaper!</li>
