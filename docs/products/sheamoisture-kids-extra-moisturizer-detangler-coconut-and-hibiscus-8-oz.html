            <li>love love this detangler!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They could have done a better job of packing it.</li>
            <li>I do love the shea moisture product line, but this detangler was just ok.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave her hair oily and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li>I think its product is just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and works great.</li>
            <li>i leave a nice smell and good enough it helps detangle her hair .</li>
            <li>That is a huge plus as anyone who has purchased something liquid</li>
            <li>Great product - will definitely use again.</li>
            <li>Works great on my daughter&#x27;s mixed hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and leaves your hair soft but this doesn&#x27;t really define your curls as you detangle as the bottle claims.</li>
            <li>Works great on wet or dry hair, best on wet though.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and my daughter rarely complains now.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount in my two year olds fine, straight hair and it work amazing for hers too!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a miracle product, but definitely one of the better ones we have tried.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells and really helps with the knots that my 10 yr old with very curly hair has.</li>
            <li>My hair is also still pretty poofy when I use this</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many others and they leave her hair dry or sticky.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my son&#x27;s super curly hair detangled and soft on non-washing days.</li>
            <li>I followed up with pure coconut oil</li>
            <li>It works equally well with my fine, straight haired kiddo.</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Combing our hair out is so much easier now.</li>
            <li>My dug hater has very curly hair and nothing has worked very well on her curls.  </li>
            <li>and I really wish it would help with smoothing it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok detangler but definitely would not use every day while at home simply because you can always make something better to use everyday.</li>
            <li>My toddler is mixed race and has very thick curly beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I generally use this each time I comb my daughter&#x27;s hair out, and have even used it on my own hair a few times.</li>
            <li>smells nice and natural - not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>That is hugely important to me.&lt;br /&gt;Third and Last, it actually works!</li>
            <li>actually takes out knots in my daughter&#x27;s hair better than I expected</li>
            <li>It was wrapped in clear plastic and mailed in bubble envelope.</li>
            <li>and it made her hair soft again.</li>
            <li>As for the actual product, I dont find it very moistrizering.</li>
            <li>My 1yr old with natural hair will let me detangle her hair with this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter is mixed- Asian and Italian and has fine to medium, long hair.  </li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s natural hair dries out and makes it difficult to comb through. I started using this product and my daughter rarely complains now. I generally use this each time I comb my daughter&#x27;s hair out, and have even used it on my own hair a few times. WORKS GREAT at softening those beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! This product works great and it smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Both of my granddaughters 2, 5, use this. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and works great.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I noticed it detangles but then leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair, for lack of a better word, crispy. I followed up with pure coconut oil and it made her hair soft again. I wish it had more slip in it but overall okay.</li>
            <li> Great product - will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> I love, love love this detangler!&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it arrived undamaged and did not leak. That is a huge plus as anyone who has purchased something liquid knows.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it smells great. It is also made from herbal and non toxic ingredients. That is hugely important to me.&lt;br /&gt;Third and Last, it actually works! I have one daughter with thick, curly hair. She hates brushing it, but this detangler makes it easier. We&#x27;ve tried many others and they leave her hair dry or sticky. Not so with the SheaMoisture brand. It works equally well with my fine, straight haired kiddo. The bottle lasts quite awhile considering we use it every day. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well and I really like the smell. It wasn&#x27;t a miracle product, but definitely one of the better ones we have tried.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, keeps my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> Great for adding moisture and slip. No fuss for my 18 month with 3c-4b mixed hair.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the way the product was packaged for delivery. It was wrapped in clear plastic and mailed in bubble envelope. When I opened the package the bottle had leaked. They could have done a better job of packing it. As for the actual product, I dont find it very moistrizering. I do love the shea moisture product line, but this detangler was just ok. It doesnt have a greasy factor which is good but I wouldnt recommend it if your child has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my son&#x27;s super curly hair detangled and soft on non-washing days.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. Combing our hair out is so much easier now.</li>
            <li> My toddler is mixed race and has very thick curly beautiful hair. I have struggled with many products trying to find one that will be great for her hair. I tried this product and it works wonderful for her hair. I now use 6 of the product for her hair and her hair loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> this stuff did not work for me, it made my hair sticky</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Works great on wet or dry hair, best on wet though. My 1yr old with natural hair will let me detangle her hair with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for detangling my daughters 3c hair. Made her hair frizz faster though. I&#x27;ll stick to my homemade detangler.</li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed- Asian and Italian and has fine to medium, long hair.  I use it sparingly and it definitely doesn&#x27;t leave her hair sticky, but I have noticed it isn&#x27;t as curly on the ends when I use it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave her hair oily and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Great, natural product that is great for my daughter&#x27;s hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This product makes my daughter&#x27;s hair difficult to style as it becomes sticky.  Since using this product my daughter has been getting crazy knots in her hair encrusted with some type of white powder residue, almost like dry tooth paste.  I have had to cut some of the knots out because I simply could not get them out.  My daughter has wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and really helps with the knots that my 10 yr old with very curly hair has. I will purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li> smells nice and natural - not overwhelming. actually takes out knots in my daughter&#x27;s hair better than I expected</li>
            <li> It agree wih my baby hair. i leave a nice smell and good enough it helps detangle her hair . Nice</li>
            <li> The best to do your Kids hair without any complains... It takes all the pain of combing their hair away!!!</li>
            <li> Works so well to make a tough job much easier and gentler.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner smells great but i don&#x27;t see any difference like using water on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s mixed hair.</li>
            <li> does well for my 3 year old sons course thick hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  My dug hater has very curly hair and nothing has worked very well on her curls.  This stuff knocks all of the tangles out and leaves gorgeous curls!  But it gets better!  I put a small amount in my two year olds fine, straight hair and it work amazing for hers too!</li>
            <li> I think its product is just ok. I mostly use this for when I travel and don&#x27;t want to take my own spray bottle with me. It smells very nice and leaves your hair soft but this doesn&#x27;t really define your curls as you detangle as the bottle claims. My hair is also still pretty poofy when I use this and I really wish it would help with smoothing it out. It&#x27;s an ok detangler but definitely would not use every day while at home simply because you can always make something better to use everyday. If you have something that you use already (and that you travel with) that works fine/great then i wouldn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
