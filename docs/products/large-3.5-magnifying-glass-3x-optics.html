    <ol>
            <li>He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am impressed!</li>
            <li>Very good to see the patches of skin, insects, animals, ants, plants, flowers, among others.</li>
            <li>This is a truly great value.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for most any reading, craft project, or close inspection of any item.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Good vision, good size.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
            <li>The lens distorts the image virtually not at all, right up to the edges, which makes this an excellent reading glass.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be made of good quality materials, seller was great, fast shipping, great price.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it also has some nice features.    </li>
            <li>Nice magnifying glass.  </li>
            <li>So I can honestly say &amp;#34; I like it&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My husband is 80 years old, and his eyes don&#x27;t work the greatest.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is unconscionable that amazon doesn&#x27;t invest resources to insure that we, their customers,get safe, honest, quality products.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of trying to figure just what will work best for low vision,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay magnifying glass.  </li>
            <li>others for this price have a better, clearer, stronger lens.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for one that has been used for many years and the kids scratched.</li>
            <li>I have to believe there are much better quality magnifying glasses out there.</li>
            <li>and I am glad to have it</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>Works fine. :)</li>
            <li>This seemed like a really good glass, with 3X magnification and real glass.  </li>
            <li>I tried to clean it with glass cleaner and the lens just fell out onto my counter top and was smashed.</li>
            <li>As we age, this type of object becomes more and more useful.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and can be handled easily.</li>
            <li>and it was not as strong as a 4x glass that I had seen before</li>
            <li>This glass in fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a scanning electron microscope, but now I can read the fine print.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap product but works fine and at this price that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>He can read smaller print with this which is great.</li>
            <li>cheap quality.  </li>
            <li>So this one really filled the bill</li>
            <li>It is so close, and they are so cheap</li>
            <li>Good optics, good size, and useful for most of the items that are too small for me to read without its help.</li>
            <li>The glass is a nice size, just wish it was clear.</li>
            <li>I did not think this was a true 4 inch</li>
            <li>The super glue did not work - thus we paid $9.80 plus shipping for an item we now have to throw away.  </li>
            <li>This product is helping her tremendously.  </li>
            <li>This is the last I am reviewing, and it is the second best, to a 4 inch metal frame Hawk MG 8779.</li>
            <li>The image is uniform and LARGE  to see easily.  </li>
            <li>, It is light with a large handle.</li>
            <li>The lens fell right out of its housing.  </li>
            <li>Great little glass!</li>
            <li>It is glass, however, not as clear or strong as my others.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavy at all and easy for her to carry</li>
            <li>I get some really lovely shots of my saltwater aquarium that were not possible with just the macro setting on the camera.</li>
            <li>I opened the package, removed the magnifying glass, looked through it and said \\&quot;well thats pretty nice\\</li>
            <li>Just some REALLY cheap plastic used to form the handle and the lens was not perfectly round either.  </li>
            <li>I am a computer tech and this product sure helps me out on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic rim on 1 side has the mold marks all the way around, looking like it was set on a hot plate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s up to you if you are willing to take the chance.</li>
            <li>could not find 1 positive thing in this product.</li>
            <li>Some producing good quality, and some very poor quality, like mine and many others.</li>
            <li>If you did get a decent one, it may be wise to put a few spots of glue on each side of the glass to prevent a lens fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>The diameter was just right for capturing nature items outside, and the magnification was enough that she actually enjoyed seeing more detail in different items.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want the spot with the extra magnification, then this is a fine choice.</li>
            <li>This magnifying glass has been wonderful for my husband who suffers from vision problems, thanks to diabetes and Agent Orange.</li>
            <li>It seems very sturdily made.</li>
            <li>retaining band broke, split straight through just about at the apex.  </li>
            <li>However, the lens is not held in very well.  </li>
            <li>This sits on my desk and is ready when I need it.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and does the job.  </li>
            <li>for the price it is a reasonable buy.</li>
            <li>The reason I did not say I love it is because I guess I do not really like to admit I need it.</li>
            <li>The magnifying glass is heavy and durable feeling, with good glass for a clear image.</li>
            <li>Generally I&#x27;m pleased, and give it four stars instead of five only because it clearly doesn&#x27;t give the 4X magnification that the Amazon description and the packaging claim.</li>
            <li>The glass itself is OK but watch out for the frame and the handle, it is very rough and you could cut your hand on the burrs.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was not sure why this one did not look as good, until I realized that this one cast a larger, darker shadow on the paper than the metal rim.</li>
            <li>Live and learn!</li>
            <li>The black part that holds the real glass lens in is plastic, and at it&#x27;s large size, it broke in the pocket of my bag easily.</li>
            <li>- it came quickly   - adequate size (but, like someone else said, even the outer frame diameter is only about 3 3/4\\&quot;)  </li>
            <li>When I removed the magnifying glass from the packaging, the glass immediately fell out of the frame and could not be re-inserted to stay put in the frame - my husband attempted to super glue it back in as we needed to give to his mother immediately.  </li>
            <li>The handle is about 8 cm (3.2 inches) long; I would prefer it a little longer to fit my hand better, but the length is acceptable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This one is great for casual use, but for extended use with overhead lighting, the thinner metal rim may be preferable.</li>
            <li>The frame and handle are plastic, not a hard plastic that would chip or crack, but a softer flexible plastic.   </li>
            <li>I needed a new one</li>
            <li>Would like it better if it had the little spot with the extra magnification, but since doesn&#x27;t advertise having that, can&#x27;t really fault the product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty flimsy plastic, but it was only $4.95.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves this!  </li>
            <li>I had seen the mixed reviews but was willing to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This handy little item is useful for taking the strain of reading small print.  </li>
            <li>we age we need a little help with the fine print.  </li>
            <li>The round cheap plastic retainer for the lens does not have a positive grove for the lens to snap solidly into, hence, it will not stay</li>
            <li>Lens glass has many imperfections, including visibly rough edges, a bubble, and a distorted center.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for our 89 year old aunt who is battling macular degeneration.  </li>
            <li>old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>It makes his daily reading much easier.</li>
            <li>Or is it that I&#x27;m getting old.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, THE MOST SERIOUS FAULT.</li>
            <li>They are exactly the same size, and magnify virtually the same size field.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see the point in returning it, as the postage was likely more than it was worth.</li>
            <li>can only conclude that due to some 4 and 5 star reviews, these most likely  come from different manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I ordered four different magnifying glasses to help me read my new Latin lexicon, and to compare the four for review.</li>
            <li>The entire piece was shoddy and the lens itself had so many imperfections that it was practically</li>
            <li>this is lightweight but like all plastic magnifiers it is not a sharp as glass but serves its purpose</li>
            <li>dum dee dum dumb tells me I need to say more stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li>But I was worried when I first opened the box because it is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>Works fine but was heavy and rough around the edges</li>
            <li>When I looked at the lens, I noticed that the glass was almost flat with high and low spots when viewed from the side, not convex, as a magnifier should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large but not too heavy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> If only to keep decent people from wasting hard earned money on a complete piece of junk, That may also be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took quite a while to clean up the broken glass pieces.</li>
            <li> I was able to glue them back with crazy glue.</li>

            <li> it is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Be that as it may, if it had at least been a decent grade of plastic product I could have lived with it.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the shipping charge to send it back.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in the process of trying to figure just what will work best for low vision, This glass in fine but I need stronger.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 89 year old aunt who is battling macular degeneration.  She loves it.  Enough said!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who said he wanted a BIG magnifying glass. He is very happy with it. But I was worried when I first opened the box because it is smaller than I expected. The glass is 3.5 inches. I don&#x27;t know how they can advertise it as 4 inches. Even if you include the black plastic rim, it&#x27;s just under 3.75 inches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay magnifying glass.  I bought it for when my reading glasses won&#x27;t let me see small details.  Pros:   - it came quickly   - adequate size (but, like someone else said, even the outer frame diameter is only about 3 3/4\\&quot;)  Cons:   - it doesn&#x27;t magnify 3x (unless you tilt it to stretch out the image), it&#x27;s closer to 2x   - plenty of rough mold seams for the plastic frame and handle. Yes I&#x27;ve smoothed it out myself, but shouldn&#x27;t have to.    I should have gotten one with a small high magnifying inset lense for the really small stuff, but I&#x27;ll keep this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my almost 5 yr. old granddaughter.  The diameter was just right for capturing nature items outside, and the magnification was enough that she actually enjoyed seeing more detail in different items.  It seems very sturdily made.</li>
            <li> Usefull when reading a paperback in bed rather then a spread out newspaper.</li>
            <li> The black part that holds the real glass lens in is plastic, and at it&#x27;s large size, it broke in the pocket of my bag easily. I can still use the glass part without the handle, but it&#x27;s really inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
            <li> others for this price have a better, clearer, stronger lens. It is glass, however, not as clear or strong as my others.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a really good glass, with 3X magnification and real glass.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been just four months since we got it and retaining band broke, split straight through just about at the apex.  Playing with it now that the glass is out it&#x27;s pretty flimsy plastic, but it was only $4.95.  Live and learn!</li>
            <li> When I removed the magnifying glass from the packaging, the glass immediately fell out of the frame and could not be re-inserted to stay put in the frame - my husband attempted to super glue it back in as we needed to give to his mother immediately.  The super glue did not work - thus we paid $9.80 plus shipping for an item we now have to throw away.  It is not worth the shipping charge to send it back.</li>
            <li> Rim and handle are poorly molded, cheap feeling plastic.  Lens glass has many imperfections, including visibly rough edges, a bubble, and a distorted center.  It works, but feels like something you&#x27;d get at a dollar store.</li>
            <li> I bought this magnifying glass with the hopes that it would increase the macro picture taking power of my little Kodak camera (EasyShare C813, 3x zoom). And it does! I get some really lovely shots of my saltwater aquarium that were not possible with just the macro setting on the camera. The optic glass allows me to get closer to objects. The magnifying glass is heavy and durable feeling, with good glass for a clear image.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. It makes his daily reading much easier.</li>
            <li> Bought 2.  They are inexpensive.  However, the lens is not held in very well.  It just pops out with some pressure or during shipping as happened in our case.</li>
            <li> I opened the package, removed the magnifying glass, looked through it and said \\&quot;well thats pretty nice\\&quot;, then CLUNK! The lens fell right out of its housing.  I saw that another review had the same issue so it&#x27;s obviously not just a fluke.  Just some REALLY cheap plastic used to form the handle and the lens was not perfectly round either.  DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING MONEY!</li>
            <li> The glass came so poorly packed that it was damaged. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see the point in returning it, as the postage was likely more than it was worth.</li>
            <li> Works fine but was heavy and rough around the edges</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to use it to read small prints, but Its not made of glass as advertised, its made of low quality plastic, the view shows a distorted image, very uncomfortable to read anything. The unit I received, there was a defect (some sort of bubble) in the plastic. Its horrible.</li>
            <li> This is just as advertised.  It&#x27;s large but not too heavy.  I didn&#x27;t want a magnifying glass that I had to hunt for all the time.  This sits on my desk and is ready when I need it.</li>
            <li> You can;t beat it for the price, I work in a Nursing Home and a resident needed it, It is light with a large handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who suffers from macular degeneration. She has trouble with the newspaper, phone book and any print items such as these.  This product is helping her tremendously.  It is very sturdy and does the job.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one that has been used for many years and the kids scratched. It is reliable. Those labels just keep getting smaller. for the price it is a reasonable buy.</li>
            <li> The glass has a coke bottle green tint to it, its not clear like you see in the example picture.   The frame and handle are plastic, not a hard plastic that would chip or crack, but a softer flexible plastic.   The magnifying glass I received had a small chip on the outer rim of the glass.   Made and assembled in China.   Packaged in a blister pack.    The glass is a nice size, just wish it was clear.</li>
            <li> This was a repeat order. The shipment arrived faster than promised, However, every one of them had the magnifying glass drop out of the plastic frame. This was unexpected and annoying. I was able to glue them back with crazy glue.</li>
            <li> Ever notice how the print is getting smaller?  Or is it that I&#x27;m getting old.    Works fine. :)</li>
            <li> I use this at work every day...and gave my cheesy plastic OfficeMax magnifying glass (which cost a lot more) away to some poor bas... I mean, guy. I have never regretted it. The other guy might.</li>
            <li> My husband is 80 years old, and his eyes don&#x27;t work the greatest.  He studies his Bible every day and finds this magnifying glass helpful in reading the small print in his commentaries and other study aids.</li>
            <li> This is really poor quality. When I received it I noticed that the lens was dirty and had what appeared to be a mark or defect in the glass. I tried to clean it with glass cleaner and the lens just fell out onto my counter top and was smashed. It took quite a while to clean up the broken glass pieces. I have to believe there are much better quality magnifying glasses out there. Save your money and find one.</li>
            <li> I think it is a matter of strength for each individual. I could have used a stronger magnifier, but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Great little glass! I am a computer tech and this product sure helps me out on a daily basis. Seems to be made of good quality materials, seller was great, fast shipping, great price.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. It&#x27;s a magnifying glass - what can I say?  Ya hold it in your hand and it makes things look bigger.  It&#x27;s not a scanning electron microscope, but now I can read the fine print.</li>
            <li> This is a truly great value.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews on this product remarking&lt;br /&gt;that it is rather weak where the handle is attached.  However, knowing that, I try&lt;br /&gt;to handle it carefully &amp; hold the bottom rim of the glass together w/ the handle&lt;br /&gt; instead of holding the habdle only.  I loove it.</li>
            <li> was looking at lots of these online for my mother and obviously got confused when ordering.  My 3 year old loves this!  She runs around either being a dective or just examining things, rocks, leaves etc...it&#x27;s not heavy at all and easy for her to carry</li>
            <li> I did not think this was a true 4 inch and it was not as strong as a 4x glass that I had seen before</li>
            <li> Good vision, good size. I like it! Very good to see the patches of skin, insects, animals, ants, plants, flowers, among others.</li>
            <li> This made-in-China magnifier enlarges up to about double the size of the object, so it&#x27;s about 2X, not 4X.  Having said that, it also has some nice features.    The housing and handle are hard plastic. The handle is about 8 cm (3.2 inches) long; I would prefer it a little longer to fit my hand better, but the length is acceptable. The lens is glass, not plastic.  The glass lens makes it a little heavier than some similar magnifiers: mine weighs 153 grams (5.4 ounces). I don&#x27;t find this weight troublesome. The diameter of the viewable area is about 98 mm (3.75 inches). The lens distorts the image virtually not at all, right up to the edges, which makes this an excellent reading glass.  Generally I&#x27;m pleased, and give it four stars instead of five only because it clearly doesn&#x27;t give the 4X magnification that the Amazon description and the packaging claim.</li>
            <li> This magnifying glass has been wonderful for my husband who suffers from vision problems, thanks to diabetes and Agent Orange. He can read smaller print with this which is great. As we age, this type of object becomes more and more useful. I would make this purchase again. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> was not happy.  cheap quality.  power did not seem to magnify 3x and the view was blurry requiring constant adjustment to use.  tossed it away as it was useless</li>
            <li> I had seen the mixed reviews but was willing to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I thought I was buying a magnifying \\&quot;glass\\&quot;, not a magnifying \\&quot;plastic\\&quot;.  Be that as it may, if it had at least been a decent grade of plastic product I could have lived with it.  The entire piece was shoddy and the lens itself had so many imperfections that it was practically unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> Good optics, good size, and useful for most of the items that are too small for me to read without its help.</li>
            <li> What can i say it definitely makes things bigger just like it&#x27;s suppose to. This is a great value yay</li>
            <li> this is lightweight but like all plastic magnifiers it is not a sharp as glass but serves its purpose and I am glad to have it</li>
            <li> I needed a new one So this one really filled the bill dum dee dum dumb tells me I need to say more stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li> I ordered four different magnifying glasses to help me read my new Latin lexicon, and to compare the four for review. This is the last I am reviewing, and it is the second best, to a 4 inch metal frame Hawk MG 8779. They are exactly the same size, and magnify virtually the same size field. I might give this one 4 1/2 stars, because there seems to be less distortion at the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is the thickness and color of the black rim versus the thin metal rim of my preferred choice. At first, I was not sure why this one did not look as good, until I realized that this one cast a larger, darker shadow on the paper than the metal rim. This one is great for casual use, but for extended use with overhead lighting, the thinner metal rim may be preferable. It is so close, and they are so cheap, I suggest you get one of each.</li>
            <li> This handy little item is useful for taking the strain of reading small print.  This also aids in eliminating misunderstandings due to improper recognition of words.</li>
            <li> This glass is just what I have been looking for everywhere I go. It is the perfect size for most any reading, craft project, or close inspection of any item. It is sturdy and can be handled easily. I am impressed!</li>
            <li> The image is uniform and LARGE  to see easily.  Having the focus of your eye assisted, is a please to use.</li>
            <li> The glass itself is OK but watch out for the frame and the handle, it is very rough and you could cut your hand on the burrs.  I had to file down some of the burrs to avoid cutting myself.  For the price, I guess this is what you get.</li>
            <li> Nice magnifying glass.  Would like it better if it had the little spot with the extra magnification, but since doesn&#x27;t advertise having that, can&#x27;t really fault the product.  If you don&#x27;t want the spot with the extra magnification, then this is a fine choice.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap product but works fine and at this price that is what I was looking for. I would recomend.</li>
            <li> I should have known better. I have a general rule that I won&#x27;t buy anything on amazon unless at least 75% of the ratings are 5 stars. But I thought, 5 bucks, what have I got to lose.&lt;br /&gt;The answer is, well, 5 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not find 1 positive thing in this product. The extremely poor quality needs to be pointed out. If only to keep decent people from wasting hard earned money on a complete piece of junk, That may also be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I carefully removed it from it&#x27;s box, the lens immediately dropped out onto my lap.When I looked at the lens, I noticed that the glass was almost flat with high and low spots when viewed from the side, not convex, as a magnifier should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, \\&quot;0\\&quot; magnification. I&#x27;d prefer a magnifier to make things LARGER! The \\&quot;lens\\&quot; was hazy on both sides, and nothing would remove it. On closer look, the \\&quot;haze\\&quot; was microscopic swirl marks on the glass. The round cheap plastic retainer for the lens does not have a positive grove for the lens to snap solidly into, hence, it will not stay in.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic rim on 1 side has the mold marks all the way around, looking like it was set on a hot plate. And mine is 3-1/2 inches, not 4\\&quot; as listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, THE MOST SERIOUS FAULT. What if a child is using it and the lens falls out and shatters, sending razor sharp shards of glass flying in every direction. The seller was &#x27;Lizards for peace&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unconscionable that amazon doesn&#x27;t invest resources to insure that we, their customers,get safe, honest, quality products. That should not be left for us to find out, after a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude that due to some 4 and 5 star reviews, these most likely  come from different manufacturers. Some producing good quality, and some very poor quality, like mine and many others. It&#x27;s up to you if you are willing to take the chance. If you did get a decent one, it may be wise to put a few spots of glue on each side of the glass to prevent a lens fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope my review helps someone in making a buying decision.ns fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope my review helps someone in making a buying decision.</li>
            <li> tAs we age we need a little help with the fine print.  This magnifier does just that.  The field is wide enough to take in whatever I am trying to see.  So I can honestly say &amp;#34; I like it&amp;#34;.  The reason I did not say I love it is because I guess I do not really like to admit I need it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this one the 3x optics are too weak!</li>
            <li> it is smaller than I expected. The glass is 3.5 inches. it is not 4inches only 3.5inches Also it is not 4x optics, just 3x optics. Also it is very bad quality glass.</li>
