    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>In terms of effectiveness, though, it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>With my shoulder length curly hair, this is not the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used but</li>
            <li>What an incredible conditioner!  </li>
            <li>The smell is so wonderful-</li>
            <li>I think the name Jungle suits the scent perfectly!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the smell is great and the concept is great....  </li>
            <li>The scent of this is amazing, although I don&#x27;t know that it smells of tropical fruit!</li>
            <li>Lush might benefit from offering a liquid version of this since it has an excellent result &amp; perfect scent.</li>
            <li>Granted, I didn&#x27;t have all kinds of smoothing chemicals and shine enhancers in my hair (which is good)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was lack of good ingredients</li>
            <li>THEN put it on your hair and let it set a good 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, what good is something that lasts forever if it doesn&#x27;t work?</li>
            <li>Best of all, the bar is durable and long-lasting and really compliments my favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This means that no matter what kind of shampoo I use</li>
            <li>This conditioner didn&#x27;t untangle my hair as much as I would have liked, however, my hair is sooo shiny and smells amazing, even the day after I washed it!!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as melty as one would need (which is good because their melty things disappear quickly) and it didn&#x27;t lather up (which is good because it&#x27;s not supposed to)</li>
            <li>I think the smell of this is very strong and not at all fruity or flowery.</li>
            <li>though individually very fine, hair.</li>
            <li>I was first attracted to this conditioner by its incredible scent - it smells quite strongly of pine.</li>
            <li>This would be one of my favorite products if it were a liquid or perhaps a semi-solid instead.</li>
            <li>I LOVE.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely though.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I&#x27;m pleased with this conditioner, although it could be better.     </li>
            <li>it smells more like a mix of fruits and veggies (probably the avocado and banana</li>
            <li>The shampoo was great, the conditioner, not so much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that my bathroom was filled with the scent of Jungle, but the bar nicely coated my hair with a soft floral smelling product that very easily rinsed out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the light smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells SO good, and is very conditioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight-ish, and after using the conditioner, my hair is silky and full of body!      </li>
            <li>Despite what some people may say, it is fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>It smells like an incencse shop to me, and I can still smell it in my hair when I wake up the next day (which would be good if I liked the smell).</li>
            <li>Though my hair is also very fine, it leaves just the right amount of moisture</li>
            <li>Plus you have the ecological bonus of no plastic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will suit the purpose for traveling light without bottles.</li>
            <li>The scent of this product is somewhat reminiscent of the times when you were a kid and found yourself rolling around happily on the grass.</li>
            <li>The smell stays in my hair, and conditions well enough to keep me happy.    </li>
            <li>The scent is strong and really lasts, but I have to use a liquid conditioner on top of it.</li>
            <li>However, as someone with greasy hair, I&#x27;ve learned to use conditioner sparingly and never near my roots, so perhaps that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t experienced the heaviness and greasiness</li>
            <li>I love Lush stuff for the most part and received this as a sample.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair smelling naturally clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>It has the distinct scent of grass and plant life... and with good reason: this condition is completely vegan.</li>
            <li>While I initially loved it, I&#x27;m familiar enough with it now that I&#x27;m looking for alternatives.    </li>
            <li>Although it can be a bit strong during use, the smell is great, and it definitely adds some real smoothness and shine, if not a lot of moisture to my dried-out hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the Boost conditioner by One Beauty products better.</li>
            <li>Just run it over your hair, if it doesn&#x27;t feel very covered, that&#x27;s ok, because it is.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I feel that the conditioner was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;ve got the shower water hot enough so that it melts, and it will coat your tresses nicely, then finger comb through and you can rinse it out.</li>
            <li>I love the solid shampoos, but this conditioner was not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am totally in love with Lush!!</li>
            <li>However, when using the bar, this scent is intensified, and I find the strong scent while using a little unbearable, but I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments, so it&#x27;s ultimately a good thing.     </li>
            <li>I have very thick, greasy hair, so this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>So far the conditioner has worked ok.</li>
            <li>It WILL, however, do a fantastic job of actually making your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about Jungle is its tropical scent, redolent of kiwi, banana, avocado, and sweet grass.  </li>
            <li>There are elements of \\&quot;freshly cut grass, bathing in a stream</li>
            <li>It is a return to nature, a super-moisturizing treat for your hair and well worth ordering again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why is using a shampoo and conditioner in a bar form so much fun?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the queen of limp, oil-slick hair, and I&#x27;m telling you right now that Jungle is a great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the queen of limp, oil-slick hair, and I&#x27;m telling you right now that Jungle is a great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I could never seem to get the right amount for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of comment on how great it looks and smells lately, so I think the Jungle bar is a success.</li>
            <li>This is a good idea and one of the best smells in the Lush line, but it can be difficult to use  because as a solid, it doesnt spread well on your hair.</li>
            <li>I actually found this to be a very light conditioner-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying the bar method first, and just make sure to go slow so as not to break and hairs, but if that doesn&#x27;t work, the paste method works fine, too, (just be aware that this method uses the conditioner up a LOT faster)!!     </li>
            <li>In the shower, I mush it up in my hand with a bit of hot water and put it on the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First off, I happen to like the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and have been using this product on and off for several years now.</li>
            <li>I paired it with one of Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, and boy do I love it!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, at first I didn&#x27;t like it though because it was really tricky to use</li>
            <li>It really took some getting use to, but now I really like it!</li>
            <li>can leave Jungle in as long as you like -- longer for more moisturizing effects.  </li>
            <li>First, I really don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li>It has a better smell and works better on my hair plus no little green pieces in the tub.</li>
            <li>It may not feel like you have enough of the product in your hair this way, but once you start massaging it in, you&#x27;ll find that it disperses easily.  </li>
            <li>, the packaging is minimal, the bar holds up well in the shower, is long lasting, and as mentioned by others, it travels wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Jungle goes on fast.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it really conditioned much.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and bouncy when it dries, and very manageable.</li>
            <li>and they said its really for straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have bone straight hair, and am a conditioner junkie.  </li>
            <li>it really calms the senses.  </li>
            <li>hair is the type that&#x27;s usually straight and limp but can hold a curl nicely with gel or hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Another showstopper from LUSH!!!</li>
            <li>Jungle is a nice switch from the usual conditioner that you apply and then have to wait for it to penetrate your hair.</li>
            <li>That worked okay, but I&#x27;ve got to say that I personally got much better results just running the bar down my hair (paying extra attention to the tips!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried combing it through, using more, using less, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different temperatures of water hoping that it would melt better as well as leaving it on for different amounts of time.</li>
            <li>I have a very busy schedule and really don&#x27;t have time for the cut a piece off and make a paste method.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was that it seemed like it would last a really long time compared to bottled conditioners.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li>conditioner actually does work pretty good, but only if you melt it down into a creamy liquid form.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, thick, and super oily, which means it turns into a greaseball if I don&#x27;t wash it every 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Jungle is truly the most versatile conditioner -- just read the reviews on this page and on LUSH&#x27;s website to see the myriad of ways people use it: daily conditioner, weekly deep conditioner, leave-in moisturizer, curl detangler, pomade, even shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>So healthy in fact that I find I only have to condition every 2-3 washings, and not for very long.</li>
            <li>And then caress it lightly into your (dry) hair to make it soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>as Lush&#x27;s flowertub bubble bar and gavarnie soap- a fresh and clean green floral.  </li>
            <li>;)g too much or waiting too long to rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made from), but it has a smell that is both green and very sweet-</li>
            <li>The application was a bit tricky at first, only because I had to keep swiping it on my hair to get the ends.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and fairly thick but also baby fine, so it tangles rather easily.</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair.</li>
            <li>An employee at my local Lush said that Jungle conditioner also works well as a shave cream, and it does!!!!</li>
            <li>A cool side benefit of using a lighter, natural conditioner was that my skin cleared up significantly - I suppose the excessively filmy silicon-based traditional conditioners were clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>This was my first Lush order and this seemed to be the most commonly used conditioner bar, so I ordered it along with my ultimate shine shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the bars dry my hair out more than I would like.</li>
            <li>I used to rub it directly on my hair (like the solid shampoo bars), but I find that it&#x27;s better to slice off slivers and then break off little bits from that.  </li>
            <li>has an absolutely alluring scent, which is probably why I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li>I have been a Lush goer for 10 years.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I have no trouble.  </li>
            <li>so many others have complained about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to intensify the results by simply using more, but I&#x27;ve found that it becomes increasingly difficult to rinse out effectively when doing so - it ends up leaving this heavy, greasy film when too much is used.     </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that it actually works better for me than Veganese, LUSH&#x27;s liquid vegan conditioner, and allows me to use a lot less product to achieve the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose that this completely defeats the purpose of having it as a solid, but the difficulty applying it as such was really just not working out.    </li>
            <li>Chop off a piece of it (maybe put a little coconut oil with it) in a small pot and warm it up.</li>
            <li>I am a recent Lush convert.</li>
            <li>This is ok every once in awhile, but when I used it everyday on my trip my hair got greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d use it the same way you use Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos by combing the bar through my hair.</li>
            <li>That said, unfortunately I don&#x27;t find solid conditioners to be terribly effective.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the whole time I used this product--which, as I said, was about two years--my hair was more dull and coarse than it usually is.</li>
            <li>I have oily hair, and despite some of the complaints here that it weighs down hair like mine, it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have to look professional, so I am very seriously considering switching, even though I have a huge chunk of this stuff left.    </li>
            <li>Or, as I do, you can simply rub the bar directly on your hair/scalp in long strokes and circles.  </li>
            <li>Making a mush every time isn&#x27;t fun, and I&#x27;m not sure about microwaving it, but this is a trend with their solid products.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thick or very dry, this might not be strong enough for you, but I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I just rub the bar down the length of my hair a few times, paying special attention to the ends, and rinse shortly after.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying the bar method first, and just make sure to go slow so as not to break and hairs, but if that doesn&#x27;t work, the paste method works fine, too, (just be aware that this method uses the conditioner up a LOT faster)!!     </li>
            <li> In the shower, I mush it up in my hand with a bit of hot water and put it on the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First off, I happen to like the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and have been using this product on and off for several years now.</li>
            <li> I paired it with one of Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, and boy do I love it!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, at first I didn&#x27;t like it though because it was really tricky to use</li>
            <li> It really took some getting use to, but now I really like it!</li>
            <li> can leave Jungle in as long as you like -- longer for more moisturizing effects.  </li>
            <li> First, I really don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> It has a better smell and works better on my hair plus no little green pieces in the tub.</li>
            <li> It may not feel like you have enough of the product in your hair this way, but once you start massaging it in, you&#x27;ll find that it disperses easily.  </li>
            <li> , the packaging is minimal, the bar holds up well in the shower, is long lasting, and as mentioned by others, it travels wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Jungle goes on fast.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it really conditioned much.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and bouncy when it dries, and very manageable.</li>
            <li> and they said its really for straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have bone straight hair, and am a conditioner junkie.  </li>
            <li> it really calms the senses.  </li>
            <li> hair is the type that&#x27;s usually straight and limp but can hold a curl nicely with gel or hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Another showstopper from LUSH!!!</li>
            <li> Jungle is a nice switch from the usual conditioner that you apply and then have to wait for it to penetrate your hair.</li>
            <li> That worked okay, but I&#x27;ve got to say that I personally got much better results just running the bar down my hair (paying extra attention to the tips!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried combing it through, using more, using less, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different temperatures of water hoping that it would melt better as well as leaving it on for different amounts of time.</li>
            <li> I have a very busy schedule and really don&#x27;t have time for the cut a piece off and make a paste method.</li>
            <li> The only good thing was that it seemed like it would last a really long time compared to bottled conditioners.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> conditioner actually does work pretty good, but only if you melt it down into a creamy liquid form.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, thick, and super oily, which means it turns into a greaseball if I don&#x27;t wash it every 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Jungle is truly the most versatile conditioner -- just read the reviews on this page and on LUSH&#x27;s website to see the myriad of ways people use it: daily conditioner, weekly deep conditioner, leave-in moisturizer, curl detangler, pomade, even shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> So healthy in fact that I find I only have to condition every 2-3 washings, and not for very long.</li>
            <li> And then caress it lightly into your (dry) hair to make it soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> as Lush&#x27;s flowertub bubble bar and gavarnie soap- a fresh and clean green floral.  </li>
            <li> ;)g too much or waiting too long to rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made from), but it has a smell that is both green and very sweet-</li>
            <li> The application was a bit tricky at first, only because I had to keep swiping it on my hair to get the ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and fairly thick but also baby fine, so it tangles rather easily.</li>
            <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair.</li>
            <li> An employee at my local Lush said that Jungle conditioner also works well as a shave cream, and it does!!!!</li>
            <li> A cool side benefit of using a lighter, natural conditioner was that my skin cleared up significantly - I suppose the excessively filmy silicon-based traditional conditioners were clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> This was my first Lush order and this seemed to be the most commonly used conditioner bar, so I ordered it along with my ultimate shine shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the bars dry my hair out more than I would like.</li>
            <li> I used to rub it directly on my hair (like the solid shampoo bars), but I find that it&#x27;s better to slice off slivers and then break off little bits from that.  </li>
            <li> has an absolutely alluring scent, which is probably why I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> I have been a Lush goer for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I have no trouble.  </li>
            <li> so many others have complained about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to intensify the results by simply using more, but I&#x27;ve found that it becomes increasingly difficult to rinse out effectively when doing so - it ends up leaving this heavy, greasy film when too much is used.     </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it actually works better for me than Veganese, LUSH&#x27;s liquid vegan conditioner, and allows me to use a lot less product to achieve the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose that this completely defeats the purpose of having it as a solid, but the difficulty applying it as such was really just not working out.    </li>
            <li> Chop off a piece of it (maybe put a little coconut oil with it) in a small pot and warm it up.</li>
            <li> I am a recent Lush convert.</li>
            <li> This is ok every once in awhile, but when I used it everyday on my trip my hair got greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d use it the same way you use Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos by combing the bar through my hair.</li>
            <li> That said, unfortunately I don&#x27;t find solid conditioners to be terribly effective.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the whole time I used this product--which, as I said, was about two years--my hair was more dull and coarse than it usually is.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair, and despite some of the complaints here that it weighs down hair like mine, it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have to look professional, so I am very seriously considering switching, even though I have a huge chunk of this stuff left.    </li>
            <li> Or, as I do, you can simply rub the bar directly on your hair/scalp in long strokes and circles.  </li>
            <li> Making a mush every time isn&#x27;t fun, and I&#x27;m not sure about microwaving it, but this is a trend with their solid products.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick or very dry, this might not be strong enough for you, but I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I just rub the bar down the length of my hair a few times, paying special attention to the ends, and rinse shortly after.</li>
            <li> If you find that Jungle weighs your hair down, you&#x27;re probably using too much or waiting too long to rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> I have the pink tea tree face bar, too, and it&#x27;s incredibly dry and hard to use unless you take the time to mash little pieces into smaller and smaller pieces in warm water.    </li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This goes especially well with Go Green solid Shampoo from Lush...........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a LOT of hair, and the bar still looks like it did when I got it, which makes me think the bar is going to last for a very long time.     </li>
            <li> You can melt a piece in warm water or in the microwave to make a liquid as thick or thin as you desire, or mush it up in the shower to make a paste.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something to bring my dull, brittle ends to life, but I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles.    </li>
            <li> scent of the product was somewhat different than expected, but almost primal in its roots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll move on to other kinds of solid conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I first went to use it I was confused a bit.</li>
            <li> The silly woman didn&#x27;t understand you have to have the water hot enough to let the stuff melt!</li>
            <li> So at first I thought it might just be too heavy for my thick, wavy,</li>
            <li> It actually is far less heavy than a lot of liquid conditioners you buy in drugstores.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve started to notice that tiny little bits remain in my hair even after rinsing (it looks like dandruff, except fewer in number and a little larger in size).    </li>
            <li> I once read a review on the Lush site where someone complained about it being all waxy and leaving a coating all over her hair.</li>
            <li> I never tried the other uses for it that people mentioned, such as shaving, because it seems like a waste.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slick my hair up enough for detangling</li>
            <li> Until recently, I was using bottled store brand conditioner to combat the dryness, but was not really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My daughter decided that she would like to try their Squeaky Green solid shampoo, so I also got a small wedge of Jungle conditioner bar.  </li>
            <li> You just use less of it.</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer says, it reminds you of rolling around in grass and flowers as a kid.  </li>
            <li> I ended up accidentally pulling some of my hair out in the process because this conditioner is slightly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the bar for about a week and a half now, and use it every time I shower.</li>
            <li> I have to condition the bottome half of my hair</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> Just try using a little less.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of complaints about this conditioner damaging the hair, so I started out, as one reviewer suggested, by crumbling a small chunk and making a paste and applying it to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used probably at least a pound of this stuff in the past two years.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it gets awfully mushy near the end and without a soap dish or something to keep it in, you will have a mess in your shower.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t feel that it conditions my hair hardly at all.</li>
            <li> , I think that it was just really awkward to get enough of the conditioner off of the bar.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use as a solid, so</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used probably at least a pound of this stuff in the past two years. While I initially loved it, I&#x27;m familiar enough with it now that I&#x27;m looking for alternatives.    Yes, it smells amazing. But application can be difficult for new users. I rub it on my hair and I&#x27;ve started to notice that tiny little bits remain in my hair even after rinsing (it looks like dandruff, except fewer in number and a little larger in size).    Not cool. I think it has to do with the friction created by dragging it over damp hair. Making a mush every time isn&#x27;t fun, and I&#x27;m not sure about microwaving it, but this is a trend with their solid products. I have the pink tea tree face bar, too, and it&#x27;s incredibly dry and hard to use unless you take the time to mash little pieces into smaller and smaller pieces in warm water.    Finally, the whole time I used this product--which, as I said, was about two years--my hair was more dull and coarse than it usually is. Granted, I didn&#x27;t have all kinds of smoothing chemicals and shine enhancers in my hair (which is good) but I think the conditioner&#x27;s residue stays in one&#x27;s hair. I have to look professional, so I am very seriously considering switching, even though I have a huge chunk of this stuff left.    It&#x27;s eco-friendly, but not that user-friendly. I&#x27;ll move on to other kinds of solid conditioner.</li>
            <li> Jungle is a nice switch from the usual conditioner that you apply and then have to wait for it to penetrate your hair. Jungle goes on fast. Just make sure you&#x27;ve got the shower water hot enough so that it melts, and it will coat your tresses nicely, then finger comb through and you can rinse it out. No waiting required. I once read a review on the Lush site where someone complained about it being all waxy and leaving a coating all over her hair. The silly woman didn&#x27;t understand you have to have the water hot enough to let the stuff melt! I know some conditioners recommend a cold rinse, but this one doesn&#x27;t work that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lush has an absolutely alluring scent, which is probably why I keep coming back to it. I have oily hair, and despite some of the complaints here that it weighs down hair like mine, it really doesn&#x27;t. You just use less of it. It actually is far less heavy than a lot of liquid conditioners you buy in drugstores. Plus you have the ecological bonus of no plastic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it gets awfully mushy near the end and without a soap dish or something to keep it in, you will have a mess in your shower. I never tried the other uses for it that people mentioned, such as shaving, because it seems like a waste. For the money, shaving cream is a lot less expensive. But the smell is so intoxicating that I might try it sometime.</li>
            <li> I love Lush stuff for the most part and received this as a sample.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the smell is great and the concept is great....  but I don&#x27;t think it really conditioned much.  I don&#x27;t think it was lack of good ingredients, I think that it was just really awkward to get enough of the conditioner off of the bar.  It isn&#x27;t as melty as one would need (which is good because their melty things disappear quickly) and it didn&#x27;t lather up (which is good because it&#x27;s not supposed to) but I don&#x27;t think I got enough off of it.  I&#x27;d pass. And I&#x27;d try their shampoo/conditioner bar.  It&#x27;s yellow.</li>
            <li> I think the smell of this is very strong and not at all fruity or flowery. So far the conditioner has worked ok. I really like the Boost conditioner by One Beauty products better. It has a better smell and works better on my hair plus no little green pieces in the tub.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea and one of the best smells in the Lush line, but it can be difficult to use  because as a solid, it doesnt spread well on your hair. The solid shampoos lather with ease, but the solid conditioner doesn&#x27;t want to yield. Lush might benefit from offering a liquid version of this since it has an excellent result &amp; perfect scent. I find it is easiest to use on the ends of my hair because i can run it across my hair as it sits in one hand.  This would be one of my favorite products if it were a liquid or perhaps a semi-solid instead.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this conditioner takes a little adjusting to. When I first got it, I WAY over conditioned while trying to produce that slick feeling that liquid conditioners have. So at first I thought it might just be too heavy for my thick, wavy, though individually very fine, hair. This bar will never produce a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; feel in the shower. It WILL, however, do a fantastic job of actually making your hair healthy. So healthy in fact that I find I only have to condition every 2-3 washings, and not for very long. I just rub the bar down the length of my hair a few times, paying special attention to the ends, and rinse shortly after. My hair is shiny and bouncy when it dries, and very manageable. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of comment on how great it looks and smells lately, so I think the Jungle bar is a success. I also use their solid shampoo, shine goddess or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging is minimal, the bar holds up well in the shower, is long lasting, and as mentioned by others, it travels wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is amazing, although I don&#x27;t know that it smells of tropical fruit! I know a lot of people say the fragrance lingers in their hair afterward, I could only smell it faintly for an hour or so until it faded.  In terms of effectiveness, though, it works wonderfully.  Honestly, at first I didn&#x27;t like it though because it was really tricky to use and I could never seem to get the right amount for my hair.  I used to rub it directly on my hair (like the solid shampoo bars), but I find that it&#x27;s better to slice off slivers and then break off little bits from that.  In the shower, I mush it up in my hand with a bit of hot water and put it on the ends of my hair.  It really took some getting use to, but now I really like it!</li>
            <li> I have been a Lush goer for 10 years. I LOVE. the smell. Like the previous reviewer says, it reminds you of rolling around in grass and flowers as a kid.  However my hair is EXTREMELY thick and it just doesn&#x27;t work at all. I asked an employee and they said its really for straight hair. Makes sense, my friend&#x27;s hair is bone sraight and she didn&#x27;t understand when I gave mine to her.  The smell is lovely though.</li>
            <li> Take a tiny piece and put it in the palm of your hand. Then mush it up with your finger(s) until it melts. And then caress it lightly into your (dry) hair to make it soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> Yup, this conditioner comes in a solid form to cut down on the unnecessary packaging. I had never heard of such a thing until recently. When I first went to use it I was confused a bit. Figured I&#x27;d use it the same way you use Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos by combing the bar through my hair. Not a good idea. I ended up accidentally pulling some of my hair out in the process because this conditioner is slightly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner actually does work pretty good, but only if you melt it down into a creamy liquid form. Chop off a piece of it (maybe put a little coconut oil with it) in a small pot and warm it up. THEN put it on your hair and let it set a good 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely wonderful. It leaves your hair smelling naturally clean and shiny. It is light and doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair. It has the distinct scent of grass and plant life... and with good reason: this condition is completely vegan. It has no animal byproducts as ingredients and it is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> With my shoulder length curly hair, this is not the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used but will suit the purpose for traveling light without bottles. It doesn&#x27;t slick my hair up enough for detangling so I still need to use a leave-in spritz.</li>
            <li> I am a recent Lush convert. My daughter decided that she would like to try their Squeaky Green solid shampoo, so I also got a small wedge of Jungle conditioner bar.  A few days ago I decided to give it a try and I have to say that I&#x27;m hooked.  I love the light smell.  I can&#x27;t honestly say that my bathroom was filled with the scent of Jungle, but the bar nicely coated my hair with a soft floral smelling product that very easily rinsed out of my hair.  Though my hair is also very fine, it leaves just the right amount of moisture and I haven&#x27;t had my usual winter frizz issues.      If your hair is thick or very dry, this might not be strong enough for you, but I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have bone straight hair, and am a conditioner junkie.  This conditioner didn&#x27;t untangle my hair as much as I would have liked, however, my hair is sooo shiny and smells amazing, even the day after I washed it!! I am totally in love with Lush!!</li>
            <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about Jungle is its tropical scent, redolent of kiwi, banana, avocado, and sweet grass.  When you apply it to your hair, it releases additional notes of lavender and passion fruit.  As a conditioner, it&#x27;s insanely versatile and has minimal packaging waste -- it comes in a small paper wrapper, which can be recycled or reused as an air freshener (it smells that good!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is the type that&#x27;s usually straight and limp but can hold a curl nicely with gel or hairspray.  It&#x27;s fine, thick, and super oily, which means it turns into a greaseball if I don&#x27;t wash it every 24 hours.  Jungle makes my hair silky and glossy, combats the oil, and adds a sensible amount of plant-based moisture without leaving a residue.  I was surprised to find that it actually works better for me than Veganese, LUSH&#x27;s liquid vegan conditioner, and allows me to use a lot less product to achieve the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jungle is truly the most versatile conditioner -- just read the reviews on this page and on LUSH&#x27;s website to see the myriad of ways people use it: daily conditioner, weekly deep conditioner, leave-in moisturizer, curl detangler, pomade, even shaving cream.  You can melt a piece in warm water or in the microwave to make a liquid as thick or thin as you desire, or mush it up in the shower to make a paste.  Or, as I do, you can simply rub the bar directly on your hair/scalp in long strokes and circles.  It may not feel like you have enough of the product in your hair this way, but once you start massaging it in, you&#x27;ll find that it disperses easily.  A little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can leave Jungle in as long as you like -- longer for more moisturizing effects.  Even though I rinse my hair after just 30 seconds, the luscious scent lasts for the rest of the day.  It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you overload your hair with Jungle, like any conditioner, it will probably leave a residue.  If you find that Jungle weighs your hair down, you&#x27;re probably using too much or waiting too long to rinse it out.  Trust me: I&#x27;m the queen of limp, oil-slick hair, and I&#x27;m telling you right now that Jungle is a great conditioner.  Just try using a little less. ;)g too much or waiting too long to rinse it out.  Trust me: I&#x27;m the queen of limp, oil-slick hair, and I&#x27;m telling you right now that Jungle is a great conditioner.  Just try using a little less. ;)</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is somewhat reminiscent of the times when you were a kid and found yourself rolling around happily on the grass. There are elements of \\&quot;freshly cut grass, bathing in a stream and I&#x27;m going to close my eyes and pretend that I&#x27;m in a Rain Forest.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the product was somewhat different than expected, but almost primal in its roots. It is a return to nature, a super-moisturizing treat for your hair and well worth ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lasts quite some time and seems to melt into your hair after shampooing. You can keep this in the shower without worry about it getting all gummy or dissolving into nothing with the steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is using a shampoo and conditioner in a bar form so much fun? I can only think it reminds us all of simpler times and handmade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It smells SO good, and is very conditioning. Despite what some people may say, it is fairly easy to use. Just run it over your hair, if it doesn&#x27;t feel very covered, that&#x27;s ok, because it is. An employee at my local Lush said that Jungle conditioner also works well as a shave cream, and it does!!!! This goes especially well with Go Green solid Shampoo from Lush...........</li>
            <li> What an incredible conditioner!  I paired it with one of Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, and boy do I love it!  The smell is so wonderful- it really calms the senses.  The application was a bit tricky at first, only because I had to keep swiping it on my hair to get the ends.  Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I have no trouble.  My hair is straight-ish, and after using the conditioner, my hair is silky and full of body!      Another showstopper from LUSH!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the bars dry my hair out more than I would like. Until recently, I was using bottled store brand conditioner to combat the dryness, but was not really pleased with the results. Ultimately, I&#x27;m pleased with this conditioner, although it could be better.     First off, I happen to like the smell. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d call it grassy, since to me it smells more like a mix of fruits and veggies (probably the avocado and banana it&#x27;s made from), but it has a smell that is both green and very sweet- I think the name Jungle suits the scent perfectly! However, when using the bar, this scent is intensified, and I find the strong scent while using a little unbearable, but I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments, so it&#x27;s ultimately a good thing.     I actually found this to be a very light conditioner- I have very thick, greasy hair, so this is perfect for me! However, as someone with greasy hair, I&#x27;ve learned to use conditioner sparingly and never near my roots, so perhaps that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t experienced the heaviness and greasiness so many others have complained about. Unfortunately, the conditioner also does not moisturize my hair as I had hoped. I was really hoping for something to bring my dull, brittle ends to life, but I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles.    I&#x27;ve had the bar for about a week and a half now, and use it every time I shower. I&#x27;ve got a LOT of hair, and the bar still looks like it did when I got it, which makes me think the bar is going to last for a very long time.     I&#x27;ve read a lot of complaints about this conditioner damaging the hair, so I started out, as one reviewer suggested, by crumbling a small chunk and making a paste and applying it to my hair. That worked okay, but I&#x27;ve got to say that I personally got much better results just running the bar down my hair (paying extra attention to the tips!). I&#x27;d recommend trying the bar method first, and just make sure to go slow so as not to break and hairs, but if that doesn&#x27;t work, the paste method works fine, too, (just be aware that this method uses the conditioner up a LOT faster)!!     Ultimately, I feel that the conditioner was a good buy. Although it can be a bit strong during use, the smell is great, and it definitely adds some real smoothness and shine, if not a lot of moisture to my dried-out hair. Best of all, the bar is durable and long-lasting and really compliments my favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and fairly thick but also baby fine, so it tangles rather easily. This means that no matter what kind of shampoo I use I have to condition the bottome half of my hair or I can&#x27;t get a comb through it. This was my first Lush order and this seemed to be the most commonly used conditioner bar, so I ordered it along with my ultimate shine shampoo. The shampoo was great, the conditioner, not so much. First, I really don&#x27;t like the smell at all. It smells like an incencse shop to me, and I can still smell it in my hair when I wake up the next day (which would be good if I liked the smell). Also, I don&#x27;t feel that it conditions my hair hardly at all. I&#x27;ve tried different temperatures of water hoping that it would melt better as well as leaving it on for different amounts of time. I have a very busy schedule and really don&#x27;t have time for the cut a piece off and make a paste method. The only good thing was that it seemed like it would last a really long time compared to bottled conditioners. But, what good is something that lasts forever if it doesn&#x27;t work? Hopefully I just made the wrong choice and another Lush product will be what works for me. I&#x27;ll be using my pantene until I find it though.</li>
            <li> I was first attracted to this conditioner by its incredible scent - it smells quite strongly of pine. I absolutely love it, and have been using this product on and off for several years now. The smell stays in my hair, and conditions well enough to keep me happy.    However, this is not at all a deep conditioner, and as one who often dyes my hair, I find it a bit lacking in that respect. I&#x27;ve tried to intensify the results by simply using more, but I&#x27;ve found that it becomes increasingly difficult to rinse out effectively when doing so - it ends up leaving this heavy, greasy film when too much is used.     It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use as a solid, so I&#x27;ve always mixed it with a bit of water and put it in a bottle. I suppose that this completely defeats the purpose of having it as a solid, but the difficulty applying it as such was really just not working out.    All things considered, I think I would still recommend this product to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it. A cool side benefit of using a lighter, natural conditioner was that my skin cleared up significantly - I suppose the excessively filmy silicon-based traditional conditioners were clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has an intoxicating smell.  It&#x27;s the same smell as Lush&#x27;s flowertub bubble bar and gavarnie soap- a fresh and clean green floral.  That said, unfortunately I don&#x27;t find solid conditioners to be terribly effective.  This conditions my hair some, but never enough.  I&#x27;ve tried combing it through, using more, using less, etc.  All to no avail.  So, now I&#x27;m using this as hair perfume.  The scent is strong and really lasts, but I have to use a liquid conditioner on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love the solid shampoos, but this conditioner was not my favorite.  This is ok every once in awhile, but when I used it everyday on my trip my hair got greasy and weighed down.</li>
