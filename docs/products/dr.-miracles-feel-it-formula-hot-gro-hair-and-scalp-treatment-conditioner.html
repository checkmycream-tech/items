            <li> good hold doesn&#x27;t make it hard and gross, but it does make your hair a little greasy but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> I will try some other products in their line that I&#x27;d like to try.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit what I usually do is put a dime size on my finger tips rub it together</li>
            <li> honestly not for white women hair</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair every other day because it starts itching and flaking but who cares!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday sometimes</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 6 months now.</li>
            <li> I just do not like how thick this grease is.</li>

            <li> I bought this item October 17 of this year because I&#x27;d like it to help my hair grow a little more.  Well, the smell is fine I just do not like how thick this grease is. It would be better if it was a little lighter.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday sometimes like you&#x27;re suppose to twice a day.  As far as it working for growth I cannot tell you if it does because I don&#x27;t use any other products from their line for better results. I will use this item up because I don&#x27;t want to waste it. Not sure I&#x27;ll purchase this item again. I will try some other products in their line that I&#x27;d like to try. I wish anyone using this product the best of luck :-). I give it 2 stars I haven&#x27;t seen results yet.  As you can see I have not been using the product for a longtime. Time and patients. Hair vitamins might work also.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that i can feel a tingling sensation after rubbing into my scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for a few years and it has made a difference in my hair growth. You only need to use a little bit what I usually do is put a dime size on my finger tips rub it together then I massage it into my scalp works best if you put a satin scarf on your head at night to seal the product in more. My hair grows faster with this product definitely will recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great seller.</li>
            <li> honestly not for white women hair</li>
            <li> after i wash my hair and blow-dry it i love using this to open my pores and help blood flow to my head ! it smells like peppermint product will open nasal passages lol but will also aid in making your scalp feel like heaven on earth !</li>
            <li> I did not get what I ordered. The advertisement was for the fresh sent. I received the old sent. Not at all what I wanted! !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 6 months now. And you guess what??? It actually works! Even my barber has noticed it. I use this along with the whole line of products from Dr. Miracles. I have to wash my hair every other day because it starts itching and flaking but who cares!! It works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to give it a better star rating. I will update again.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s just OK because it is extremely thick and I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s viscosity is ultimately good for a healthy scalp! I use it VERY sparingly, and the hair at my roots look very greasy. I&#x27;m keeping it for a weekly intense treatment to use before shampooing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as my hair is starting to thin on top.  I think it is reasonably priced.  I am a middle-aged female who colors her hair.  I like the product despite the rather strong clove smell (although it is a natural scent).  I rubbed it onto my scalp and some on my ends and sat with it under a shower cap.  After shampooing, my hair feels really nice and soft and my natural wave seems stronger.  I recommend it. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I am a new user so time will tell if it helps the thinning.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me about it.  I love the product. Would recommend to many friends with simular hair. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product.</li>
            <li> I used the Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Feel It Formula Hot Gro, Hair &amp; Scalp Treatment Conditioner, Super Strength for over a year, my hair did grow.  I still use it, and do not see any growth! Maybe my hair is at wit&#x27;s end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> I love the tingly feeling on my scalp it smells divine and my hair is growing and shiny</li>
            <li> It helps hair growth, but I have to use it in the shower and rinse it out to reduce how greasy and sticky it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and it helps her hair grow.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because it is awesome I use it every night and I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> good hold doesn&#x27;t make it hard and gross, but it does make your hair a little greasy but nothing crazy. only need like the size of a penny and work through the hair. smells good, and does make hair look thicker</li>
