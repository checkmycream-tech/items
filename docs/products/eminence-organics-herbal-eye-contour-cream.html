            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>

            <li>it is very rich and nourishing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so easy on my eyes</li>
            <li>It goes on easily without tugging or pulling the skin...</li>
            <li>this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>Find a way to keep the container secure and from leaking out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell  a difference, but I think this product is good.</li>
            <li>and I can just dab in my clean finger and take out the amount I want.</li>
            <li>This product goes a long way - it feels very nice when applying around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tgicker than regular moisturizer, which is good.</li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream I have used and has become the only one I buy regularly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, goes very far (you only need a teeny dab for both eyes top and bottom), I just love it!</li>
            <li>My first impression upon opening box and looking at the cream was :cheap looking product.</li>
            <li>Kind of gross now</li>
            <li>I like this Herbal Eye Contour Cream very much.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels and seems to be keeping the deep lines from forming around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>When I pay more than $20 for a tiny jar of cream, I expect it to be a grass jar and not plastic.</li>
            <li>i have tried many eye creams and sometimes they are not nourishing enough</li>
            <li>The protective seal sort of popped off at first touch, but not like it had been opened before, like the adhesive had worn out.</li>
            <li>With my aging skin though I find I need better moisturizers and one that will last from morning till night!  </li>
            <li>It does kind of smell of old lady, but I really don&#x27;t mind that much because the scent dissipates quickly, especially when I layer other amazing smelling eminence product over it on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>I am only halfway through this jar, which is incredible, as all other products I used generally would be gone within 2 months!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the result that much even I read reviews.</li>
            <li>very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really dose what it says</li>
            <li>It works really well and my under eye makeup applies really well after using this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mid 30s,and I&#x27;ve got fine lines around my eyes recently.  </li>
            <li>I am 55 with very good skin and very little wrinkles and have been using moisturizing products for the past 25 years.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are much less now and softer looking.</li>
            <li>I was most surprised with how long this lasts, you really do only use a tiny bit with each application.</li>
            <li>Have been using a few months, and this cream completely solved the problem, my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>burn my eyes, soft texture and abrorb</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is part of the line of products that are far and away my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I might like it if I could use the product for a while, but I am really sensitive to smells and couldn&#x27;t handle this one on my face.  </li>
            <li>For a 58 years old women, I still get complements on my skin.</li>
            <li>The product I received had to have been old, though I couldn&#x27;t find an expiration date.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, actually had to quit using Clinique which I used for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased Eminence from Amazon, as I always purchased it from a salon before, but the price was $30 less</li>

            <li> I got it because my eyelids and under eyes were getting dry and flaky.</li>

            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>

            <li> It flops around loose and the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on tight.  </li>
            <li> I often put a drop of water on my fingers after applying this product and apply the wet finger to the under eye area to help spread the cream a little easier.</li>
            <li> I even tried to mix it a little, but it was still chunky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soothing, and I feel the difference if I&#x27;ve not used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> And the cream was HARD.</li>
            <li> Do not get me wrong, I do not expect gold plated engraving but comparing to other expensive products that I use this looks</li>
            <li> All of their products are very thick.  </li>
            <li> One was so bad I returned it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for years.  Love the pudding-like texture of the cream and the fact that it is not greasy.  It&#x27;s so soothing, and I feel the difference if I&#x27;ve not used it for a few days. Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mid 30s,and I&#x27;ve got fine lines around my eyes recently.  I found Eminence when I was looking for the organic skincare products. I didn&#x27;t expect the result that much even I read reviews. Umm...even though it does not work&lt;br /&gt;dramaticaly, I can say it is good product.&lt;br /&gt;No burn my eyes, soft texture and abrorb well. I couldn&#x27;t see the result for a while. However, oneday I noticed my lines were gone. It work slowly but does really well.&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is part of the line of products that are far and away my favorites.  I have tried a variety of eye creams and most have been satisfactory, but this one is an ideal combination of light and emollient.  I have been using it for many years now - night and day.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way - it feels very nice when applying around the eyes.  I apply before my moisturizer and know that the skin around my eyes looks better and brighter.  I would definitely order this again.  However, a little goes a long way and I still have quite a bit in the jar.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t review what I did not get.  I ordered the Herbal Eye Contour Cream and instead got lip balm.  Very unhappy with this order.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, actually had to quit using Clinique which I used for over 20 years. This stuff is so easy on my eyes it doesn&#x27;t even matter if I get it in one! I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years and have never had any irritation, burning... anything. It&#x27;s light, goes very far (you only need a teeny dab for both eyes top and bottom), I just love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for about 4 years now.  I love how it feels and seems to be keeping the deep lines from forming around my eyes.  The way they pack the container in the box is a joke however! It flops around loose and the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on tight.  The last 3 I ordered leaked out in the box. One was so bad I returned it. Come on Eminence...this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.  Find a way to keep the container secure and from leaking out.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand and found shopping online to be easy.&lt;br /&gt;I will do this again when the product runs out.</li>
            <li> This eye cream moisturizes the area around my eyes. It&#x27;s tgicker than regular moisturizer, which is good. I feel like I&#x27;m preventing crows feet from surfacing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell  a difference, but I think this product is good. I like that it is in a jar and I can just dab in my clean finger and take out the amount I want. A little goes a long way! It does kind of smell of old lady, but I really don&#x27;t mind that much because the scent dissipates quickly, especially when I layer other amazing smelling eminence product over it on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I was most surprised with how long this lasts, you really do only use a tiny bit with each application. I got it because my eyelids and under eyes were getting dry and flaky. Have been using a few months, and this cream completely solved the problem, my skin is smooth. Also smells nice.</li>
            <li> I might like it if I could use the product for a while, but I am really sensitive to smells and couldn&#x27;t handle this one on my face.  Tried using it on the back of my hands, and it still bothered me.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and feel.  I was hoping for something a bit heavier for night time use but this works well over regular moisture cream for day use.  I just use it twice a day and it seems to work.  I love this product line and will try another one of their eye creams when I&#x27;m finished with this jar.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream, very moisturizing and good price.&lt;br /&gt;I use every morning and night. It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the second Eminence eye cream I have used and I tried it because it said it was more firming. Some of the reviews I read said that it caused irritation but I have had no problems at all. I like this Herbal Eye Contour Cream very much. It goes on easily without tugging or pulling the skin...just pat it into the skin. Like all Eminence products, it works. Basically it is just your personal preference as to which of their products you yourself prefer. I will purchase this one again because I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I love all the Eminence products. For a 58 years old women, I still get complements on my skin. Plus, the fact that all their products are Vegan, is VERY important to me. I also love the customer service.</li>
            <li> When I pay more than $20 for a tiny jar of cream, I expect it to be a grass jar and not plastic. My first impression upon opening box and looking at the cream was :cheap looking product. Do not get me wrong, I do not expect gold plated engraving but comparing to other expensive products that I use this looks very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am from Europe and hearing that this product manufactured in Hungary makes me concern of product quality.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 3 weeks ( after paying $50 for a jar there is no way I would threw it out). Can not say anything good/bad on actual product itself but I would not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> this product is the best i would never get from any where else and it really dose what it says</li>
            <li> i have tried many eye creams and sometimes they are not nourishing enough and they actually feel sticky.  This is not one of those! it is very rich and nourishing. A little bit goes a long way. Very happy with this product. I am 24 and do not have deep eye wrinkles so I can not speak about that, but I think it is great for everything else.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased Eminence from Amazon, as I always purchased it from a salon before, but the price was $30 less so I had to try it. The product I received had to have been old, though I couldn&#x27;t find an expiration date. The protective seal sort of popped off at first touch, but not like it had been opened before, like the adhesive had worn out. And the cream was HARD. I even tried to mix it a little, but it was still chunky. Kind of gross now that I think about it. I know this is not what it is supposed to be like so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> All of their products are very thick.  All of them clog my pores, my skin sweats when I wear them, and Im starting to break out with acne because of it.  I will no longer purchase this brand.  Way too much money for this negative result</li>
            <li> All time favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li> My eyes love this stuff. They are less puffy and my dark circles are much improved. The fine lines are much less now and softer looking. My nose loves this stuff to!</li>
            <li> I am 55 with very good skin and very little wrinkles and have been using moisturizing products for the past 25 years. With my aging skin though I find I need better moisturizers and one that will last from morning till night!  I&#x27;ve used several over the years, and this one I have been using since February and I really love it. I am only halfway through this jar, which is incredible, as all other products I used generally would be gone within 2 months! That&#x27;s because there is very little water content in this product, which allows it to go a long way and last a long time. I often put a drop of water on my fingers after applying this product and apply the wet finger to the under eye area to help spread the cream a little easier. It works really well and my under eye makeup applies really well after using this cream. And it stays well the entire day and night without creasing or drying! I have actually noticed i have no lines around my eyes as the day progresses into the night, whereas with my other moisturizers, that was not the case. I&#x27;m using this along with their toner and facial moisturizer and facial cleanser. Great prices here on Amazon. The salon I go to sells the same product for $42!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have used and has become the only one I buy regularly.  I have been using this eye cream for about four years and feel it has lived up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
