            <li>This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve found for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides healing and preventing breakouts, Liquimat does an excellent job of concealing.  </li>
            <li>Of all the products I use, I think Liquimat is the best.  </li>
            <li>so it just goes to show how great it is.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>When her 5 kids were teens , they also used this on their face for great acne coverage.</li>
            <li>Great deal for the price</li>
            <li>I like this product because it seems to do a good job of concealing blemishes.  </li>
            <li>This lotion works great as a blemish cover-up to use under make-up or just on its own.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, although imho overpriced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product that works fast!</li>
            <li>I have very light skin, and this was good for me out of the box.  </li>
            <li>product controls the oils on my face nicely without&lt;br /&gt;giving</li>
            <li>So really these sulfur based tinted lotions are the best thing for me to help hide and heal faster.</li>
            <li>and it is by far the best blemish medicine I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This one conceals better.  </li>
            <li>Been around many years.</li>
            <li>Glad to see company that sticks with what works.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have to use it often, but when needed, it&#x27;s excellent on facial blemishes.</li>
            <li>If you need a bit more you can use some from the inside of the cap.</li>
            <li>Has worked better on my acne than almost anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love it for night.</li>
            <li>This has been around for over 30 years and is safe and reliable.</li>
            <li>My wife asked me to order this for her, she has been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a learning curve for application, but once you figure out what works best, it only takes seconds to apply.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for healthy makeup with great cover, but this definitely was not it.</li>
            <li>Zits heal much, much faster using this product, and I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin, so I don&#x27;t add any of the color mixer that comes with it.      </li>
            <li>but I think it is a small price to pay for the fact it is the best cover-up / treatment product I have tried that is still available on the market.    </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it covers great and helps to clear blemishes at the same time.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever from teen years to current mid-sixties...</li>
            <li>shipping was quick also.</li>
            <li>It really dries up and heals any blemish very quickly.  </li>
            <li>So the lotion comes with a tint coloring that you add to match your skin tone, but the product itself is a pasty reddish pink (like the label), so no matter how much tint you add, the tone always looks off and is very obvious, drawing attention to your face--not good if you&#x27;re wanting good cover.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like sulfur, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>You just have to learn how to apply this one the right way.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>- I had previously used this product for many years and was satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works, it really does cover up a pimple and dries it quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it worked very fast.</li>
            <li>Fine condition, and so far seems to be a product with legitimate claims.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the similar product made by Glytone, but I found this one works much better.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing better that Liquimat for getting rid of acne or red spots on the face.</li>
            <li>I first learned about this product from my dermotologist.  </li>
            <li>When younger I goy a lot more zits</li>
            <li>I use Liquimat for any blemish when it first shows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have full makeup-like coverage without worrying about making the skin worse.</li>
            <li>I find that the best way to use is to loosen the cap just a few degrees from tight and then shake the bottle to get a bit of Liquimat on the rim of the container and inside of the cap.</li>
            <li>It blends very well into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Covers and drys up pimple fast</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>I use this product because I have VERY oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This  </li>
            <li>It will reduce breakouts by absorbing excess oil.</li>
            <li>Linda Sy&#x27;s product worked better than any other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It is more a battle of healing and maybe a bland diet.</li>
            <li>Downside is that it goes on kind of thick</li>
            <li>I use Liquimat full strength, and I dilute it 50/50 with Cerave lotion for my dry cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this NEW BATCH HAS A PERFUMY FRAGRANCE.  </li>
            <li>at 1-877-523-1349 to tell them of my issues with this new fragrance and suggested they make a \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; formula.  </li>
            <li>Given this new PERFUMY FRAGRANCE I will be looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li>I am now 67 years old!  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much in the way of topical lotions that help me since my acne seems to be caused mainly by hormones and my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as a cover up on bad skin and also as a weapon to reduce large pimples when they become inflammed.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want too much on or it will be obvious.  </li>
            <li>My mother is 75 years old and has used this for 35 years.</li>
            <li>I still buy it at 67 years old..</li>
            <li>A zillion years ago (when my mom was young)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 43 year old woman with hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li>No bother, no mess.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight sulfur smell, but the smell disipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>&quot; This product is worth the price, as it last for a long time.</li>
            <li>This definitely helped keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I avoid putting it near my jawline, because the color difference between my face and neck makes it too obvious</li>
            <li>I have been on Retin-A, Duac, Azalex, and Spironolactone for years, but still I have at least one huge cyst on my chin at all times, and sometimes I&#x27;ll have several.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast on your skin so it looks like you have dried cream on your face and looks anything but natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 24 year old male, very active, and have very sensitive skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using Liquimat for decades and continue using even as the price inevitably increases over the years.  Best stuff ever from teen years to current mid-sixties...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old male, very active, and have very sensitive skin. Every now and then, I get some acne I want to cover up and so my mom recommended this product to me.I use it everyday! One bottle lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve used this product almost everyday now for the past 2-3 years and will continue doing so. I don&#x27;t see it in stores so I order it online. My mom told me this stuff has been around since her college days so it just goes to show how great it is. It works well because it&#x27;s a cover up lotion and a treatment in one. Thank you Liquimat!</li>
            <li> I started looking around for acne cover/treatment products after Linda Sy stopped producing her \\&quot;Acne Cover Lotion\\&quot; product.  Linda Sy&#x27;s product worked better than any other product I have tried.  I was quite sad to see her retire and discontinue her product line.  If I had known, I would have purchased $300 worth of that product to last me for at least the next 20 years.  Anyway...  a tragedy....    I like this product because it seems to do a good job of concealing blemishes.  I also use a prescribed benzoyl perioxide-based cream at night.  Together, these two work the best for me.  I have light skin, so I don&#x27;t add any of the color mixer that comes with it.      You just have to learn how to apply this one the right way.  You don&#x27;t want too much on or it will be obvious.  I avoid putting it near my jawline, because the color difference between my face and neck makes it too obvious I&#x27;m wearing \\&quot;make up\\&quot;.    I also purchased the similar product made by Glytone, but I found this one works much better.  This one conceals better.  Maybe it&#x27;s thicker?  Don&#x27;t know, but I stopped using the Glytone product as a result.    Note:  my gf has commented that \\&quot;I smell like fireworks\\&quot;.  I wear this stuff every day, and yes... you can smell the sulfur....  but I think it is a small price to pay for the fact it is the best cover-up / treatment product I have tried that is still available on the market.    I give it two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Been around many years. Glad to see company that sticks with what works.</li>
            <li> I have used Liquimat for over 20 years. So has another household member. We don&#x27;t have to use it often, but when needed, it&#x27;s excellent on facial blemishes. One bottle is enough to last us both 10 years. It doesn&#x27;t go bad. If it starts to get too dry, a drop or two of distilled water and/or rubbing alcohol revitalizes the mixture. What may seem like a near empty bottle may last for years and years, as only the tiniest little dab is usually needed. I find that the best way to use is to loosen the cap just a few degrees from tight and then shake the bottle to get a bit of Liquimat on the rim of the container and inside of the cap. If you only need a tiny dab just use a bit of Liquipmat from the rim. If you need a bit more you can use some from the inside of the cap. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Has worked better on my acne than almost anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Downside is that it goes on kind of thick and you have to be careful not to be left with any pink residue. I love it for night. When I wake up my skin is hardly oily at all.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin, and this was good for me out of the box.  I did not add any of the included color adjuster.    The tone does run on the pink side.  I have yellow undertones, so after I put this sulfur treatment on pimples, I pat on Lemon Aid yellow undereye color adjuster to even it out.    Zits heal much, much faster using this product, and I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.  One bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better that Liquimat for getting rid of acne or red spots on the face. This has been around for over 30 years and is safe and reliable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it is by far the best blemish medicine I have ever used.  I wish I had known about this when I was sixteen and had to worry about my Saturday night dates!  This product actually (for me) causes the blemish to disappear within 3 days!  Miraculous!  I just dab it on at night and it dries almost instantly.  No bother, no mess.  Cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s but still get ocassional breakouts.  I first learned about this product from my dermotologist.  This lotion works great as a blemish cover-up to use under make-up or just on its own.  It blends very well into the skin.  It has a slight sulfur smell, but the smell disipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> My mother is 75 years old and has used this for 35 years. When her 5 kids were teens , they also used this on their face for great acne coverage. Even my brothers would have me dab it on to cover a unsightly \\&quot;zit\\&quot; This product is worth the price, as it last for a long time. A dab will do!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> - I had previously used this product for many years and was satisfied with it.  To me, it always had a slight but not objectionable sulfer smell which made sense becasue it contained sulfer.&lt;br /&gt;- However, this NEW BATCH HAS A PERFUMY FRAGRANCE.  Having this perfumy fragrance on your face next to your nose and eyes iis irritating to allergies and sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;- I contacted the manufacturer, Summer Labs at 1-877-523-1349 to tell them of my issues with this new fragrance and suggested they make a \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; formula.  Fragrance is on the ingredient list. If you are having the same problem I hope you will call and suggest the same to them (i.e. a fragrance-free\\&quot; formula)..&lt;br /&gt;- If not for this new perfumy fragrance I would have rated it at least a 4 star:  This is a good product, although imho overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;- Given this new PERFUMY FRAGRANCE I will be looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price</li>
            <li> wonderful product...I used it as a teenager and now my kids do! Its the best!! This one little bottle will last forever! Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I have used Liquimat for since in my teens.  I am now 67 years old!  It really dries up and heals any blemish very quickly.  As a teen I used it sometimes as just a base makeup.  I have tried some others over the counter, but never have any matched the effectiveness of Liquimat!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! I&#x27;ve used it for decades and my father used it before me. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 50 years and it continues to work on the occasional zit. When younger I goy a lot more zits and it worked very fast. I still buy it at 67 years old..</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was a teenager. It was what the dermatologist recommended as a drying agent/cover up. I found it again on Amazon and am using it now - 50 years later.</li>
            <li> dries out the skin and helps the inflammation due to acne; also the tint helps hide some of the acne.</li>
            <li> Horrible i looked a mess, will never ever order again. ;(</li>
            <li> Even my age I still get the occasional pimple. Covers and drys up pimple fast</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for over 20 years.  It&#x27;s great as a cover up on bad skin and also as a weapon to reduce large pimples when they become inflammed.  Being broken out is bad enough as an adult, this is a true lefesaver.</li>
            <li> A zillion years ago (when my mom was young) this was the medicine prescribed by dermatologist. It is a wonderful product that works fast!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it covers great and helps to clear blemishes at the same time. shipping was quick also.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to order this for her, she has been using it for many years. It last a long time!</li>
            <li> Fine condition, and so far seems to be a product with legitimate claims.</li>
            <li> I use Liquimat for any blemish when it first shows. It covers well and often the blemish development is stopped.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 25 years. My mom actually introduced me to it. You can no longer find it at your local drug stores. It really works well.</li>
            <li> I use this product because I have VERY oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This  product controls the oils on my face nicely without&lt;br /&gt;giving me blemishes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help my acne.  I didn&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> I started using Liquimat 35 years ago. I have found it to be reliable.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much in the way of topical lotions that help me since my acne seems to be caused mainly by hormones and my body chemistry. So really these sulfur based tinted lotions are the best thing for me to help hide and heal faster. This is the best I&#x27;ve found for that. It will reduce breakouts by absorbing excess oil. It helps, but it&#x27;s not a cure by any means. I&#x27;ve never really found anything that truly helps. It is more a battle of healing and maybe a bland diet. Anyway, I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for discovering Liquimat.  I&#x27;m a 43 year old woman with hormonal acne.  I have been on Retin-A, Duac, Azalex, and Spironolactone for years, but still I have at least one huge cyst on my chin at all times, and sometimes I&#x27;ll have several.  The cysts last for weeks and are ridiculously painful.  I have been using Liquimat for about two months, and in that time have only gotten one cyst.  I use the Liquimat on my entire face every morning after applying my prescription products.  Liquimat can be drying, so on my oily skin - chin, nose, and forehead- I use Liquimat full strength, and I dilute it 50/50 with Cerave lotion for my dry cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides healing and preventing breakouts, Liquimat does an excellent job of concealing.  There&#x27;s a learning curve for application, but once you figure out what works best, it only takes seconds to apply.  Of all the products I use, I think Liquimat is the best.  It&#x27;s great to have full makeup-like coverage without worrying about making the skin worse.</li>
            <li> So the lotion comes with a tint coloring that you add to match your skin tone, but the product itself is a pasty reddish pink (like the label), so no matter how much tint you add, the tone always looks off and is very obvious, drawing attention to your face--not good if you&#x27;re wanting good cover. It dries fast on your skin so it looks like you have dried cream on your face and looks anything but natural. I was hoping for healthy makeup with great cover, but this definitely was not it.</li>
            <li> have used for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> It works! This definitely helped keep my skin clear. It smells a bit like sulfur, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have yet to find one to compare.  It dries up any outbreak and even shrinks the pore associated with the outbreak.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, it really does cover up a pimple and dries it quickly.  It&#x27;s going to be something I have on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> Works well hiding blemishes.  Little difficult to match color to skin, but worth buying.  I would recommend this item to others.</li>
