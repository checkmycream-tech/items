    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I purchased this Hyaluronic Acid serum after a tip from Dr Oz about its magnificent properties.  </li>
            <li>This product has not given me any problems, which has impressed me.  </li>
            <li>I have been very happy with this serum.</li>
            <li>Very nice!  </li>
            <li>great products for the price</li>

            <li>FEELS GOOD</li>
            <li>Good product as described.</li>
            <li>It does feel good on my skin</li>
            <li>Good product as described.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels and looks!  </li>
            <li>I am ordering more!</li>
            <li>Looks and feels better!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>I think it’s important to calibrate your expectations and not expect a 30 dollar skin cream to take away all your wrinkles overnight, but considering what this is it has been remarkably effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bella Versache Skin Care had by far the best price for a product of this caliber</li>
            <li>Fine lines and sagging eye skin seems to be disappearing!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it helps sooth my skin even more.</li>
            <li>I am hoping as I continue to use it, the improvements will be more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look fantastic!</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>to help with the fine lines  and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m noticing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and although I think I have used every store shelf facial moisturizer ,I haven&#x27;t often come across many that make my skin feel so good.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super smooth.</li>
            <li>I had a box of this product in my fanny pack and showed it to him, he looked it over for a few minutes and nodded his head, telling me that judging from the ingredients this is a very good skin product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot express how happy I am to have finally found something that really works!</li>
            <li>But i like the general appearance of my face more and notice if I skip a day that wringles seem more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my face nice and clear.  </li>
            <li>It does spread easily and really has a significant effect on the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>The amount of Hyaluronic Acid Serum is low on the list of ingredients so basically it seems to filled with fillers &amp; water more than the serum.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>Smooth and Soft Skin will continue to use Serum</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, I think it&#x27;s really working on fine lines around my lips.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer and tighter.</li>
            <li>or so therefore I haven’t noticed any real changes in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Worth the price and not irritating on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay the full price they&#x27;re asking for</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, goes on light and sinks into skin leaving it smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing product, saw overall improvement in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Product did not irritate my sensitive skin at all nor did it cause break outs.</li>
            <li>This product actually surprised me with its gel-like consistency.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s too early to give rating.</li>
            <li>I used  the complete bottle and could not see any improvement .Product may not be for me, but may  work wonders for some one else</li>
            <li>I’ve been using it consistently as it directs and have indeed been noticing a slow but noticeable reduction in my laugh lines.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product, and will be rebuying it it in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, I have pretty sensitive and dry skin, which causes me to break out sometimes with various anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It’s affordable and made in the USA with a lot of natural ingredients; those are all big pluses in my book.</li>
            <li>At first it seems shiny, but let it dry thoroughly and your skin will appear noticeably less wrinkled.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels and looks!  Fine lines and sagging eye skin seems to be disappearing!</li>
            <li> great products for the price</li>
            <li> Amazing product, saw overall improvement in less than 2 weeks. My skin looks brighter and I swear it glows. Product did not irritate my sensitive skin at all nor did it cause break outs. I am ordering more! I cannot express how happy I am to have finally found something that really works!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all the rave reviews and because it&#x27;s made in the USA but it did nothing for my 69 year-old skin! I was especially looking to improve firmness. I used the product faithfully twice daily as directed using one pump and the product is gone in 5 weeks with no results. Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Save your money - no results</li>
            <li> Amazing.....clears your skin and evens skin tones</li>
            <li> IT SQUIRTS OUT IRREGULAR BUT OTHER THAN THAT FEELS GOOD</li>
            <li> This does not live up to the hype. The amount of Hyaluronic Acid Serum is low on the list of ingredients so basically it seems to filled with fillers &amp; water more than the serum.</li>
            <li> This product actually surprised me with its gel-like consistency. (Several serums I have used must be applied using a dropper and are watery) It does spread easily and really has a significant effect on the appearance of my skin. At first it seems shiny, but let it dry thoroughly and your skin will appear noticeably less wrinkled. I also feel that my pores seem smaller. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I have used the serum for close to a month now and have not seen any results.  I&#x27;m very disappointed!  I believed the claims the company made.  😞</li>
            <li> The face was a little tickle.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell about results, but I think I do see an improvement after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Somewhat lifting, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough....</li>
            <li> Good product as described.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin is much clearer and tighter. Brown spots I&#x27;ve tried everything on including laser treatments, are fading.</li>
            <li> I see a difference in my skin! Looks and feels better!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Hyaluronic Acid serum after a tip from Dr Oz about its magnificent properties.  Bella Versache Skin Care had by far the best price for a product of this caliber and I decided to give it a shot. I’ve been using it consistently as it directs and have indeed been noticing a slow but noticeable reduction in my laugh lines. I think it’s important to calibrate your expectations and not expect a 30 dollar skin cream to take away all your wrinkles overnight, but considering what this is it has been remarkably effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I have pretty sensitive and dry skin, which causes me to break out sometimes with various anti-aging products. This product has not given me any problems, which has impressed me.  The dermatologist I visit for my skin problems yesterday asked me what I was doing different that my skin looked healthier. I had a box of this product in my fanny pack and showed it to him, he looked it over for a few minutes and nodded his head, telling me that judging from the ingredients this is a very good skin product.  When I told him I  got it for less than 30 bucks he couldn’t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product, and will be rebuying it it in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to restores and hydrate my skin that has been damaged from years of being out in the sun. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and I&#x27;m noticing a huge difference. My skin is super smooth. I plan to keep using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> stupid vein product. never again</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way. I have only used it for a week or so therefore I haven’t noticed any real changes in the texture of my skin. I will have to update my review in a couple of weeks. It does feel good on my skin and I haven’t had any ill effects which is sometimes an issue since I have sensitive skin. It’s affordable and made in the USA with a lot of natural ingredients; those are all big pluses in my book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and although I think I have used every store shelf facial moisturizer ,I haven&#x27;t often come across many that make my skin feel so good.  I feel as if it works because I notice my skin is dewy to the touch and over all my skin seems to be smoother. This is a thick gel, so I don&#x27;t use much.  I also put it in the refrigerator on steamy days so in the morning when I do apply it- it helps sooth my skin even more.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my face nice and clear.  I am hoping it helps with age spots too.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this serum. Non-greasy, goes on light and sinks into skin leaving it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I think it&#x27;s really working on fine lines around my lips. I am hoping as I continue to use it, the improvements will be more noticeable. Worth the price and not irritating on my sensitive skin. Try it..</li>
            <li> Good product as described.</li>
            <li> great product and will keep on using it till they run out.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Fast delivery!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s ok. But it&#x27;s too early to give rating.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Makes my skin look fantastic!</li>
            <li> Smooth and Soft Skin will continue to use Serum</li>
            <li> Recommend product.  Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Did not take before picture so I have nothing to compare it to. But i like the general appearance of my face more and notice if I skip a day that wringles seem more pronounced.</li>
            <li> well its make my skin very dry...its just hard to apply makeup after it. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I do not believe the product had enough hyaluronic acid  to help with the fine lines  and wrinkles. I used  the complete bottle and could not see any improvement .Product may not be for me, but may  work wonders for some one else</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion.  No damage.  Product does not seem to make any difference after a month....  Maybe longer usage?</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I was initially skeptical!  It seems to agree well with my skin type. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Really no different from lesser priced items. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay the full price they&#x27;re asking for</li>
