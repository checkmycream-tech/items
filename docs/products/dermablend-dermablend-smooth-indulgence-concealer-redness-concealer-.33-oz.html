    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is perfect!!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found to cover spider veins and rosacea on the face.</li>
            <li>I bought MAC and it works perfectly to cover the blinding redness that surrounds my nose.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that it is a good for the skin product, it just isn&#x27;t as good as the claims</li>
            <li>A fairly good over.  </li>
            <li>about as good as the drug store type...</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a good concealer.</li>
            <li>Good concealer for redness/rosacea.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that this product provided as good of coverage as I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the quality was excellent.</li>
            <li>however I find this too oily to be effective on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>i was impressed not only with its ability to conceal blemishes and disguise redness, but it also was easy to apply and felt good on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure with the right foundation the combination would be great.</li>
            <li>Need more practice</li>
            <li>Also, that&#x27;s why you you have to be sure that you blend it well before applying the foundation.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I would like, but with the makeup on top it was ok.</li>
            <li>Not any better than the store bought &amp;#34;green concealer&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>hint-- go easy in the amount because you will look like the undead with you ghostly-gray</li>
            <li>and then I use the Quick Fix Tan Concealer, SPF 30, on top of it.</li>
            <li>If you rub it into the skin good, the red still shows, if you don&#x27;t rub it in good then you will see exactly where it was applied.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used Dermablend Smooth Indulgence Concealer before.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product and covers up the above mentioned blemishes, etc.</li>
            <li>Does stay on all day and feels smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li>I blush super easily</li>
            <li>It may be a great product if you use a matte finish foundation, which I don&#x27;t as I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It also washed off easily with my very gentle cleanser (Cerave).</li>
            <li>Dermablend was worth a try</li>
            <li>Effective, but very very very tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I like Almay concealer, natural color, better.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good but could be a little thicker to provide more cover for red skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>I do know that the Physician&#x27;s Formula concealer that I use on a daily basis holds up much better.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it if you apply it to a Q-tip; it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>I was scared at first when I saw how bright a green</li>
            <li>(I healed without makeup for 6 days first).</li>
            <li>it seems to separate between uses and comes out watery at first.</li>
            <li>I like that the green is good for eliminating redness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and it looks green on my face even with rubbing in well.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a bit more creamy in texture and not so dry.</li>
            <li>I expected so much more from Dermablend.</li>
            <li>The areas that it was applied too before foundation, were left pasty and too light.  </li>
            <li>I really works to use under your makeup.</li>
            <li>Too much used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several green concealers, and this is better than most.  </li>
            <li>The green doesn&#x27;t show up but the redness is effectively covered.</li>
            <li>I received it really quickly and used it the next day.  </li>
            <li>It hides my red roceasa very well !!</li>
            <li>I had a really hard time trying to find something that would effectively cover my redness from rosacea.</li>
            <li>and it is still covering the redness completely!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed  to do &amp; makes red areas disappear.</li>
            <li>I like it, does help a lot with the redness, took some adjusting on the blending prior to make up application, but now that I got it figured out, I really like it!</li>
            <li>Most concealers I try that are green or yellow disappear into my skin and don&#x27;t improve the redness, but this one really works.</li>
            <li>I had pulsed dye laser treatment for rosacea and this was great for covering up the purple polka-dots left behind (it looked like Harold and his purple crayon had gotten a hold of my face!).</li>
            <li>My foundation covers it completely and my face looks like I haven&#x27;t used any concealer at all.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take care of the red as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It goes on very dry and doesn&#x27;t really hide the red spots as well as I hoped it would.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It will leave your skin more grayish than green, which I found hard to cover over with foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t burn, sting, cause dryness, or ay other adverse effects.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> May work if you use a very creamy opaque foundation or have oilier skin, but definitely not good for dry skin or with a sheer or mineral powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> I only recommend this product if you have small areas of red such as blemishes and use a matte finish foundation for oily skin.</li>
            <li> , this concealer is unique in its category because it belongs to a line which specializes in concealing flawed skin (Dermablend).</li>
            <li> Wait a couple of minutes for it to dry and then apply foundation over your face.</li>
            <li> I should have looked at reviews and I would not recomend it for  peoople who have dry skin like me</li>
            <li> The only downside is it only lasts a few hours if used alone</li>
            <li> and I need half the product to get double the coverage.</li>
            <li> and I was still blotchy red with green undertones.  </li>
            <li> Green concealers are meant to be used for redness, red spots, blemishes, acne, you name it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Green as expected, but looks and feels too dry.  </li>
            <li> stays green a long time on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a pasty white and can actually be a tad worse then the redness I was trying to cover up.  </li>
            <li> I used a little bit of this after having some laser treatment of skin cancers that left my skin very raw and unattractive.</li>
            <li> Physicians Formula green concealer is like half the price</li>
            <li> and I was green/gray in color, too little</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> provides little coverage</li>
            <li> and I even add a little to liquid makeup to balance out the redness.</li>
            <li> It could be a little thicker in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I put the Dermablend green concealer on once today at about 9am......</li>
            <li> This is a green concealer.</li>
            <li> That is because the color green neutralizes the redness in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember it is green</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t want to have green spots all over your face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this green colored concealer to help cover blemishes or rosacea-type redness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A bit wasted....</li>
            <li> a little is all you need!</li>
            <li> I like it, but do not love it.  </li>
            <li> ...at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Just simply not good.  </li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> Too expensive to give away.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Was kinda disappointed with the coverage.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a period of time and hate throwing things away.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this product. The slightest touch after application wipes it off like it was never applied. I expected so much more from Dermablend. I worked in retail where Dermablend was sold and it was practically waterproof. Not sure why this product doesn&#x27;t live up to the same standards. I do know that the Physician&#x27;s Formula concealer that I use on a daily basis holds up much better. Dermablend was worth a try but I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help mask the redness that was a result of a chemical peel.  It may be a great product if you use a matte finish foundation, which I don&#x27;t as I have dry skin.  It goes on very dry and doesn&#x27;t really hide the red spots as well as I hoped it would.  I have no doubt that it is a good for the skin product, it just isn&#x27;t as good as the claims it makes.&lt;br /&gt;It will leave your skin more grayish than green, which I found hard to cover over with foundation.  The areas that it was applied too before foundation, were left pasty and too light.  If you rub it into the skin good, the red still shows, if you don&#x27;t rub it in good then you will see exactly where it was applied.  I was hoping for something a bit more creamy in texture and not so dry. I only recommend this product if you have small areas of red such as blemishes and use a matte finish foundation for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go out without my redness concealer!  I really works to use under your makeup. Would recommend to anyone that has problems.</li>
            <li> Green as expected, but looks and feels too dry.  May work if you use a very creamy opaque foundation or have oilier skin, but definitely not good for dry skin or with a sheer or mineral powder foundation.  Too much used and I was green/gray in color, too little and I was still blotchy red with green undertones.  Not good!</li>
            <li> A fairly good over.  I wish the tube was bigger!</li>
            <li> A great base for a person that has Rosacea and then I use the Quick Fix Tan Concealer, SPF 30, on top of it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend as well as powder</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a period of time and hate throwing things away.  I like that the green is good for eliminating redness etc however I find this too oily to be effective on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect!!!  I blush super easily and my cheeks can stay flushed.  I was using a green based powder, but I had to use SOOOO much of it throughout the day.  I put the Dermablend green concealer on once today at about 9am......It&#x27;s the end of the day and it is still covering the redness completely!</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations.  The price was right and the quality was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> stays green a long time on my skin.  would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It hides my red roceasa very well !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several green concealers, and this is better than most.  Helpful hint-- go easy in the amount because you will look like the undead with you ghostly-gray hue-- a little is all you need!</li>
            <li> I like it, but do not love it.  It is a pasty white and can actually be a tad worse then the redness I was trying to cover up.  I&#x27;m on the fence about this product.  A little pricey as well I think.</li>
            <li> Trying to get use to using.  Need more practice</li>
            <li> definitely adhered to advertisement</li>
            <li> This is a green concealer. Green concealers are meant to be used for redness, red spots, blemishes, acne, you name it. That is because the color green neutralizes the redness in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this concealer is unique in its category because it belongs to a line which specializes in concealing flawed skin (Dermablend). I use it before applying foundation. Some concealers can be used before or after, but with this concealer I do not believe that is possible. Remember it is green so you don&#x27;t want to have green spots all over your face. Also, that&#x27;s why you you have to be sure that you blend it well before applying the foundation. Wait a couple of minutes for it to dry and then apply foundation over your face.</li>

I received it really quickly and used it the next day.  It is a great product and covers up the above mentioned blemishes, etc. that a regular concealer doesn&#x27;t cover.  My foundation covers it completely and my face looks like I haven&#x27;t used any concealer at all.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Effective, but very very very tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed  to do &amp; makes red areas disappear. Voila!!</li>
            <li> Was kinda disappointed with the coverage. Maybe, I was expecting miracles.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I would like, but with the makeup on top it was ok. Does stay on all day and feels smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li> about as good as the drug store type...</li>
            <li> It does not cover red as it states in the product description. I would not buy it again  provides little coverage</li>
            <li> Excellent product! SUPER FAST DELIVERY! THANKS!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all.  I bought it to cover some redness left from my radiesse injection site.  Can&#x27;t even tell that you put it on.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found to cover spider veins and rosacea on the face. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it if you apply it to a Q-tip; it doesn&#x27;t take much. It is applied before any type of foundation.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take care of the red as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This product caused my face to break out.  I would like a refund. Kduncan@columbus.rr.com</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but could be a little thicker to provide more cover for red skin conditions.  Price of $19 was too high for such a small size product.</li>
            <li> I like it, does help a lot with the redness, took some adjusting on the blending prior to make up application, but now that I got it figured out, I really like it!</li>

            <li> Not as good as I expected. Could not blend well. A bit wasted....sigh. Too expensive to give away. Will try again.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time trying to find something that would effectively cover my redness from rosacea. I was scared at first when I saw how bright a green it was but it immediately lightened the redness on my skin. The only downside is it only lasts a few hours if used alone but I&#x27;m sure with the right foundation the combination would be great.</li>
            <li> Not any better than the store bought &amp;#34;green concealer&amp;#34; sticks. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Good concealer for redness/rosacea. A little goes a long way. Most concealers I try that are green or yellow disappear into my skin and don&#x27;t improve the redness, but this one really works. The green doesn&#x27;t show up but the redness is effectively covered. Not heavy or greasy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that this product provided as good of coverage as I was expecting for the price. Physicians Formula green concealer is like half the price and I need half the product to get double the coverage.</li>
            <li> I used a little bit of this after having some laser treatment of skin cancers that left my skin very raw and unattractive. (I healed without makeup for 6 days first). i was impressed not only with its ability to conceal blemishes and disguise redness, but it also was easy to apply and felt good on my skin. I have very sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t burn, sting, cause dryness, or ay other adverse effects.  It also washed off easily with my very gentle cleanser (Cerave). Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I use this to even out redness around my chin and nose. it works well and I even add a little to liquid makeup to balance out the redness. It could be a little thicker in my opinion. it seems to separate between uses and comes out watery at first.</li>
            <li> ...at least for me.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and it looks green on my face even with rubbing in well.  I like Almay concealer, natural color, better.</li>
            <li> Just simply not good.  I should have looked at reviews and I would not recomend it for  peoople who have dry skin like me it turns cakey.</li>
