            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect sunscreen, but this one works fine til we run out.</li>
            <li>It was a bright sunny day but for some reason I did not use it on my face (thank God) or on my legs.  </li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
            <li>Ingredients Great, but I will not buy again because of strong scent.</li>
            <li>; I can&#x27;t stand the feel on my own hands after applying it to my twins.  </li>
            <li>nice to use, no irritation on skin.</li>
            <li>Nice, huh?</li>
            <li>There are much better option for your precious children!</li>
            <li>this is the best sunblock so far amongst the ones that I used....</li>
            <li>Of course I have to keep my 16 month old&#x27;s skin protected and this stuff is perfect!!  </li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>my daughter who is 6 has extremely sensitive skin and is very fair.</li>
            <li>Nearly all sunblocks sting my skin, and I am fanatical about UVA/ UVB protection as I am very fair.  </li>
            <li>Sure -</li>
            <li>I wonder if it dries out their skin even more</li>
            <li>and it seemed to be okay at the time.   </li>
            <li>SPF which I felt would give me more protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>I also make sure he always wears a hat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on the hunt for more as I haven&#x27;t found it at a brick and mortar store.      </li>
            <li>I am a dermatologist, and this is my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>You should be able to get three years&#x27; use out of it.</li>
            <li>Most anything will make my skin feel like it is on fire.  </li>
            <li>For us, the Aveeno was the better product.</li>
            <li>Tried a patch test and it seemed OK.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>Granted, we were out very limited time and did our best to shelter</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my daughter since she was 3 months old (now 15 months) and it has always worked great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply (not very tick as many others) and no rash, very good sunprotection.</li>
            <li>I do wish that it was easy online to see the sunscreen ingredients.</li>
            <li>However, that was easily removed when I showered.  </li>
            <li>This applies easily although I did seem to have a light film on my skin.  </li>
            <li>We normally use California Baby, which causes a light breakout but so far has been the best of the brands we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Until I found this...it is the only sunscreen I can use (without spending a fortune at the dermatologist) and it also gives great protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying some Coppertone 30 SPF specifically for faces (also fragrance free).  </li>
            <li>I wrote a review just before this praising Neutrogena Light Night Cream as a moisturizer and said that I use it during the day because it has NO sunscreen in it, then I gave the reasons why I sometimes don&#x27;t want to have sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sum it up by saying that this would have received five stars if it were purely free for babies, otherwise, find another sunblock.</li>
            <li>I goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t stay greasey.  </li>
            <li>so the trick is too smooth it out evenly on your face or else</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I only wish it was available in more than 3 oz size since I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need it more when we are in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>i used this product all weekend long while at the beach and playing sports, it seemed to work great.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of a Pure &amp; Free sunscreen for my daughters, as this one claims to be.</li>
            <li>and i wish it smelled a little better, but is works great fus us.</li>
            <li>In its favor, I will say that I experienced absolutely no stinging or irritation with this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I like Neutrogena and thought a higher-end baby specific line would be good for my sons face.  </li>
            <li>For our 4 year old daughter, who has sensitive skin and eczema, this has been great.</li>
            <li>He has mild eczema</li>
            <li>It helps to take a quick shower/wash face before applying all sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have read the reviews first here!   </li>
            <li>This is what I use when I DO want sunscreen on, Neutrogena pure &amp; free baby.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it stays very well over 6 hours in full sun at the beach, (first sun exposure for the year) and experienced NO SUNBURN, minimal tanning after a week&#x27;s vacation at the beach.    </li>
            <li>When I ordered 2 items vendor sent me 1 by mistake and when contacted he took care of it right away....</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is Alumina (first inactive ingredient) and alumina has been linked to cancer, developmental issues, and environmental toxicity.</li>
            <li>I am glad to read another reviewer&#x27;s kids had a similar reaction.  </li>
            <li>After more than two hours it still leaves my face white and chalky looking.</li>
            <li>PS - many ppl do not apply sunscreen properly.  </li>
            <li>Also, the Aveeno provided much much better moisturization, which actually improved my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>Please do your research, read ingredients, and be careful on what kind of sunscreen you are slathering on your babies.</li>
            <li>60 SPF is a bit better, the product is hypoallergenic and my skin has definitely improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li>That night I went to bed and by the next morning woke up with itchy arms and a bright red raised rash!   </li>
            <li>Amazon should sell this popular product directly instead of a third party vendor.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to get away from ALL chemicals in any sunscreen you buy, however, baby sunscreens are made with much fewer harmful chemicals and there is NO reason Adults can&#x27;t use them with the same effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>he can use pretty much everything but Neutrogena baby sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Odors, especially sweet scents attract flying insects and are not appropriate for any sunscreen or block, let alone shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well for us when my son was a baby (post 6 months) to now (18 months).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had success with Aveeno Baby \\&quot;Natural</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has absolutely zero irritation on my skin.     </li>
            <li>I am a real whitey too, so that says a lot about the quality of this sunscreen.    </li>
            <li>The Aveeno spread easier since it was creamier, so my son did not resist sunscreen application as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all greasy and really works well.</li>
            <li>It definitely beats the spray I originally bought that just made him smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li>However, I used it for the first time today on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>so I was particularly concerned with what I put on him.  </li>
            <li>Government-funded studies have found that this particular type of vitamin A may increase risk of skin cancer when used on sun-exposed skin.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product a little over a year ago after I discovered that Aveeno continuous protection sunscreens worked better for us.</li>
            <li>Human skin toxicant - strong evidence  Known human immune system toxicant       Source:</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be more careful selecting my sunscreen in the future and have done away with all Nuetrogena products</li>
            <li>My skin has become very, VERY sensitive to any chemicals since I turned 30.  </li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(The first part of this review is the same that I wrote for BabyGanics 50 SPF sunscreen because the info applies to both.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall pretty sketched out by this experience.</li>
            <li>My boy doesn&#x27;t have any allergy nor sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In fact I have a bottle of Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunblock lotion, SPF 30 which I have been using for over a year with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I wish I never saw this product.  </li>
            <li>AS for the reviews about rashes-I was really surprised to hear that since my son does have eczema.  </li>
            <li>Within 30 minutes of putting this on my sensitive skinned 3-year-old he was covered in a rash.  </li>
            <li>Strange but true, parents, but the only sunscreen that works for my sensitive skinned kid is Banana Boat Kids.  </li>
            <li>product is fragrance-free with a natural odor that is not offensive.</li>
            <li>I took this to the tropics (USVI) and my husband, who does not have sensitive skin, used it too.  </li>
            <li>I only reapplied on the tip of my nose once per day and never got any sign of too much sun.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended for people with sensitive skin, which I have.  </li>
            <li>When I was out in the sun it caused burning and I broke out in a rash which was very itchy and lasted several days.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since my kid was 8 months old,</li>
            <li>(she is now 2 yrs old), I had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>(I have extremely sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>His arms were OK, but his face and neck broke out into lots of tiny bumps--not a red rash but like all his pores blocked, his skin looked bumpy and rough.  </li>
            <li>I tried this sunscreen (as an adult) while visiting my mom, who bought it for me</li>
            <li>she knows I prefer natural products, and I guess bc</li>
            <li>I called Neutrogena&#x27;s medical department to report my allergic reactions to this product (which required emergent oral and topical steroids), but they gave me very defensive responses and said that they &amp;#34;test their product for allergies.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry, but Methylisothiazolinone is not an uncommon allergy.</li>
            <li>product is more of a thick cream than a lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is about as chemical free as you can get (only active ingredients are Titanium oxide &amp; zinc oxide).</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m an adult, if it wasn&#x27;t apparent).  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was supposed to be mild enough for an infant and because I have had allergic reactions to other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Definitely didn&#x27;t live up to its name.    </li>
            <li>I dont see this product in any major stores...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been googling it and apparently many others have had this reaction, so it&#x27;s pretty shocking since I assumed Neutrogena was always the safest, but now I wouldn&#x27;t trust any of their stuff without more research.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product to prevent melasma and for general protection of the face.  </li>
            <li>Within minutes of applying my 6 year old son was covered in a pin rash on his back.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say that I have used this product daily this summer on my two year old with no problems.</li>
            <li>I already didn&#x27;t like it because it goes on thick like a shoe polish and leaves a white-purple residue, but I was willing to deal with that, the rash not so much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the second leading cause of dermatitis after Nickel metal (not sure if that&#x27;s true 100%).</li>
            <li>First of all, the price is a little prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>I am so sensitive, that I have found only one other sunscreen that has a high spf that does not irritate my facial skin--and that one costs $42 per ounce.</li>
            <li>it is tough to rub in, my friends called my edward cullen, but once rubbed in, it worked fine.</li>
            <li>We are currently using the new Johnson &amp; Johnson product (supposedly a daily-use lotion that is SPF 40; it doesn&#x27;t feel so drying), and so far they are only breaking out a little bit.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to get away from ALL chemicals in any sunscreen you buy, however, baby sunscreens are made with much fewer harmful chemicals and there is NO reason Adults can&#x27;t use them with the same effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> he can use pretty much everything but Neutrogena baby sunblock.  </li>
            <li> Odors, especially sweet scents attract flying insects and are not appropriate for any sunscreen or block, let alone shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for us when my son was a baby (post 6 months) to now (18 months).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had success with Aveeno Baby \\&quot;Natural</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has absolutely zero irritation on my skin.     </li>
            <li> I am a real whitey too, so that says a lot about the quality of this sunscreen.    </li>
            <li> The Aveeno spread easier since it was creamier, so my son did not resist sunscreen application as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy and really works well.</li>
            <li> It definitely beats the spray I originally bought that just made him smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> However, I used it for the first time today on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> so I was particularly concerned with what I put on him.  </li>
            <li> Government-funded studies have found that this particular type of vitamin A may increase risk of skin cancer when used on sun-exposed skin.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product a little over a year ago after I discovered that Aveeno continuous protection sunscreens worked better for us.</li>
            <li> Human skin toxicant - strong evidence  Known human immune system toxicant       Source:</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be more careful selecting my sunscreen in the future and have done away with all Nuetrogena products</li>
            <li> My skin has become very, VERY sensitive to any chemicals since I turned 30.  </li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (The first part of this review is the same that I wrote for BabyGanics 50 SPF sunscreen because the info applies to both.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall pretty sketched out by this experience.</li>
            <li> My boy doesn&#x27;t have any allergy nor sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In fact I have a bottle of Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunblock lotion, SPF 30 which I have been using for over a year with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I wish I never saw this product.  </li>
            <li> AS for the reviews about rashes-I was really surprised to hear that since my son does have eczema.  </li>
            <li> Within 30 minutes of putting this on my sensitive skinned 3-year-old he was covered in a rash.  </li>
            <li> Strange but true, parents, but the only sunscreen that works for my sensitive skinned kid is Banana Boat Kids.  </li>
            <li> product is fragrance-free with a natural odor that is not offensive.</li>
            <li> I took this to the tropics (USVI) and my husband, who does not have sensitive skin, used it too.  </li>
            <li> I only reapplied on the tip of my nose once per day and never got any sign of too much sun.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended for people with sensitive skin, which I have.  </li>
            <li> When I was out in the sun it caused burning and I broke out in a rash which was very itchy and lasted several days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since my kid was 8 months old,</li>
            <li> (she is now 2 yrs old), I had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> (I have extremely sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> His arms were OK, but his face and neck broke out into lots of tiny bumps--not a red rash but like all his pores blocked, his skin looked bumpy and rough.  </li>
            <li> I tried this sunscreen (as an adult) while visiting my mom, who bought it for me</li>
            <li> she knows I prefer natural products, and I guess bc</li>
            <li> I called Neutrogena&#x27;s medical department to report my allergic reactions to this product (which required emergent oral and topical steroids), but they gave me very defensive responses and said that they &amp;#34;test their product for allergies.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry, but Methylisothiazolinone is not an uncommon allergy.</li>
            <li> product is more of a thick cream than a lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is about as chemical free as you can get (only active ingredients are Titanium oxide &amp; zinc oxide).</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m an adult, if it wasn&#x27;t apparent).  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was supposed to be mild enough for an infant and because I have had allergic reactions to other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t live up to its name.    </li>
            <li> I dont see this product in any major stores...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been googling it and apparently many others have had this reaction, so it&#x27;s pretty shocking since I assumed Neutrogena was always the safest, but now I wouldn&#x27;t trust any of their stuff without more research.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to prevent melasma and for general protection of the face.  </li>
            <li> Within minutes of applying my 6 year old son was covered in a pin rash on his back.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that I have used this product daily this summer on my two year old with no problems.</li>
            <li> I already didn&#x27;t like it because it goes on thick like a shoe polish and leaves a white-purple residue, but I was willing to deal with that, the rash not so much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the second leading cause of dermatitis after Nickel metal (not sure if that&#x27;s true 100%).</li>
            <li> First of all, the price is a little prohibitive.  </li>
            <li> I am so sensitive, that I have found only one other sunscreen that has a high spf that does not irritate my facial skin--and that one costs $42 per ounce.</li>
            <li> it is tough to rub in, my friends called my edward cullen, but once rubbed in, it worked fine.</li>
            <li> We are currently using the new Johnson &amp; Johnson product (supposedly a daily-use lotion that is SPF 40; it doesn&#x27;t feel so drying), and so far they are only breaking out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SPF 60, there is no difference in effectiveness when used on Adult skin compared to baby skin, and the active ingredients are Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide.  </li>
            <li> In theory, if you are actually using on a baby, I guess the smaller surface area and delicate skin would balance it out, but for an adult using it every day, sometimes multiple times a day, it made me think twice.  </li>
            <li> To me, that means it&#x27;s not pure enough for baby.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard from other moms that it&#x27;s the same for their rash-prone kids.  </li>
            <li> The only other sunscreen that works as well as this one is the 30 dollar skinceuticals version.  </li>
            <li> The finish isn&#x27;t too dry or shiny and I can use this all over my face without irritation.</li>
            <li> I just got this less than month ago and have been personally using it for my skin.</li>
            <li> These are the least offensive as far as allergic reactions to sunscreen go.    </li>
            <li> For the fact that the Neutrogena was harder to spread and rub in, I&#x27;ve changed my rating of the Neutrogena product from 5 stars to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my face, but thank goodness there hasn&#x27;t been the same reaction there, just a few clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Finally, the zinc and titanium content will turn even the fairest complexion a lighter shade of pale, so unless your baby is Caucasian or you are auditioning for a sequel to Twilight, I would not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I did try several organic brands which fared no better (one even cost me over $20).</li>
            <li> I am now suspecting my rosacea flare ups are due to this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small raised red bumps all over his body.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what you want to be rubbing on your baby or having in our water supply.</li>
            <li> Zinc is a proven healing agent and this &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; formula doesn&#x27;t have all the toxic chemicals in it that other &amp;#34;non-baby&amp;#34; sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve posted on other sunscreen products - I grew up at the beach in FL</li>
            <li> About 4 hours later, I noticed that she had broken out in a rash only on her face and arms, where the sunscreen was applied.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this sunblock since it has active ingredients that doctor recommended.  </li>
            <li> If you want that dark brown tan, this is not the product for you.  </li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t bother with sun screen when I walk after dark).</li>
            <li> This is the only product we use in common.</li>
            <li> It was even the common allergen of the year recently</li>
            <li> I am appalled that this company puts out such a product so full of chemicals for babies.  </li>
            <li> She also came down with a headache.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down, Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Please use ingredients safer for children, a formula easier to apply, and less toxic to the environment (sunscreen gets washed off and enters water supply).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not extraordinarily vain, but I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m wearing zombie make-up when I go out for a walk in the sunshine</li>
            <li> I have asthma that is triggered by scented products and the smell of typical sunscreens</li>
            <li> It seems to allow a little tanning to occur, and doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li> I learned a few years ago, when I was 17, that I was allegic to chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Apply, then wait a few minutes before heading out into the sun.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few seconds longer to rub it in well.</li>
            <li> We ended up tossing it out after a few weeks and switching to another brand.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m usually out walking for less than an hour it will have to do.  </li>
            <li> I am already pale (hence the need for sun screen) and this turns my skin a pasty white-bordering-on-lavender color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disturbing that a company is claiming to have a  \\&quot;Pure &amp; Free\\&quot; product when it is anything but that.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this product for my face because i have sensitive eyes and other sunscreens make them burn badly</li>
            <li> Well I guess I will stand in line behind all of the other horror stories of rashes.</li>
            <li> He has been out for a couple of hours at a time at the pool or playing in the yard and did not get burned (and he is very pale).</li>
            <li> Also that stuff other reviewers are saying about retinyl palmitate is pretty horrible too...</li>
            <li> It just feels like it sucks the moisture out of my skin</li>
            <li> Methylisothiazolinone is a relatively common allergen, so test this before using it all over your body.</li>
            <li> it is thick and takes some time to apply.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this if you have sensitive skin or plan lots of activity in the sun - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.    </li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> but this one gave me a harsh rash all over my arms and chest where I used it!!!</li>
            <li> But within 3 hours he broke out in a severe rash on his cheeks and forehead, poor thing.</li>
            <li> neither one of us have broken out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> Within an hour of applying this stuff, my 2 year old broke out in a nasty rash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d break out in a terrible rash and my face would swell, so I avoided the sun as much as possible.</li>
            <li> What a frustrating dissapointment!</li>
            <li> It is also borderline difficult to wash off (it says on the package</li>
            <li> It worked superbly - no burns at all, even with profuse sweating and lots of water activities.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I now use this product for myself as well as my baby.    </li>
            <li> He said a min. of 50 SPF is what&#x27;s required to prevent damaging your skin from casual sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I realized that sunblocks are chemical but there are others in the market that do not give this bad result e.g. Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> Too bad scentless hair care products are so costly.</li>
            <li> BHT is very bad for you    </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> will cause an ashtma issue not to mention a terrible headache.  </li>
            <li> and it got a horrible rating..mostly because it contains Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), a toxic cancer causing chemical.  </li>
            <li> This product is the worst sunblock ever.  </li>
            <li> Both of my kids have olive complexion and while using this product as directed got the worst  sunburn ever.  </li>
            <li> this newest product is the worst ever.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazon should sell this popular product directly instead of a third party vendor. However, that does not stop me from buying it coz this is the best sunblock so far amongst the ones that I used....ZincOxide is all that matter and this is the Sunblock that has it. When I ordered 2 items vendor sent me 1 by mistake and when contacted he took care of it right away....customer service is good.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep ordering coz I dont see this product in any major stores...</li>
            <li> i purchased this product for my face because i have sensitive eyes and other sunscreens make them burn badly (i&#x27;m an adult, if it wasn&#x27;t apparent).  i used this product all weekend long while at the beach and playing sports, it seemed to work great.  it is tough to rub in, my friends called my edward cullen, but once rubbed in, it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I learned a few years ago, when I was 17, that I was allegic to chemical sunscreen. I&#x27;d break out in a terrible rash and my face would swell, so I avoided the sun as much as possible. Until I found this...it is the only sunscreen I can use (without spending a fortune at the dermatologist) and it also gives great protection.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the big hub-bub about people?    This product is about as chemical free as you can get (only active ingredients are Titanium oxide &amp; zinc oxide). These are the least offensive as far as allergic reactions to sunscreen go.    Sure - it is thick and takes some time to apply. So what. Do you want fries and a burger or protection against malignant melanoma?    Yes, it does leave a &#x27;whitish&#x27; tone to the applied skin.  Again -- so what? Are you competing in a Miss America contest or going to be out in the sun all day?    I&#x27;ve found it stays very well over 6 hours in full sun at the beach, (first sun exposure for the year) and experienced NO SUNBURN, minimal tanning after a week&#x27;s vacation at the beach.    If you want that dark brown tan, this is not the product for you.  If you want maximum sun protection for you or your children, this is it!</li>
            <li> Well I guess I will stand in line behind all of the other horror stories of rashes. I wish I would have read the reviews first here!   Within minutes of applying my 6 year old son was covered in a pin rash on his back. The rash continued to develop overnight to cover his face, ears, back, and chest. Everywhere that I applied the sunscreen and no rash anywhere that I did not apply such as his legs. What a frustrating dissapointment! I have contacted Neutrogena with my complain    I would suggest visiting the EWG 2010 Sunscreen Reviews for Toxicity ~ This one rates a 7 on the list to avoid    [...]    There are much better option for your precious children!</li>
            <li> For our 4 year old daughter, who has sensitive skin and eczema, this has been great. I went through 6-7 different brands prior to this one and was informed by the pediatric dermatologist to not use chemical sunblocks.  He suggested a sunblock with titanium dioxide.  She used to flare on contact but has not since with this one. She used it daily prior to going to camp and swimming all summer.  I did try several organic brands which fared no better (one even cost me over $20).</li>
            <li> I just got this less than month ago and have been personally using it for my skin. I have rosacea, so I thought I was breaking out from sun exposure. However, I used it for the first time today on my 2 year old. About 4 hours later, I noticed that she had broken out in a rash only on her face and arms, where the sunscreen was applied. She also came down with a headache. I am now suspecting my rosacea flare ups are due to this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be more careful selecting my sunscreen in the future and have done away with all Nuetrogena products--I guess they are just not for us.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this sunblock since it has active ingredients that doctor recommended.  But it gave my boy rash on his face every time we use it.  His cheek got so red that parents in the park had to ask.  To me, that means it&#x27;s not pure enough for baby.  I realized that sunblocks are chemical but there are others in the market that do not give this bad result e.g. Aveeno.  My boy doesn&#x27;t have any allergy nor sensitive skin he can use pretty much everything but Neutrogena baby sunblock.  This is all about 1 star.  Those who like it just keep using but don&#x27;t assume that it&#x27;s the best for all alright.</li>
            <li> Both my two-year olds have eczema and they both broke out severely after use of the Neutrogena Baby Sunblock.  I wonder if it dries out their skin even more (eczema is skin prone to severe drying).  It just feels like it sucks the moisture out of my skin; I can&#x27;t stand the feel on my own hands after applying it to my twins.  Their skin also broke out with the Aveeno Baby product, although not as severely.  We are currently using the new Johnson &amp; Johnson product (supposedly a daily-use lotion that is SPF 40; it doesn&#x27;t feel so drying), and so far they are only breaking out a little bit.  I think I will try the California Baby product next, if needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was supposed to be mild enough for an infant and because I have had allergic reactions to other sunscreens.  I put it on my arms when I sat out in the sun at my Aunt&#x27;s Memorial Day barbecue and it seemed to be okay at the time.   It was a bright sunny day but for some reason I did not use it on my face (thank God) or on my legs.  That night I went to bed and by the next morning woke up with itchy arms and a bright red raised rash!   I am appalled that this company puts out such a product so full of chemicals for babies.  I have used Neutrogena products before with no problem.  In fact I have a bottle of Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunblock lotion, SPF 30 which I have been using for over a year with no problem.  I bought the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; product because they advertize 60+ SPF which I felt would give me more protection from the sun.  Wow, I wish I never saw this product.  Parents be warned, I am still suffering today 24 hours later with the raised rash on my arms.  If I could give it zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for us when my son was a baby (post 6 months) to now (18 months).  When we went to the  pediatrician for my son&#x27;s 18 month appointment, the pediatrician actually complimented me on my use of sunscreen. (perhaps a lot of kids had been coming in with sunburn?)  My son still hasn&#x27;t had any sunburn and we are outside daily.  I also make sure he always wears a hat. He has mild eczema so I was particularly concerned with what I put on him.  I&#x27;m now on the hunt for more as I haven&#x27;t found it at a brick and mortar store.      If kids are getting sunburnt, I wonder if it had been applied every 2 hours and after going in the water?  That&#x27;s what my dermatologist suggested. AS for the reviews about rashes-I was really surprised to hear that since my son does have eczema.  I do wish that it was easy online to see the sunscreen ingredients.</li>
            <li> Within an hour of applying this stuff, my 2 year old broke out in a nasty rash.  Small raised red bumps all over his body.  It took about 3 days to go away.  I&#x27;ve had success with Aveeno Baby \\&quot;Natural protection\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Within 30 minutes of putting this on my sensitive skinned 3-year-old he was covered in a rash.  Definitely didn&#x27;t live up to its name.    Strange but true, parents, but the only sunscreen that works for my sensitive skinned kid is Banana Boat Kids.  I&#x27;ve heard from other moms that it&#x27;s the same for their rash-prone kids.  Hope this helps someone find a solution!</li>
            <li> I tried using this on my two boys (both under 5) and they could not tolerate the lengthy rubbing-in process necessary for application of this sunblock. I also found it to be a bit greasy. The first ingredient is Alumina (first inactive ingredient) and alumina has been linked to cancer, developmental issues, and environmental toxicity. Not exactly what you want to be rubbing on your baby or having in our water supply. Thumbs down, Neutrogena. Please use ingredients safer for children, a formula easier to apply, and less toxic to the environment (sunscreen gets washed off and enters water supply). Ugh.</li>
            <li> I am glad to read another reviewer&#x27;s kids had a similar reaction.  I bought this because I like Neutrogena and thought a higher-end baby specific line would be good for my sons face.  But within 3 hours he broke out in a severe rash on his cheeks and forehead, poor thing.</li>
            <li> I am a dermatologist, and this is my favorite sunscreen.  I have lupus and my husband is very fair, and this is the sunscreen we both use.  I use it on my baby as well.  It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and there is essentially nothing allergenic in this sunscreen.  Zinc Oxide and Titanium dioxide are inert minerals and don&#x27;t cause rash.  The only other sunscreen that works as well as this one is the 30 dollar skinceuticals version.  I recommend it to all my patients.  It&#x27;s great.  I love it!</li>
            <li> (The first part of this review is the same that I wrote for BabyGanics 50 SPF sunscreen because the info applies to both.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is more of a thick cream than a lotion. It does not absorb into my skin. I am already pale (hence the need for sun screen) and this turns my skin a pasty white-bordering-on-lavender color. I&#x27;m not extraordinarily vain, but I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m wearing zombie make-up when I go out for a walk in the sunshine (and I don&#x27;t bother with sun screen when I walk after dark). After more than two hours it still leaves my face white and chalky looking. It is also borderline difficult to wash off (it says on the package it&#x27;s waterproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is fragrance-free with a natural odor that is not offensive. The cream doesn&#x27;t seem to have a detrimental effect on my skin, nevertheless I will not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying some Coppertone 30 SPF specifically for faces (also fragrance free).  It seems to allow a little tanning to occur, and doesn&#x27;t stink.  Since I&#x27;m usually out walking for less than an hour it will have to do.  In the summer, in my BACKYARD garden (where no one can see me), when I&#x27;ll be outside for longer periods of time, maybe I can use up the 60 SPF stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, you don&#x27;t get to check the expiration date on the tubes Amazon sends you.  This one I got expires next Dec, so I only get one year to use it.  You should be able to get three years&#x27; use out of it.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my 2 children and myself during the weekend. We are all having a a rush on our face and neck. This is the only product we use in common. No doubt about it: We&#x27;ll never use it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my daughter since she was 3 months old (now 15 months) and it has always worked great.  Never had a rash and never got burned.  It is very thick and i wish it smelled a little better, but is works great fus us.</li>
            <li> I purchased it in 2014 and they had given me an expired 2012 product.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review just before this praising Neutrogena Light Night Cream as a moisturizer and said that I use it during the day because it has NO sunscreen in it, then I gave the reasons why I sometimes don&#x27;t want to have sunscreen on my face.  This is what I use when I DO want sunscreen on, Neutrogena pure &amp; free baby.  It&#x27;s SPF 60, there is no difference in effectiveness when used on Adult skin compared to baby skin, and the active ingredients are Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide.  Zinc is a proven healing agent and this &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; formula doesn&#x27;t have all the toxic chemicals in it that other &amp;#34;non-baby&amp;#34; sunscreens do.  I should know, I&#x27;ve had Melanoma and have researched sunscreens until all hours of the night.  You won&#x27;t be able to get away from ALL chemicals in any sunscreen you buy, however, baby sunscreens are made with much fewer harmful chemicals and there is NO reason Adults can&#x27;t use them with the same effectiveness.  It&#x27;s the SPF that matters.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve posted on other sunscreen products - I grew up at the beach in FL so I know about tanning/burning.  My skin has become very, VERY sensitive to any chemicals since I turned 30.  Most anything will make my skin feel like it is on fire.  This sunscreen has absolutely zero irritation on my skin.     I took this to the tropics (USVI) and my husband, who does not have sensitive skin, used it too.  It worked superbly - no burns at all, even with profuse sweating and lots of water activities.  I only reapplied on the tip of my nose once per day and never got any sign of too much sun.  I am a real whitey too, so that says a lot about the quality of this sunscreen.    I have quite an arsenal of products from the dept. store cosmetic counters but this sunscreen is the best.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this if you have sensitive skin or plan lots of activity in the sun - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.    PS - many ppl do not apply sunscreen properly.  It helps to take a quick shower/wash face before applying all sunscreens.  Apply, then wait a few minutes before heading out into the sun.  I realize this doesn&#x27;t sound so convenient, but the pain of a burn is much worse.</li>
            <li> My two kids and wife all had rashes after one use:    BHT is very bad for you    Human skin toxicant - strong evidence  Known human immune system toxicant       Source: National Library of Medicine HazMap      [...]</li>
            <li> my daughter who is 6 has extremely sensitive skin and is very fair. This is the ONLY sunblock that I use on her and it keeps her from burning 100%!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing it featured in a magazine.  It was recommended for people with sensitive skin, which I have.  Nearly all sunblocks sting my skin, and I am fanatical about UVA/ UVB protection as I am very fair.  So, supposedly, this was the sunblock for me.  Wrong.  First of all, the price is a little prohibitive.  $10 retail for 3 ounces?  In theory, if you are actually using on a baby, I guess the smaller surface area and delicate skin would balance it out, but for an adult using it every day, sometimes multiple times a day, it made me think twice.  Secondly, as this is designed for babies (who do not sweat), sweat will bead up under the sunblock and will not evaporate, so you find yourself continually dabbing at your face like a portly, wool-clad defense attorney in pre air-conditioned Atlanta.  In its favor, I will say that I experienced absolutely no stinging or irritation with this product.  Finally, the zinc and titanium content will turn even the fairest complexion a lighter shade of pale, so unless your baby is Caucasian or you are auditioning for a sequel to Twilight, I would not recommend this product.  I&#x27;ll sum it up by saying that this would have received five stars if it were purely free for babies, otherwise, find another sunblock.</li>
            <li> good product. nice to use, no irritation on skin. you do not need to use a lot. happy with it.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my upper chest and neck area. When I was out in the sun it caused burning and I broke out in a rash which was very itchy and lasted several days. I can&#x27;t imagine ever using this product on a baby. I am suspicious that the salicylate ingredient is the culprit. I am 61 and have never had a problem with a sunscreen before using this product.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that I have used this product daily this summer on my two year old with no problems. No rash, no dryness, no sunburn. He has been out for a couple of hours at a time at the pool or playing in the yard and did not get burned (and he is very pale). It does take a few seconds longer to rub it in well. It definitely beats the spray I originally bought that just made him smell like chemicals. I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect sunscreen, but this one works fine til we run out.</li>
            <li> I am a physician myself and I want to assure everyone. I have been using this product since my kid was 8 months old, (she is now 2 yrs old), I had no problems with it. This is the best sunscreen product I&#x27;ve tried for my kid. Easy to apply (not very tick as many others) and no rash, very good sunprotection.</li>
            <li> I tested it on me for a number of days prior to using it on my baby, and I didn&#x27;t react at all (I have extremely sensitive skin). I am so sensitive, that I have found only one other sunscreen that has a high spf that does not irritate my facial skin--and that one costs $42 per ounce. Needless to say, I now use this product for myself as well as my baby.    6/16/11: additional comments. I stopped using this product a little over a year ago after I discovered that Aveeno continuous protection sunscreens worked better for us. The Aveeno spread easier since it was creamier, so my son did not resist sunscreen application as much. Also, the Aveeno provided much much better moisturization, which actually improved my son&#x27;s eczema. The Aveeno sunscreen (both the baby version and the cream SPF 70 face version) did not irritate our skin at all. For us, the Aveeno was the better product. For the fact that the Neutrogena was harder to spread and rub in, I&#x27;ve changed my rating of the Neutrogena product from 5 stars to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin.  We normally use California Baby, which causes a light breakout but so far has been the best of the brands we&#x27;ve tried.  I saw this in the store and thought it sounded great.  Tried a patch test and it seemed OK.  Applied to his face, neck and arms.  His arms were OK, but his face and neck broke out into lots of tiny bumps--not a red rash but like all his pores blocked, his skin looked bumpy and rough.  Very disappointed.  It has taken three days for the rash to start subsiding.  This product is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunblock I&#x27;ve ever found!  I have asthma that is triggered by scented products and the smell of typical sunscreens will cause an ashtma issue not to mention a terrible headache.  Of course I have to keep my 16 month old&#x27;s skin protected and this stuff is perfect!!  I goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t stay greasey.  Best of all, there&#x27;s NO ODOR!  None!  I wear it myself too!  My son and I both have sensative skin and neither one of us have broken out in a rash.  LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. It&#x27;s not at all greasy and really works well. Baby did not burn at all, even in Florida at the beach. Granted, we were out very limited time and did our best to shelter her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well on my face. Very light.</li>
            <li> Works well. Takes a moment to rub in to be dissolved on skin so it doesn&#x27;t appear white. So far so good. Will purcahse again.</li>
            <li> PLEASE....DO YOUR RESEARCH before buying these products.  I bought this to use on my kids last year and I regret not waiting another year before the info came out on EWG&#x27;s website. I just went to check it out and it got a horrible rating..mostly because it contains Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), a toxic cancer causing chemical.  It&#x27;s very disturbing that a company is claiming to have a  \\&quot;Pure &amp; Free\\&quot; product when it is anything but that.  Please do your research, read ingredients, and be careful on what kind of sunscreen you are slathering on your babies.</li>
            <li> Avoid this sunscreen for your child, and even for yourself!  This sunscreen contains retinyl palminate (Vitamin A). Government-funded studies have found that this particular type of vitamin A may increase risk of skin cancer when used on sun-exposed skin. Nice, huh? Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this since I have solar dermatitis (break out in rash and itch when exposed to sun).  I used this while at the beach and had NO symptoms.  This applies easily although I did seem to have a light film on my skin.  However, that was easily removed when I showered.  This arrived on time in excellent packaging.  I only wish it was available in more than 3 oz size since I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need it more when we are in Hawaii.  Love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Ingredients Great, but I will not buy again because of strong scent. Odors, especially sweet scents attract flying insects and are not appropriate for any sunscreen or block, let alone shampoos and conditioners. Too bad scentless hair care products are so costly. I believe that sales would skyrocket if someone like Neutrogena produced scentless hair care products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s non greasy but it is like putting white powder on you face so the trick is too smooth it out evenly on your face or else youd look like youve been baking flour and it blew on your face...</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a Pure &amp; Free sunscreen for my daughters, as this one claims to be. While it was still in date, the product itself was clumpy when we used it. We ended up tossing it out after a few weeks and switching to another brand.</li>
            <li> I tried this sunscreen (as an adult) while visiting my mom, who bought it for me bc she knows I prefer natural products, and I guess bc she thinks of me as her baby...anyways I have no known allergies and have always used whatever products but this one gave me a harsh rash all over my arms and chest where I used it!!! I also used it on my face, but thank goodness there hasn&#x27;t been the same reaction there, just a few clogged pores. I think perhaps my makeup must have diluted the effect on my face. I already didn&#x27;t like it because it goes on thick like a shoe polish and leaves a white-purple residue, but I was willing to deal with that, the rash not so much. Over 24 hrs later it&#x27;s keeping me up at night. Definitely headed for the trash. I&#x27;ve been googling it and apparently many others have had this reaction, so it&#x27;s pretty shocking since I assumed Neutrogena was always the safest, but now I wouldn&#x27;t trust any of their stuff without more research. Also that stuff other reviewers are saying about retinyl palmitate is pretty horrible too...don&#x27;t need any cancer enhancers! Overall pretty sketched out by this experience. And itchy.</li>
            <li> This product is the worst sunblock ever.  Both of my kids have olive complexion and while using this product as directed got the worst  sunburn ever.  I&#x27;ve used neutrogena products before and have been very happy this newest product is the worst ever.  Dont put your kids at risk!!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to prevent melasma and for general protection of the face.  He said a min. of 50 SPF is what&#x27;s required to prevent damaging your skin from casual sun exposure.  60 SPF is a bit better, the product is hypoallergenic and my skin has definitely improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li> After finding out that chemical sunscreens irritate my skin, I went in search of a physical one and found this. I do like this a lot. My skin is on the oilier side and will sometimes break out, but this sunscreen hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me. The finish isn&#x27;t too dry or shiny and I can use this all over my face without irritation. I am on my second tube. I have to say the only thing that irks me is the packaging; it&#x27;s a standing tube and the sunscreen tends to collect at the cap and harden. I have to store it on its side instead.</li>
            <li> I am severely allergic to Methylisothiazolinone, which is in this product. Methylisothiazolinone is a relatively common allergen, so test this before using it all over your body. I called Neutrogena&#x27;s medical department to report my allergic reactions to this product (which required emergent oral and topical steroids), but they gave me very defensive responses and said that they &amp;#34;test their product for allergies.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry, but Methylisothiazolinone is not an uncommon allergy. It was even the common allergen of the year recently and I read somewhere it&#x27;s the second leading cause of dermatitis after Nickel metal (not sure if that&#x27;s true 100%). Regardless, I just want people to know that this product is not allergy-free and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
