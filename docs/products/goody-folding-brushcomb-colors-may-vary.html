            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the 3 pack of these, as they are good for traveling, but I am experiencing an issue with the bristles splaying out to the sides.  </li>
            <li>Nice pocket size and fits well.</li>
            <li>I would probably be just as happy with a wider tooth comb to do a quick comb through while I am at work.  </li>

            <li>Was so glad to find these.  </li>

            <li>Arrived quick!</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this little folding brush is WONDERFUL!!!  </li>
            <li>These are just as great as I remember them from way back.</li>
            <li>Still, I will use and enjoy them.</li>
            <li>I have had one of these combination comb/brushes for years and thought they were no longer available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very narrow brush so not the best, but it can be tucked discreetly into a desk drawer or handbag and be there when you need a quick touch up and nothing better is available.  </li>
            <li>I still have a few but its always great to know where to buy more.</li>
            <li>the brush is would be good for horses but not human beings!!!</li>
            <li>The comb is very fine tooth and the brush is old fashioned (maybe 70&#x27;s vintage).  </li>
            <li>I lost my old one and these seems just as good as the 10 year old one I had.</li>
            <li>I had one of these when I was young and glad Goody still makes them.  </li>
            <li>My teenage grandson wanted one - was surprised and delighted to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found theses ...looked in several places and could not find a brush for my purse , keep one in my car too !!</li>
            <li>anything smaller than a huge purse will have space for this almost indestructable brush/comb combination.  </li>
            <li>this product really met my needs/  </li>
            <li>They both say that the really like the brushes</li>
            <li>I still have my older one</li>
            <li>I doubt much can be done to avoid this without changing the compact design, and so far the brushes are still usable, so I am giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Same brush is offered for much higher prices.</li>
            <li>The brush fits in your pocket and has good stiff bristles compared to other carry-around types.</li>
            <li>This kind of folding brush-and-comb combination is very hard to find in stores these days.  </li>
            <li>Had these for years and 5 year old granddaughter was intrigued by it</li>
            <li>I keep it in my purse where it&#x27;s easily accessible and takes up little room.  </li>
            <li>Small size allows it to fit in jeans pocket.</li>
            <li>It is sufficient for usage during the day but not heavy duty enough for nightly &#x27;brush outs&#x27;.....</li>
            <li>(Just be careful to open it slowly so as not to break it at the &#x27;hinge&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hooray for the supplier for carrying this useful and  hard to find beauty aid.&lt;br /&gt;Virginia from south Florida&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Rapid delivery ...very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I am a male and I like the convenience of having a comb and brush.  This set fits in my pocket and is not bulky. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> good quality, got to have it</li>
            <li> Best portable comb and brush ever</li>

            <li> I love this 2-in-1 brush/comb.  I have one in every purse.  They last a long long time.  I have extras on hand just in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> its a bet hard brush for short beard</li>
            <li> Awesome it works it fits in your pockets nicely I recommend it</li>
            <li> I got the 3-pack so I could keep 1 in my purse, 1 in my desk at work, and 1 in my travel bag. They&#x27;re great to have around.</li>
            <li> I like using the comb brush. I had one before and lost it. I had a hard time find a replacement so I purchased three.</li>
            <li> I picked up a 3-pack of these for around $9 just to have some spares if I lost the one i carry. The brush fits in your pocket and has good stiff bristles compared to other carry-around types. Good deal. Same brush is offered for much higher prices.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a while to find this combo comb/brush for my loved ones and their travel needs.  Light and compact!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this little folding brush is WONDERFUL!!!  It is sufficient for usage during the day but not heavy duty enough for nightly &#x27;brush outs&#x27;.....BUT it is so compact it fits into the smallest of bags!!!  Evening bags, golf bags. anything smaller than a huge purse will have space for this almost indestructable brush/comb combination.  (Just be careful to open it slowly so as not to break it at the &#x27;hinge&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for the supplier for carrying this useful and  hard to find beauty aid.&lt;br /&gt;Virginia from south Florida&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS This would make a great &#x27;stocking stuffer&#x27; come the holidays!</li>
            <li> I love these combo folding brush and comb.  Gave several to family and the men like them to carry in a pocket also.  I still have a few but its always great to know where to buy more.</li>
            <li> This kind of folding brush-and-comb combination is very hard to find in stores these days.  It&#x27;s a very narrow brush so not the best, but it can be tucked discreetly into a desk drawer or handbag and be there when you need a quick touch up and nothing better is available.  Very handy.</li>
            <li> I love these comb/brush combos. I&#x27;d give them a 5 if it were not that two or three of the six I ordered had misaligned comb and grooves or warbled combs. Still, I will use and enjoy them.</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I was young and glad Goody still makes them.  I purchased these for Christmas shoe box gifts.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive enough to buy several.  I keep one in my purse, my desk, and in each car,</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this brush for years! I still have my older one and it looks good. It fits in my small hand bags too.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased 6 for me and gifts.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these combination comb/brushes for years and thought they were no longer available.  My teenage grandson wanted one - was surprised and delighted to find them on Amazon.  Perfect for pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> this product really met my needs/  I keep it in my purse where it&#x27;s easily accessible and takes up little room.  Bought 2 others for stocking stuffers for my granddaughters!</li>
            <li> Nice pocket size and fits well. Sturdy and well made. Small size allows it to fit in jeans pocket. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This comb &amp; brush combo set are great for my boys - ages 6 &amp; 8. It&#x27;s a perfect fit for their pockets and they are pleased to have a comb on then go - just like the adults :)!</li>
            <li> Had these for years and 5 year old granddaughter was intrigued by it, so, guess who got one</li>
            <li> It is Okay.  The comb is very fine tooth and the brush is old fashioned (maybe 70&#x27;s vintage).  I would probably be just as happy with a wider tooth comb to do a quick comb through while I am at work.  What I really wanted was a small flip travel brush with a softer scalp feel.  I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere so I bought this instead.  It gets me through.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my boat bag and I gave one each to my wife and daughter.  They both say that the really like the brushes</li>
