            <li>I use these to get my daughters to do their chores and to reward good behavior.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what happened, this company used to sell a good product</li>
            <li>I received this lip balm from you before from a friend and LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li>and it was a good product.</li>
            <li>I received right on time and very happy with service!</li>
            <li>I was happy as a gift-giver; in our winter climate, everybody was borrowing my pot lip balm (stick a finger in it &amp; rub it over your lips) and getting them their own guarantees that they won&#x27;t be touching mine again.  </li>
            <li>I love my Lipsmackers!</li>
            <li>This is good lip gloss and tastes ok.  </li>
            <li>but my nieces love these</li>
            <li>My girls love any kids of chapstick.</li>
            <li>I really love these.</li>
            <li>But i still love them.</li>
            <li>They LOVE them</li>
            <li>Hi, you will not regret gettin these lip smacking delicios chap sticks, i have always been a smackers fan,I love, love,</li>
            <li>cause i am a forever smackers chap stcik fan! :)</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment - great quality.</li>
            <li>It is better then othe lip balm (chap stick)</li>
            <li>in that it tastes better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>So when I ran out I had to order more.  </li>
            <li>Love this packages because I got all of them in just one package for such a good price!</li>
            <li>The scents are nice and true to the candy, and on the rare occasion that I lick my lips, it has a nice sweet taste.  </li>
            <li>however instead of one great big package of 16 Lip Smackers, the box contained two eight hang-packs (see additional photos) like you would buy in a store.  </li>
            <li>lol i can&#x27;t wait until they are back in stock,</li>
            <li>Great product will buy again If possible.</li>
            <li>No bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my neice did like the flavors, so I guess it worked out.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly seem like the most beneficial substance to be absorbing into our bodies.</li>
            <li>this product is ok, i recomended, the service is fast, all rigth, the price is the exact.</li>
            <li>They are really worth it.</li>
            <li>Their taste and scents are just like the real Skittles, the delivery had no problems, arrived pretty fast and everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li>The first three listed ingrediants in this product are petroleum derived.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Real men don&#x27;t care about &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My recommendation is for you to research the chemicals in this product to determine for yourself if it&#x27;s really something you want to be exposing your body to.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be safe to give them to other peoples children without the safety seals.</li>
            <li>NOW, CAUSE I RAN OUT OF THEM A LONG TIME AGO, AND THEY SAY, &#x27;CURRENTLY EN AVAILABLE,</li>
            <li>Gave them away for birthday party favors along with bags of skittles and were a big hit and reasonably priced for LOTS of girls!</li>
            <li>I did after my 5 yr old</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s probably harmless, it might make stomachs upset, but there is absolutely no information on the individual packaging.</li>
            <li> things or not, or whatever perception there is, as long as it works (protect chapped lips).  </li>
            <li> A LONG LONG TIME AGO, BUT I WAS GONNA GET IT</li>
            <li> Unfortnately my teenage sons are not interested in the fruity flavors.  </li>
            <li> I could have gone to the local drugstore and done something prettier myself for less money.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it feels greasy at all like the other reviewer.</li>
            <li> the other 10 did not.</li>
            <li> A little sticky though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to add to a gift bag for the little girls in my daughters wedding party.</li>

            <li> When it arrived it was merely 2 identical variety packs of lip balm crammed into an otherwise empty cardboard box.</li>
            <li> and I used at least one of these</li>
            <li> I bought some different flavored lip gloss by another company for my daughter and she complained that hers had a bad aftertaste.  </li>

            <li> My daughter came home from school yesterday with this product that her friend gave her.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice it.  Then when she said she had candy I looked at it. A bunch of kids had been eating this.  It&#x27;s probably harmless, it might make stomachs upset, but there is absolutely no information on the individual packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my neice. When it arrived it was merely 2 identical variety packs of lip balm crammed into an otherwise empty cardboard box. Not a great \\&quot;gift\\&quot; presentation and doesn&#x27;t show that or tell you that in the description. I could have gone to the local drugstore and done something prettier myself for less money.  Luckily my neice did like the flavors, so I guess it worked out.</li>
            <li> This is great pack of lip balm.  Unfortnately my teenage sons are not interested in the fruity flavors.  I keep one in my purse but my nieces love these</li>
            <li> My girls love any kids of chapstick. These smell great. My only complaint...wish they had SPF sunscreen in them to protect their lips in the summer.</li>
            <li> I really love these. I think they are like the best chapsticks ever..! And they smell delicous. A little sticky though. But i still love them. They are really worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for a friends daughter.  It came boxed as shown as the photo, however instead of one great big package of 16 Lip Smackers, the box contained two eight hang-packs (see additional photos) like you would buy in a store.  If I had known it was two packages of eight, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought them, or just bought the same thing for cheaper at a regular store.  Giving her two packages of 8 definitely didn&#x27;t have the same \\&quot;cool\\&quot; factor as one 16 package would have.</li>
            <li> I use these to get my daughters to do their chores and to reward good behavior.  They LOVE them and I like them too!</li>
            <li> Purchased as gifts for fellow students.  I opened the packaging in front of them and passed them out; they are not worried that it was an &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; gift since it was opened in front of them and they saw that it was brand new (not that things being &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; ever stopped them when times &amp; temps got desperate).  Everybody was happy!  It smells great, they got gifts; they were happy.  I was happy as a gift-giver; in our winter climate, everybody was borrowing my pot lip balm (stick a finger in it &amp; rub it over your lips) and getting them their own guarantees that they won&#x27;t be touching mine again.  Note:  it was the men, the males in class who were asking to borrow mine over several weeks; they didn&#x27;t care about the fruity smells or whatever flavours; they just wanted to protect their lips, that spurred me to purchase this item.  Real men don&#x27;t care about &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; things or not, or whatever perception there is, as long as it works (protect chapped lips).  I gave them out to both males and females in class.</li>
            <li> I have these and they are great! As you put them on your lips, it liquifies and makes your lips feel hydrated, and not for just 10 min like chapstick, but for quite a while, I don&#x27;t think it feels greasy at all like the other reviewer. The scents are nice and true to the candy, and on the rare occasion that I lick my lips, it has a nice sweet taste.  Once I put it on my lips, I don&#x27;t smell it anymore, so it doesn&#x27;t become a nuisance or try to compete with my perfume or hand lotion.</li>
            <li> The first three listed ingrediants in this product are petroleum derived. Hmmmm. Doesn&#x27;t exactly seem like the most beneficial substance to be absorbing into our bodies. My recommendation is for you to research the chemicals in this product to determine for yourself if it&#x27;s really something you want to be exposing your body to. I did after my 5 yr old received a tube as a gift and my answer is \\&quot;No way!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to add to a gift bag for the little girls in my daughters wedding party. When I received the lip balms only 6 of them had safety seals on them but the other 10 did not. I didn&#x27;t think it would be safe to give them to other peoples children without the safety seals. There would be no way to know if they had been tampered with. Needless to say...I returned them.</li>
            <li> Gave them away for birthday party favors along with bags of skittles and were a big hit and reasonably priced for LOTS of girls!</li>
            <li> Hi, you will not regret gettin these lip smacking delicios chap sticks, i have always been a smackers fan,I love, love, L-O-V-E&lt;br /&gt;THESE CHAP  STICKS, I WHERE THEM EVERY DAY OF THE Week, and i love the soda one&#x27;s the best, they taste (JUST) Like root beer, dr pepper, and sprite, I GOT THIS SET A LONG LONG TIME AGO, BUT I WAS GONNA GET IT NOW, CAUSE I RAN OUT OF THEM A LONG TIME AGO, AND THEY SAY, &#x27;CURRENTLY EN AVAILABLE, And im like, OH MANNN! lol i can&#x27;t wait until they are back in stock, cause i am a forever smackers chap stcik fan! :)</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment - great quality. Purchased for party favors!</li>
            <li> it was just was i was expecting for. I really like it. i get it on time and the box was not very big</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Strawberry Shortcake and Cherry Cobbler flavors. The both smell and taste like feet. I don&#x27;t know what happened, this company used to sell a good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got my Lipsmackers!  Their taste and scents are just like the real Skittles, the delivery had no problems, arrived pretty fast and everything went smoothly. Thanks Amazon! I love my Lipsmackers!</li>
            <li> What can I say....it&#x27;s lip balm for my grandaughter and she will love it!!  I received right on time and very happy with service!</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again If possible.</li>
            <li> I received this lip balm from you before from a friend and LOVED IT.  It is better then othe lip balm (chap stick) in that it tastes better and lasts longer.  So when I ran out I had to order more.  It is a GREAT product and I will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> Love this packages because I got all of them in just one package for such a good price! Smoth and good taste are the best words to describe the Skittles LipSmackers.</li>
            <li> We used one lip balm in each of the goodie bags for my son&#x27;s ice skating birthday party.  They were perfect!</li>
            <li> This is good lip gloss and tastes ok.  No bad aftertaste.  I bought some different flavored lip gloss by another company for my daughter and she complained that hers had a bad aftertaste.  I had no complaints and I used at least one of these and it was a good product.</li>
            <li> this product is ok, i recomended, the service is fast, all rigth, the price is the exact. very very good</li>
