            <li>I love Watts Beauty serums because they work!</li>
            <li>I purchased this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>but what I like about Watts is it provides as good or better results at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>All views are my own.</li>
            <li>on that note I can&#x27;t HONESTLY say that just using this product alone will give you the results I&#x27;m experiencing</li>
            <li>To be honest I have not noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly did see a pinker, and fresher appearance to my skin after 1 week.</li>
            <li>, it goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>so I could you a honest review.</li>
            <li>...and effective.  </li>
            <li>This does a good job, but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>Just using this Hyaluronic acid serum, my face feels nice refreshed and moist.</li>
            <li>received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>love love love this!!</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and for the price this is amazing!</li>
            <li>The fact that the price on this serum is very good, the ingredients and positive reviews are why I&#x27;m giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, none greasy, none sticky serum.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, WILL PROBABLY BUY MORE!</li>
            <li>Love how light it is on my skin!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff and worth a try</li>
            <li>So far I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells amazing and surely does its job.</li>
            <li>Watts products are wonderful as a general rule, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in fine lines within a week!</li>
            <li>It is very smooth in my face and you can see the difference in the part around the eye.  </li>
            <li>I still love my philosophy products and will for ever use purity face wash</li>
            <li>I feel that I need many things in my beauty program, this is a must have for the price</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>My face is so much more even toned.</li>
            <li>This product is more like a gel serum.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>First of all, this stuff is AMAZING at healing a chemical peel!</li>
            <li>and then I throw some CeraVe lotion on top.</li>
            <li>I hope they always sell this and with the lovely economy we have</li>
            <li>I make sure that when I rinse the cleansing product off that I use warm-hot water.  </li>
            <li>but I DO think I will be ordering the 2oz bottle soon &amp; continue this regimen (better deal too).</li>
            <li>add argan oil on top.  </li>
            <li>I am sure within time it will help to soften</li>
            <li>Also a brightting also , I love it , and I will buy more .</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>My husband says my skin looks clearer and more even.</li>
            <li>Love these products from Watts..no smelly perfumes to make me sneeze</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>so i have to take the top off and manually apply it.</li>
            <li>love this product and use it morning and night</li>
            <li>will no doubt by some more as i ran out of my supply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a couple more days.</li>
            <li>It works better than the $150 serums.</li>
            <li>I love that I have not had any reaction or breakouts with this product</li>
            <li>At night I use the Watt&#x27;s retinol serum (used to use ROC exclusively) and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>Gave this as a gift to several wonderful women!</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Alice</li>
            <li>I love this product, I will return for another purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>looks better than before.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s worth to give a try and see if this one is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but if I would of used a moisturizer like it recommended that probably would of made that better.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a pump.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my wife and it&#x27;s not her favorite.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you--I have been wasting my money on that $100/bottle stuff because Watts&#x27; brand works as well or EVEN BETTER.</li>
            <li>I also love they are made with a pump rather than an eye dropper.</li>
            <li>The most important aspect is that yes, this serum delivers!</li>
            <li>My daughter even commented that my skin looks better, and she had no idea</li>
            <li>different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond being pleased with this product</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>It feels nice &amp; cool on the skin and seems to hydrate well.</li>
            <li>This product is non-irritating, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, goes on smoothly, makes me feel beautiful, and within a few days of using it people already remark on how &#x27;beautiful&#x27;</li>
            <li>Nice lotion absorbs really quick.</li>
            <li>This product makes my face feel good, but I have not seen positive results.  </li>
            <li>I have seen great results with marked wrinkles around the mouth.</li>
            <li>Not convinced it did much, but it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and the ingredients are good.</li>
            <li>Am using it with my new microcurrent device, and my skin hasnt looked this good in years :)</li>
            <li>My fine lines and wrinkles have disappeared.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li>Seems to be tightening up my skin &amp; eliminating fine lines(I&#x27;m 44).</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the fine crow&#x27;s feet I had are also begining to fade and</li>
            <li>I also have been using it with fade creams and works just fine.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem to be diminished a bit.</li>
            <li>Just try it for a week or two and see if you notice a difference to those fine lines around your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
            <li>but it seemed fine.</li>
            <li>At almost 40, I&#x27;ve taken very good care of my skin over the years, but was looking for something a little more aggressive to keep fighting the fine lines around my eyes and lips, as well as to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing a HUGE improvement in the texture, clarity and tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed huge improvements in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>I have jowls and am hoping that in time they’ll smooth out too.  </li>
            <li>The prices are fabulous.</li>
            <li>The product is clean and has a gel like feel that is obsorbed in the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smoothly and I can feel my skin tightening without drying.  </li>
            <li>This Peptide Firming serum is a light weight gel.</li>
            <li>rated it 4 out of 5 only in that you really need to mix it with Vit C to get the best results.</li>
            <li>It is never too early to prevent and maintain good healthcare habits.  </li>
            <li>this product works as well as the very pricey skincare products from &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34; online and in dept. stores (who needs the fancy packaging anyway!!!???)........</li>
            <li>show that this particular facial aging was best corrected with peptides</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many serums from many manufacturers, both high &amp; lower end.</li>
            <li>The bottle easily dispenses just the right amount, and it is easily worn under moisturizer and make up with no noticeable difference in look or feel.</li>
            <li>Clean and light.</li>
            <li>In one week I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I did not see any significant benefit from this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used other brands that have been cheaper and loved  - much better then this one.  </li>
            <li>specially now that is 34 degrees out )</li>
            <li>This product is amazing as well as others that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I like the way it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The pump is much easier to use and is more sanitary.</li>
            <li>Maybe a stronger compound with longer lasting effects would be more appealing</li>
            <li>I work with many young ladies, and now I am actually feeling more confident because of this firming wrinkle serum.</li>
            <li>Pretty good,  I see a big difference in my turkey neck,  </li>
            <li>I saw improvement in my under eye area after the first use!</li>
            <li>I have used other products that have been adequate, but am overwhelmingly pleased that this serum is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>: impatient lol)</li>
            <li>This product is wonderfull it leaves your face looking healthy , young plumped ...</li>
            <li>The Watts Firming Wrinkle Serum has an effective combination of ingredients that make my skin look years younger.  </li>
            <li>It is odorless and has a nice, spreadable consistency, two pumps cover my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>I often get complements from people on my skin--definitely more frequently than I did before I started using the hyaluronic products.</li>
            <li>I have been getting compliments on my skin all week and love how soft it feels.  </li>
            <li>I recieved a discount to buy and it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I find the serum very nice and moist and after applying wait for a few moments and</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviewers that say that the pump doesn&#x27;t work that good.  </li>
            <li>and you can see the difference right away in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>and I KNOW that I made the right choice with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I guess I will give this three stars because I just started using it and can&#x27;t really make a true decision until I have been using it longer.</li>
            <li>While the directions are extremely small, I&#x27;m happy with the product in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>gentle on the skin, no negative reaction to this product, easy to use, I noticed the wrinkles around my eyes fading away, very happy with this product, I usually have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This certainly helps!</li>
            <li>I recently received this serum and so far so good.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel fresh after I put is on and as you can see in the picture my deep four head wrinkles do look better.</li>
            <li>First - do NOT expect overnight results.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth,  soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two weeks now and am absolutely sold!  </li>
            <li>It is nice, but the size compared to my other bottles of 1 oz. does not measure up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled that I&#x27;ve started using it on other areas that are sagging, like my brow bone skin.</li>
            <li>I will always be loyal to Watts and Amazon as this is where I purchase all of my chemical peels and the little hidden treasures like Watts Serum! &lt;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m counting down my 50th year, so that&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I broke out horribly pretty much wherever I used this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients in this one as well as the fact that it&#x27;s chock full of peptides along with the hyluronic acid.</li>
            <li>and there are certain skin</li>
            <li>This is nice,my skin felt soft and plumped up,there is no unpleasant smell,it smells of nothing,the only con is that the bottle is tiny,otherwise its good for dry ,dehydrated skin,i dont know if i would repurchase,i may try something else instead.</li>
            <li>are products like DMEA that cause huge problems and this product only helps not harms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now, and I definitely see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Also, I have oily skin and this summer has been very humid.</li>
            <li>Finally a reasonably priced skin cream</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>( i like to see results fast</li>
            <li>And, judging from the compliments and what I can see, it really does make your skin look brighter and firmer.</li>
            <li>The combination really works for me.</li>
            <li>didnt see real omprovements</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like using this product.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse in a dermatology office and highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed a difference really</li>
            <li>I really like this serum</li>
            <li>It feels like a very watery oil</li>
            <li>It really helps to even out my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This, in combination with a moisturizer, really did the trick.</li>
            <li>very dissipointed.</li>
            <li>My skin feels firmer and so smooth, especially in the morning!</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have even used it in my eye area (not too close) and it was very cooling.</li>
            <li>Product is always delivered quickly and quality just as good, if not better, than much pricier similar products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty new to me, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it as it really improves my skin.</li>
            <li>I had a very uneven complexion with some wrinkles here and there, some fine lines here and there and a complexion that does not look smooth in anyway.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this healthy and clear in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may need a little extra something for under the eyes if you like soft eyes, but as an overall daytime serum, this is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using good skin care for several years now, I don&#x27;t expect a huge transformation in my skin, I only hope this serum will help me maintain the results I&#x27;ve achieved with other serums that have similar ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend a little more to have a stronger concentrated product.</li>
            <li>Good for bags &amp; sags and, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>because I have hope it&#x27;ll work for those with normal skin.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, most of them have the same ingredients, but prices vary wildly.  </li>
            <li>I do my own chemical peels at home and wanted to test the healing process with and without this serum (In other words, it&#x27;s taken a long time before I could write this review)</li>
            <li>Further I really like this product because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>FOR MY DRY SKIN, ABSORBS QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I bought it because a dermatologist recommended another brand with some of the same ingredients, but for a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Since I am approaching my thirties, I want to find products that will not only help my skin now, but will help keep it healthy and clear in the future.</li>
            <li>I have oily/acne-prone skin that can be sensitive to new products.</li>
            <li>i just finished my tiny bottle and the skin texture looks a lot better and my marionette wrinkles and sagging jaw is a lot less noticeable</li>
            <li>/&gt;the Hyaluronic Acid get dry right after applied on my skin I think this product is fear for the price</li>
            <li>the sagging jowls are barely noticeable along my jaw line, the deep puckered lines are completely gone on the right side.</li>
            <li>I have several fine lines on my forehead from the several &amp;#34;faces&amp;#34; I make daily and wanted to try something that would &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It feels very soothing on the skin and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m almost completely healed, I use this along with some CeraVe SPF50.</li>
            <li>The downside here is that my sensitive skin did NOT respond as well to this product as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, perhaps this product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I have used dozens of anti-aging cream and so far the watts beauty peptide seems to work like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review because as a professional in the skin care business, our consumer which that&#x27;s me ?  </li>
            <li>It looks firmer and more glowing, or at least I think it does.  </li>
            <li>I think I should give up on finding something for my old face.  </li>
            <li>On both sides that &#x27;y&#x27; that was forming to my mouth is completely gone</li>
            <li>Not only does my face feel smooth and tighter, but others have commented on my wrinkles particularly on my forehead being less noticeable.</li>
            <li>So far I notice that my skin feels fuller on my face.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this faithfully now and my only issue is that I havent tried this much sooner.</li>
            <li>So far I like it, time will tell.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to any of their products.</li>
            <li>my face looks younger and more firm.</li>
            <li>I do not understand why something with the same make up should work differently, but I have just had better results with other products.  </li>
            <li>BTW I am a 61 year old woman, trying to look as vibrant as possible.</li>
            <li>I wanted it for under eye trearment for fine lines not satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have numerous allergies and very sensitive skin, so sometimes it makes my face itch.  </li>
            <li>I use the Vanish eye cream first, then I dampen my forehead, face, neck with water and apply the pure acid solution, followed by the peptide complex (then Retinol Serum 5 at night), and Estee Lauder &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; cream for face and neck.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and actually soaks into your skin!</li>
            <li>I am in my late 20&#x27;s and starting to see fine lines.</li>
            <li>I really want to keep those lines at bay but have trouble finding products that don&#x27;t irritate my &#x27;ginger&#x27; skin (I am a natural redhead).</li>
            <li>no dry patches (</li>
            <li>I really feel this product does not help with dark spots</li>
            <li>But, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s in a dark bottle &amp; tightly capped so as to not allow it to be deteriorated by light and air.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this as I&#x27;ve been looking for something to soften lines around my lips and other expression lines.</li>
            <li>Over the past winter deep puckered lines formed in the jowls from my jawline up to the smile lines.</li>
            <li>Much less expensive than some name brand products and the results are just as good.</li>
            <li>Better than most creams at expensive department stores!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Im extremely pleased with the results I have since I started using this!</li>
            <li> I love Watts Beauty serums because they work!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> but what I like about Watts is it provides as good or better results at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> All views are my own.</li>
            <li> on that note I can&#x27;t HONESTLY say that just using this product alone will give you the results I&#x27;m experiencing</li>
            <li> To be honest I have not noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly did see a pinker, and fresher appearance to my skin after 1 week.</li>
            <li> , it goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> so I could you a honest review.</li>
            <li> ...and effective.  </li>
            <li> This does a good job, but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Just using this Hyaluronic acid serum, my face feels nice refreshed and moist.</li>
            <li> received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> love love love this!!</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and for the price this is amazing!</li>
            <li> The fact that the price on this serum is very good, the ingredients and positive reviews are why I&#x27;m giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, none greasy, none sticky serum.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, WILL PROBABLY BUY MORE!</li>
            <li> Love how light it is on my skin!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and worth a try</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells amazing and surely does its job.</li>
            <li> Watts products are wonderful as a general rule, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in fine lines within a week!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth in my face and you can see the difference in the part around the eye.  </li>
            <li> I still love my philosophy products and will for ever use purity face wash</li>
            <li> I feel that I need many things in my beauty program, this is a must have for the price</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> My face is so much more even toned.</li>
            <li> This product is more like a gel serum.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> First of all, this stuff is AMAZING at healing a chemical peel!</li>
            <li> and then I throw some CeraVe lotion on top.</li>
            <li> I hope they always sell this and with the lovely economy we have</li>
            <li> I make sure that when I rinse the cleansing product off that I use warm-hot water.  </li>
            <li> but I DO think I will be ordering the 2oz bottle soon &amp; continue this regimen (better deal too).</li>
            <li> add argan oil on top.  </li>
            <li> I am sure within time it will help to soften</li>
            <li> Also a brightting also , I love it , and I will buy more .</li>
            <li> This product was okay.</li>
            <li> My husband says my skin looks clearer and more even.</li>
            <li> Love these products from Watts..no smelly perfumes to make me sneeze</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> so i have to take the top off and manually apply it.</li>
            <li> love this product and use it morning and night</li>
            <li> will no doubt by some more as i ran out of my supply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a couple more days.</li>
            <li> It works better than the $150 serums.</li>
            <li> I love that I have not had any reaction or breakouts with this product</li>
            <li> At night I use the Watt&#x27;s retinol serum (used to use ROC exclusively) and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to several wonderful women!</li>
            <li> Sincerely, Alice</li>
            <li> I love this product, I will return for another purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> looks better than before.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s worth to give a try and see if this one is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but if I would of used a moisturizer like it recommended that probably would of made that better.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a pump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and it&#x27;s not her favorite.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you--I have been wasting my money on that $100/bottle stuff because Watts&#x27; brand works as well or EVEN BETTER.</li>
            <li> I also love they are made with a pump rather than an eye dropper.</li>
            <li> The most important aspect is that yes, this serum delivers!</li>
            <li> My daughter even commented that my skin looks better, and she had no idea</li>
            <li> different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond being pleased with this product</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> It feels nice &amp; cool on the skin and seems to hydrate well.</li>
            <li> This product is non-irritating, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, goes on smoothly, makes me feel beautiful, and within a few days of using it people already remark on how &#x27;beautiful&#x27;</li>
            <li> Nice lotion absorbs really quick.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel good, but I have not seen positive results.  </li>
            <li> I have seen great results with marked wrinkles around the mouth.</li>
            <li> Not convinced it did much, but it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and the ingredients are good.</li>
            <li> Am using it with my new microcurrent device, and my skin hasnt looked this good in years :)</li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles have disappeared.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li> Seems to be tightening up my skin &amp; eliminating fine lines(I&#x27;m 44).</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the fine crow&#x27;s feet I had are also begining to fade and</li>
            <li> I also have been using it with fade creams and works just fine.</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem to be diminished a bit.</li>
            <li> Just try it for a week or two and see if you notice a difference to those fine lines around your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> but it seemed fine.</li>
            <li> At almost 40, I&#x27;ve taken very good care of my skin over the years, but was looking for something a little more aggressive to keep fighting the fine lines around my eyes and lips, as well as to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a HUGE improvement in the texture, clarity and tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed huge improvements in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> I have jowls and am hoping that in time they’ll smooth out too.  </li>
            <li> The prices are fabulous.</li>
            <li> The product is clean and has a gel like feel that is obsorbed in the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smoothly and I can feel my skin tightening without drying.  </li>
            <li> This Peptide Firming serum is a light weight gel.</li>
            <li> rated it 4 out of 5 only in that you really need to mix it with Vit C to get the best results.</li>
            <li> It is never too early to prevent and maintain good healthcare habits.  </li>
            <li> this product works as well as the very pricey skincare products from &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34; online and in dept. stores (who needs the fancy packaging anyway!!!???)........</li>
            <li> show that this particular facial aging was best corrected with peptides</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many serums from many manufacturers, both high &amp; lower end.</li>
            <li> The bottle easily dispenses just the right amount, and it is easily worn under moisturizer and make up with no noticeable difference in look or feel.</li>
            <li> Clean and light.</li>
            <li> In one week I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> I did not see any significant benefit from this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands that have been cheaper and loved  - much better then this one.  </li>
            <li> specially now that is 34 degrees out )</li>
            <li> This product is amazing as well as others that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I like the way it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The pump is much easier to use and is more sanitary.</li>
            <li> Maybe a stronger compound with longer lasting effects would be more appealing</li>
            <li> I work with many young ladies, and now I am actually feeling more confident because of this firming wrinkle serum.</li>
            <li> Pretty good,  I see a big difference in my turkey neck,  </li>
            <li> I saw improvement in my under eye area after the first use!</li>
            <li> I have used other products that have been adequate, but am overwhelmingly pleased that this serum is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> : impatient lol)</li>
            <li> This product is wonderfull it leaves your face looking healthy , young plumped ...</li>
            <li> The Watts Firming Wrinkle Serum has an effective combination of ingredients that make my skin look years younger.  </li>
            <li> It is odorless and has a nice, spreadable consistency, two pumps cover my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I often get complements from people on my skin--definitely more frequently than I did before I started using the hyaluronic products.</li>
            <li> I have been getting compliments on my skin all week and love how soft it feels.  </li>
            <li> I recieved a discount to buy and it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I find the serum very nice and moist and after applying wait for a few moments and</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that say that the pump doesn&#x27;t work that good.  </li>
            <li> and you can see the difference right away in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> and I KNOW that I made the right choice with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I guess I will give this three stars because I just started using it and can&#x27;t really make a true decision until I have been using it longer.</li>
            <li> While the directions are extremely small, I&#x27;m happy with the product in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gentle on the skin, no negative reaction to this product, easy to use, I noticed the wrinkles around my eyes fading away, very happy with this product, I usually have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This certainly helps!</li>
            <li> I recently received this serum and so far so good.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel fresh after I put is on and as you can see in the picture my deep four head wrinkles do look better.</li>
            <li> First - do NOT expect overnight results.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth,  soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and am absolutely sold!  </li>
            <li> It is nice, but the size compared to my other bottles of 1 oz. does not measure up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled that I&#x27;ve started using it on other areas that are sagging, like my brow bone skin.</li>
            <li> I will always be loyal to Watts and Amazon as this is where I purchase all of my chemical peels and the little hidden treasures like Watts Serum! &lt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m counting down my 50th year, so that&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I broke out horribly pretty much wherever I used this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients in this one as well as the fact that it&#x27;s chock full of peptides along with the hyluronic acid.</li>
            <li> and there are certain skin</li>
            <li> This is nice,my skin felt soft and plumped up,there is no unpleasant smell,it smells of nothing,the only con is that the bottle is tiny,otherwise its good for dry ,dehydrated skin,i dont know if i would repurchase,i may try something else instead.</li>
            <li> are products like DMEA that cause huge problems and this product only helps not harms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now, and I definitely see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Also, I have oily skin and this summer has been very humid.</li>
            <li> Finally a reasonably priced skin cream</li>
            <li> the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> ( i like to see results fast</li>
            <li> And, judging from the compliments and what I can see, it really does make your skin look brighter and firmer.</li>
            <li> The combination really works for me.</li>
            <li> didnt see real omprovements</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse in a dermatology office and highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a difference really</li>
            <li> I really like this serum</li>
            <li> It feels like a very watery oil</li>
            <li> It really helps to even out my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This, in combination with a moisturizer, really did the trick.</li>
            <li> very dissipointed.</li>
            <li> My skin feels firmer and so smooth, especially in the morning!</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have even used it in my eye area (not too close) and it was very cooling.</li>
            <li> Product is always delivered quickly and quality just as good, if not better, than much pricier similar products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty new to me, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it as it really improves my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a very uneven complexion with some wrinkles here and there, some fine lines here and there and a complexion that does not look smooth in anyway.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this healthy and clear in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may need a little extra something for under the eyes if you like soft eyes, but as an overall daytime serum, this is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using good skin care for several years now, I don&#x27;t expect a huge transformation in my skin, I only hope this serum will help me maintain the results I&#x27;ve achieved with other serums that have similar ingredients.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I would rather spend a little more to have a stronger concentrated product.</li>
            <li> Good for bags &amp; sags and, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> because I have hope it&#x27;ll work for those with normal skin.</li>
            <li> Strangely enough, most of them have the same ingredients, but prices vary wildly.  </li>
            <li> I do my own chemical peels at home and wanted to test the healing process with and without this serum (In other words, it&#x27;s taken a long time before I could write this review)</li>
            <li> Further I really like this product because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> FOR MY DRY SKIN, ABSORBS QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I bought it because a dermatologist recommended another brand with some of the same ingredients, but for a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Since I am approaching my thirties, I want to find products that will not only help my skin now, but will help keep it healthy and clear in the future.</li>
            <li> I have oily/acne-prone skin that can be sensitive to new products.</li>
            <li> i just finished my tiny bottle and the skin texture looks a lot better and my marionette wrinkles and sagging jaw is a lot less noticeable</li>
            <li> /&gt;the Hyaluronic Acid get dry right after applied on my skin I think this product is fear for the price</li>
            <li> the sagging jowls are barely noticeable along my jaw line, the deep puckered lines are completely gone on the right side.</li>
            <li> I have several fine lines on my forehead from the several &amp;#34;faces&amp;#34; I make daily and wanted to try something that would &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It feels very soothing on the skin and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m almost completely healed, I use this along with some CeraVe SPF50.</li>
            <li> The downside here is that my sensitive skin did NOT respond as well to this product as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> For those of you who have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, perhaps this product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of anti-aging cream and so far the watts beauty peptide seems to work like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because as a professional in the skin care business, our consumer which that&#x27;s me ?  </li>
            <li> It looks firmer and more glowing, or at least I think it does.  </li>
            <li> I think I should give up on finding something for my old face.  </li>
            <li> On both sides that &#x27;y&#x27; that was forming to my mouth is completely gone</li>
            <li> Not only does my face feel smooth and tighter, but others have commented on my wrinkles particularly on my forehead being less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So far I notice that my skin feels fuller on my face.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this faithfully now and my only issue is that I havent tried this much sooner.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, time will tell.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to any of their products.</li>
            <li> my face looks younger and more firm.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why something with the same make up should work differently, but I have just had better results with other products.  </li>
            <li> BTW I am a 61 year old woman, trying to look as vibrant as possible.</li>
            <li> I wanted it for under eye trearment for fine lines not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have numerous allergies and very sensitive skin, so sometimes it makes my face itch.  </li>
            <li> I use the Vanish eye cream first, then I dampen my forehead, face, neck with water and apply the pure acid solution, followed by the peptide complex (then Retinol Serum 5 at night), and Estee Lauder &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; cream for face and neck.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and actually soaks into your skin!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and starting to see fine lines.</li>
            <li> I really want to keep those lines at bay but have trouble finding products that don&#x27;t irritate my &#x27;ginger&#x27; skin (I am a natural redhead).</li>
            <li> no dry patches (</li>
            <li> I really feel this product does not help with dark spots</li>
            <li> But, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s in a dark bottle &amp; tightly capped so as to not allow it to be deteriorated by light and air.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this as I&#x27;ve been looking for something to soften lines around my lips and other expression lines.</li>
            <li> Over the past winter deep puckered lines formed in the jowls from my jawline up to the smile lines.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than some name brand products and the results are just as good.</li>
            <li> Better than most creams at expensive department stores!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it made my face a little dry</li>
            <li> Watts Beauty Peptide - Hyaluronic Acid Concentrated Serum Complex used twice daily made the skin appear to have less fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was curious how much was left in the bottom that the little pump couldn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> My face looks so much smoother in the past month.</li>
            <li> It really does firm and tone your face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if im a unique case because i&#x27;m also a raw foodest so that could impact my results</li>
            <li> I then pat dry quickly &amp; apply the Hyaluronic Acid in a thin film</li>
            <li> However, my honey says my skin feels much firmer lately...</li>
            <li> Pores are smaller, under eye bags and dark circles are starting to go away, as well as lines.  </li>
            <li> just ordered the size up , $17 is not much to pay for 2.oz of a product that actually works and you can see changes</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried similar to this one.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any immediate effect in using it the last 3 days, as other reviewers have.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found Watts Beauty long ago!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little bigger bottle though doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Mind you, with a TCA peel, this stuff makes the process last only a few days.</li>
            <li> Theres no need to blow your hard earned money on much more expensive serum that does the same thing!</li>
            <li> (42 years old, acne scars, monthly acne (no more) oil reduction with this)</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin, I would recommend this and then a cream over.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling a little greasy</li>
            <li> FROm what i see, in only a few weeks time, i&amp;#34;m impressed&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> she said its make her skin softer but not much</li>
            <li> It is a very small container; much smaller than other High quality Serums I usually buy.</li>
            <li> And second, you just can&#x27;t beat the price of this little miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> even with a tiny bottle it will late me a long time!</li>
            <li> extremely hydrating without greasiness.</li>
            <li> Purchased due to other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have from other like products.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have found my husband using this</li>
            <li> Only needed a small amount to cover face and neck.</li>
            <li> I had done a lot of reading of reviews of this and other products and based on the reviews of Watts Beauty Peptide Firming Wrinkle Serum</li>
            <li> Using moderate to hard pressure.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m late 50&#x27;s and was starting to notice the saggy jowls about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Seems to help the &#x27;crepey&#x27; and sagging skin under my chin and down my neck.  </li>
            <li> A lot firmer and less puffiness.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, I notice maybe a slight improvement</li>
            <li> I used it up in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It showed a small improvement, but it didn&#x27;t produce the result I had expected.</li>
            <li> It  tightens up your skin without having that nasty dried egg white film that so many serums give you.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half now and have noticed a little difference in the appearance of these lines.</li>
            <li> nothing is a miracle, but every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li> A little backstory for you</li>
            <li> thank you for letting me test your product for little money</li>
            <li> I then wait a few mins.</li>
            <li> Would notice my skin tighen up and then shedding of dead skin.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I am beginning to see results.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled for a few years looking for products that will work well for my skin.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I came across Watts Beauty.</li>
            <li> I have a few of their products now, and all of them work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works yet.</li>
            <li> my wrinkle line slowly disappear and it doesnt felt heavy and itchy..</li>
            <li> I usually buy stuff that promise results and never work.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, one oz, that&#x27;s why 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction after using this every day for a week on my (newly forming) \\&quot;jowls\\&quot; was \\&quot;another false claim and worthless product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I often try other peptide beauty treatments and have found a few that seem to immediately perk up the skin, unfortunately this was not one.</li>
            <li> Always hard to tell with these skin potions</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, my skin feels smoother and does not look so tired in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This has the same ingredients as very expensive serums.</li>
            <li> Give this some time and you&#x27;ll see subtle improvements.  </li>
            <li> The pump on this is not great.  </li>
            <li> I started using this over a month ago and found some dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive stuff that does work</li>
            <li> Peptides can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> This serum works just as well as the very expensive brand I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> So, count me disappointed in the packaging.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I still love my philosophy products and will for ever use purity face wash but I am swapping out my moisturizers for the watts brands. I use this in the morning under my makeup because I have oily skin by the end of the day and I use this along with Watts retinol in the evenings. I&#x27;m seeing a HUGE improvement in the texture, clarity and tone of my skin. (42 years old, acne scars, monthly acne (no more) oil reduction with this) Great stuff and worth a try</li>
            <li> I feel that I need many things in my beauty program, this is a must have for the price you would think that it is so so but it&#x27;s not.  if  you  stay with it your face will take on a softer look and fill and you will glow.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful addition to my daily routine. I had a very uneven complexion with some wrinkles here and there, some fine lines here and there and a complexion that does not look smooth in anyway. I started using this over a month ago and found some dramatic results. My fine lines and wrinkles have disappeared. My face is so much more even toned. My face looks so much smoother in the past month. I noticed that it&#x27;s not so embarrassing when I am putting on foundation and power and the powder isn&#x27;t sinking into the lines under my eyes anymore. I love it! I work with many young ladies, and now I am actually feeling more confident because of this firming wrinkle serum. It really does firm and tone your face! I purchased this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion. I can honestly say I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> i just finished my tiny bottle and the skin texture looks a lot better and my marionette wrinkles and sagging jaw is a lot less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;the overall effect is the skin looks younger and w/  no dry patches ( specially now that is 34 degrees out )&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the size up , $17 is not much to pay for 2.oz of a product that actually works and you can see changes&lt;br /&gt;Great find!</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel good, but I have not seen positive results.  I would rather spend a little more to have a stronger concentrated product.</li>
            <li> This is nice,my skin felt soft and plumped up,there is no unpleasant smell,it smells of nothing,the only con is that the bottle is tiny,otherwise its good for dry ,dehydrated skin,i dont know if i would repurchase,i may try something else instead.</li>
            <li> Have just started using this product. I&#x27;m not sure how it works yet. But I am hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Watts Beauty products for about 6 weeks. I use the Vanish eye cream first, then I dampen my forehead, face, neck with water and apply the pure acid solution, followed by the peptide complex (then Retinol Serum 5 at night), and Estee Lauder &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; cream for face and neck. My skin feels great but I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines, etc. However, my honey says my skin feels much firmer lately... and it &amp;#34;glows.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give the credit to Watts! And I&#x27;ll use all the products till gone...then reassess!</li>
            <li> this serum is fantastic!!! extremely hydrating without greasiness. Clean and light. I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in fine lines within a week!</li>
            <li> In one week I noticed a significant improvement. A lot firmer and less puffiness. I have tried very expensive stuff that does work but what I like about Watts is it provides as good or better results at a fraction of the cost. Also, I have oily skin and this summer has been very humid. Basically, I cannot apply anything greasy at all or I break out. This product is more like a gel serum. If you have very dry skin, I would recommend this and then a cream over. However, it is perfect for me without anything else.</li>
            <li> Watts Beauty Peptide - Hyaluronic Acid Concentrated Serum Complex used twice daily made the skin appear to have less fine lines.</li>
            <li> excelent product super happy very effective</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Am using it with my new microcurrent device, and my skin hasnt looked this good in years :)</li>
            <li> I do my own chemical peels at home and wanted to test the healing process with and without this serum (In other words, it&#x27;s taken a long time before I could write this review) First of all, this stuff is AMAZING at healing a chemical peel! After I initially apply the peel and wash it off, I use this all over my face and cover with Vaseline. As the healing process continues, I switch to putting this on, letting it sink in awhile and then I throw some CeraVe lotion on top. When I&#x27;m almost completely healed, I use this along with some CeraVe SPF50. Mind you, with a TCA peel, this stuff makes the process last only a few days. It takes a lot longer to heal without this awesome serum. I know because I tested it. And second, you just can&#x27;t beat the price of this little miracle in a bottle! I hope they always sell this and with the lovely economy we have, I pray they don&#x27;t raise the price. Great stuff Watts!!!! I will always be loyal to Watts and Amazon as this is where I purchase all of my chemical peels and the little hidden treasures like Watts Serum! &lt;3</li>
            <li> I have used other brands that have been cheaper and loved  - much better then this one.  The pump on this is not great.  I don&#x27;t think this did anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> First - do NOT expect overnight results. Patience is needed in order to see the miracle of this product, but this Watts serum does work. Watts products are wonderful as a general rule, and this is no exception. The downside here is that my sensitive skin did NOT respond as well to this product as I&#x27;d hoped. For those of you who have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, perhaps this product isn&#x27;t for you. I broke out horribly pretty much wherever I used this product. I give it two stars because I have hope it&#x27;ll work for those with normal skin. I purchased this product through a discount program. All views are my own.</li>
            <li> I had to try this product.  I was running out of a Hyaluronic cream &amp; decided to give this a try. I recently purchased a Neutragena Microdermabrasion system also.  In addition I have a Peptide/Ester C Cream I use in the end.  I do this process Every Night.  I make sure that when I rinse the cleansing product off that I use warm-hot water.  I then pat dry quickly &amp; apply the Hyaluronic Acid in a thin film so it soaks in while my pores are still open!  I then wait a few mins. to allow that to soak in &amp; then apply the cream.&lt;br /&gt;It Seems to be tightening up my skin &amp; eliminating fine lines(I&#x27;m 44). I have been at it 10days now&lt;br /&gt;So on that note I can&#x27;t HONESTLY say that just using this product alone will give you the results I&#x27;m experiencing but I DO think I will be ordering the 2oz bottle soon &amp; continue this regimen (better deal too).</li>
            <li> I like this serum a lot.</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed.  I started using this on March 14th and I was suprised to see the stubborn creases on my forehead begin to soften after about a week.  I have used dozens of anti-aging cream and so far the watts beauty peptide seems to work like a charm.  The first time I used it it made my face a little dry but now my skin has seemed to adjust to it. I use it morning and night.  After applying a wait 5-10 minutes and then follow with a moisturizer.  I also noticed that the fine crow&#x27;s feet I had are also begining to fade and the pores on my face seem much smaller now. I do agree with other reviewers that say that the pump doesn&#x27;t work that good.  My pump is some-timey, but I will be ordering again and next time the 2 oz pump instead of the 1 oz.</li>
            <li> Give this some time and you&#x27;ll see subtle improvements.  I put it above my upper lip to help with those vertical wrinkles.  Helps. Must use every day. Very good customer service if you have issues.</li>
            <li> Finally a reasonably priced skin cream</li>
            <li> Nice lotion absorbs really quick. Wish it was a little bigger bottle though doesn&#x27;t last very long. Got there retinol creme and it&#x27;s about double that size.</li>
            <li> you know you have a winner when you apply a product and you can see the difference right away in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Better than most creams at expensive department stores!!! I have seen great results with marked wrinkles around the mouth.</li>
            <li> I find the serum very nice and moist and after applying wait for a few moments and&lt;br /&gt;then add argan oil on top.  I am sure within time it will help to soften lines.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it nothing is a miracle, but every little bit helps.  Try this&lt;br /&gt;and the price is reasonable.  Peptides can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> It is nice, but the size compared to my other bottles of 1 oz. does not measure up. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This feels very nice on my skin and makes it look wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used this after derma rolling with .50mm Derma roller. Using moderate to hard pressure. ( i like to see results fast: impatient lol) It would take me about 1-1.5 days to heal sometimes 2 days with this serum. Would notice my skin tighen up and then shedding of dead skin. I&#x27;m not sure if im a unique case because i&#x27;m also a raw foodest so that could impact my results but W.e. What I do know for a fact is that it would take me 3-4 days to heal up before I could derma roll again without this serum. I also have been using it with fade creams and works just fine.</li>
            <li> my wrinkle line slowly disappear and it doesnt felt heavy and itchy..</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, I notice maybe a slight improvement</li>
            <li> 1st time using Watts.  Purchased due to other reviews. Hope this works</li>
            <li> This has the same ingredients as very expensive serums. And, judging from the compliments and what I can see, it really does make your skin look brighter and firmer. I am a total Watts convert. I use it with Derma e Vitamin A cream. The combination really works for me.</li>
            <li> I have had friends ask if I had botox or work done, nope watts-- the best you will find, I almost don&#x27;t want to leave a review this good as I fear they will raise prices or sell out all the product before I can get more. Thanks guys! A job well done!</li>
            <li> I did not see any significant benefit from this product.  I have from other like products.  I often try other peptide beauty treatments and have found a few that seem to immediately perk up the skin, unfortunately this was not one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because as a professional in the skin care business, our consumer which that&#x27;s me ?  it&#x27;s a great product why say it , to the world..... This product is wonderfull it leaves your face looking healthy , young plumped ... Also a brightting also , I love it , and I will buy more .</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try something so inexpensive, but my face soaks this up in all of about 2 seconds!  Pores are smaller, under eye bags and dark circles are starting to go away, as well as lines.  LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> The Watts Firming Wrinkle Serum has an effective combination of ingredients that make my skin look years younger.  I have jowls and am hoping that in time they’ll smooth out too.  I think I see a difference already after just a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the great reviews and it didn&#x27;t disappoint! I saw improvement in my under eye area after the first use!</li>
            <li> I GIVE IT 5 STARS! WORKS WELL FOR MY DRY SKIN, ABSORBS QUICKLY. I LOVE IT, WILL PROBABLY BUY MORE!</li>
            <li> This product was okay. It showed a small improvement, but it didn&#x27;t produce the result I had expected. It didn&#x27;t work as well as some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried similar to this one.</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with my night time face cream and I can see that it has improved my skin.  I have a scar that is noticeably smaller.  I just started my second bottle of this.  I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> didnt see real omprovements</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a bout a week now.. My husband says my skin looks clearer and more even. Fine lines seem to be diminished a bit. I like the way it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and moisturized. Good value for the price.I received a discount on this in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Love these products from Watts..no smelly perfumes to make me sneeze and/or get rhinitis from..just good ingredients to help my skin.  I am seeing a smoothing effect and my scars are not so noticeable now.  Will order a larger size next time.</li>
            <li> I noticed huge improvements in a matter of days. I will be ordering more of this stuff. I usually buy stuff that promise results and never work. I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t see the deference before and now , my skin is the same way it was before&lt;br /&gt;the Hyaluronic Acid get dry right after applied on my skin I think this product is fear for the price</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Minimized lines. Going to continue to use.</li>
            <li> This serum works just as well as the very expensive brand I&#x27;ve been using.  My skin looks great.  It looks firmer and more glowing, or at least I think it does.  I bought it because a dermatologist recommended another brand with some of the same ingredients, but for a much higher cost.  I did my research and found the Watts Beauty Peptide and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product. It&#x27;s pretty new to me, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it as it really improves my skin.</li>
            <li> Now that I am well into my 40&#x27;s I am always looking for that one product that gets my attention. This product makes a difference!  I am a nurse in a dermatology office and highly recommend this product!  Your getting a quality product for next to nothing. Just try it for a week or two and see if you notice a difference to those fine lines around your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s smooth,  soft and not at all greasy. Perfect for oily skin. Price is right.</li>
            <li> No change is skin, but i like the way it feels</li>
            <li> I think I should give up on finding something for my old face.  I have numerous allergies and very sensitive skin, so sometimes it makes my face itch.  I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but if you have allergies or skin issues be cautious about any product, including soaps and shampoos.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction after using this every day for a week on my (newly forming) \\&quot;jowls\\&quot; was \\&quot;another false claim and worthless product\\&quot;. I kept using it anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did! WOW! A little backstory for you - I&#x27;m late 50&#x27;s and was starting to notice the saggy jowls about a year ago. Over the past winter deep puckered lines formed in the jowls from my jawline up to the smile lines. Recently those pucker lines had started to \\&quot;y\\&quot; to the corners of my mouth. I heard on a Dr. Oz show that this particular facial aging was best corrected with peptides so I bought this product. Now let me tell you the improvement. As of today (I guess it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks - now still using one drop on each jaw, daily) the sagging jowls are barely noticeable along my jaw line, the deep puckered lines are completely gone on the right side. I sleep on my left side so the pucker line on the left isn&#x27;t gone but it&#x27;s not deep or actually &#x27;puckered&#x27; anymore. It&#x27;s just a dent. On both sides that &#x27;y&#x27; that was forming to my mouth is completely gone and I can&#x27;t even tell where they WERE! I&#x27;m so thrilled that I&#x27;ve started using it on other areas that are sagging, like my brow bone skin. This is a real-deal peptide product. Not a phony jazzed up to placate us baby boomers just to take our money. Bravo to WATTS!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It seems like my face just keeps looking younger and younger!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li> Always hard to tell with these skin potions but it seemed fine.</li>
            <li> clogged products are always a pain so i have to take the top off and manually apply it. haven&#x27;t noticed a difference really</li>
            <li> Love how light it is on my skin!!</li>
            <li> love this product and use it morning and night</li>
            <li> I really like this serum but i have to use several times daily. Maybe a stronger compound with longer lasting effects would be more appealing</li>
            <li> It is a very small container; much smaller than other High quality Serums I usually buy. I used it up in less than 2 weeks. To be honest I have not noticed any difference in my skin. In addition, it says 70% (or close) &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;A product to be Organic has to be 100% Organic. I am not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I honestly did see a pinker, and fresher appearance to my skin after 1 week. The bottle easily dispenses just the right amount, and it is easily worn under moisturizer and make up with no noticeable difference in look or feel. Will reorder. BTW I am a 61 year old woman, trying to look as vibrant as possible. This certainly helps!</li>
            <li> I recently received this serum and so far so good. The bottle is small, one oz, that&#x27;s why 4 stars instead of 5. But, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s in a dark bottle &amp; tightly capped so as to not allow it to be deteriorated by light and air. It is odorless and has a nice, spreadable consistency, two pumps cover my entire face and neck. It feels nice &amp; cool on the skin and seems to hydrate well. I&#x27;ve used many serums from many manufacturers, both high &amp; lower end. I like the natural ingredients in this one as well as the fact that it&#x27;s chock full of peptides along with the hyluronic acid. Since I&#x27;ve been using good skin care for several years now, I don&#x27;t expect a huge transformation in my skin, I only hope this serum will help me maintain the results I&#x27;ve achieved with other serums that have similar ingredients. The fact that the price on this serum is very good, the ingredients and positive reviews are why I&#x27;m giving it a try. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> i have not use this personally but have used this on my clients. FROm what i see, in only a few weeks time, i&amp;#34;m impressed&lt;br /&gt;and will no doubt by some more as i ran out of my supply.</li>
            <li> this product works as well as the very pricey skincare products from &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34; online and in dept. stores (who needs the fancy packaging anyway!!!???)........this was a VERY GOOD BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> I really feel this product does not help with dark spots</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this as I&#x27;ve been looking for something to soften lines around my lips and other expression lines. It feels like a very watery oil and I haven&#x27;t seen any immediate effect in using it the last 3 days, as other reviewers have. I&#x27;ll give it a couple more days.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite skin products to use! It really helps to even out my skin. I use it under my moisturizer and wake up feeling softer.</li>
            <li> I read an article that indicated that one of the best wrinkle reducing serums is a mixture of hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. It works better than the $150 serums. Save money and use something that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 4 out of 5 only in that you really need to mix it with Vit C to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found Watts Beauty long ago! This company rocks! This product is amazing as well as others that I have tried so far. The prices are fabulous. I love that I have not had any reaction or breakouts with this product, it goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy. This makes my skin feel  remarkable!</li>
            <li> I got this product at a discount so I could you a honest review. I did not think this would work but I gave it a try. The product is clean and has a gel like feel that is obsorbed in the skin very quickly. It made my skin feel fresh after I put is on and as you can see in the picture my deep four head wrinkles do look better. So I give this product a 5 star rating because it do what it claimed to do an I like the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and actually soaks into your skin! I&#x27;ve been wearing it under my makeup as well and it works as a toner. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like how it tighten/dims wrinkles, yet still keeps moisture in at eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Seems to help the &#x27;crepey&#x27; and sagging skin under my chin and down my neck.  Much less expensive than some name brand products and the results are just as good.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face every night.  It is very smooth in my face and you can see the difference in the part around the eye.  When I started using this, I don&#x27;t anymore experience dryness on my face.</li>
            <li> I ♡♡♡ this Watts Beauty product. Not only does my face feel smooth and tighter, but others have commented on my wrinkles particularly on my forehead being less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So just ordered my second bottle of this. I hade been using La Roche-Posay Redermic and was looking to find a cheaper alternative. This, in combination with a moisturizer, really did the trick. I often get complements from people on my skin--definitely more frequently than I did before I started using the hyaluronic products. I&#x27;m counting down my 50th year, so that&#x27;s pretty nice. Further I really like this product because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells and there are certain skin are products like DMEA that cause huge problems and this product only helps not harms.  However, having ordered my second bottle, I took a knife to the container since you can&#x27;t unscrew this one. I was curious how much was left in the bottom that the little pump couldn&#x27;t get. I&#x27;d estimate perhaps a sixth of the bottle was sitting there. So, count me disappointed in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product again.  After a few weeks of use, my skin feels smoother and does not look so tired in the morning.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the best daytime serum I have ever used.  It  tightens up your skin without having that nasty dried egg white film that so many serums give you.  I wear it under sunscreen and primer and I feel that I look great with it!  Not too oily yet keeps you moisturized.  You may need a little extra something for under the eyes if you like soft eyes, but as an overall daytime serum, this is awesome.  At night I use the Watt&#x27;s retinol serum (used to use ROC exclusively) and I love it.  So, this for day, the retinol serum for night, and add a good moisturizer and sunscreen - you&#x27;re going to look great!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel, tightens it a bit, which is always nice!!!</li>
            <li> Product is always delivered quickly and quality just as good, if not better, than much pricier similar products</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T GET THE SERRUM TO COME OUT.  YOU CAN PRESS THE PLUNGER OVER AND OVER AND IT WILL NOT COME OUT.  I HAVE TO TAKE OFF THE CAP TO USE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT ORDER IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. very dissipointed. I wanted it for under eye trearment for fine lines not satisfied.</li>
            <li> ...and effective.  I like the single-dose pump delivery system.  I use it with the derma-roller &amp; occasionally, on the days in between.  Good for bags &amp; sags and, a little goes a long way.  No frills;  just good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and am absolutely sold!  At almost 40, I&#x27;ve taken very good care of my skin over the years, but was looking for something a little more aggressive to keep fighting the fine lines around my eyes and lips, as well as to even out my skin tone.  I have used other products that have been adequate, but am overwhelmingly pleased that this serum is more than adequate.  This product is wonderful!  I have been getting compliments on my skin all week and love how soft it feels.  It is never too early to prevent and maintain good healthcare habits.  Watts Hyaluronic Serum now has a permanent place in my regimen!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected. Its okay.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to several wonderful women!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin after one bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple weeks. So far I notice that my skin feels fuller on my face.</li>
            <li> I am using this product, can not see in changes in skin tone or texture. Sincerely, Alice</li>
            <li> I love this product, I will return for another purchase. My skin loves it and I don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> This does a good job, but there are better products out there. Strangely enough, most of them have the same ingredients, but prices vary wildly.  I do not understand why something with the same make up should work differently, but I have just had better results with other products.  On the other hand, I have found my husband using this and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Pretty good,  I see a big difference in my turkey neck,  good buy.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I am beginning to see results.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for skin, when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li> I guess I will give this three stars because I just started using it and can&#x27;t really make a true decision until I have been using it longer.</li>
            <li> gentle on the skin, no negative reaction to this product, easy to use, I noticed the wrinkles around my eyes fading away, very happy with this product, I usually have sensitive skin and I had no problems while using this serum. thank you for letting me test your product for little money</li>
            <li> While the directions are extremely small, I&#x27;m happy with the product in general.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing and surely does its job. I could see a difference in my crows feet within minutes. I love this stuff. I recieved a discount to buy and it was worth every penny. I will be a repeat customer, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a family member. They loved it! Says it works great!</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smoothly and I can feel my skin tightening without drying.  My skin feels smoother, tighter and in my opinion,  looks better than before.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, none greasy, none sticky serum. Dries on yours skin in seconds. Just using this Hyaluronic acid serum, my face feels nice refreshed and moist. With some serum you have to apply moisturizer, but with this one I don&#x27;t feel like I have too. But probably I should.  I&#x27;m using this serum about week now and my  face feels and looks  smoother and healthier. I believe it&#x27;s worth to give a try and see if this one is good for your skin. I was sent these for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Well this serum is a great way to start clearing up some imperfections. The texture of my face as GREATLY improved as has the glow. Ive been using this faithfully now and my only issue is that I havent tried this much sooner. My face is smooth and for the price this is amazing! Theres no need to blow your hard earned money on much more expensive serum that does the same thing! Im extremely pleased with the results I have since I started using this!</li>
            <li> Used it for about 6 months. Not convinced it did much, but it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and the ingredients are good.</li>
            <li> i gave it to my mum she said its make her skin softer but not much difference in wrinkle but she just started will see</li>
            <li> I love this product. my face looks younger and more firm. even with a tiny bottle it will late me a long time!</li>
            <li> Only needed a small amount to cover face and neck. Left my skin feeling a little greasy but if I would of used a moisturizer like it recommended that probably would of made that better.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for a few years looking for products that will work well for my skin. I have oily/acne-prone skin that can be sensitive to new products. Since I am approaching my thirties, I want to find products that will not only help my skin now, but will help keep it healthy and clear in the future. A few months ago, I came across Watts Beauty. I must say, this company is a lifesaver! I have a few of their products now, and all of them work well on my skin. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to any of their products. As a matter of fact, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this healthy and clear in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried a collagen booster before, so I thought I would give this a try! This Peptide firming wrinkle serum works wonders on my skin! I apply it after my cleanser and toner in the morning and at night. The serum seeps into your skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now, and I definitely see a huge difference. My skin feels firmer and so smooth, especially in the morning! I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne scars aren&#x27;t as visible now. My pores (especially around my nose) have also gotten a lot smaller. I feel like my skin is glowing, and that makes me so happy! I love that it comes with a pump. It makes it so much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. And my honest review is that this serum is a must-have! You definitely need to add this collagen booster to your skin routine!</li>
            <li> I have several fine lines on my forehead from the several &amp;#34;faces&amp;#34; I make daily and wanted to try something that would &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; these lines. I have been using this product for about a week and a half now and have noticed a little difference in the appearance of these lines. I can&#x27;t wait to see the extended results after several weeks of use. It feels very soothing on the skin and sinks in fast. Making this part of my daily regimen for a while and will update in a month or so. Would recommend this product to my friends and family</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Got this for my wife and it&#x27;s not her favorite.  She thinks she might stick with her regular wrinkle cream.  Thank you though.</li>
            <li> I used a name brand Peptide Firming Serum I got from Sephora and loved it... but when I ran out and had a coupon code for Watts, I decided to try it. Let me tell you--I have been wasting my money on that $100/bottle stuff because Watts&#x27; brand works as well or EVEN BETTER. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and starting to see fine lines. I really want to keep those lines at bay but have trouble finding products that don&#x27;t irritate my &#x27;ginger&#x27; skin (I am a natural redhead). This product is non-irritating, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, goes on smoothly, makes me feel beautiful, and within a few days of using it people already remark on how &#x27;beautiful&#x27; my skin is. I say this is a definite beauty must-buy!</li>
            <li> love love love this!!</li>
            <li> I love Watts Beauty serums because they work! I also love they are made with a pump rather than an eye dropper. The pump is much easier to use and is more sanitary. This Peptide Firming serum is a light weight gel. I appreciate that in addition to peptides the serum also contains hyaluronic acid. It is convenient to use just one product instead of two, as I had been doing. The gel feels cooling to my skin. I have even used it in my eye area (not too close) and it was very cooling. The most important aspect is that yes, this serum delivers! My skin is firmer, plumper and smoother!! This is a great product that I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I bought this serum because I have started to see wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. I had done a lot of reading of reviews of this and other products and based on the reviews of Watts Beauty Peptide Firming Wrinkle Serum, I thought this one would be a good one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was correct!!! I have never put any type of lotion, serum, oil,  or anything else that showed changes immediately, but this product did. I was amazed. Blown away!  After putting this on, the wrinkles are not as deep and they are appear plumped up!  My daughter even commented that my skin looks better, and she had no idea I was using something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond being pleased with this product and I KNOW that I made the right choice with this purchase. I would recommend this serum without hesitation,  and I already have, to friends. I bought this at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased evaluation and review, but that in no way shaped how I feel about this stuff.  It is great and I will continue to buy it!</li>
