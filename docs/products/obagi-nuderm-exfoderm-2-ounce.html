            <li>I highly recommend obagi products!!</li>
            <li>Why pay more for the exact same products.</li>
            <li>First I got this  mmmm....</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s too old or originally smell like that</li>
            <li>For this particular product (#4) from this last vendor, I am 99.9% sure it&#x27;s not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I use the Obagi Nu-Derm system and this is Step 4 of a certain Obagi regime.</li>
            <li>After my friend moved out of the area and I was no longer able to get facials from her and buy the products, I tried to substitute department store or drug store products and my skin suffered looking less clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>whole system took all the spots away and changed the texture.</li>
            <li>Find this product works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>Too much of a bother to return to sender.</li>
            <li>This step 4 cream wash very watery.</li>
            <li>My wife is over fifty, yet everyone thinks she is in her thirties, and she attributes much of it</li>
            <li>It really works and you are not wasting you money when you purchase this product.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than the other Obagi brand CREAM or LOTION products.</li>
            <li>I tried another popular dark spot corrector, but didn&#x27;t have nearly the results that I have with this product.  </li>
            <li>and there is such a tremendous difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream for slightly older ladies like me.</li>
            <li>The nu derm exfoderm combined with several other obagi product lines are amazing and would highly recommend this line to anyone and everyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li>Using every other day is also effective if you can&#x27;t tolerate daily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to keep it handy, in case other spots appear.</li>
            <li>I did it because it was cheaper than Kaiser, where I normally buy it.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am using Image Skincare products but some of my spots are coming back (living in FL</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used Obagi for 3 years and this product looks a bit different and isn&#x27;t giving me the same fantastic results.</li>
            <li>By cutting one container in half when I could not longer get any more cream out, I discovered that there was about 2 weeks worth more product yet inside.  </li>

            <li>it can make your skin sensitive.  </li>
            <li>it is old or the cream was made incorrectly.  </li>
            <li>Too much hassle to send back, etc.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised to find a couple &amp;#34;Thank you gifts&amp;#34; included in my Amazon box.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product, because I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in only about 3 weeks of using it once a day on a small area of my face.  </li>
            <li>The price is high and the quantity is low, but in the end it does work.</li>
            <li>I use Obagi and love it, but there was something wrong with this Exfoderm #4, it is very watery and runny.  </li>

            <li>, not sure if this is the original</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other comments that the cream has a funny smell, it&#x27;s runny and it only last me about a month.  </li>
            <li>but I too like some of the previous users question if this is the real product.</li>

            <li> The product  I received, while sealed, was runny and had a strange smell.</li>
            <li> this seems to be a different exfoderm #4 product than i have used before, so i am not sure whether this is a mistake or simply a different product altogether.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product I usually purchase from my local store.</li>
            <li> it is hard to stay out of the sun completely and even</li>
            <li> The Obaji line of products has single handedly improved my skin by smoothing and softening the texture as well as removing the brown blotches and other discoloration.  </li>
            <li> Much of this product line can only be bought through a licensed salon in Texas, so it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> My skin was either too irritated or there was inadequate sloughing off of the dead skin cells and whatever else gets left on your skin.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as I&#x27;ve used in the past...</li>
            <li> It is not the same as what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I agree with other people.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Obaji from Amazon and other mail sources as well as Obaji stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful to wear sun block, but the spots still appeared.  </li>
            <li> My only reason for possibly switching is that I&#x27;m not happy with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I use less makeup and can concentrate on moisturizing and protecting my skin from the elements, with other Obagi products.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for 20 years and while they can&#x27;t totally remove the ageing process they do help slow it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly feel off skin  </li>
            <li> I had run out of Exfoderm and despite using other exfoliants, I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> just little bit&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using obagi products for a little over a year now</li>
            <li> Cleans face and removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> but not strong</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is the right consistency. :(</li>
            <li> After I started using them people were shocked when they learned my real age.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in past and knew the cream was supposed to be firmer in texture.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it Obagi product or not.  </li>
            <li> However, I usually use the &amp;#34;OBAGI Nu-Derm Exfoderm Forte&amp;#34; which is a bit stronger.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually too thick for that.</li>
            <li> it has a bad smell, and no expiration date, I used to buy this product from Kaiser back in the days  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed and may not ever order these products online.</li>
            <li> This item is definitely a FAKE.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong here.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller but they failed to respond to my replacement request.  </li>
            <li> There is definitely something wrong with this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and now I found a place where the price is a bit else&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> As expensive as Obagi is it&#x27;s time the company came up with a container that dispensed all of what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li> smell is bad</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t sting or smell too bad.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t remember smelling bad</li>
            <li> Should be a creamy base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> i couldnt bear the horrible smell - like putting chemicals on your face.</li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell and the cream is chunky.  </li>

            <li> I love Obagi but would love them more if they would omit parabens from their products.  This Nuderm truly&lt;br /&gt;changed the skin on my face. I used to be a sun worshipper and had years of sunspots and some fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;This whole system took all the spots away and changed the texture. I used it for a year and then started reading&lt;br /&gt;about parabens and that they are found in some cancerous tumors (breast, etc) in women that use products&lt;br /&gt;laden with it. Parabens are man made in a lab preservatives that we use found in our shampoos, bubble baths,&lt;br /&gt;body lotion, makeup and even food. Some say that children that use products with it in it have premature pubic&lt;br /&gt;hair and even breast growth!!!  Also it is known that it can raise estrogen levels!  I quit using Obagi except for their newest one called Hydrate. Ironically their brand new product out in Nov 2012 is &amp;#34;paraben free&amp;#34; YAY!! Maybe they are catching onto this and are going to reformulate their entire line. Right now I am using Image Skincare products but some of my spots are coming back (living in FL it is hard to stay out of the sun completely and even tho I use SPF 30 every day it still happens) so I will go back to&lt;br /&gt;Obagi after they reformulate (I hope they do!!!).</li>
            <li> If it looks too good to be true, then it probably is!  This item is definitely a FAKE.</li>
            <li> Great products!! My skin feel great!!</li>
            <li> Product seems to be &amp;#34;to liquid&amp;#34;.  Should be a creamy base.  I think the product sat of the shelf for a long time.</li>
            <li> i couldnt bear the horrible smell - like putting chemicals on your face. this seems to be a different exfoderm #4 product than i have used before, so i am not sure whether this is a mistake or simply a different product altogether. i&#x27;d never recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi products for 10 years now and I love them. It is so nice to be able to get them at an affordable price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Find this product works very well on my skin. I would highly recommend this product a must for everyday care.</li>
            <li> The product  I received, while sealed, was runny and had a strange smell. I had purchased this product in past and knew the cream was supposed to be firmer in texture. Too much of a bother to return to sender.</li>
            <li> was excited to get this at discount price but I too like some of the previous users question if this is the real product. This product doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as I&#x27;ve used in the past...wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I got it as advertised.</li>
            <li> Just perfect.  Used Obagi for years and this replaces my step 4 just like the ones i get at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi products for YEARS! I love what it does for my skin. This is a great price!I first purchased products from a plastic surgeon, so I was told which ones were best for me, and also taught how to apply.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m not getting exfoliation not sure if it&#x27;s original product</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi Nu-Derm for over a year. This is the first time I have received any Nu-Derm product that not only doesn&#x27;t smell like the past orders of Exfoderm, it also does not have the same consistency. Something is wrong here.</li>
            <li> I love obagi products! I deffinitly think if you have any dark spots, melasma or hyperpigmentation, the best! Contains 4% hydroquine, a very powerful lightning agent. I highly recommend obagi products!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and it is absolutely one the best when used in combination with this skin care program. It gently exfoliates and refines the skin beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love Obagi products and can get it here so much cheaper.  Why pay more for the exact same products.</li>
            <li> I use this cream twice a day after I wash my face. I noticed a collection of milia or whiteheads from the inner eye corners, along nose and all the way to sides of mouth. Also found on my chest. So, went hunting for an exfoliant cleanser. I am pleased that it really works!  Has already rid my chest of milia and decreasing mila on face. I highly recommend this cream for slightly older ladies like me. But, I think it will work for younger folks, too.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this item. I have been using this product for about three years. This step 4 cream wash very watery. It is not the same as what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The price is high and the quantity is low, but in the end it does work. I&#x27;d suggest purchasing through Amazon than elsewhere because of the cost and availability.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Obagi products so i cannot attest whether or not this product is authentic; all i know is the product seems to be working for my skin. This exfoderm is helping clear my skin in combination with a retinol cream. The item came on time.</li>
            <li> Obagi is awesome.  This product makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and just as advertised!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it Obagi product or not.  Kind of clumpy.</li>
            <li> My wife is over fifty, yet everyone thinks she is in her thirties, and she attributes much of it tot he Obagi line of products.  Much of this product line can only be bought through a licensed salon in Texas, so it is expensive.  SOme of product is supposedly &amp;#34;illegal&amp;#34; to sell in Texas, so being able to get it at all and then at a discount online is a blessing.</li>
            <li> I like all the products that I purchased.</li>
            <li> been using it for 15years. It really works and you are not wasting you money when you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I rated this product as 5 star because I love Obagi products.  It really works.  It is a great skin product line and affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi for years. This is the very first time when I shook the bottle I could hear the liquid inside. It&#x27;s usually too thick for that. And that concerns me.</li>
            <li> the Obagi products are the best.  I have been using them for 20 years and while they can&#x27;t totally remove the ageing process they do help slow it.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliating products on the market.  Must wear sunscreen and best when used with blender/Retin A.  Use with caution in the beginning it can make your skin sensitive.  Using every other day is also effective if you can&#x27;t tolerate daily.  I have been using it for years and my skin looks great at 58.</li>
            <li> Out dated did not work properly!:(</li>
            <li> so thrilled to be able to buy at this price!  About 1/2 what I&#x27;ve been paying my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> This was a great price on a  very god product. I have used Obagi products for years even though they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get very good prices on Obagi products using Amazon every time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, J.Piro</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is the right consistency. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this product, which I have used before and love, but this one was old.  It has a horrible smell and the cream is chunky.  I contacted the seller but they failed to respond to my replacement request.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use Obagi and love it, but there was something wrong with this Exfoderm #4, it is very watery and runny.  Took it to my dermatologist and she told me to throw it out, weather it is old or the cream was made incorrectly.  Too much hassle to send back, etc.</li>
            <li> Great Obagi product.  I was resuppling my different Obagi products.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She loves it... so I guess is good ;)</li>
            <li> This definitely is a great product!  It exfoliates your skin in a kind way so you can use this daily.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Obagi products. I was introduced to them by a friend who was a skin specialist. After I started using them people were shocked when they learned my real age. Using the products took ten to fifteen years off my face. After my friend moved out of the area and I was no longer able to get facials from her and buy the products, I tried to substitute department store or drug store products and my skin suffered looking less clear and smooth. I finally started buying the products through Amazon. I had run out of Exfoderm and despite using other exfoliants, I was not satisfied. My skin was either too irritated or there was inadequate sloughing off of the dead skin cells and whatever else gets left on your skin. Soon my skin smoothed out again and looked brighter. I use less makeup and can concentrate on moisturizing and protecting my skin from the elements, with other Obagi products.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Fast and friendly. I will continue to purchase products from this retailer. I was happily surprised to find a couple &amp;#34;Thank you gifts&amp;#34; included in my Amazon box. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I purchase Exfoderm for the fist time through Amazon.  I did it because it was cheaper than Kaiser, where I normally buy it.  I agree with some of the other comments that the cream has a funny smell, it&#x27;s runny and it only last me about a month.  There is definitely something wrong with this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I agree with other people. This is not the same product I usually purchase from my local store. The texture is completely different. It smells different. I don&#x27;t know if its expired or not obagi nu-derm exfoderm. I am a little disappointed and may not ever order these products online.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and now I found a place where the price is a bit else&#x27;s expensive.  This product does a good job of exfoliating when used with steps 1-3 of  the Nu-derm Obagi treatment.</li>
            <li> First I got this  mmmm....&lt;br /&gt;I smell is bad it&#x27;s like rotten something  but not strong just little bit&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s too old or originally smell like that&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s slightly feel off skin  that&#x27;s I like.</li>
            <li> thankful they carry this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi for years with very good results. While I no longer use Step 3 I find Step 4 very helpful. My only reason for possibly switching is that I&#x27;m not happy with the packaging.  By cutting one container in half when I could not longer get any more cream out, I discovered that there was about 2 weeks worth more product yet inside.  As expensive as Obagi is it&#x27;s time the company came up with a container that dispensed all of what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi products for years now.  My dermatologist office used these products on me for a facial and I have been using them ever since.</li>
            <li> Am a dedicated fan to Obagi products and have been using for 5years.  My dermatologist discontinued the line, so I attempted to get them online.  It&#x27;s been hit/miss.  For this particular product (#4) from this last vendor, I am 99.9% sure it&#x27;s not the real deal.  Consistency and smell are different even though packaging looks identical.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using obagi products for a little over a year now and there is such a tremendous difference in my skin.  The nu derm exfoderm combined with several other obagi product lines are amazing and would highly recommend this line to anyone and everyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product, because I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in only about 3 weeks of using it once a day on a small area of my face.  I have very fair skin and have a couple of &amp;#34;sun spots,&amp;#34; that appeared this summer.  I&#x27;m very careful to wear sun block, but the spots still appeared.  I tried another popular dark spot corrector, but didn&#x27;t have nearly the results that I have with this product.  It also doesn&#x27;t sting or smell too bad.  I&#x27;m definitely going to keep it handy, in case other spots appear.</li>
            <li> Cleans face and removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this product it has a bad smell, and no expiration date, I used to buy this product from Kaiser back in the days  and I don&#x27;t remember smelling bad, not sure if this is the original</li>
            <li> I use the Obagi Nu-Derm system and this is Step 4 of a certain Obagi regime. However, I usually use the &amp;#34;OBAGI Nu-Derm Exfoderm Forte&amp;#34; which is a bit stronger.  This regular step 4 is the gentler version and I found it to be more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than the other Obagi brand CREAM or LOTION products. The consistency is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi for 3 years and this product looks a bit different and isn&#x27;t giving me the same fantastic results. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real thing. Will never purchase from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> The Obaji line of products has single handedly improved my skin by smoothing and softening the texture as well as removing the brown blotches and other discoloration.  I couldn&#x27;t be a bigger fan.  After three years I still use the stuff taking breaks as recommended.  I have purchased Obaji from Amazon and other mail sources as well as Obaji stores.</li>
            <li> Dermotologist recommended, but charged me a fortune for it. Love the cream and now don&#x27;t feel guilty about paying for it. Came right away!</li>
