            <li>This color took beautifully -</li>
            <li>I used this on my tween/teen daughters, and the color turned out great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great fix for in-between times.</li>
            <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s a great semi-permanent option.</li>
            <li>Great Bright Vibrate Color.</li>

            <li>It smelled good and did not ruin any clothes, towels, shower tiles, or pillow cases.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a good 4 weeks to start to look faded.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good experiences with all the Jerome Russell dye I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>GOOD.</li>

            <li>AMAZING STUFF</li>
            <li>It def had a nice grape smell tho.</li>
            <li>When it fades, it fades nicely.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too..</li>
            <li>Punky Colour really is the best.</li>
            <li>love this colour and its not as neon as it looks but its amazing, the price for this is fabulous and it smells like grapes!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT LOOKED GREAT RIGHT</li>
            <li>Its way better in than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased and hope it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>more of a magenta color than the purple that it looks like it is</li>
            <li>I wish it had more n the container</li>
            <li>Love the color too.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>In love with this brand</li>
            <li>My favorite dye yet.</li>
            <li>Good colour, great lasting power.</li>
            <li>I still enjoyed it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll have to find something a bit more purple</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s what I love about this brand.</li>
            <li>Love these colors</li>
            <li>but this color is more a redish magenta</li>
            <li>i love the color</li>
            <li>its more of a pinky purple</li>
            <li>Jerome Russell Punky Colors is absolutely the BEST vibrant colors out there.</li>
            <li>apparently it has a shelf life of over 15 years - and looked great.</li>
            <li>&quot; I see it as more of a pinky/purple than a true purple.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good as new.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the price and the product are much better than any of the other brightly colored brands (I&#x27;m looking at you, Manic Panic!)</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic and it smells like grape upon opening the jar.</li>
            <li>My hair is a light brown and the colors still show.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer than most similar products, and is superior to Manic Panic even.</li>
            <li>It was more of a pinkish purple, if you are looking for a true purple this color might need to be mixed with another shade of their purples, but it was nice and bright and really lasted quite a while</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d still recommend this brand, as it was easy, didn&#x27;t stink, and worked quickly.</li>
            <li>HAIR MUST BE LIGHT COLOR TO GET FULL AFFECT.</li>
            <li>Any cleaner with bleach will clean it out of your tub or off your counter tops.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, super long-lasting color.</li>
            <li>fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A great purple if you want to fade out pink.</li>
            <li>if you want purple, it&#x27;s actual a really beautiful purple that like all Jerome Punky lasts long and is an amazing buy.</li>
            <li>It smells good too, almost reminiscent of Kool-Aid.  </li>
            <li>If you want super temporary and are okay with a muted version of the expected bright fuchsia hue, and don&#x27;t mind it fading quick, this could be a fun color for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Jerome Russel for many years and every color is true to advertising, stays vibrant for at least 4-5 weeks before fading, and always smells excellent.</li>
            <li>This color turned out a very nice purple and has held its color for much longer than most other dyes she has used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand, it smells great and lasts for a couple of weeks, even if you wash daily.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite hair dye.</li>
            <li>It is super bright with minimal fading</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this color would be one of weaker ones (some Jerome Russell colors wash out very early on), but this one took well and has not washed out right away.  </li>
            <li>:)  Leaves hair soft and shiny and the color lasts for weeks before it starts to gradually fade.  </li>
            <li>brand left my hair soft and the color lasted for a good month without fading.</li>
            <li>I slept with a towel on my pillow the first two nights and some of it kept coming off.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I bought five containers of different purples and pinks to try.</li>
            <li>Either way it is a pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a lovely color</li>
            <li>Even bleached out of my towels pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is way better then manic panic and actually last</li>
            <li>Color doesn&#x27;t fade as fast as the leading competitor!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells fruity, the color is very vibrant, doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillow case,</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very vibrant.</li>
            <li>No running, vibrant colour!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>product overall is fantastic though.</li>
            <li>It smells like grape soda, which a lot of people really like.</li>
            <li>It faded so fast...</li>
            <li>the shipping to me was fast n_n</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>I mixed it with some red and got a really nice color.</li>
            <li>She was so excited and now my parents won&#x27;t let me try a different brand.</li>
            <li>Use white towels for clean up</li>
            <li>Once I start getting lazy and washing it with warm water while I&#x27;m showering it starts to fade</li>
            <li>More of a dark fuscia...</li>
            <li>+, better than any other I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my thorough washing the first time wasn&#x27;t good enough, or if it&#x27;s normal to see the dye coming off in each shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mixed it with violet to make it more blue based</li>
            <li>When it gets to the end of 4 weeks, it fades quickly, which makes me think it&#x27;s not getting deeply into the hair follicle.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair since high school, but I needed a change</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to people.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly washed her hair in the sink after using the dye, so I was surprised that she still had so much washing out in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I just mixed this with midnight blue and it makes the true purple I wanted!</li>
            <li>true colour, lasts a long time, easy to use at home, used another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to mix with 3 parts of hair conditioner then apply, it goes on smoother and uses less dye which makes no difference to the strength of the dye colour that I could tell.  </li>
            <li>Big bonus would be that it makes your hair smell like grape when you first add the color</li>
            <li>I can usually go a month or more before needing to re-dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This has much more of a pink tone to it than expected.</li>
            <li>and I naturally have medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>so you can bleach them, otherwise you will completely kill your colored towels.</li>
            <li>in fact it barely leaks at all!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, the color is vibrant, and works quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts a good two to three weeks of intense color if I shampoo every other day and use cold water.</li>
            <li>It definitely shows up better on lighter hair, though, as my dark-haired daughter&#x27;s hair looked almost black with this (like a raven black color).  </li>
            <li>does not dry your hair!</li>
            <li>This does eventually fade like any other hair dye, but even when it fades I really like the pinkish/purple color it turns in to.</li>
            <li>Even though I left it on my hair for two hours, the color barely took.</li>

            <li> This does eventually fade like any other hair dye, but even when it fades I really like the pinkish/purple color it turns in to.</li>
            <li> Even though I left it on my hair for two hours, the color barely took.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of pink shades and, as others have said, this stuff lasts much longer than Manic Panic or other brands.</li>
            <li> Its long lasting.</li>
            <li> only thing that sucks is that the color washes off too fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this because its specifically for dark hair but it barely came out.</li>
            <li> Color stays in for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, this stuff is thick and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> she uses this stuff all the time, she says it is easy to use and less expensive from amazon.  </li>
            <li> So I used the other half on the same hair but let it sit about 90 minutes.  </li>
            <li> came out pink in my bleached hair</li>
            <li> Minimal fading after weeks.</li>
            <li> but you have to know that purple is going to come out fuchsia dark pink.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as other products either.</li>
            <li> I have relatively oily hair, so I have to wash my hair every day or at least every other day.  </li>

            <li> came out looking a little neon</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it is a little drying, so be prepared to moisturize with heavy conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li> and it doesnt run down my face when i take a shower!</li>
            <li> She has very dark brown hair, and does need to have all the color bleached out periodically.  </li>
            <li> Used on bleached hair, it didn&#x27;t show well, came out splotchy and uneven</li>

            <li> I typically put a small dab in my conditioner as a refresher when it starts to fade</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I was expecting and it doesn&#x27;t smell nasty; furthermore, it&#x27;s cheaper than at the local beauty supply</li>
            <li> but... It barely lasted a couple of ours before it kept washing out like crazy...</li>

            <li> Used on bleached hair, it didn&#x27;t show well, came out splotchy and uneven</li>
            <li> Awsome!!! Great Bright Vibrate Color. Its long lasting. Its way better in than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim because I wanted to ombre my hair without it being permanent in case I didn&#x27;t like it. I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair or anything before and I naturally have medium brown hair. Left it in for 30min and washed with cold water. It didn&#x27;t stain the tub or anything, but it did come off on the towel a lot after I rinsed. I slept with a towel on my pillow the first two nights and some of it kept coming off. The color though was just what I wanted! I&#x27;m really pleased and hope it lasts awhile. My hair still smells like grape a week later though haha.</li>
            <li> more of a magenta color than the purple that it looks like it is</li>
            <li> i have a teenaged granddaughter who is into hair.  she uses this stuff all the time, she says it is easy to use and less expensive from amazon.  it is always ell packaged and received very shortly after ordering.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 star but you have to know that purple is going to come out fuchsia dark pink.  It is super bright with minimal fading and it&#x27;s awesome- if you want that color.  Go to PLUM if you want purple, it&#x27;s actual a really beautiful purple that like all Jerome Punky lasts long and is an amazing buy.</li>
            <li> I used this on my sister and let it sit double the time and it still came out in two washes.  So I used the other half on the same hair but let it sit about 90 minutes.  It came out in a couple washes and left her hair an almost dirty grayish color.  She was so excited and now my parents won&#x27;t let me try a different brand.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this color would be one of weaker ones (some Jerome Russell colors wash out very early on), but this one took well and has not washed out right away.  The perfect purple tone for my hair!</li>
            <li> came out pink in my bleached hair</li>
            <li> I just mixed this with midnight blue and it makes the true purple I wanted! The dye mixes well, smells good and stays in longer than manic panic!</li>
            <li> A great purple if you want to fade out pink. This dye will fade out with co-washes so you can prolong it by mixing some blue dye into it to darken.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair since high school, but I needed a change, so I bleached the ends and used a dye that I bought from Sally&#x27;s (Beyond the Zone). Big mistake! Even though I left it on my hair for two hours, the color barely took. I just looked like I had been swimming in a chlorinated pool. I dug through some boxes and found the remnants of a jar of Punky Colour Purple from what had to have been 1996. I had to do something, so I went ahead and put it on for an hour. It was PERFECT! This color took beautifully - apparently it has a shelf life of over 15 years - and looked great. I was so pleased that I bought five containers of different purples and pinks to try. I highly recommend this brand, it smells great and lasts for a couple of weeks, even if you wash daily. In my opinion, the price and the product are much better than any of the other brightly colored brands (I&#x27;m looking at you, Manic Panic!)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on my hair at all not buying it again</li>
            <li> this color didn&#x27;t stick well to my hair. I mixed it with some red and got a really nice color.</li>
            <li> I bought this because its specifically for dark hair but it barely came out. It def had a nice grape smell tho.</li>
            <li> The color is fantastic and it smells like grape upon opening the jar. It doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as other products either.</li>
            <li> This is awesome I wish it had more n the container</li>
            <li> I already used pinky color before, it&#x27;s the best for me. a lot of people liked my hair with that color!</li>
            <li> I have relatively oily hair, so I have to wash my hair every day or at least every other day.  Even with a heavy washing regiment, this stuff lasted 2 weeks +, better than any other I&#x27;ve tried!  Love the color too.</li>
            <li> I always buy this brand of dye. It lasts longer than most similar products, and is superior to Manic Panic even. I&#x27;ve been using Jerome Russel for many years and every color is true to advertising, stays vibrant for at least 4-5 weeks before fading, and always smells excellent.</li>
            <li> I used this on my tween/teen daughters, and the color turned out great.  It definitely shows up better on lighter hair, though, as my dark-haired daughter&#x27;s hair looked almost black with this (like a raven black color).  It smells good too, almost reminiscent of Kool-Aid.  Overall, the color is vibrant, and works quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is a little drying, so be prepared to moisturize with heavy conditioner afterwards.  As for the washing out process, it seemed to continuously wash out, ever time my daughter washed her hair.  -She&#x27;d complain of having purple tinted water whenever she showered.  I thoroughly washed her hair in the sink after using the dye, so I was surprised that she still had so much washing out in the shower.  I&#x27;m not sure if my thorough washing the first time wasn&#x27;t good enough, or if it&#x27;s normal to see the dye coming off in each shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d still recommend this brand, as it was easy, didn&#x27;t stink, and worked quickly.</li>
            <li> I am still having a hard time with this color being called purple but I think I see it differently on myself because everyone says, \\&quot;I like your purple hair.\\&quot; I see it as more of a pinky/purple than a true purple. Either way it is a pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a good two to three weeks of intense color if I shampoo every other day and use cold water. Once I start getting lazy and washing it with warm water while I&#x27;m showering it starts to fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color doesn&#x27;t stain as bad as some of the other Punky Colour dyes. Any cleaner with bleach will clean it out of your tub or off your counter tops. I do recommend using white pillowcases so you can bleach them if necessary.</li>
            <li> Color stays in for a long time. When it fades, it fades nicely. Big bonus would be that it makes your hair smell like grape when you first add the color</li>
            <li> Such a lovely color I mixed it with violet to make it more blue based came out looking a little neon but I love it</li>
            <li> Love it! The color is exactly what I was expecting and it doesn&#x27;t smell nasty; furthermore, it&#x27;s cheaper than at the local beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that sucks is that the color washes off too fast.</li>
            <li> This colour has been awesome to me! No running, vibrant colour! In love with this brand</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who loves to color her hair many colors! This color turned out a very nice purple and has held its color for much longer than most other dyes she has used.</li>
            <li> My favorite dye yet. Smells awesome. Really thick dye. And bleaching is not neccessary. My hair is a light brown and the colors still show. Minimal fading after weeks.</li>
            <li> If you want super temporary and are okay with a muted version of the expected bright fuchsia hue, and don&#x27;t mind it fading quick, this could be a fun color for you. Yes, I have bleached hair and left it on for three hours... So I am not a novice to expectations regarding unconventional hair colors. It smelled good and did not ruin any clothes, towels, shower tiles, or pillow cases. (Cold water, guys! Always!)</li>
            <li> Best Hair dye I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand left my hair soft and the color lasted for a good month without fading.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter instead of sending her back to the salon for another $200 fix.  She has very dark brown hair, and does need to have all the color bleached out periodically.  This is a great fix for in-between times. It gives such a deep, vibrant color that the roots growing in seem less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a good 4 weeks to start to look faded.  When it gets to the end of 4 weeks, it fades quickly, which makes me think it&#x27;s not getting deeply into the hair follicle.  But for the price, it&#x27;s a great semi-permanent option. Even bleached out of my towels pretty well.  Use white towels for clean up so you can bleach them, otherwise you will completely kill your colored towels.</li>
            <li> Good colour, great lasting power.</li>
            <li> This has much more of a pink tone to it than expected. More of a dark fuscia... I still enjoyed it but I&#x27;ll have to find something a bit more purple, perhaps I&#x27;ll have to try the Violet.&lt;br /&gt;This product overall is fantastic though. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of pink shades and, as others have said, this stuff lasts much longer than Manic Panic or other brands. The smell is nice too.. this one smelled like grapes. :)  Leaves hair soft and shiny and the color lasts for weeks before it starts to gradually fade.  I typically put a small dab in my conditioner as a refresher when it starts to fade and I&#x27;m good as new.</li>
            <li> It was more of a pinkish purple, if you are looking for a true purple this color might need to be mixed with another shade of their purples, but it was nice and bright and really lasted quite a while, that&#x27;s what I love about this brand.</li>
            <li> true colour, lasts a long time, easy to use at home, used another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to mix with 3 parts of hair conditioner then apply, it goes on smoother and uses less dye which makes no difference to the strength of the dye colour that I could tell.  Love these colors</li>
            <li> This stuff is way better then manic panic and actually last but this color is more a redish magenta kinda color so beware of that!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. It smells like grape soda, which a lot of people really like. It&#x27;s just not my thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this stuff is thick and highly pigmented. I slather my bleached hair with this color, throw on a shower cap, and let it sit overnight. Bam! Fantastic, super long-lasting color. I can usually go a month or more before needing to re-dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this stuff over Manic Panic and Beyond the Zone Color Jamz. I&#x27;ve had good experiences with all the Jerome Russell dye I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT LOOKED GREAT RIGHT AFTER I DYED IT....but... It barely lasted a couple of ours before it kept washing out like crazy... It faded so fast... I&#x27;ve had this color on for almost 2 weeks now and it already looks blonde....</li>
            <li> i love the color n the shipping to me was fast n_n</li>
            <li> its more of a pinky purple but I put violet by my roots &amp; use this on the middle to ends. prefer this over manic panic - it smells like grape gum!</li>
            <li> BEST HAIR PRODUCT EVER</li>
            <li> love this colour and its not as neon as it looks but its amazing, the price for this is fabulous and it smells like grapes!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years, I&#x27;ve had it every color of the rainbow and have used  almost every product out there.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fruity, the color is very vibrant, doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillow case, and of course the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to people. And I have!</li>
            <li> HAIR MUST BE LIGHT COLOR TO GET FULL AFFECT. BLEACH HAIR OUT GOOD. I DID MY HAIR TWO SHADES PURPLE N YELLOW. MY HAIR IS DARK SO I HAD TO BLEACH IT OUT N YELLOW TOOK LIKE BLONDE N ONE PURPLE(VIOLET)WAS A REDISH PURPLE KINDA. BUT DONT MATTER I AM JUST PLAYING AROUND WITH COLORS.</li>
            <li> Wonderful color. Best purple I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite hair dye. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for YEARS now and haven&#x27;t found a good purple color that sticks until now. This does eventually fade like any other hair dye, but even when it fades I really like the pinkish/purple color it turns in to.</li>
            <li> Punky Colour really is the best. Hands down.</li>
            <li> The best alternative color product I have used! Color doesn&#x27;t fade as fast as the leading competitor! And it&#x27;s very vibrant. does not dry your hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dye! it stays for WEEKS and it doesnt run down my face when i take a shower! in fact it barely leaks at all!!! AMAZING STUFF</li>
            <li> fun and easy to use. It lasts through several shampoos</li>
            <li> Jerome Russell Punky Colors is absolutely the BEST vibrant colors out there. I only have to dye my hair one and it stays in until the next time I have to bleach my roots. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
