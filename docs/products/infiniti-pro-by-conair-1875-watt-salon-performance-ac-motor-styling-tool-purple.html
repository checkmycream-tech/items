            <li>Plus it comes in some great colors!</li>
            <li>The color is awesome.  </li>
            <li>My daughter saw this hair blower in the store and had read good reviews on.  </li>
            <li>...the cool function is great!</li>
            <li>Absolutely gorgeous and very easy to carry, too.  </li>
            <li>Great product, very strong, great quality and useful.  </li>
            <li>Nice size, works well, and has all the features you want and none that you don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good hair dryer</li>
            <li>Dries my hair very easily.</li>
            <li>the condition of my hair is actually better.</li>
            <li>Glad she got it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Love the speed and heat options and the attachments that come with it too.</li>
            <li>She likes this one even better.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I really love the concentration attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered it based on the good reviews, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li>I received this package with two concentrators when I ordered from Amazon, and I just called ConAir to confirm - there is no diffuser attachment available for this product.</li>
            <li>On searching online, I can&#x27;t find any defusers that are supposed to fit this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The Conair Infiniti Pro hair dryer is powerful, easy to handle, and blow dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my wife&#x27;s Bluebird model hair dryer that was destroyed by Super storm Sandy.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The speed is strong, but the heat is warm, not hot.  </li>
            <li>advantage: so powerful, voltage detection.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine hair and it can take a while to dry it and add some volume, but this dryer helps me do both quickly.</li>
            <li>(this just saves me from quickly running a flat iron over the top layer of hair).</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading reviews thinking it was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair dryer, it is better than all I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The good is that it&#x27;s a nice looking dryer, in a fun (purple) color, and it&#x27;s not overly heavy (but not light either).  </li>
            <li>Works fine, but does not blow as hot of air as my last one...</li>
            <li>Very unimpressed with the service.</li>
            <li>but there is a misprint (or very misleading statement) on this product description which reads \\&quot;It</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s important to you, you might want to look for a different dryer and not get this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe that is a new design feature and it doesn&#x27;t need to have that hot of air.</li>
            <li>I  have long hair that needs super hot air to get the frizzies out.  </li>
            <li>The noise is better than my previous dryer.  </li>
            <li>My old universal Conair defuser doesn&#x27;t fit on this one either.</li>
            <li>and so I cannot put both of the controls on high</li>
            <li>If I want to be lazy and not take the time to round brush my hair, I don&#x27;t get the extra frizz which is awesome</li>
            <li>This dryer is just fine; my only wish was for it to blow out a bit harder, which then I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It works fast and it also tames my frizzy hair more than other hair dryers I have previously used.</li>
            <li>but so far, She loves it.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t suffer much from frizz, but I noticed a big difference with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Drys hair well, and has loads of power, but for some odd reason, it seems to take more time to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was I real decision paralysis, but my other hair dyer (also Conair, but lower quality, that I had for almost 10 years just stopped working on Thanksgiving).</li>
            <li>If you have thin hair, or short hair, it may work better for you.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this after reading reviews thinking it was exactly what I needed.  I  have long hair that needs super hot air to get the frizzies out.  It doesn&#x27;t do that.  The speed is strong, but the heat is warm, not hot.  If you have thin hair, or short hair, it may work better for you.  But it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer, it is better than all I have used in the past. It works fast and it also tames my frizzy hair more than other hair dryers I have previously used. I have to be careful that my hair does not dry out and so I cannot put both of the controls on high (I believe it is speed and heat) or I can feel it dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a different model that broke.  Works fine, but does not blow as hot of air as my last one...Maybe that is a new design feature and it doesn&#x27;t need to have that hot of air.</li>
            <li> Nice size, works well, and has all the features you want and none that you don&#x27;t want.  Plus it comes in some great colors!</li>
            <li> The color is awesome.  The noise is better than my previous dryer.  Drys hair well, and has loads of power, but for some odd reason, it seems to take more time to dry my hair.  I&#x27;d still buy this again.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a french diffuser and it&#x27;s heavy. Not my world, since i don&#x27;t use it.  I got it for my wife.</li>
            <li> Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC is a dream! I was amazed how fast it dried my hair! My hair would always feel dried out after blow drying but after using  the Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC the condition of my hair is actually better. No frizz &amp; so shiny. Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> borrowed the hair dryer from my niece, and I had to get one for myself...  ...the cool function is great!</li>
            <li> I received the infinity conair blow dryer on April 1st, I used the product several times then it just stopped working.  It did not burn up it just stopped working.  Very unimpressed with the service.</li>
            <li> My daughter saw this hair blower in the store and had read good reviews on.  She loves the purple color!  Glad she got it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> advantage: so powerful, voltage detection. the price is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;disadvantage: it can&#x27;t be shrinked and it&#x27;s inconvenient for carrying, too heavy.</li>
            <li> Great product, very strong, great quality and useful.  Absolutely gorgeous and very easy to carry, too.  Dries my hair very easily.</li>
            <li> This dryer is just fine; my only wish was for it to blow out a bit harder, which then I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works well with my fine and thin hair -- other crappier tools tend to dry my hair frizzy. Love the speed and heat options and the attachments that come with it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good hair dryer but there is a misprint (or very misleading statement) on this product description which reads \\&quot;It includes a concentrator attachment and bonus diffuser attachment\\&quot;. This hair dryer comes with TWO CONCENTRATORS (not 1 concentrator and 1 diffuser). I received this package with two concentrators when I ordered from Amazon, and I just called ConAir to confirm - there is no diffuser attachment available for this product.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my wife&#x27;s Bluebird model hair dryer that was destroyed by Super storm Sandy. She likes this one even better. My wife has long, very thick hair. We only have it 2 months so fer, but so far, She loves it.</li>
            <li> I returned this blow dryer.  The good is that it&#x27;s a nice looking dryer, in a fun (purple) color, and it&#x27;s not overly heavy (but not light either).  The bad is that it made my hair frizzy, dried out and unmanageable.  I ordered it based on the good reviews, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  It dries my hair very quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and soft.  I have a lot of very fine hair and it can take a while to dry it and add some volume, but this dryer helps me do both quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I read a ton of reviews before purchasing, watched some of the videos for this and other hair dryers. I was I real decision paralysis, but my other hair dyer (also Conair, but lower quality, that I had for almost 10 years just stopped working on Thanksgiving). I finally decided on this one. LOVE IT. I have wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t suffer much from frizz, but I noticed a big difference with this hair dryer. If I want to be lazy and not take the time to round brush my hair, I don&#x27;t get the extra frizz which is awesome (this just saves me from quickly running a flat iron over the top layer of hair). I really love the concentration attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only sad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a defuser (as others have noted) just two concentration nozzle. My old universal Conair defuser doesn&#x27;t fit on this one either. On searching online, I can&#x27;t find any defusers that are supposed to fit this hair dryer. If that&#x27;s important to you, you might want to look for a different dryer and not get this one.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro hair dryer is powerful, easy to handle, and blow dries hair very quickly. It is much better than the expensive drier I purchased at a salon supply store.</li>
