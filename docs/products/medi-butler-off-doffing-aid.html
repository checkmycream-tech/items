            <li>I started to experiment with this tool to remove my Jobst knee high support hose and found it to be very efficient.  </li>
            <li>I could do it by hand, peeling them down to the ankle, then working them gradually over the heel (rubber gloves, the dishwashing kind, give enough grip on the stocking to make this work), then pulling them off the foot.</li>

            <li>I then slip the &amp;#34;shoehorn&amp;#34; under the edge of the top at the back of my leg and set my heel firmly on the floor with the ball of the foot elevated to streamline the heel while I push down on the handle with one hand.</li>

            <li> The product works better than I expected.  For several years I have been unable to wear socks because due to hip problems I can&#x27;t reach my feet.  I also would like to wear support socks due to circulation problems.  I purchased an aid to help with getting support hose on, and it works fine, but then I couldn&#x27;t get them off.  I had tried a long shoehorn, but it wasn&#x27;t sturdy enough.  The Mediven Butler Off finally allows me to easily remove the socks as I tried to do with the shoehorn.  It works just as described and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> It is a great help in removing the stockings.  It does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Since my (Mediven) compression stockings are 30-40 Hg rated, which is the maximum compression available, and are thigh high, I found it hard to take them off. I could do it by hand, peeling them down to the ankle, then working them gradually over the heel (rubber gloves, the dishwashing kind, give enough grip on the stocking to make this work), then pulling them off the foot. I hoped the Butler Off would make this easier, and it does make it a little easier. I still have to peel them down to the ankle; the shoe-horn part of the device then levers the stocking over the heel. I find that using the device to actually push the rest of the stocking off the foot can be very difficult, so I usually just put down the Butler Off and pull _hard_ on the stocking with both hands to get it off the foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Butler, on the other hand (or the equivalent Jobst Stocking Donner, which is the one I got) is indispensable for me to get the stockings on. My husband, with stronger hands than mine, had a lot of trouble, but with the Donner (or the Butler), I can do it all myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I&#x27;m at it... the Mediven 2-in-1 looks to me to be quite useless. It appears to be just a long strip of plastic that makes your leg more slippery but doesn&#x27;t stretch the stocking at all, which is the hard part; putting talcum powder on your leg works quite as well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful idea and worked for my 86 year old mother for a time, until she got new stockings that are much tighter (perhaps they will loosen up little). She says that now it hurts her heel when trying to remove her stockings using this device. It was great with her old stockings, but that may be because they were loosening up with age. She did say that when the device worked, it was very good, but sometimes her stockings would \\&quot;shoot across the room\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This doffer is a very important part of using compression stockings.  For those of us who know what that means, you know what it means.  And the quality of this doffer is excellent.  I&#x27;s very easy to use, and very sturdy.  I am 100% happy with this product and the process for obtaining it.</li>
            <li> Taking off compression stockings is easier with this tool.  Saves my hands from pain.</li>
            <li> I am very fat and this doffer makes removing compression hose easy for me to take off.</li>
            <li> In anticipation of my upcoming shoulder surgery when I expect to have one arm incapacitated for weeks, I ordered this overpriced device along with the Jobst Stocking Donner. (See my review of the latter at that listing.) I had been using two hands and some grunting for years to get my heavy  Jobst 30-40 Athletic socks (which I wear daily) on and off. I hope to be able to do that with one hand post-op. After practicing with these two devices for over two weeks I do believe that I can get the socks off one-handed with this device - but not nearly a easily as the female model does with the thin stockings in the demo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While sitting I have to first fold the stocking top down over my heel to the ball of my foot before using this special device. This leaves about four inches of the top above the heel. I then slip the &amp;#34;shoehorn&amp;#34; under the edge of the top at the back of my leg and set my heel firmly on the floor with the ball of the foot elevated to streamline the heel while I push down on the handle with one hand. When the shoehorn reaches the bottom of the heel I raise the heel and place the ball of the foot on the floor while I pry downward with the handle to make the stocking top slip around the heel. Then I raise the whole foot off the floor and the stocking slides past the toes and rests on the shoehorn. I think this device with its pink handles was designed with womens&#x27; stockings in mind, as featured in the demo. However, I think it will serve my purpose with some effort.</li>
            <li> Rolls my pressure socks into a painful band half way down my leg. I do better taking them (socks) off with an 88cent pair of rubber gloves. I won&#x27;t return mas the shipping charges makes the item more that the cost of it.</li>
            <li> It works &amp;#34;O.K&amp;#34; on my non-swollen right foot &amp; leg, but the reason I have to wear compression hose is my swollen Left Leg. I can Very carefully work&lt;br /&gt;the sock down to the ankle, but no further. At that point, my wife must woirk it down off my foot. I&#x27;ve tried various approaches - none work. Very Dis-&lt;br /&gt;appointing!. R.S. Broderick</li>
            <li> Simple easy to use product that performs task very quick.  I&#x27;m a 66 year old female 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; in height and right handed.  Could remove support stocking on left foot but struggled with right foot. After finding this tool on internet search (not referenced by a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;) able to remove stocking in seconds.  Wish I had found this tool when I first started wearing support stockings.  Supplier please pass word to professionals.  Will take this tool when I travel but may have to fuss with customs.  Would be nice to print on tool somewhere its&#x27; function so I don&#x27;t have to explain to those on educated in this device.</li>
            <li> Great easy product for taking off compression hose. This was a replacement. Sp glad to have found it...love the way they work.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to. The really tight compression stockings that I almost got a hernia pulling off, just slide right off with the &amp;#34;Butler Off&amp;#34;. I absolutely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Mediven Butler Off as a shoe horn not realizing it was designed for removing support hose.  I started to experiment with this tool to remove my Jobst knee high support hose and found it to be very efficient.  I push the hose down my calf and over my heel.  Then I use my cane to clamp the toe of the hose to the floor so I can pull my foot from the hose the rest of the way.  This device works very well for me.  It is sturdy and  light weight.</li>
            <li> What a great invention. My mother uses this to help take her support stockings off and also for putting her shoes on. She says she doesn&#x27;t know what she would do without it!</li>
            <li> The person I purchased this product for is recovering from Hip surgery.  Unfortunately she is not allowed bend over far enough to use this product.  She is 5&#x27; 10\\&quot;; tall and it appears that this product is for much shorter people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than sending back this product I was able to lengthen the shaft, and now the product works well.  I would not recommend anyone without a mechanical background attempting to modify this device, my modification actually made the tool stronger and more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the manufacture will read this and sell longer lengths, and ask a persons height before ordering.</li>
            <li> Makes putting support stocking on, a one (1) person operation.  I even carry it when I travel.</li>
            <li> It does the job. A bit awkward and can hurt a little if it gets in a bind while going over the heel.  I know the plastic must be firm, but couldn&#x27;t it have just a little tiny bit of flex. That said. I am very happy to be able to remove stockings easier.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says on the box and the more you use it the easier it gets. I would recommend this to anyone who has a problem taking off socks or support hose.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to learn how to use this tool properly, but it is very helpful.  It saves my wife a lot of work removing my heavy duty compression hose.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear my sup hose without this tool. I use it to remove the socks, Also use it when donning the socks to push them a little down in order to pull them up properly.</li>
            <li> the ted hose devices are easy to use and do a great job came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> My legs can not take the pain this item  creates when I am trying to get my stocking off my legs.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tool to remove compression stockings. Have tried other tools and they did not do the job and were cumbersome. I was happy to find Mediven Butler Doffing item.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and is quite helpful. I think the portion that fits on the heel, like a shoe horn, would make it easier to use were it wider.</li>
            <li> I just started to use compression hose and they have been a real pain to get off.  These help a lot.</li>
            <li> I have broken 2 of these in the same area each time. Mine seem to break in the heal/elbow area at the bottom. Wish they would correct this design. Update I broke #3 there is something wrong with this design for me. I&#x27;m going to look at a different Butler Off.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
