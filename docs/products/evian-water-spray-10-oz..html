            <li>ITS AN AMAZING PRODUCT I WOULD BUY 5000000</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>The Evian Water Spray produces a very light, odorless, refreshing mist.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i was told this product was way better</li>
            <li>but it is just water in a can nothing more</li>
            <li>Much more convenient.</li>
            <li>Always love this product.</li>
            <li>Came with some free lotion samples, too!  </li>
            <li>I receive many compliments on my skin, even when I visit cosmetic counters...</li>
            <li>Such a great refresher that leaves the skin youthfully dewy!!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS WATER -</li>
            <li>Refreshing to spray and use as a toner.  </li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing!</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>is the best alternative for an air conditioner that I can find (along with a standard fan).&lt;br /&gt;It also sets powder makeup very well.  </li>
            <li>i was so excited when i got this</li>
            <li>Now that summer is in full swing, I pack these in our cooler for an extra-refreshing misting at his games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cool mist feels so good on my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>My friends and family don&#x27;t understand facial spray and to be honest, I don&#x27;t either, but this stuff is so refreshing and sets makeup really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Evian also makes a small one that&#x27;s great for freshening up after a flight.</li>
            <li>Just hot this today and just lovej</li>
            <li>I use it every morning to set my make-up and also take it to the beach on a hot day.</li>
            <li>I think it comes out as more of a mist in the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>It is such a refreshing way to start the day.  </li>
            <li>and I am wide awake, feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>WATERY HAHA</li>
            <li>I live where it&#x27;s hot, so</li>
            <li>(the mist is so light that, particularly if you spray while holding it further from your face, it won&#x27;t disturb your makeup).</li>
            <li>I really recommend buying multiple travel sizes if possible.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to find this product in a few department stores but cannot any longer; thus I buy it here and will always use the spray for hydration on my would-be dry facial skin.</li>
            <li>it really cools you down</li>

            <li> Refrigerate, keep it on ice and bring it to the beach.  it really cools you down</li>
            <li> Just hot this today and just lovej</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it every morning to set my make-up and also take it to the beach on a hot day.</li>
            <li> Great hydration! Cool and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I work at night, get tired during the wee hours of the morning, couple sprays from the Evain and I am wide awake, feels so refreshing. The cool mist feels so good on my dry eyes. Love it!</li>
            <li> My friends and family don&#x27;t understand facial spray and to be honest, I don&#x27;t either, but this stuff is so refreshing and sets makeup really well.</li>
            <li> i was told this product was way better i was so excited when i got this but it is just water in a can nothing more</li>
            <li> The Evian Water Spray produces a very light, odorless, refreshing mist. I always take one to my son&#x27;s baseball games and keep one in my purse for any-time use (the mist is so light that, particularly if you spray while holding it further from your face, it won&#x27;t disturb your makeup). Now that summer is in full swing, I pack these in our cooler for an extra-refreshing misting at his games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Evian also makes a small one that&#x27;s great for freshening up after a flight.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the smaller sizes even if you&#x27;re using at home. I think it comes out as more of a mist in the smaller bottles. I really recommend buying multiple travel sizes if possible. Much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much I bought a few of the smaller sizes to put in my purse</li>
            <li> It is such a refreshing way to start the day.  Whether or not your wear make-up or are male or female, this is a terrific part of your morning hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> Item packaged well and shipped promptly. Item undamaged and as described.</li>
            <li> Pretty good! I love it!</li>
            <li> Always love this product. Great for freshening up skin/make-up. Cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it arrived on time and I am very happy with my purchase!  Came with some free lotion samples, too!  Sweet! :o)  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I can no longer buy this at CVS or Sephora but...&lt;br /&gt;This is the best alternative for an air conditioner that I can find (along with a standard fan).&lt;br /&gt;It also sets powder makeup very well.  Long wear that lasts through a double shift!</li>
            <li> This says it all...I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1980.  I receive many compliments on my skin, even when I visit cosmetic counters...this is my secret.</li>
            <li> I have used Evian Water Spray for years to set mineral or powder makeup, for which it does a most excellent job. Used to be able to find this product in a few department stores but cannot any longer; thus I buy it here and will always use the spray for hydration on my would-be dry facial skin. Wonderful product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a cruise to Bermuda...it was so perfect.  Used it multiple times daily while laying out on the deck of the cruise and used it on shore while exploring Bermuda.  Such a great refresher that leaves the skin youthfully dewy!!</li>
            <li> Arrived in tact. No dented cans. All units spray. This stuff is great. Try it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS WATER - Cannot ever be without it.  I have them jotted all over my house and the travel size in my purse.  I live where it&#x27;s hot, so having one in my fridge is a great refresher throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also good for &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; make-up.  Tightens skin too.</li>
            <li> Know of this product so had no problem buying with my eyes closed!  Great value, too.  Refreshing to spray and use as a toner.  I hear make up artists use this as well for their make up clients.  Once again, great product!</li>
            <li> EVEN THOUGH THIS IS JUST WATER IN A BOTTLE IM OBSESSED WITH IT! WHEN I SPRAY IT EVERY MORNING IT WAKES ME UP AND I FEEL SO LIKE WATERY HAHA ITS AN AMAZING PRODUCT I WOULD BUY 5000000 IF I COULD! AND A GREAT PRICE FOR THIS!</li>
            <li> I know it might be just water, but I love it!  So refreshing after a sun bath!  And now my husband loves using it after shaving too!</li>
