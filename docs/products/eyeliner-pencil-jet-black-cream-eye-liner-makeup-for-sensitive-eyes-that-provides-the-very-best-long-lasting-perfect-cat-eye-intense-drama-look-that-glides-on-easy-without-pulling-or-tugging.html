            <li>This eyeliner is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this eye liner because of my eyes reactions to the others, but it goes on nicely</li>
            <li>Product provided in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I just trim it with a Q tip for a thinner line (my preferance) and it looks nice and lasts all day into evening.</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>It smudges nicely if you&#x27;re going for a smokey eye.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner pencil works great with no &#x27;bad stuff ingredients&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It glides on very easily.</li>
            <li>The very best part is that it is all natural and organic.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and the customer service.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great natural eyeliner</li>
            <li>Not only does this liner not contain chemicals, it has good for you ingredients in it!</li>
            <li>Then, while it was relatively easy to put on, I did experience some discomfort...felt like eye fatigue.  </li>
            <li>Plus does not smudge easily, and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to sharpen the pencil and the tip won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner pencil is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to blend and soften.</li>
            <li>We both are trying to be more conscious of what we put in and on our bodies, so choosing a vegan eyeliner like this one was a good choice.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it needs it; so I can&#x27;t comment on that question as accurately as should be.  </li>
            <li>Now I wonder if the 5 stars came as a result of the free sample rather than the effectiveness of the product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe in the future Shimarz will make it self-sharpening, which would be a great bonus.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lasts all day unless of course you are rubbing your eyes, etc.  </li>
            <li>smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>It does smudge if you&#x27;re looking for a good blendable liner that&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>But overall a good buy</li>
            <li>But it sure is pure black it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any irritation and most importantly its really soft.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>Love the natural makeup, thank you!</li>
            <li>Great eyeliner, it&#x27;s a little lighter than expected but great that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and does not drag on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Good color, no irritation, very sharp point.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge when it gets too hot out.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more Shimiraz products in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, but for me it was not as outstanding as the other ladies found it.</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find a good gluten free eyeliner</li>
            <li>I have tried two other products by Shimarz and so far I have just loved them.</li>
            <li>Also, you can create a winged eyeliner or a more dramatic look with ease because the pencil sits nicely in your hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a whole year without.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>You can glide it gently to get a lighter shade as well.</li>
            <li>This product really delivers what it advertises.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals, no sulfates, gluten free, vegan, and has nourishing and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and if I wear normal eyeliner it really messes with my eyes</li>
            <li>It was dry and did not apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>Need to press on it a little more than I would like.</li>
            <li>I personally would prefer not such a sharp point and a little softer, but it is easy to apply and looks great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a really strong black</li>
            <li>The pencil substance itself is dry enough that I suspect a light dabbing of powder beneath the lower lid would contain any smearing that might occur.  </li>
            <li>However, what I am most concerned about is that on at least two of the five-star reviews, the reviewer stated that a sample was provided.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>This is an all natural eye liner that does not irritate your eyes since it has no toxins or chemicals in its ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner especially because it doesn&#x27;t contain any toxins.  </li>
            <li>You do have to press a little more or go over a little more to get it black.</li>
            <li>I really liked the liquid eyeliner as it is dramatic.  </li>
            <li>I expected to have to go over many times to get a dark line</li>
            <li>As far as how often I had to reapply it in one day, I generally don&#x27;t touch up my eye makeup unless I&#x27;m going out in the evening</li>
            <li>I did like the product, but if you want a more dramatic look, I would recommend using the eyepencil in conjunction with the liquid eyeliner that Shimarz offers.  </li>
            <li>The color is bland, more like charcoal rather than black.</li>
            <li>Next I am going to see if this brand offers eye shadow and mascara.  </li>
            <li>I guess I just read so many of the ads that I got confused.  </li>
            <li>and I have a few other brands that do not come off as easily.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it to line the upper lids.  </li>
            <li>The color payoff is fabulous, very dark black.</li>

            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am able to put on a very small or very thick line.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as dark as I like it and took several coats of it to get it to apply.</li>
            <li> The pencil gives a really dark pure black shade if you press it firmly.</li>
            <li> Standard black pencil</li>
            <li> , The deep black color glides on effortlessly without tugging on your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not really burning, but I knew something was doing it.  </li>
            <li> so it did not go on as smoothly as expected with minimal pressure.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this product based on previous reviews, but was disappointed in two ways...one of them my own fault.  </li>
            <li> I like that the black color is not too intensely black.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner was flaky and crumbles slightly upon application.</li>
            <li> and it was an eye-opener (no pun intended) for me to have this tight feeling from the liner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find an all natural eyeliner, but this is it!</li>
            <li> All natural and vegetarian...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I felt as if the eye pencil was a little hard</li>
            <li> No more putting ingredients on your eyes that you can&#x27;t even pronounce.</li>
            <li> That is my biggest complaint with all of my eyeliners.</li>

            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this product based on previous reviews, but was disappointed in two ways...one of them my own fault.  I thought the pencil had a sharpener which it did not, but it never claimed to.  I guess I just read so many of the ads that I got confused.  Then, while it was relatively easy to put on, I did experience some discomfort...felt like eye fatigue.  Not really burning, but I knew something was doing it.  I would have blamed it on mascara as I&#x27;ve had the feeling in the past, but this particular day I forgot to use the mascara and it was an eye-opener (no pun intended) for me to have this tight feeling from the liner.  As far as how often I had to reapply it in one day, I generally don&#x27;t touch up my eye makeup unless I&#x27;m going out in the evening and it needs it; so I can&#x27;t comment on that question as accurately as should be.  However, what I am most concerned about is that on at least two of the five-star reviews, the reviewer stated that a sample was provided.  Now I wonder if the 5 stars came as a result of the free sample rather than the effectiveness of the product.  It&#x27;s not a bad product, but for me it was not as outstanding as the other ladies found it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner! I have used department store brands and my eyes always watered more or would itch and sometimes sting. I was hesitant to try this eye liner because of my eyes reactions to the others, but it goes on nicely and I have none of those side effects! I would recommend this to anyone with makeup sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner works well for me. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Love this. Compares to the quality of high-end makeup. No irritation. What a relief!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find an all natural eyeliner, but this is it! Delivery was fast, great costumer care, and the product is very good too.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing. You do have to press a little more or go over a little more to get it black. But it sure is pure black it&#x27;s beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all! I have really sensitive eyes and if I wear normal eyeliner it really messes with my eyes so I ordered this one and I&#x27;m so happy I can wear eyeliner again. It&#x27;s been a whole year without. Thank you for a great natural eyeliner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great. Doesn&#x27;t smudge when it gets too hot out. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this pencil, I have been using it for 2 weeks now. I don&#x27;t have any irritation and most importantly its really soft. Just the 2 things I look for in a eyeliner pencil. Plus does not smudge easily, and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Great eye liner! Love that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> Good color, no irritation, very sharp point. I personally would prefer not such a sharp point and a little softer, but it is easy to apply and looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye pencil for my daughter. We both are trying to be more conscious of what we put in and on our bodies, so choosing a vegan eyeliner like this one was a good choice. She absolutely loves it. I plan to buy more Shimiraz products in the future.</li>
            <li> Very smooth pencil! Applies almost like a gel and it&#x27;s not hard. Easy to sharpen, easy to use and great color! It does smudge if you&#x27;re looking for a good blendable liner that&#x27;s all natural. Product provided in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:16d2a61d14cb6cd74a843c4ff00af5c2]] I have tried two other products by Shimarz and so far I have just loved them.This is an all natural eye liner that does not irritate your eyes since it has no toxins or chemicals in its ingredients. The pencil gives a really dark pure black shade if you press it firmly. You can glide it gently to get a lighter shade as well. It is really easy to sharpen the pencil and the tip won&#x27;t break. Also, you can create a winged eyeliner or a more dramatic look with ease because the pencil sits nicely in your hands. I would totally recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this eyeliner. It goes on easy and smooth. I just trim it with a Q tip for a thinner line (my preferance) and it looks nice and lasts all day into evening. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it smearing at all. The very best part is that it is all natural and organic. Maybe in the future Shimarz will make it self-sharpening, which would be a great bonus.The very best thing is that there is no irritation, no worries about my precious eyes.  Next I am going to see if this brand offers eye shadow and mascara.  I hope so!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pencil is easy to apply.  So far I have only used it to line the upper lids.  Since I have not used it to line the lower eyelids I can&#x27;t address whether or not is is smear-proof at that location. The pencil substance itself is dry enough that I suspect a light dabbing of powder beneath the lower lid would contain any smearing that might occur.  I like this pencil. I like that the black color is not too intensely black.</li>
            <li> I expected to have to go over many times to get a dark line but it&#x27;s a really strong black so it&#x27;s perfect !</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, it&#x27;s a little lighter than expected but great that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> Would like more color choices</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Nice color.  All natural and vegetarian...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This pencil was just as it was described! I love it. It is very hard to find a good gluten free eyeliner</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner especially because it doesn&#x27;t contain any toxins.  It goes on smooth and lasts all day unless of course you are rubbing your eyes, etc.  Glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Great value! smooth to apply. Easy to blend and soften. I have had problems with eye redness and irritation from other eyeliner and so far this one has caused no problems! Very happy.</li>
            <li> This pencil does not disappear by midday but lasts until I remove it at bedtime.  It goes on very smoothly and does not drag on my eyelids.  I am able to put on a very small or very thick line.  This product really delivers what it advertises.</li>
            <li> I did like the product, but if you want a more dramatic look, I would recommend using the eyepencil in conjunction with the liquid eyeliner that Shimarz offers.  I really liked the liquid eyeliner as it is dramatic.  I felt as if the eye pencil was a little hard so it did not go on as smoothly as expected with minimal pressure.  I am going to try warming the pencil with a lighter to soften it up to see if this works (a trick that my friend told me about).</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner. The color payoff is fabulous, very dark black. It glides on very easily. It smudges nicely if you&#x27;re going for a smokey eye. Stays put when you want it too and doesn&#x27;t give you raccoon eyes. No harsh chemicals, no sulfates, gluten free, vegan, and has nourishing and natural ingredients. No more putting ingredients on your eyes that you can&#x27;t even pronounce. This stuff is fabulous. *sample provided*</li>
            <li> Need to press on it a little more than I would like. But overall a good buy</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pencil works great with no &#x27;bad stuff ingredients&#x27;.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> Love the natural makeup, thank you!</li>
            <li> Standard black pencil</li>
            <li> The eyeliner was flaky and crumbles slightly upon application. It was dry and did not apply smoothly. The color is bland, more like charcoal rather than black. However, it did stay on all day and did not run.  The customer service was immediate and pleasant. I was refunded promptly. All in all, rhe product reviews are not trustworthy for this product</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as dark as I like it and took several coats of it to get it to apply. Switched over to Shimarz gel and absolutely love it--exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Wonderful eyeliner without any smudging. That is my biggest complaint with all of my eyeliners. Also, my eyes tend to get irritated with a lot of eyeliners and it has not with this one as of yet. It also comes off so simply with face wash or my eye makeup remover and I have a few other brands that do not come off as easily.</li>
            <li> Excellent eyeliner that is creamy and goes on smoothly, The deep black color glides on effortlessly without tugging on your eyes.  Not only does this liner not contain chemicals, it has good for you ingredients in it! I am extremely pleased with this product and the customer service.</li>
