            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not looking for Amy Winehouse in a mascara; this isn&#x27;t clumpy, it makes my lashes look like they&#x27;re great naturally, and the color . . .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a really good product for a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>Mascara color was fine</li>
            <li>but shipping wasn&#x27;t free</li>
            <li>Best mascara for  green eyes.</li>
            <li>Wish it lasted longer, dries out kind of fast.</li>
            <li>The color is something I haven&#x27;t ever tried but is perfect for my green eyes.</li>
            <li>No longer available</li>
            <li>if you keep it clean the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>So be sure you scrape the brush very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light hypo allergenic mascara that works well for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I always receive compliments about how beautiful and green my eyes are.</li>
            <li>I love Almay products as I have very sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazaon!!</li>
            <li>The color is awesome - particularly for blonds with green eyes, and the wand is consistent.</li>
            <li>It was recommended in Allure magazine to be great for women with green eyes which I have</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely with no clumps and is not irritating to sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much more natural looking.</li>
            <li>Rich, thick, looks great all day.</li>
            <li>I have red hair and blue eyes, this is a great color for me.  </li>
            <li>It really highlights your natural beauty without overwhelming it.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty...</li>
            <li>So be aware if u want both it will look off...</li>
            <li>but it looks really great on, especially if you use the eyeliner and shadows for green eyes along with it.</li>
            <li>It stays on well and is reasonably waterproof.</li>
            <li>Almay has really pulled out all the stops when they created this line of cosmetics that works with the color of your eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Really brightens up my eyes.</li>
            <li>This color looks awesome on green, hazel, or blue eyes and really enhances eye color without being too obvious.</li>
            <li>I really hope Almay doesn&#x27;t ditch this color.</li>
            <li>I wish this product was not discontinued in my area, however, This was extremely easyily received, the shipper was extremely courtesy and the product is great.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is very pretty, the color really intensifies blue eyes and brown eyes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Not only does it really compliment red hair, and look far more natural than black, but it&#x27;s also better than brown in making the color of my eyes really pop.</li>
            <li>Maybe one in 20 color products of this shade I don&#x27;t react but for the price it was worth the chance to try something different although I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>i should have taken more heed to the reviewers that said it was dried out.  </li>
            <li>I love how this mascara makes my hazel/green eyes look like sparklin green marble-eyes.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive at all, just good), and this is the first beauty product I&#x27;ve bothered to write a review about.</li>
            <li>Looks so much better than black!  </li>
            <li>Almay mascara is very different from most other brands in</li>
            <li>because it does everything a very expensive mascara would do and yet it does not cake, goes on very smoothly, and most of all does not irritate the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have to clean it about every other use.  </li>
            <li>that it never feels super heavy or goopy (clumps too much).</li>
            <li>the brush looks like a regular mascara brush (spoolie style), but it&#x27;s really more like a little comb.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately at all.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and their products have never caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse short eyelashes</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>(mine aren&#x27;t super sensitive, but some of the new, fiber-filled mascaras seem to cause a little itchiness/irritation at times--not this one).</li>
            <li>You could barely tell I had any mascara on at all.</li>
            <li>This a very natural yet enhancing color especially for blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love the color unfortunately I have allergic reactions (puffy, swollen, itchy, red eyes that take 2 days to return to normal) to dyes used in this color family and cannot wear it.  </li>
            <li>I use it on the bottom lashes because it accents the eye color, is not dark enough to close up the eye and make it look</li>
            <li>No complaint in any other way</li>
            <li>The next Almay intense i-color mascara chocolate quartz is too black and goes on cakey and globby and flakes off.  </li>

            <li> It wears very well with very little smudging, even on oily skin.</li>
            <li> I think it makes you look younger, too--more natural, less made-up, but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a purplish-red which sounds strange</li>
            <li> You may or may not like that, for me it helps separate the lashes and works nicely on my long bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had other women ask me about it after seeing it on.</li>
            <li> I have always worn standard jet black mascara.</li>
            <li> I will be using my basic black mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> This is definitely thicker and clumpier than my usual mascara.</li>
            <li> It is part of Almay&#x27;s green eye products</li>
            <li> I wish they would come out with a green color too.  </li>
            <li> I have green eyes, and this makes them pop.</li>
            <li> just a subtle bit of purple that&#x27;s softer than black.</li>
            <li> I promise you there is no better all around mascara.  </li>
            <li> It is very stiff and to get to the corners is a bit hard.  </li>
            <li> but it was clumpy and hardly added volume or length.</li>
            <li> I think they discontinued because hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, so</li>
            <li> Amazon - you need to take this item down!!!</li>
            <li> The plum color is subtle...</li>
            <li> I was so sad when they discontinued it :(  </li>
            <li> and I hate that.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What a shame this product has been discontinued! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of mascara, and this works best for me. The dealer was prompt, and even sent a nice note with the packing slip.</li>
            <li> This is definitely thicker and clumpier than my usual mascara. So be sure you scrape the brush very well. But I like the color... just a subtle bit of purple that&#x27;s softer than black.</li>
            <li> Love the color unfortunately I have allergic reactions (puffy, swollen, itchy, red eyes that take 2 days to return to normal) to dyes used in this color family and cannot wear it.  Maybe one in 20 color products of this shade I don&#x27;t react but for the price it was worth the chance to try something different although I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 0 star if I could.  i should have taken more heed to the reviewers that said it was dried out.  Well, that is an understatement.  If i had not already thrown away the packaging, I would have sent it back.  obviously after one use, it went out in the garbage!  Amazon - you need to take this item down!!!</li>
            <li> I have red hair and blue eyes, this is a great color for me.  It stays on well and is reasonably waterproof.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this mascara. It is part of Almay&#x27;s green eye products but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately at all. Thus the reason for my online purchase. It was cheaper online than in stores but shipping wasn&#x27;t free so it was about the same with that included. The color is really pretty...it&#x27;s like a purplish-red which sounds strange but it looks really great on, especially if you use the eyeliner and shadows for green eyes along with it. I&#x27;ve actually had other women ask me about it after seeing it on. Highly recommended. I use BareMinerals for foundation but everything else is Almay. I have sensitive skin and their products have never caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;d like to know is why I can only get it online now, and not in stores.  It&#x27;s the absolute perfect color for me.</li>
            <li> I used to use this mascara eyeliner combo all the time. Mascara color was fine but it was clumpy and hardly added volume or length. They must have changed the color in the eyeliner cuz that didn&#x27;t match. So be aware if u want both it will look off...</li>
            <li> So glad to find it. Best mascara for  green eyes. I will keep stocking up whenever I can find it.</li>
            <li> This a very natural yet enhancing color especially for blue eyes.  It goes on nicely with no clumps and is not irritating to sensitive eyes.  I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> Almay&#x27;s Intense i-color mascara in Raisin Quartz is the perfect color for those with red/auburn hair, and wanting a natural look.  I have eyes that vary between blue/gray/green and this mascara makes them sparkle and stand out no matter which color they decide to be.  I don&#x27;t understand why mascara makers keep fazing out these colors!  The goth look is not for me and brown is blah.  The next Almay intense i-color mascara chocolate quartz is too black and goes on cakey and globby and flakes off.  I want my Raisin Quartz back!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever! Almay has really pulled out all the stops when they created this line of cosmetics that works with the color of your eyes. I love all the products in this line. It really highlights your natural beauty without overwhelming it.</li>
            <li> Almay is a great mascara because it does everything a very expensive mascara would do and yet it does not cake, goes on very smoothly, and most of all does not irritate the eyes.  I promise you there is no better all around mascara.  The color &amp;#34;Raisen Quartz&amp;#34; is beautiful.  I use it on the bottom lashes because it accents the eye color, is not dark enough to close up the eye and make it look smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any and everyone.</li>
            <li> I like the color but the brush isn&#x27;t what I would like.  I have to clean it about every other use.  It is very stiff and to get to the corners is a bit hard.  I wish they would come out with a green color too.  I like that I can wash it off with soap and it doesn&#x27;t seem to come off during the day.</li>
            <li> I love how this mascara makes my hazel/green eyes look like sparklin green marble-eyes.  I always receive compliments about how beautiful and green my eyes are.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It makes me happy every time I find it. The color is awesome - particularly for blonds with green eyes, and the wand is consistent. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not the greatest wand but it does the trick and if you keep it clean the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump.  Also, the mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off easily and is waterproof.  It&#x27;s just a really good product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes, and this makes them pop. It doesn&#x27;t take much. I have always worn standard jet black mascara. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back to it. So far, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have loved this color ever since Almay came out with it.  I was so sad when they discontinued it :(  I have been on a search ever since looking for something like this color.  Never came close to finding it.  I saw it on Amazon, how great is that.  Thanks Amazaon!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It was recommended in Allure magazine to be great for women with green eyes which I have so I thought I would try it.  I love the color It&#x27;s that reddish brown and does make my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> The mascara is very pretty, the color really intensifies blue eyes and brown eyes.  Wish it lasted longer, dries out kind of fast.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I think they discontinued because hard to find.  But I don&#x27;t know why.  Makes my green eyes really pop.  Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love Almay products as I have very sensitive eyes and skin. This color just wasn&#x27;t for me. You could barely tell I had any mascara on at all. I will be using my basic black mascara from now on. I have very sparse short eyelashes anyway so maybe that is why this color didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I wish this product was not discontinued in my area, however, This was extremely easyily received, the shipper was extremely courtesy and the product is great.  I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite COLOR mascara ever!  Looks so much better than black!  Really brightens up my eyes. Rich, thick, looks great all day.</li>
            <li> Almay mascara is very different from most other brands in that it never feels super heavy or goopy (clumps too much). It&#x27;s a light hypo allergenic mascara that works well for a more natural look. This color looks awesome on green, hazel, or blue eyes and really enhances eye color without being too obvious. The plum color is subtle...it whispers rather than screams. This is NOT an obvious purple....it&#x27;s much more natural looking. It wears very well with very little smudging, even on oily skin. Note: the brush looks like a regular mascara brush (spoolie style), but it&#x27;s really more like a little comb. You may or may not like that, for me it helps separate the lashes and works nicely on my long bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Mascara is wonderful.The color is something I haven&#x27;t ever tried but is perfect for my green eyes. Almay makes great hypoallerginic make-up so it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water either!</li>
            <li> I have red hair and blue eyes, and I wish I&#x27;d found this mascara years ago. I like the way it feels, stays on, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (mine aren&#x27;t super sensitive, but some of the new, fiber-filled mascaras seem to cause a little itchiness/irritation at times--not this one). I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m not looking for Amy Winehouse in a mascara; this isn&#x27;t clumpy, it makes my lashes look like they&#x27;re great naturally, and the color . . . wow. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m hooked. Not only does it really compliment red hair, and look far more natural than black, but it&#x27;s also better than brown in making the color of my eyes really pop. I think it makes you look younger, too--more natural, less made-up, but good! I&#x27;m picky about make-up (not snooty--doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive at all, just good), and this is the first beauty product I&#x27;ve bothered to write a review about. I really hope Almay doesn&#x27;t ditch this color.</li>
            <li> No longer available and I hate that.  Almay give us what we want!!!  The supplier of the product shipped immediately.  No complaint in any other way they towards Almay for discontinuing this product.</li>
