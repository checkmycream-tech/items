    <ol>
            <li>It is the best non greasy mask.</li>
            <li>And it smells wonderful, too!</li>
            <li>That is not what it is advertised to be used for, but it works beautifully under makeup.</li>
            <li>I give this product a great deal of the credit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job</li>
            <li>Smells like honey, nice!</li>
            <li>I often purchase something as a gift (samplers are great gifts), and the men&#x27;s products are exceptional, but</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Good to use in the winter.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It is nice that the propolis&lt;br /&gt;is already in this product.</li>
            <li>and she liked it a&lt;br /&gt;lot also.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before bed, again after washing and drying my face, I apply it again, more liberally this time, and let it all \\&quot;soak in.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>People have commented how rested I look and healthy</li>
            <li>love this moisture mask</li>
            <li>I love how my skin glows now.</li>
            <li>Allergic to most fragrances in most skin care products.  </li>
            <li>It smells deliciously of honey, and is also great for lips and the delicate under eye skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone including those like me, who swear by Zia or Mychelle products: it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I wear this as I sleep since it absorbs into the skin and has noticeably removed fine lines and improved skin texture.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>Lather has some great body creams and souffle&#x27;s, and the scrubs, especially the Eucalyptus foot one, no woman, or man, should be without.</li>
            <li>The men&#x27;s shaving products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped my skin stay nice this winter and the jar is a generous size-</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is a very heavy moisture mask, but it&#x27;s absolutely perfect for parched winter skin.  </li>
            <li>Apply slightly more than you would a normal moisturizer (not a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; quantity) and allow 5 minutes or so for it to soak in.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I use it every night applying a little bit more than when using moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My irritated spots were calm and zits calmed.</li>
            <li>This stuff has completely goten rid of all the excema bumps on my forehead, softened the skin under my eyes (and lessened smile lines even though i love those).  </li>
            <li>He stated that is was pretty mild.  </li>
            <li>I have (well, had) super dry, itchy, sensitive, fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully creamy, not even slightly greasy, all natural, and works like a charm keeping skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>but it does leave skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, supple and smooth.  </li>

            <li>It quickly moisturizes your skin and leaves it soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Many of the fine lines on my very dry skin have simply disappeared and my pores have been minimised.  </li>
            <li>really like it...</li>
            <li>It works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li>That led me to read the ingredients more carefully -</li>
            <li>But during the winter without hydration, it just looks older than it should be.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the honey moisture</li>
            <li>I have normal skin...</li>
            <li>I also have a&lt;br /&gt;bottle of propolis extract that I use to put on a new pimple that&lt;br /&gt;pops</li>
            <li>I did run out of this one time (the first and LAST time)</li>
            <li>First it was irritated, then came massive breakout.</li>
            <li>I like all the natural ingredients that the honey bees provide for us.  </li>

            <li>After few months and hundreds of dollar later, my skin is better</li>
            <li>It is especially great for the dry skin you get in the middle of the cold winter months.  </li>
            <li>It just vanishes after 5 minutes, or maybe a little more, and my skin is not, before application, dry.</li>
            <li>I am almost 50 years old, have been using this daily for at least 7 years, and despite it being the only skin care product I use on my face other than a cleanser, many people comment on how young I look.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask almost every night for around a month now.  My skin has never been so smooth and supple.  Many of the fine lines on my very dry skin have simply disappeared and my pores have been minimised.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone including those like me, who swear by Zia or Mychelle products: it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I cannot recall ever trying a product from Lather that I did not love. I often purchase something as a gift (samplers are great gifts), and the men&#x27;s products are exceptional, but this Honey Moisture Mask I use Every Single Day. I could not live without it. In the morning after washing and drying my face it becomes my moisturizer. That is not what it is advertised to be used for, but it works beautifully under makeup. Apply slightly more than you would a normal moisturizer (not a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; quantity) and allow 5 minutes or so for it to soak in. It&#x27;s wonderfully creamy, not even slightly greasy, all natural, and works like a charm keeping skin soft and supple. I am almost 50 years old, have been using this daily for at least 7 years, and despite it being the only skin care product I use on my face other than a cleanser, many people comment on how young I look. Genes? Perhaps. I give this product a great deal of the credit.&lt;br /&gt;Before bed, again after washing and drying my face, I apply it again, more liberally this time, and let it all \\&quot;soak in.\\&quot; I never need to wipe any off. It just vanishes after 5 minutes, or maybe a little more, and my skin is not, before application, dry. Of course maybe this product is why. I have normal skin... not dry, not oily, just normal, although I seem to remember about 7 years ago having combination skin with oily areas and dry patches. Hmmm. Come to think of it I did run out of this one time (the first and LAST time) and I about went nuts. My face felt like leather all day. Terrible. This product definitely makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am a redhead with very pale sensitive skin, which is why I tried Lather to begin with. I like the all-natural part. Lather has some great body creams and souffle&#x27;s, and the scrubs, especially the Eucalyptus foot one, no woman, or man, should be without. The men&#x27;s shaving products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer especially in the winter.  It does a great job</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;m using it slightly wrong, but I have been not only using as a mask but also as an intense moisturizer; especially when I go out in the morning for a walk when it is very cold - it keeps my skin protected and I end up with super soft skin afterward.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It is the best non greasy mask. I wear this as I sleep since it absorbs into the skin and has noticeably removed fine lines and improved skin texture. People have commented how rested I look and healthy my skin looks. My children tell me my skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li> love this moisture mask</li>
            <li> really like it... not sure if it works as well as its suposed to, but it does leave skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells like honey, nice!</li>
            <li> I have been using this honey moisture mask with propolis extract for&lt;br /&gt;about 5 years.  It has reduced the redness in my face and keeps my face&lt;br /&gt;moisturized.  I like all the natural ingredients that the honey bees provide for us.  The propolis is a natural antibiotic.  I also have a&lt;br /&gt;bottle of propolis extract that I use to put on a new pimple that&lt;br /&gt;pops up on my face a few times a year. It is nice that the propolis&lt;br /&gt;is already in this product. I always use this product and keep an extra&lt;br /&gt;jar on hand.  I gave a jar to my 30 year old niece and she liked it a&lt;br /&gt;lot also.  I highly recommend the honey moisture mask.&lt;br /&gt;Anne in Georgia</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. I have used it for 3 to 4 years. It works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day.  It is especially great for the dry skin you get in the middle of the cold winter months.  And it smells wonderful, too!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. I think she likes it, but I don&#x27;t use it so it is difficult to say.</li>
            <li> My skin has been difficult since beginning of the year. First it was irritated, then came massive breakout. For the first 3 months of this year I spent most of time(and money) trying to get my skin back to where it was. After few months and hundreds of dollar later, my skin is better but I&#x27;d have breakouts here and there. It is really annoying when you wake up to find new colony on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive combination skin, it is dry in some areas and oily in others. I noticed a different after one use. My skin becomes supple and dewy. My irritated spots were calm and zits calmed. I loved it so much that I use it every night applying a little bit more than when using moisturizer. I love how my skin glows now. I&#x27;ve ordered another jar to keep an extra on hand. Because like another reviewer, I cannot imagine life without it now.</li>
            <li> Feel like cream. Good to use in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have (well, had) super dry, itchy, sensitive, fair skin.  Allergic to most fragrances in most skin care products.  This stuff has completely goten rid of all the excema bumps on my forehead, softened the skin under my eyes (and lessened smile lines even though i love those).  The only down side is i keep sayin, &amp;#34;touch it!!!&amp;#34; and pointing to my face and it might start to get creepy.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy moisture mask, but it&#x27;s absolutely perfect for parched winter skin.  It leaves my skin soft, supple and smooth.  I absolutely adore it.  It smells deliciously of honey, and is also great for lips and the delicate under eye skin.  If you&#x27;re very dry you can even use a little dab as a regular moisturizer.  I also like it for dry elbows, knees, and hands.</li>
            <li> My winter skin has it&#x27;s glow back thanks to using this mask weekly. It&#x27;s basically used like a moisturizer- you apply it to skin after cleansing and toning and let it sink in. You can use it occasionally as a body or hand lotion as well. It&#x27;s really helped my skin stay nice this winter and the jar is a generous size- this will last a long time, and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this but it stings my face.  That led me to read the ingredients more carefully - two kinds of alcohol are within the first few ingredients.  So, no wonder it stings.  I want a soothing mask I can use often to help with dry, premature aging, skin.  Since this stings I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it -- I&#x27;m sending it back and will keep looking for another mask.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only used this product on my son&#x27;s face and he didn&#x27;t complain.  He stated that is was pretty mild.  Maybe a little different feeling, but he also doesn&#x27;t use masks regularly.</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago and winter could be a dry hell for my face. And this didn&#x27;t work at all. I used it day and night, still feels dryness. So won&#x27;t buy it again. My skin condition is very well, firm and clear. But during the winter without hydration, it just looks older than it should be.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for years and I love it.  It quickly moisturizes your skin and leaves it soft and supple.</li>
