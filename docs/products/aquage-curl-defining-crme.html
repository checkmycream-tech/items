            <li>I&#x27;ve used aquage products for straightening my hair and loved them.</li>

            <li>Great light smell as well.</li>
            <li>Helps my curls look good, and frizz free!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work perfectly on really humid days, but since I&#x27;ve had the agave treatment, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>--though it does have dimethicone, it&#x27;s waaaaay near the bottom of some impressive ingredients.</li>

            <li>absolutley love this product.</li>
            <li>I actually love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>This makes me have more than the &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies to many hair products.  </li>
            <li>and i got better results.</li>
            <li>Aquage Curl Defining Creme is one of my favorite curl products.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a great deal and handy in the larger pump bottle rather than buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li>Just an FYI, I am writing a review for my purchase of this product because I have used it many times before and am familiar with it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either, which I like.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is permed .</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and used to use a fantastic product which is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Great product initially recommended to my by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every curly hair cream and serum and frizz tamer available.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which I prefer, but it does smell clean.  </li>
            <li>Because of the price I paid i thought it was the original one.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, overall.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Got everything I ordered quickly and with no issues.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>love this product - would highly recoomend this to my friends and family..</li>
            <li>Defines curls indeed, looks very pretty as my hair dries.  </li>
            <li>This product will last a very, very long time and is great for the price!  </li>
            <li>I have used a quite a few curling cr&amp;egrave;me&#x27;s and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This gives my curls great shape and it is not sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>Great product to tame frizzy Curls.</li>
            <li>right before I walk out the door.</li>
            <li>The most important thing for me is doesn&#x27;t make it hard and crunchy like most of the curling products out there.  </li>
            <li>Flip upright again, just kind of scrunch the curls from bottom upward, and I have ringlets all day long -</li>
            <li>Luckily, Amazon.com covered me and refunded me since I had to throw the whole thing out when I received it.</li>
            <li>Price has increased recently so it is pretty &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and now I have finally found one that works.  </li>
            <li>I have thinning hair &amp; the Aquage seems to produce a well couffed hair style after using a hot iron.</li>
            <li>it is very smoothing for frizz with curl definition and control with out losing volume!</li>
            <li>Really holds!  </li>
            <li>I have used the Aquage Curl Defining Creme for over a year and, although I live in a very dry climate, this product has given me soft, beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>My curls look very pretty, yet very soft.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you may loose 1/4 or more of the product in shipping.</li>
            <li>works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Gentle curl definition.  </li>
            <li>However, you do have to use the right shampoo and conditioner to get the soft curls.  </li>
            <li>Unlike gel, and as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it, it leaves your curls soft and not crunchy, while at the same time it does a good job at preventing frizz and keeping your curls shapely.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little crunchy, but I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time touching my hair, so doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft with some control, very touchable.</li>
            <li>I have very naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>And wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be considering to try the morocconoil brand, but now I&#x27;m not sure to buy anything for my hair any more.</li>
            <li>A must if you have naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I finally bought the large hand pump.</li>
            <li>Not stiff or oily.  </li>
            <li>Might seem high priced, but it does last a long time, and definitely worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>not heavy</li>
            <li>- do not order this product directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair totally soft, but close.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky - I use it if I&#x27;m encouraging the curl or straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair - and LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I used it together with the healing conditioner to soften and condition my very long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Many products for curly hair are just dimethicone or some other \\&quot;cone\\&quot; chemical, and that can leave hair shiny--but limp and almost greasy-looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive the than grocery store brands (of which I&#x27;ve tried them all), but it&#x27;s a huge bottle that lasts like 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I use it several times per week on my toddler&#x27;s naturally curly hair now to keep it conditioned and the curls soft with no frizz.  would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>If you need a little bit, it will last forever, but if not, well it may not be worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold my natural waves as long or as well as mouse</li>
            <li>I wasted a lot of money on this product, I wish I could have tried it first, I wouldnt have bought it.</li>

            <li> These helps bring out my curls, tame the frizzes, and doesn&#x27;t get crunchy unless I put waaay too much in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years for my very curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> make your hair stiff but gives you a soft control.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for year.</li>
            <li> I have tried other curl creams over the years, but I keep coming back to Aquage.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I bought it from the third party seller Beautogen on Amazon.com, they sent it USPS, wrapping the bottle in a bubble wrap envelope and when I got it the bottle and envelope were broken open and most of the product was gone...</li>
            <li> Can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I received quicker then I expected.</li>
            <li> Just passing my experience along in case I can save someone the trouble I had with the 3rd party seller.</li>
            <li> I have very curly thin hair that tends to frizz out.  </li>
            <li> I have lived with curly hair and rarely left it down because it would become a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> - just makes my hair look messy and sort of greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need tons of other products,</li>
            <li> I have wavy (not quite curly) extremely frizzy Hispanic hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I didn&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> This product works well with my thin but naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, wavy hair that is somewhat thick.  </li>
            <li> I was told at the beauty salon that this product would make my hair stay wavy and get rid of frizz without looking wet and stiff.</li>
            <li> I just massage in a small amount and air dry.</li>
            <li> I typically have gotten this product from my Stylist -</li>
            <li> I wanted a similar product which would define my curls, but not make them stiff and icky, or weighted down.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product if used properly gives my thin hair body and brings out the curl.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and allows my hair to stay curly all day.</li>

            <li> Dried my curls out and made it feel dirty. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and used to use a fantastic product which is no longer available.  I wanted a similar product which would define my curls, but not make them stiff and icky, or weighted down. Many products for curly hair are just dimethicone or some other \\&quot;cone\\&quot; chemical, and that can leave hair shiny--but limp and almost greasy-looking. For about five years I&#x27;ve been searching for something, and I think I&#x27;ve finally found it.  It&#x27;s expensive, but I didn&#x27;t have to use much. My curls look very pretty, yet very soft. I&#x27;ll be buying it in the largest size now!  PS--though it does have dimethicone, it&#x27;s waaaaay near the bottom of some impressive ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I have tried other curl creams over the years, but I keep coming back to Aquage.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have very naturally wavy hair. I was told at the beauty salon that this product would make my hair stay wavy and get rid of frizz without looking wet and stiff. Well, I purchased it from amazon, and tried it several times. It didnt work for me - just makes my hair look messy and sort of greasy and flat. I wish it would have worked because I can find nothing that makes my hair unfrizzy. I wasted a lot of money on this product, I wish I could have tried it first, I wouldnt have bought it.</li>
            <li> I finally bought the large hand pump. This product if used properly gives my thin hair body and brings out the curl. I have a smaller hand one I travel with also.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I used it together with the healing conditioner to soften and condition my very long, straight hair.  I use it several times per week on my toddler&#x27;s naturally curly hair now to keep it conditioned and the curls soft with no frizz.  would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  I have naturally curly hair.  This helps to soften the curls and eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, overall.  Price has increased recently so it is pretty &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; product.  If you need a little bit, it will last forever, but if not, well it may not be worth it.</li>
            <li> The product itself has done wonders for my hear. I have lived with curly hair and rarely left it down because it would become a frizzy mess. I have tried so many products and now I have finally found one that works.  I don&#x27;t need tons of other products, just the Aquage Curl Defining creme alone makes my hair look awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair - and LOVE this product. (I have also tried Aquage&#x27;s Illuminating Gelade, and also like it - but the Curl Defining Creme is my favorite.)&lt;br /&gt;When I step out of the shower, I towel-dry my hair so it&#x27;s damp, comb it with my fingers, then put maybe a nickel-sized amount in my palm. Rub my palms together, flip my hair and comb it through my hair while my head is upside-down. Flip upright again, just kind of scrunch the curls from bottom upward, and I have ringlets all day long - but you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;ve used any styling product. Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s truly touchable.&lt;br /&gt;Really, a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works beautifully. I just massage in a small amount and air dry. If I&#x27;m rushed, I do a very short blow-dry right before I walk out the door.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this gives it body and staying power as well has enhances the curls.  Great product initially recommended to my by my stylist.  I use every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used aquage products for straightening my hair and loved them. The curl defining creme is lightweight as promised and doesn&#x27;t add any crunchiness or greasiness to your hair. It doesn&#x27;t hold my natural waves as long or as well as mouse but it gets the job done well enough.</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair that I have ever found! I have always had problems with frizzy hair from my curls. I have tried every curly hair cream and serum and frizz tamer available. My hair stylist has very similar hair to mine and I asked her what product she used.. this was it! And wow! I will never try anything else again! And it&#x27;s a great deal and handy in the larger pump bottle rather than buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> These helps bring out my curls, tame the frizzes, and doesn&#x27;t get crunchy unless I put waaay too much in. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either, which I like.</li>
            <li> Great product for managing hair. I have thinning hair &amp; the Aquage seems to produce a well couffed hair style after using a hot iron.</li>
            <li> works very well with my hair. I have textured wavy hair and this helps get the curl i want out of my hair</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It smells great  and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard. It&#x27;s better than using gel. My hair feels really good with it.  It&#x27;s very expensive tho.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff but gives you a soft control.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for year.</li>
            <li> the best there is out there... love this product - would highly recoomend this to my friends and family..&lt;br /&gt;great stuff</li>
            <li> works great on my hair- not heavy</li>
            <li> Works great and really controls my unruly hair.  Helps my curls look good, and frizz free!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly on my curly hair! Not too heavy and allows my hair to stay curly all day.</li>
            <li> This product works well with my thin but naturally curly hair. it is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> this hair product is amazing for curly hair. this will not leave a crunch in you hair at all. it is very smoothing for frizz with curl definition and control with out losing volume!</li>
            <li> I ordered what I wanted.  It came quickly.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Got everything I ordered quickly and with no issues.  Would use them again in the future. This hair cream is awesome for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I have used the Aquage Curl Defining Creme for over a year and, although I live in a very dry climate, this product has given me soft, beautiful curls. However, you do have to use the right shampoo and conditioner to get the soft curls.  I have used Pureology, Biolage Hydrating, and Joico K-pak Reconstruct Shampoos and Conditioners with the Aquage Curl Defining Creme and have had good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING - do not order this product directly from Amazon. Order from one of the outside vendors. Otherwise, you may loose 1/4 or more of the product in shipping. Amazon does not properly package hair products before shipping.</li>
            <li> I typically have gotten this product from my Stylist - it works amazingly well on my fine, curly hair to prevent frizz - Price for 10 additional ounces CAN NOT be beat anywhere, and I have looked.  Need smaller container as well for traveling, but this is perfect for home.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is permed . . . absolutley love this product. I towel-dry my hair after I wash my hair unitl it is still damp.  I put two pumps of the Aquage in my palm. After rubbing the cream into my hand, I flip my hair and comb it through my hair while my head is upside-down, then flip upright again and comb through my hair again.  I scrunch the curls from bottom upward, and after my hair air dries I then style my hair. This product leaves my hair soft with some control, very touchable. This is a wonderful product. Might seem high priced, but it does last a long time, and definitely worth every cent.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do.  My curls look great and not frizzy.  I received quicker then I expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for those with curly hair that don&#x27;t want that crunchy feeling. I have been using it for years and won&#x27;t give it up!</li>
            <li> I have used a quite a few curling cr&amp;egrave;me&#x27;s and this is by far the best.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which I prefer, but it does smell clean.  I actually love the smell of this product.  I have blonde, wavy hair that is somewhat thick.  This makes me have more than the &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look.  It gives me great curl definition.  This product will last a very, very long time and is great for the price!  I use about 4-5 pumps on my hair. The most important thing for me is doesn&#x27;t make it hard and crunchy like most of the curling products out there.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Defines curls indeed, looks very pretty as my hair dries.  Frizz returns during the day though, so I keep having to apply motions hair cream as before. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair totally soft, but close.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies to many hair products.  Gentle curl definition.  Not stiff or oily.  Can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great product to tame frizzy Curls.</li>
            <li> Excellent for Curly Hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using Aquage styling cream ever since I have had spiral perms. It holds the curl and makes it look good. I gave it a 5 star rating because it works for me. It was recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> It works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> I disagree with the product i used &amp;#34;the same&amp;#34; at the salon and i got better results. I thinks this one it&#x27;s a poor imitation. I&#x27;ll be considering to try the morocconoil brand, but now I&#x27;m not sure to buy anything for my hair any more. Because of the price I paid i thought it was the original one. I&#x27;m sorry Amazon you didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations at this time :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years for my very curly thick hair. It feels a little crunchy, but I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time touching my hair, so doesn&#x27;t bother me. It does the job of keeping my curls under control. It doesn&#x27;t work perfectly on really humid days, but since I&#x27;ve had the agave treatment, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought some from my hairdresser, loved it, wanted to find it cheaper. Arrived quickly. Not heavy or sticky - I use it if I&#x27;m encouraging the curl or straightening my hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> Aquage Curl Defining Creme is one of my favorite curl products.  Unlike gel, and as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it, it leaves your curls soft and not crunchy, while at the same time it does a good job at preventing frizz and keeping your curls shapely.  In addition to these important details, it also smells great.  The 16 oz product should last for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Just an FYI, I am writing a review for my purchase of this product because I have used it many times before and am familiar with it. Unfortunately, when I bought it from the third party seller Beautogen on Amazon.com, they sent it USPS, wrapping the bottle in a bubble wrap envelope and when I got it the bottle and envelope were broken open and most of the product was gone...partly in my mailbox. Luckily, Amazon.com covered me and refunded me since I had to throw the whole thing out when I received it. Just passing my experience along in case I can save someone the trouble I had with the 3rd party seller.</li>
            <li> A must if you have naturally curly hair!  Really holds!  Love this Aquage line!</li>
            <li> I have wavy (not quite curly) extremely frizzy Hispanic hair.  This is the only product that works for me.  It keeps my frizz at bay for two whole days without making my hair greasy, heavy or crunchy.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive the than grocery store brands (of which I&#x27;ve tried them all), but it&#x27;s a huge bottle that lasts like 3 months.  Please keep making it forever...</li>
            <li> Great product....I have very curly thin hair that tends to frizz out.  This gives my curls great shape and it is not sticky or stiff.  Great light smell as well.</li>
