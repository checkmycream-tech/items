            <li>Works great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi worked so much better than the pumas stone and the non-powered PedEgg which we had been using.  </li>

            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>Best purchase 8 made in a long time.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT FOR USE TO REMOVE DRY SKIN ON FEET AND ELBOWS.</li>
            <li>I own one that I purchased from Costco (came with 3 extra rollers) and I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this works very well, but it takes a bit of time and patience.</li>
            <li>Best money spent ever!</li>
            <li>Changing the roller is easy peezy.  </li>
            <li>You will probably find that it will do just fine.  </li>
            <li>Used regularly it has kept my feet callous free and looking beautiful.</li>
            <li>You just buff using the Micro-Pedi until your heels are smooth and then rinse your heels,</li>
            <li>would make a fabulous christmas gift.</li>
            <li>They were like elephant skin, and I couldn&#x27;t get them smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best-wish I&#x27;d had one years ago!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome little gizmo!</li>
            <li>but this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>After just 4 days of using this nightly and applying my ointment, my feet are ultra smooth and &#x27;snag-free&#x27; for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li>I think I will order the more intense grinding things though.</li>
            <li>Works great, but be careful not to sand too much!!</li>
            <li>There are other Medi Pedis out their alot cheaper but went with this and was really happy</li>
            <li>When used regularly it helps keep feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it solves a major problem and it is inexpensive and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>: Easy to use and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Oh, and even after 4 uses, I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries!  </li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>I find the Amazon review program very useful,  but wish there was an automated mechanism that asked buyers to review the product&#x27;s durability in a reasonable timeframe.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was going to buy a courser roller which not only would have been too coarser, but more damaging when I did not know how well the Emjoi worked.  </li>
            <li>While the instructions say you should rinse the top of the roller for 5 seconds to clean it, a friend told me to definitely NOT rinse it at all.  </li>
            <li>When my husband first saw a product like this advertised on TV</li>
            <li>I am very happy to say that I was wrong.    </li>
            <li>When deciding if you need a coarser roller, first try the one that comes with your purchase.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so calloused and this product made them soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My feet feel smooth and soft after using the micro-pedi.  </li>
            <li>My elbows are now smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have more control for specific spots on my feet, something my mani/pedi person never finds.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to maintain in between pedis and after the first use the emory board needs to be changed.</li>
            <li>Wow, it really does work -EASILY.  </li>
            <li>It does the job with ease and is the most effective at removing rough dry skin.  </li>
            <li>You push the little button on the top right side of the roller and it pops out to the right.  </li>
            <li>Very please, Thank you.....</li>
            <li>The whole family loves it.  </li>
            <li>I beats pumice and is so much quicker.  </li>
            <li>how much power this had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>: I really wish they made a roller that is a bit tougher.</li>
            <li>Very well.  </li>
            <li>I like the whole emoji micro-pedi exfoliator system.  </li>
            <li>In addition it is a good tool to follow a weeks treatment of Gold Bond Ultimate Rough &amp;  Bumpy Skin therapy cream.</li>
            <li>The sizes and types of roller replacements are better than any other on the market.  </li>
            <li>I paid $24.95 for this device and it lasted less than a year,  with pretty light use -  once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this tool.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in years!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, easy to hold for arthritic hands, cleans easily with the help of the included brush, and takes up very little space in my cosmetic drawer.  </li>
            <li>While it is a totally safe product, if you are over zealous and having fun using the product (as I did), it is possible to over-sand your foot, and nick it, causing a little bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Also, after a few days of using it consistently I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>When you are done pull the roller head release button down and the roller will come out easily.  </li>
            <li>required new batteries for each use -- and</li>
            <li>I have very soft feet.</li>
            <li>After we bought and used it several other people in our family have also bought and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been paying for professional pedicures.</li>
            <li>I just wish the whole end was open.  </li>
            <li>Having used a walker for 6 weeks, I  developed a small callous on the heel of my hand and the Emjoi smoothly took care of that, too.    </li>
            <li>In just a few minutes that little roller did magic!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and small enough to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li>Works as well as other positive reviewers have said.&lt;br /&gt;Advertised as coming with a spare roller,  but I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone that struggles with dry heels or calluses.</li>
            <li>You pull it out, blow on it and brush it with a brush that comes with the unit, and then stick it back in narrow side first</li>
            <li>Directions clearly state that your feet must be dry in order for it to work properly.  </li>
            <li>Instead of it sanding off the dry skin right away, it took a few seconds of going over and over the spot, feeling it for smoothness before continuing.  </li>
            <li>I wish the rollers were water proof as using a little brush to get the  Calluses off it really stays on and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The EMJOI and the R.E.M. Spring are probably the two best, \\&quot;every day\\&quot;  beauty/health products I have ever purchased.  Both are inexpensive and have paid for themselves with  just a few uses.  I did a lot of research and there are maybe 4 or 5 different companies that make this type of product, but what prompted me to buy Emjoi is that you have a choice in the coarseness of the rollers. The other companies syeem to provide only one coarseness.    I recently purchased the Emjoi Micropedi and it surpassed my expectations. When my husband first saw a product like this advertised on TV I poo pooed it thinking it would be a waste of money and time - that there would not be enough power or friction to take care of the callouses and corns we both get on our dry feet.  I am very happy to say that I was wrong.    It took about 20 seconds to get the feel for it.  Instead of it sanding off the dry skin right away, it took a few seconds of going over and over the spot, feeling it for smoothness before continuing.  While it is a totally safe product, if you are over zealous and having fun using the product (as I did), it is possible to over-sand your foot, and nick it, causing a little bleeding.  I did not use common/common sense and that&#x27;s what happened to me.  The next time I used it, I knew how effective it was, and what to expect, so I took my time and did not over sand my foot and everything was perfect.    The Emjoi Extra Coarse (blue roller) got rid of the deep cracks on the outside of my foot as well as the calluses on the outside of my big toe.  The Emjoi worked so much better than the pumas stone and the non-powered PedEgg which we had been using.  Having used a walker for 6 weeks, I  developed a small callous on the heel of my hand and the Emjoi smoothly took care of that, too.    Changing the roller is easy peezy.  You push the little button on the top right side of the roller and it pops out to the right.  You pull it out, blow on it and brush it with a brush that comes with the unit, and then stick it back in narrow side first that&#x27;s it.  Please note that you only get one roller (the one attached) with this purchase.  Other packages   usually provide 2 rollers with the initial purchase.    Suggestions:  Try the attached roller before buying coarser  When deciding if you need a coarser roller, first try the one that comes with your purchase.  You will probably find that it will do just fine.  Originally, I was going to buy a courser roller which not only would have been too coarser, but more damaging when I did not know how well the Emjoi worked.  I do not need the coarser roller.    Cleaning:  Don&#x27;t rinse.  While the instructions say you should rinse the top of the roller for 5 seconds to clean it, a friend told me to definitely NOT rinse it at all.  I found that blowing both sides of the roller while it is still on the Emjoi, and using the tiny brush that is included gets a lot of the fluff off.  _________  I love this product, it solves a major problem and it is inexpensive and easy to use.  I definitely recommend the Emjoi Micropedi.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing next to sliced bread. I have been paying for professional pedicures. I often complained that the pedicurist didn&#x27;t file down my callouses enough. They always said they didn&#x27;t want to cause sore spots. The Emjoi Micro-Pedi got rid of my callouses, without causing sore spots, in just minutes per foot. My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in years!! Not only that, but within days of a professional pedicure, my feet looked as bad as before I went in. I have gone two weeks, and am just now needing to use it again. Best money spent ever!</li>
            <li> This is the very best callus remover I have ever used.  I do get pedi&#x27;s once a month, but my heels still get dry. You do not have to apply pressure at all.  Smoothest outcome.  Gave one to my daughter and she was amazed also.</li>
            <li> Works well as advertised</li>
            <li> Excellent item. I never have to go to the SPA again!</li>
            <li> This product really got rude of my calluses! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My feet are so calloused and this product made them soft and smooth. It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi works great! When used regularly it helps keep feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have checked out all of the other types of rollers out there, and this by far is the easiest to use, hold, and handle.  It has the easiest roller replacement method, cleans up the easiest, and does not skid or stop during use.  It does the job with ease and is the most effective at removing rough dry skin.  I do not know what I would do without this product.  The sizes and types of roller replacements are better than any other on the market.  If you want the best product, get the Micropedi.</li>
            <li> Works as well as other positive reviewers have said.&lt;br /&gt;Advertised as coming with a spare roller,  but I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> batteries last only one time on both feet. should have purchased the corded one, will know for future when this dies</li>
            <li> Product received on time...  I was billed correctly...  Very please, Thank you.....</li>
            <li> Omg this machine is amazing!! My husband was always telling me to not walk around with the back of my feet looking so harsh. It took off so much dead skin and my feet are so summertime smooth!! I did it on dry skin not wet and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all but this is worth every penny! I don&#x27;t have to go get a pedicure weekly anymore! I love this!! Get it is not short of a life changer!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product ,works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi Micro-Pedi a few years ago.  It came with two disposable rollers, a cleaning brush, and a plastic cover.  You will need two AA batteries for the Micro-Pedi.  This beauty tool is amazing.  My heels are often terrible looking and in need of some major help and the Micro-Pedi makes my heels look great.  I recommend buffing with your Micro-Pedi over a towel because it will be very messy.  There will be dry, dead skin flying from your feet like it is a blizzard if your heels are anything like mine.  You just buff using the Micro-Pedi until your heels are smooth and then rinse your heels, pat dry, and apply lotion.  If your heels are super bad like mine then it may take a few times using this to achieve the desired look.  When you are done pull the roller head release button down and the roller will come out easily.  Do not wash the roller, only the Micro-Pedi itself can be washed.  You must use the cleaning brush on the roller heads.  I am including some rather embarrassing photos of my heels.  There are two before photos, two after photos (only rinsed and dried), and then two &#x27;after&#x27; after photos where I applied lotion.</li>
            <li> Best way yet to trim the callus that appears on my feet. Maybe I will not have as many podiatrist visits. In addition it is a good tool to follow a weeks treatment of Gold Bond Ultimate Rough &amp;  Bumpy Skin therapy cream.</li>
            <li> Works awesome. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the present for every birthday girl I know.  Awesome little gizmo!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best-wish I&#x27;d had one years ago!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent  product. Very effective.</li>
            <li> This device worked great. [[ASIN:B00AUTKHHM Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover]] I bought it in October 2014, but last month, July 2015,  the bottom cap that holds the batteries in came off and fell apart. Consequently the device wouldn&#x27;t function until I taped it shut.  I submitted a request for a replacement to ShaveNow (the seller) and was just sent an automated &amp;#34;Expiration of returns period&amp;#34;.  I paid $24.95 for this device and it lasted less than a year,  with pretty light use -  once or twice a month.  Since I had bought additional rollers I bought the updated version [[ASIN:B005XUNG5I Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover]], so that those wouldn&#x27;t be a complete waste too.  I hope this one lasts longer.  I find the Amazon review program very useful,  but wish there was an automated mechanism that asked buyers to review the product&#x27;s durability in a reasonable timeframe.</li>
            <li> I heard from friend that they are very happy to use. This kind foot cleaner</li>
            <li> Love,Love,Love, this product.!  just got it today!  i can see my feet again!  i highly recommend this tool.  in minutes, im all done.  using a pumice stone  was time consuming.  this isnt.  i am very pleased with this product!  so worth it. would make a fabulous christmas gift. thank you!</li>
            <li> I already had one of these that I bought a few years ago. I wanted to get a second one for my hubby. I like to take good care of my feet and this works great. I have very soft feet. I use this every few months and then put shea butter on my feet everyday.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT FOR USE TO REMOVE DRY SKIN ON FEET AND ELBOWS.</li>
            <li> love love love it! I think I will order the more intense grinding things though. My new obsession is using this to make my feet perfect!</li>
            <li> This works really good!  The price us good too!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this works very well, but it takes a bit of time and patience. Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Best purchase 8 made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Great product. Does just what the description says or maybe better.  I gotta have for all ladies wearing sandals.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Bought three of them this year. One for me and two for gifts.</li>
            <li> +++++  The whole family loves it.  May need to buy another.  May buy more for Christmas presents.  +++++</li>
            <li> Wow, it really does work -EASILY.  I beats pumice and is so much quicker.  Now I need to order all of the replacement rollers.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything on your feet but it does produce the dust from dead skin.  Great product, wish I discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  My feet feel smooth and soft after using the micro-pedi.  It is easy to use and small enough to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> Because of a medical condition I lean on my elbows a lot. They were like elephant skin, and I couldn&#x27;t get them smooth. They caught on my clothes and bed linens. Enter Emjoi! Voila!  In just a few minutes that little roller did magic! My elbows are now smooth and soft. I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Karen Thomas, San Diego, CA</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Easy to clean. The more abrasive rollers work better.</li>
            <li> I always thought that women would get this done and I&#x27;ve seen reviews that guys have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use and gentle on the skin. If you press to hard the motor will stop for safety reasons. There are other Medi Pedis out their alot cheaper but went with this and was really happy how much power this had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I really wish they made a roller that is a bit tougher. I bought the blue/grayish color for men and was the as the roller it comes with. I&#x27;ve seen the reviews for the tougher ones and everyone agrees they are the same strength as the roller as it comes with, I would like to see the company make a roller that is a bit tougher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I wish the rollers were water proof as using a little brush to get the  Calluses off it really stays on and instructions say not to wet it.</li>
            <li> I have had the Emjoi Micro-Pedi for years now and I love it. I get calluses all over my feet, and this works great to smooth out my feet and get rid of those stubborn calluses. I have noticed that if I stop using it for a while, the calluses get rough again. So, I have been trying to use it every night before bed. This is the best callus remover I have used, it requires no elbow grease nor are you any danger of making your feet bleed. It does not hurt at all but it gets the job done.  I can see it working when I glide it over my dry heels and calluses because I can see the &amp;#34;white dust&amp;#34; coming off. Also, after a few days of using it consistently I notice a huge difference. I just use it at night before bed, apply some foot cream and put my socks on. I would highly recommend this to anyone that struggles with dry heels or calluses.</li>
            <li> Wonderful tool every woman should have!  I have hand/foot exzema, and it&#x27;s very difficult to keep the extra dead skin off my feet, especially where this condition is the worst.  After just 4 days of using this nightly and applying my ointment, my feet are ultra smooth and &#x27;snag-free&#x27; for the first time in years!  I love it.  It&#x27;s quiet, easy to hold for arthritic hands, cleans easily with the help of the included brush, and takes up very little space in my cosmetic drawer.  Oh, and even after 4 uses, I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries!  My old dremel I used for this in the past required new batteries for each use -- and it used 4!</li>
            <li> Works great, but be careful not to sand too much!!</li>
            <li> This works so ell on my feet.</li>
            <li> Every girl I gave this to loves it!</li>
            <li> This works really good....I just wish the whole end was open.  You can only use one angle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. No power.</li>
            <li> It only had 1 roller. I would have gave it 5 stars if it came with extra rollers! I bought this for a Xmas gift and have yet to give it, so can&#x27;t comment on how it (this specific one) works. I own one that I purchased from Costco (came with 3 extra rollers) and I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> JUST GOT IT so we shall see ,,it looks amazing</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the negative reviews.  I purchased my Emjoi at Costco years ago and now am looking for replacement rollers (which amazon has listed).  I absolutely love this product.  Directions clearly state that your feet must be dry in order for it to work properly.  Used regularly it has kept my feet callous free and looking beautiful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in the least!  Very disappointed....</li>
            <li> Love, love the Emjoi!</li>
            <li> Works great, item as described</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price</li>
            <li> It is ok.  Not what they claim but it will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> This product is life-changing!! Quality is incredible and it dies the job effectively and quickly. I never thought I&#x27;d EVER get my feet back to thevway they once were. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These work.  Very well.  I like the whole emoji micro-pedi exfoliator system.  I like the feeling of the callus remover because scraping my heals with whatever tool that is used reminds of having my horse shoed.  I have more control for specific spots on my feet, something my mani/pedi person never finds.</li>
            <li> Does the job I wanted.  Works great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Really great product.</li>
            <li> SImple review this thing does what it says and works great.  After we bought and used it several other people in our family have also bought and love it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I get pedis every 2 weeks but due to my pregnancy I&#x27;m noticing a change in my skins typical character. I purchased this to maintain in between pedis and after the first use the emory board needs to be changed. That makes this expensive seeing as it only comes with one cartridge and the additional ones can be pricey if you have to purchase them every week. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend since I already spend $80 a month on pedicures</li>
