            <li>that is insanely amazing (for all skin types)</li>
            <li>NO LONGER EFFECTIVE.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Good product but the pump dispenses more product than you need</li>
            <li>The company is wonderful and professional.</li>
            <li>I will buy something else comparable to this and see if that works any better.</li>
            <li>This is mostly on my fore head</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is a drastic improvement, but definitely better and seems to be cumulative (longer i have used, better it seems).</li>
            <li>She was able to figure the website out to get instructions, so I went there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I do believe the longer you use this the more difference you see.  </li>
            <li>OK, so this arrived today, Argireline 20% serum with Matrixyl 3000 and Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>Now I can feel confident again.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have that many yet to begin with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is how \\&quot;normal\\&quot; people always are -- but to me it&#x27;s a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it for about a week, I noticed it working better and better.</li>
            <li>This product relaxes the muscles more so than it does mine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product relaxes the muscles more so than it does mine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get better results from Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use a light moisturizer over top.</li>
            <li>The company shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, please know if you have acne prone or oily skin, it is fine to use this product.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s to minimize fine lines (it didn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>I purchased this product several years ago and it was really great.  </li>
            <li>I finished my Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder advanced night repair and didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 again.</li>
            <li>I have been on some of the most &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; skin care products for most of my adult life too, so I would know a thing or two about results.</li>
            <li>Such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so maybe for someone older result might be more visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends quickly and then I put a moisturizer and sunscreen over it in the a.m and a retinol cream over it in the p.m.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could be such a good judge of products, most with no previous experience of them.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it works for me and if you are up there in age, worth a try.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I quite honestly should have went with my &amp;#34;gut&amp;#34; (my gut told me no way)  on this product prior to buying it</li>
            <li>I think IQ Natural Argireline Anti-Aging Serum gives more of an immediate VERY VERY MINIMAL,BARELY NOTICEABLE skin relaxing effect that you should expect from Argireline after all.</li>
            <li>Not sure yet about how well it works, but if &#x27;feels&#x27; great.</li>
            <li>The reviews thrilled me not becoz the product sounded promising, but that I found others struggling with the same chronic frowning like I do.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying this product</li>
            <li>The first day I put the product on it</li>
            <li>With multiple learning disabilities, I need to concentrate SO much more whenever I THINK.</li>
            <li>and gives your skin an overall healthy glow not in two weeks or six but that day.  </li>
            <li>I got better longer lasting results from the avocado masks that I do.</li>
            <li>The only thing that was okay was the texture, it was a serum as claimed and didn&#x27;t bother my skin,</li>
            <li>and I work hard to stay in the best physical shape.</li>
            <li>Shop at your local drug store for more reasonably priced face creams.</li>
            <li>I am positive about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Such a huge stress relief, it&#x27;s like a positive feedback loop of stress reduction.</li>
            <li>I purchased it based on reviews, but didn&#x27;t really believe that it would work like botox in any way.</li>
            <li>It restricts movement, almost as much as the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Skin really looks smoother.</li>
            <li>I frown so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much I haven&#x27;t tried when it comes to skin care.  </li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>you apply your foundation or cream blusher because it&#x27;s not enough moisture to allow makeup to be applied smoothly.  </li>
            <li>An added plus is the price point on this is reasonable....</li>
            <li>Any woman who has purchased skin care products knows in the world of skin care reasonable means you can use it and still buy groceries.  </li>
            <li>Nothing comes close to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum day and night for about two weeks, i use 3 drops for my whole face.</li>
            <li>Not seeing much change with use.</li>
            <li>This is marvelous cream it is not great but moisturizes the skin totally.</li>
            <li>you read this review, find out where the correct areas are to apply this product, use a decent (but by no means large) amount (I rub some in and then pat some over the area</li>

            <li>I use one full squirt and put it on my forehead only which is a lot</li>
            <li>Matter of fact, I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in any fine lines and definitely not even the slightest &amp;#34;botox like&amp;#34; action either.  </li>
            <li>It works decently.  </li>
            <li>An OK moisturizing serum, but with peptides, percentages matter and this one just doesn&#x27;t have enough to create any lasting improvements.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin so having to use the yogurt to hydrate and balance</li>
            <li>I will update in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>The price is right on target; have spent tons more on other products that did not give any substantive results.</li>
            <li>and I am only able to lift my eyebrows minimally, which I want, no movement&#x3D;housewives of where ever.</li>
            <li>I actually bought it primarily for a facial motor tic of the forehead and eye muscles.</li>
            <li>The Esthetician said the muscles between my eyes have become &amp;#34;very strong&amp;#34;, wish he would say that about my other muscle :)  I bought 2 bottles of Argireline 2 weeks ago, and have been applying twice a day on my entire forehead, and between my eyes.  </li>
            <li>That said, this stuff works EXACTLY the same as a product I have purchased at the recommendation of my dermatologist that to my shock and dismay cost $160.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>Product results too early to tell.</li>
            <li>But it absolutely improves the overall look and feel of your skin.  </li>
            <li>So far my skin is doing well with this serum.</li>
            <li>LOVED IT, sadly.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money trying different products on my face and this is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Sorry, if my initial review on this product was now misleading, but years ago it was effective.y opinion, any product can make them look good.</li>
            <li>As a preface to my review: I&#x27;m 40 years old, am a bit of a product junkie and have had botox several times....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 58 yr old women who has been a personal trainer for over 25 yrs</li>
            <li>for anyone considering Argireline for wrinkles, it seems that my few mild forehead lines are diminished, but I am only 29</li>
            <li>I am passionate about, I use this product and a brand new product called Nuforia</li>
            <li>I am passionate about, I use this product and a brand new product called Nuforia</li>
            <li>But other than that, I am still frowning just as much as if no product is on my forehead.</li>
            <li>and all it managed to do is dry out my skin and actually make my skin look older.</li>

            <li> The Esthetician said the muscles between my eyes have become &amp;#34;very strong&amp;#34;, wish he would say that about my other muscle :)  I bought 2 bottles of Argireline 2 weeks ago, and have been applying twice a day on my entire forehead, and between my eyes.  </li>
            <li> That said, this stuff works EXACTLY the same as a product I have purchased at the recommendation of my dermatologist that to my shock and dismay cost $160.  </li>
            <li> My face is soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> Product results too early to tell.</li>
            <li> But it absolutely improves the overall look and feel of your skin.  </li>
            <li> So far my skin is doing well with this serum.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT, sadly.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money trying different products on my face and this is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Sorry, if my initial review on this product was now misleading, but years ago it was effective.y opinion, any product can make them look good.</li>
            <li> As a preface to my review: I&#x27;m 40 years old, am a bit of a product junkie and have had botox several times....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 58 yr old women who has been a personal trainer for over 25 yrs</li>
            <li> for anyone considering Argireline for wrinkles, it seems that my few mild forehead lines are diminished, but I am only 29</li>
            <li> I am passionate about, I use this product and a brand new product called Nuforia</li>
            <li> I am passionate about, I use this product and a brand new product called Nuforia</li>
            <li> But other than that, I am still frowning just as much as if no product is on my forehead.</li>
            <li> and all it managed to do is dry out my skin and actually make my skin look older.</li>
            <li> I admit this is partially genetic, due to growing up with oily skin but partially thanks to this entire routine I&#x27;ve found that works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get angry and irritated easily</li>
            <li> and I also expected it would somewhat have a similar or slight botox action as it claims it does</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;worried&amp;#34; look in younger years, has now established itself into an &amp;#34;Angry&amp;#34; look in my mid 40&#x27;s, which get me into a lot of trouble socially.  </li>
            <li> I come from a long line of frowners</li>
            <li> a minor annoyance occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream goes a long way one only needs a drop the size of about half a pea and that does ones entire face.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it last week and got an avocado mashed it up into a creamy paste mixed half a cup of yogurt and put it on my face and neck for 30 minutes then rinsed it off and my skin was glowing, tighter and plumper from being hydrated.</li>
            <li> Oh, my cleanser is plain old Neutrogena with an exfoliating brush))</li>
            <li> Oh, my cleanser is plain old Neutrogena with an exfoliating brush))</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d let it dry thoroughly before applying my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose 2 products I could not live without?</li>
            <li> If I had to choose 2 products I could not live without?</li>
            <li> my skin is not normal for me.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer to my entire face and then in the areas that I would normal have an injection I pat another layer in.</li>
            <li> Although Argireline can&#x27;t stop my frowns totally, I&#x27;m still thankful for a less invasive alternative.</li>
            <li> But in my case at least it definitely causes noticeable muscle relaxation, so the active ingredient clearly does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> Not a dead numb, but it&#x27;s obvious the main ingredient is no joke.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s wet with the gel, so the gel, leave it there and let it soak in)....</li>
            <li> /&gt;((If you are curious about the rest of my regimen</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s wet with the gel, so the gel, leave it there and let it soak in)....</li>
            <li> /&gt;((If you are curious about the rest of my regimen</li>
            <li> maybe it is not strong enough for me..</li>
            <li> She got it Monday and is very dissatisfied with it since there is no instructions at all and the printing is so small it is hard to see the website.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase again as I think the restricted movement will be preventative, but the jury is still out on any other benefits.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with 3 other products in my skin routine</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I still frown often and deeply, but I feel it&#x27;s slightly easier to relax my brows when I become conscious of it.  </li>
            <li> I still react to things that need to be done (I don&#x27;t lie down and whistle while my house burns down)</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000 and Argireline Cell Repair Concentrate Serum also sold here at Amazon, and I have to say I like it much less.</li>
            <li> It did cost less and did less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks for reading!test subject for this product, He is 42.</li>
            <li> I can still furrow a little, but it is difficult enough so that I don&#x27;t automatically make that facial expression every time</li>
            <li> until I started using him as a little test subject for this product, He is 42.</li>
            <li> Seems to make a little difference</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of usage the difference is not as drastic as I would like, but it does help a little.</li>
            <li> Initially, I would only use Argireline for the area, but the cold weather seems to suggest the need for creams.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for a few days now</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have twelve things to do at once (which usually sends me into a fury) --</li>
            <li> Usually I have to use just an avocado.</li>
            <li> Not sure how Argireline works, but this seems to outperform all the rest.</li>
            <li> Around my period I need to add 1/2 tsp lemon juice and 1 tbs cinnamon to it because my skin get slightly oily and the only time I&#x27;ve ever had to add yogurt or buttermilk to it is after a sunburn or a really cold winter that dries and cracks the skin.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this did nothing for me, but dry my skin.</li>
            <li> and I can say it does not cause any irritations,brakeouts or anything negative at all.</li>
            <li> I use it at least tree time per day.  </li>
            <li> (At least for me.  </li>
            <li> I simply don&#x27;t get angry or irritated!</li>

            <li> It is difficult to criticize this serum because I guess it&#x27;s effectiveness depends on how dramatic of a result one expects.I used it for over 6 weeks now and I can say it does not cause any irritations,brakeouts or anything negative at all.It is non greasy,light and absorbs fast,it has very faint practically non existent scent.Sometimes I think it works sometimes I think it does nothing at all.Maybe it depends on my mood or amount of sleep I get.I guess next I will buy something else comparable to this and see if that works any better.I have to mention I am only 32 so maybe for someone older result might be more visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.I got COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000 and Argireline Cell Repair Concentrate Serum also sold here at Amazon, and I have to say I like it much less.I think IQ Natural Argireline Anti-Aging Serum gives more of an immediate VERY VERY MINIMAL,BARELY NOTICEABLE skin relaxing effect that you should expect from Argireline after all.</li>
            <li> As a preface to my review: I&#x27;m 40 years old, am a bit of a product junkie and have had botox several times.... This was my first time buying this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. I purchased it based on reviews, but didn&#x27;t really believe that it would work like botox in any way. To my surprise it does, to a certain degree. It restricts movement, almost as much as the real stuff. I apply a thin layer to my entire face and then in the areas that I would normal have an injection I pat another layer in. This is mostly on my fore head and I am only able to lift my eyebrows minimally, which I want, no movement&#x3D;housewives of where ever. I&#x27;m going to purchase again as I think the restricted movement will be preventative, but the jury is still out on any other benefits.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used it twice daily for about a month and just ordered another. Skin really looks smoother. I do not know if it is a drastic improvement, but definitely better and seems to be cumulative (longer i have used, better it seems). The price is right on target; have spent tons more on other products that did not give any substantive results. The company shipped very quickly. Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> My sister saw Argireline on Dr Oz so she called me and I found this product, so she sent me the money and I ordered.  She got it Monday and is very dissatisfied with it since there is no instructions at all and the printing is so small it is hard to see the website.  She was able to figure the website out to get instructions, so I went there and then there is no actual website.  I suggest not buying this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and shes very happy with it. This works for her. Save your money from Botox, people. Recommended.</li>
            <li> NO LONGER EFFECTIVE.  I purchased this product several years ago and it was really great.  However, they must have diluted or changed the ingredients.  I stopped using it.  They also substantially lowered the price. I suppose because there is no longer anything of value in it. Both Argreline and Hyaluronic Acid are EXCELLENT anti-aging ingredients. However, look into another product. Sorry, if my initial review on this product was now misleading, but years ago it was effective.y opinion, any product can make them look good. Anyway, it works for me and if you are up there in age, worth a try. I&#x27;ve used several expensive Lancome products and this worked much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for a few days now and I think it&#x27;s starting to make a difference. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  When it arrived the bottle looked nothing like the picture shown.  It came with a pipette.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> No results.  Used every day as advised and have been using it since purchased.</li>
            <li> Denise gives 5 stars to everything. Wish I could be such a good judge of products, most with no previous experience of them. I may try the product, haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for awhile. My face is soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> This is quit a find!  3 great products in one!!!  It works awesome. I put it on in the evening after washing my face and the use collagen over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be ordering more…..</li>
            <li> Delivery great. Product results too early to tell.</li>
            <li> The product is good and plan to buy it again. The company is wonderful and professional.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month can&#x27;t tell anything still using</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money for me. I frown so much. The first day I put the product on it felt like it worked. But other than that, I am still frowning just as much as if no product is on my forehead. I use one full squirt and put it on my forehead only which is a lot and still it does nothing for my frowning. I come from a long line of frowners maybe it is not strong enough for me.. I will keep using until all gone hoping eventually it will work. I have been using it for 3 weeks now 7 days per week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 monthes now and I love it!  I put it on in the morning after washing and moisterizing my face and can actually feel it firming up my skin.  I have spent a lot of money trying different products on my face and this is well worth the money! I&#x27;m a 58 yr old women who has been a personal trainer for over 25 yrs and I work hard to stay in the best physical shape. But there&#x27;s no exercise to keep you face in good shape except taking the best care of your skin and this works for me!</li>
            <li> The reviews thrilled me not becoz the product sounded promising, but that I found others struggling with the same chronic frowning like I do. With multiple learning disabilities, I need to concentrate SO much more whenever I THINK. Botox eases muscular tension from frowns n thus my stress level, but it&#x27;s a poison with neurological risks. My &amp;#34;worried&amp;#34; look in younger years, has now established itself into an &amp;#34;Angry&amp;#34; look in my mid 40&#x27;s, which get me into a lot of trouble socially.  The Esthetician said the muscles between my eyes have become &amp;#34;very strong&amp;#34;, wish he would say that about my other muscle :)  I bought 2 bottles of Argireline 2 weeks ago, and have been applying twice a day on my entire forehead, and between my eyes.  Initially, I would only use Argireline for the area, but the cold weather seems to suggest the need for creams.  So I&#x27;d let it dry thoroughly before applying my moisturizer. Sad to say, I still frown often and deeply, but I feel it&#x27;s slightly easier to relax my brows when I become conscious of it.  Although Argireline can&#x27;t stop my frowns totally, I&#x27;m still thankful for a less invasive alternative.</li>
            <li> I;ve been using for a while. Seems to make a little difference</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes as of yet.</li>
            <li> They delivered me a generic looking product, not this. Also, would not issue and refund or exchange.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like it claims to for treating puffy eyes 😏.  Instantly ageless does!</li>
            <li> I like the serum. I use it at least tree time per day.  I really like this serum. Thank you</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much I haven&#x27;t tried when it comes to skin care.  THIS is something I will continue to use.  It tightens!  It really does.  and gives your skin an overall healthy glow not in two weeks or six but that day.  I do believe the longer you use this the more difference you see.  Seems to be a win/win product. (At least for me.  I&#x27;m 62, Heaven help me.) You&#x27;ll want to wear a good moisturizer over it b4 you apply your foundation or cream blusher because it&#x27;s not enough moisture to allow makeup to be applied smoothly.  But it absolutely improves the overall look and feel of your skin.  An added plus is the price point on this is reasonable....sort of.  Any woman who has purchased skin care products knows in the world of skin care reasonable means you can use it and still buy groceries.  That said, this stuff works EXACTLY the same as a product I have purchased at the recommendation of my dermatologist that to my shock and dismay cost $160.  LOVED IT, sadly.  But could not afford to keep buying it.  I can&#x27;t even afford to think about the fact that I did buy it once.  Oh...let&#x27;s don&#x27;t think about it.</li>
            <li> I had to wait until I tried this serum on my skin before doing a review. I have been using it for about a month now and my skin has a glow that it never had before I am very pleased with this product. It arrived on time and was packaged properly.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use a light moisturizer over top.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this did nothing for me, but dry my skin. I have been on some of the most &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; skin care products for most of my adult life too, so I would know a thing or two about results. Yes, I applied it as directed twice daily for over two months. Nada!! I can&#x27;t recommend. Just find a &amp;#34;special deal&amp;#34; and go get Botox injections. Nothing comes close to the real thing. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> not as good  of a product as Face Whisperer nor Cellex C</li>
            <li> Best HA product I ever used!</li>
            <li> noticable results .great product</li>
            <li> This product is expensive for something that didn&#x27;t work for me.  Shop at your local drug store for more reasonably priced face creams.</li>
            <li> OK, so this arrived today, Argireline 20% serum with Matrixyl 3000 and Hyaluronic Acid. There was a noticeable instant relaxation of my forehead and facial muscles around my eyes upon application- this stuff actually works. I actually bought it primarily for a facial motor tic of the forehead and eye muscles. My tic has been 95% gone all day. Such a huge stress relief, it&#x27;s like a positive feedback loop of stress reduction. Now I can feel confident again. Such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for anyone considering Argireline for wrinkles, it seems that my few mild forehead lines are diminished, but I am only 29 so I don&#x27;t have that many yet to begin with. But in my case at least it definitely causes noticeable muscle relaxation, so the active ingredient clearly does what it is intended to do. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be similar to a product I was using in Victoria Principal&#x27;s skin care line. It did cost less and did less. I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is marvelous cream it is not great but moisturizes the skin totally. This cream goes a long way one only needs a drop the size of about half a pea and that does ones entire face.It  does a wonderful job on fine lines as well, i am so happy with it. Just what I wanted. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am using the serum as directed  and I like itbut I do not see any results yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product but i do use Instantly Ageless, my wrinkles literally disappeared in 2 minutes!!!  I buy here: [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this because there has been research finding that Botox, injected into the \\&quot;frown\\&quot; lines between the eyes, can relieve depression. I get angry and irritated easily and I noticed that if I try to keep my \\&quot;furrow\\&quot; from forming between my eyes, I don&#x27;t get as irritated. I stumbled upon argireline and decided to try it. Botox sounded too scary and too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been absolutely amazing for me. I dabbed some between my eyebrows, spreading it to the middle of each eyebrow. I simply don&#x27;t get angry or irritated! My son dumped cinnamon on the bed -- no problem, I just cleaned it up. I have twelve things to do at once (which usually sends me into a fury) -- no problem, I just do them one at a time. I&#x27;m sure this is how \\&quot;normal\\&quot; people always are -- but to me it&#x27;s a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I dab it on, I find it difficult to \\&quot;furrow\\&quot; my brow. I can still furrow a little, but it is difficult enough so that I don&#x27;t automatically make that facial expression every time a minor annoyance occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to get rid of my worry and anxiety, which I didn&#x27;t think were triggered by my furrowing. I still react to things that need to be done (I don&#x27;t lie down and whistle while my house burns down) but I don&#x27;t feel stressed about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who cares about the cosmetic benefits -- this stuff makes me happy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once a day since I got it and all it managed to do is dry out my skin and actually make my skin look older. I stopped using it last week and got an avocado mashed it up into a creamy paste mixed half a cup of yogurt and put it on my face and neck for 30 minutes then rinsed it off and my skin was glowing, tighter and plumper from being hydrated. I have normal to oily skin so having to use the yogurt to hydrate and balance my skin is not normal for me. Usually I have to use just an avocado. Around my period I need to add 1/2 tsp lemon juice and 1 tbs cinnamon to it because my skin get slightly oily and the only time I&#x27;ve ever had to add yogurt or buttermilk to it is after a sunburn or a really cold winter that dries and cracks the skin. The product claims to be as good as injections and honestly I don&#x27;t see it. I got better longer lasting results from the avocado masks that I do.</li>
            <li> I did not feel this product was well represented.  It said it would do a lot of things that it did not do.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is all that I now use on my face</li>
            <li> Not sure how Argireline works, but this seems to outperform all the rest. Will Definitely re-order. Has hyaluronic acid also. One thing that could lower rating is the runny quality of the liquid.</li>
            <li> Argireline DOES relax facial muscles, it doesn&#x27;t erase time. Nothing does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing, I have to admit. I use this in combination with 3 other products in my skin routine and I&#x27;ve never EVER been happier with my skin. At 44, I am also always guess at 10 years or so younger than I am. I admit this is partially genetic, due to growing up with oily skin but partially thanks to this entire routine I&#x27;ve found that works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, please know if you have acne prone or oily skin, it is fine to use this product. I&#x27;m always terrified to try something new as I am afraid I will break out horribly but this is a serum that soaks into your skin leaving no greasy residue nor is it irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, not only immediately but over time. After using it for about a week, I noticed it working better and better. I only apply it to the places where I used to be injected with botox. If you are appying this serum under your eyes, that is the wrong area. You needn&#x27;t apply the serum to the area where the wrinkles are but where the cluster of muscles are that contract to make your forehead, eyes, mouth.... wrinkle. I think this product should come with a chart that shows you where those injection areas are in case you have never had Botox before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can look up &amp;#34;where is Botox injected&amp;#34; in google and then go to images, and see the areas to apply this product. I promise it does work. It has work for my fiance&#x27;, my sister, my mother. I had never tried this product before nor any product by this company. What I was looking for when I found it was 20% argireline so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works on it&#x27;s own. At this point in using the product regularly, I can feel the numbing in those muscles when I apply then touch those areas. Not a dead numb, but it&#x27;s obvious the main ingredient is no joke. My fiance&#x27; has DRAMATIC results from it. His forehead when he frowns is ridiculous.... until I started using him as a little test subject for this product, He is 42. He has good skin otherwise. This product relaxes the muscles more so than it does mine and it is amazing with mine. I am not joking. I do not benefit in any way from this review. I am not affiliated with this company. In fact, I tried to cancel my order but they had already shipped it. I&#x27;m glad they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read this review, find out where the correct areas are to apply this product, use a decent (but by no means large) amount (I rub some in and then pat some over the area so it&#x27;s wet with the gel, so the gel, leave it there and let it soak in).... you will NOT be disappointed. I am positive about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((If you are curious about the rest of my regimen I am passionate about, I use this product and a brand new product called Nuforia that is insanely amazing (for all skin types) in the morning, Hyaluronic serum in my moisturizer before make-up and then at night, I use Dr.Denese Firming Pads, and a Retinol Serum that includes Hyaluronic in it..... If I had to choose 2 products I could not live without? and only two? I&#x27;d choose Hyaluronic Serum and be knocking my head against the wall between Nuforia and this product. It&#x27;s that good.

He has good skin otherwise. This product relaxes the muscles more so than it does mine and it is amazing with mine. I am not joking. I do not benefit in any way from this review. I am not affiliated with this company. In fact, I tried to cancel my order but they had already shipped it.

            <li> Not sure yet about how well it works, but if &#x27;feels&#x27; great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum day and night for about two weeks, i use 3 drops for my whole face. It blends quickly and then I put a moisturizer and sunscreen over it in the a.m and a retinol cream over it in the p.m.  I finished my Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder advanced night repair and didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 again. So far my skin is doing well with this serum. I will update in a few more weeks. At the moment I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works decently.  Takes several days of usage to notice a difference.  After a few weeks of usage the difference is not as drastic as I would like, but it does help a little.</li>
            <li> Good product but the pump dispenses more product than you need</li>
            <li> Not seeing much change with use. No directions included in package.  Makes me wonder about product. No way to return product. Nothing!!!!</li>
            <li> An OK moisturizing serum, but with peptides, percentages matter and this one just doesn&#x27;t have enough to create any lasting improvements.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I decided to try this product...NOT expecting a facelift by any means and definitely not expecting miracles either, but I did expect it to do what the manufacturer claims it would do and that&#x27;s to minimize fine lines (it didn&#x27;t) and I also expected it would somewhat have a similar or slight botox action as it claims it does (but again, it didn&#x27;t.)  Matter of fact, I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in any fine lines and definitely not even the slightest &amp;#34;botox like&amp;#34; action either.  I quite honestly should have went with my &amp;#34;gut&amp;#34; (my gut told me no way)  on this product prior to buying it but I figured I would try it so I could scratch it off my list.  This one is scratched off my list permanently.  The claims of this product are a fraud.  I get better results from Oil of Olay. Save your time and definitely your money.  The only thing that was okay was the texture, it was a serum as claimed and didn&#x27;t bother my skin, no break-outs. That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars, probably should only give 2 but I&#x27;m feeling generous tonight for some reason.</li>
