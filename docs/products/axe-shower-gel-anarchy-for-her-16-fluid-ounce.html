            <li>This product smells wonderful, while you are in the shower.  </li>

            <li>The pricing of this product was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for what it is.</li>
            <li>Great smell</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it and have to keep typing til it tells me I can submit lol</li>
            <li>It was good to know tha Axe makes some fragrances for ladies.  </li>
            <li>but it does bubble/lather good in a scrubby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>she loved it</li>
            <li>Love this wash,smells and feels great</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li>My daughter wears  Axe body spray for women, I was glad to find the shower gel for a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li>Not my signature fragrance but nice to wear as a Springtime fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is very, very lightly fragranced.</li>
            <li>I will probably continue buying it since I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>would recommend Unilever design this more as a body scrub and then a lotion for after the shower.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more feminine.</li>
            <li>Glad i bought 2.</li>
            <li>it has a clean fresh scent it washes of with good ease and</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it smells great and for the size, I&#x27;m not missing out on anything.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh floral scent!</li>
            <li>I love this scent because it&#x27;s mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I remember thinking that conditioner was well justified during the rinse cycle, but didn&#x27;t recall the sensation until the moment I turned off the shower.</li>
            <li>I would spend your money on something else with a stronger scent unless you like the fragrance free stuff</li>
            <li>And the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>do agree with the one poster, the men&#x27;s version of Axe is significantly stronger.  </li>
            <li>Was so excited to try this body wash as I also ordered the body spray.</li>
            <li>One wash through my hair, and I felt clean.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who feels the need to feel clean.</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t leave a clean feeling like I hoped</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft cherry fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Basic body wash is more just a quick rinse and more suited for a guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, just right for my daughter!</li>
            <li>I finally have something I love that don&#x27;t have to steal from my man!</li>
            <li>The body wash has a sweet scent that is very soothing to me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, not your typical 90%</li>
            <li>But, its simple and easy like axe is known to be.</li>
            <li>It may seem strong for some, but it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin at the same strength.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Most of my other body washes don&#x27;t leave a lingering scent that&#x27;s strong enough to really matter after I leave the shower</li>
            <li>My son has used axe for years and I really like that they have now included us women.</li>
            <li>However, I feel like I have to use more of it to achieve the same amount of cleanliness with a loofah because a drop of this doesn&#x27;t go as far as, say, Bath and Body Works shower gel.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m excited that Axe is finally offering products for woman.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a new years resolution for hair.</li>
            <li>If I was religious I would recommend this product to sinners because I&#x27;m certain it would wash the heathens out of whatever heathens are washed.  </li>
            <li>the scent is barely there.</li>

            <li> the smell is weird and the bottle is wrapped in saran wrap and the fake label of AXE peels off.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Since this shower gel is intended for women let me start off by informing you that I myself am a man. We recently ran out of shampoo. I&#x27;m not certain how it happened, but I assume it involves shampoo thievery. I did not forget, and I don&#x27;t need to be reminded every six months that we are running out of shampoo. As you can see where this is going I admit to my manly stereotype and using this product &amp;#34;not in accordance with the products intended use&amp;#34;. I slid by the skin of my teeth that this product did not have a federal warning on the label. This stuff is amazing, not your typical 90% fru-fru 10% water pink label stuff my wife usually brings home. If this was fuel it would be leaded. One wash through my hair, and I felt clean. If I was religious I would recommend this product to sinners because I&#x27;m certain it would wash the heathens out of whatever heathens are washed.  If I wasn&#x27;t fearful of my life for using the only substance that can pass as shampoo before my wife&#x27;s shower this would have been my choice of body wash. I remember thinking that conditioner was well justified during the rinse cycle, but didn&#x27;t recall the sensation until the moment I turned off the shower. Being the man that I am, and that I don&#x27;t forget, I assumed it was intentional. Now that I have dried off I have that &amp;#34;new haircut&amp;#34; feeling. You know the one like a giant weight has been lifted. It&#x27;s like a new years resolution for hair. I would recommend this product to anyone who feels the need to feel clean.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff! The only complaint I have is that is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> My daughter wears  Axe body spray for women, I was glad to find the shower gel for a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> My son has used axe for years and I really like that they have now included us women. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It is what it says and does what it says. Very pleased with it and have to keep typing til it tells me I can submit lol</li>
            <li> i would buy this a again it has a clean fresh scent it washes of with good ease and it suds well.</li>
            <li> It was good to know tha Axe makes some fragrances for ladies.  It has a nice soft cherry fragrance.  Layers well with the body spray.  Lasts about half the day.  Can touch up the spray.  Not my signature fragrance but nice to wear as a Springtime fragrance.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I finally have something I love that don&#x27;t have to steal from my man! I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because I like the pink. the scent is barely there. when I get out of the shower there is no scent left on your body. It is very, very lightly fragranced. my husband&#x27;s axe is way stronger. I am very disappointed. I would spend your money on something else with a stronger scent unless you like the fragrance free stuff then this is for you.</li>
            <li> No problem with this product. I am fan of this product. The packaging was excellent. The pricing of this product was great. My sister recommend this product and from ever since I have been using this product</li>
            <li> I bought the 16 oz bottle of Axe shower gel yesterday in Walmart and only paid $3.97 for it.  Amazon price seems way out of line.</li>
            <li> The product is counterfeit.  the smell is weird and the bottle is wrapped in saran wrap and the fake label of AXE peels off.  The stuff might well be dish washing liquid for all I know since it smells like a cleaning product and not body wash.  and the consistency is strange unlike body wash. It&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, while you are in the shower.  However, the scent does not stay with you once you leave the shower.  I will probably continue buying it since I love the scent.  Most of my other body washes don&#x27;t leave a lingering scent that&#x27;s strong enough to really matter after I leave the shower anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with the one poster, the men&#x27;s version of Axe is significantly stronger.  But I&#x27;m excited that Axe is finally offering products for woman.</li>
            <li> Love this wash,smells and feels great</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, just right for my daughter! Home delivery so I don&#x27;t have to fight crowds at stores is the best!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to try this body wash as I also ordered the body spray. The body wash has a sweet scent that is very soothing to me. It may seem strong for some, but it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin at the same strength.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t leave a clean feeling like I hoped but it does bubble/lather good in a scrubby.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Unilever design this more as a body scrub and then a lotion for after the shower. That&#x27;s more feminine. Basic body wash is more just a quick rinse and more suited for a guy.&lt;br /&gt;No matter what may seem negative I do like this product. It&#x27;s great for what it is. And the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I received this product because I-as ignorant as I seem to be when it comes to reading the label-didn&#x27;t expect it to be so big. There&#x27;s a lot of body wash here! However, I feel like I have to use more of it to achieve the same amount of cleanliness with a loofah because a drop of this doesn&#x27;t go as far as, say, Bath and Body Works shower gel. Nonetheless, it smells great and for the size, I&#x27;m not missing out on anything. I would definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Great smell she loved it lok</li>
            <li> smell is very delicate, unlike the boy axe gel.</li>
            <li> I love this scent because it&#x27;s mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Glad i bought 2. Need to keep stock in my shower. Love the fresh floral scent! But, its simple and easy like axe is known to be.</li>
