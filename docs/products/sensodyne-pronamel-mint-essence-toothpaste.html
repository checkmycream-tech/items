            <li>Also comes in 3 pleasant flavors, no after taste.  </li>
            <li>These are both funded by GSK so they should be looked with caution, but both point to superior mineralization using ProNamel.</li>
            <li>Good luck and remember to use Google Scholar (</li>
            <li>This is really a good toothpaste.</li>

            <li>Tastes good.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have SLS, the avoidance of which is supposed to be good for preventing cankers.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel good</li>
            <li>Cleans well and tastes good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>every so often there might be a sale promotion, but saving on fuel and hours shopping at the grocery store, why not use our time wisely and shop from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste foams nicely and tastes pleasant.</li>
            <li>kind of mint, just a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>I whiten my teeth, and this helps me to take very good care of them and be free of any discomfort.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and I will continue using this brand which, in my opinion, is head and shoulders over the others.</li>
            <li>And the flavor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product for me, and I love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Using Pronamel has helped a great deal - now my teeth are smooth to my tongue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>I honestly think this toothpaste has helped me with my sensitivity issues on my teeth.</li>
            <li>any kind of acids</li>
            <li>It effectively desesitizes teeth and smoothes them over.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>also tried sealing a crack in a piece of jewelry - it did that effectively too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My teeth are beautiful, and this product is part of my nice smile.</li>
            <li>Ideally, floss after each meal is the best protection (more important than brushing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deduct one point because like nearly all products on the market it has fluoride.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those that have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Best sensitive toothpaste that I have found.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste I have found for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>This product is the best for sensitive teeth &amp; the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste because it is perfect for my sensitive tooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff tastes mildly and pleasantly minty.  </li>
            <li>Good mild but minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>but I love it now.</li>
            <li>love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li>Being an Amazon Prime member, I immediately subscribed to Sensodyne toothpaste so that I can save even more.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, if you look at the reviews for the mouthwash you&#x27;ll see that most people agree with the staining issue.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say that I would do better if I used anything else.</li>
            <li>Magic; lifesaver--</li>
            <li>I had not been able to drink anything with ice without a straw.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap, so the price always makes me think twice, but honestly, it&#x27;s worked so well</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of years and have outstanding results relieving sensitivity and have purchased it on Amazon with gift certificates earned by taking surveys that reward with Amazon Gift Certificates</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste</li>
            <li>many of my teeth were having</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended and I&#x27;m so glad he did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more medicine-like.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Japanese tooth paste doesn&#x27;t work well to me, but this is the best to me.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li>I bought this paste which comes in a can with a dispenser top which when pushed dispenses a set amount of paste.</li>
            <li>Taste is okay</li>
            <li>Seems to a be better.</li>
            <li>It is perfect not only for sensitivity issues but also to protect and strengthen tooth enamel.</li>
            <li>I purchase it through subscribe and save to get more savings.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love Sensodyne toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love Sensodyne, but this product needs to be pulled from the shelves IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>That being said my teeth were healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been using sensodyne toothpaste because I have had a crown split off in the root but with no sensitivity, and I heard it \\&quot;filled in &#x27;\\&quot; cracks!  </li>
            <li>And  4 dollars toothpaste or 600 dollars at the dentist for the works of a competent person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this for the convenience of having more than one tube on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>I read many complaints on another review website about it after the fact.</li>
            <li>Once you switch, you&#x27;ll be amazed that your breath is awesome, mouth clean and fresh feeling without that super strong aftertaste.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the packaging is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste for those with any types of sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>There is no other on the regular market to match in being non abrasive, clean the teeth great, whiten and brighten, and have an excellent taste.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t see how it has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about this product!  </li>
            <li>I use a Sonicare toothbrush and was brushing my teeth twice and flossing so many times just to get clean teeth.</li>
            <li>The taste is okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li>The slight touch of mint is quite delightful.</li>
            <li>ProNamel did clean my teeth, but I don&#x27;t think it is as good at preventing sensitivity as the regular kind.  </li>
            <li>There are pastes available on Amazon (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been years since my mouth has been this comfortable post brushing.</li>
            <li>Enjoy...</li>
            <li>Great price for an item I use twice daily.  </li>
            <li>My hygienist was surprised at how good the price was compared to brick and mortar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched over to Tom&#x27;s of Maine Sensitive toothpaste, however, and find it more effective at soothing/reducing sensitivity.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is of the best toothpastes you can buy and provided amazon doesn&#x27;t trick us by raising the price (as they are with too many other products), it&#x27;s priced very fairly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BTW, most of the top people in the FDA once worked as high level food industry executives.</li>
            <li>After using it for 3 days my teeth are feeling smooth and clean once again.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m more interested in enamel.</li>
            <li>Now that is worth it in itself!  </li>
            <li>I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>But then I discovered Pronamel (also by Sensodyne) and even though it costs more, I am willing to pay it because I like the toothpaste and the tube</li>
            <li>While the paste did get my teeth clean, there was no change in the sensitivity level.</li>
            <li>Save your money if you want clean teeth.</li>
            <li>anything cool</li>
            <li>I believe it really does work. : )</li>
            <li>do not have enough good things to say about this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is great for people who have sensitivity in their teeth due to enamel erosion from drinking acidic or sweet beverages.  </li>
            <li>I can actually drink it, while eating hot soup - that&#x27;s how amazing this stuff is!</li>
            <li>This has helped that tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I think that is why it doesn&#x27;t tear up the inside of my mouth like many toothpastes with high SLS are prone to do.  </li>
            <li>Best toothpaste I ever used due to my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>so you go through the can faster and will need to buy MORE sooner than you might normally have.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to complain about...definitely a high 5 star rating on this product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally went again last week--no new cavities, everything in great shape.</li>
            <li>so I am well aware of what clean teeth should look and feel like.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth minty taste and texture but doesn&#x27;t foam much like some people appreciate.  </li>
            <li>I have a very reactive tongue and decided to try a toothpaste which is SLS free.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely helps with my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>so picking this up is worth it.</li>
            <li>Even better since this stuff doesn&#x27;t foam like many more popular toothpastes, I rarely vomit after brushing with Sensodyne (I&#x27;d vomit at least once a day for years on regular toothpaste).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive gums and protecting teeth against wear overall.</li>
            <li>It sure feels like it helps with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>the toothpaste itself is pretty good, the taste is somewhat strange, but it does work!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>what with all that relatively more frequent daytime eating activities.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>Everything GSK claims is true of Pronamel is equally true of regular Sensodyne or Crest Sensivity or good old flouride toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I had a really sensitive spot on one of my teeth, just under the gum line, and I thought for sure</li>
            <li>Unlike regular Synsodyne toothpaste, this one has a nice mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it and better than many other sensitivity toothpastes I have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dentists highly recommend this toothpaste and that&#x27;s good enough for me!  </li>
            <li>After a week I noticed that my teeth were becoming sensitive.</li>
            <li>After about a month my teeth were becoming almost transparent and extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>I thought the original was for the older generation</li>
            <li>I can definitely say though that for SLS-free options, I&#x27;ve found nothing better.</li>
            <li>The only way you&#x27;ll be able to see if it works for you is to try it.  </li>
            <li>Since I am an avid coffee drinker I figured that by switching to the ProNamel</li>
            <li>but there are many advances in medical science</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m definitely going out to get some more of this.</li>
            <li>This makes business breakfasts and everything else you eat so much better regardless of when your brushed your teeth.    </li>
            <li>The reason so many people have gum diseases and gum problems are we no longer drink grass feed (organic) mile or butter made from such milk.</li>
            <li>I have about used my first tube of toothpaste and my teeth</li>
            <li>Well for the first time ever I could feel it building up between all my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have immediate sensitivity along the gumline of my molars (what dentists call &amp;#34;young tooth&amp;#34;) when I eat fruit or add lemon juice to food and forget to swish some water in my mouth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste and my family&#x27;s also - only wish it came in larger size- a bit more spendy though.</li>
            <li>While my mouth is doing OK on it, the taste has left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>yourself the horror and buy regular Sensodyne, or like me, swap it for another favorite: Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste better than either of those brands&#x27; offerings by taste alone, but especially for the reduction in tooth sensitivity to temperature.</li>
            <li>~SMILE~ That said, I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>One less trip to the store means more family time!</li>
            <li>It is easy to get out of the tube up to the last drop, doesn&#x27;t need to be folded from the bottom like other toothpaste and stands up nicely on the counter.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is I feel like it doesn&#x27;t keep my breath as fresh as some other toothpastes which another why using a mouthwash is good.</li>
            <li>Secondly, isn&#x27;t that clever of them, forcing you to use more than you really want</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is very particular about her dental hygiene, she is the one who got me to switch from colgate/crest etc.  </li>
            <li>Now I can tolerate hot or cold with perfect comfort.</li>
            <li>This despite consuming, daily, a large number of chocolate or candied espresso beans, and about 3-5 cups of strong coffee/tea; plus I still don&#x27;t sleep much.</li>
            <li>Acid wear used to leave my teeth feeling gritty like fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste on a regular basis there has been a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had problems with my enamel my whole life, until this</li>
            <li>really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you, I still can&#x27;t bite straight into ice cream or anything...</li>
            <li>Is what I was looking for and came fast.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>you are experiencing issues with tooth sensitivity, you might want to give this product a try for a whole month.  </li>
            <li>It looked exactly like normal staining but appeared at an extreamly accelerated rate.  </li>
            <li>I have had the same experience with Crest Pro Health (alcohol free</li>
            <li>hope that one day, the manufactures of toothpaste will realize that not everyone wants to have fluoride in their toothpaste.</li>
            <li>really does help with sensitivity</li>
            <li>I was skeptic that it could really work, but it did.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Not as much fluoride as I would like to help protect enamel.</li>
            <li>There is a simple, cheap way to keep tooth surfaces from being eroded by food acids.</li>
            <li>have so much tartar build up</li>
            <li>Recently because of mouth and tongue sensitivity issues, my dentist witched me to Cari Free.</li>
            <li>This stuff works as intended and I really like the taste.</li>
            <li>I really look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>This formulation still cleans very well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much about it at the time and continued using it.</li>
            <li>Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product since the original post back in 2014, and I&#x27;ve really come around to it.</li>
            <li>Most other SLS-free toothpastes on the market are \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (though Toms of Maine uses SLS) and a lot of them are slimy.</li>
            <li>price isn&#x27;t much more than buying any other toothpaste</li>
            <li>I have been using it like normal toothpaste, and the crack at the root and gum line is 90 percent healed!  </li>
            <li>Sensodyne ProNamel products seem to work pretty well for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you start using first time, you will probably feel that toothpaste kinda hurts your teeth, but that&#x27;s the protect action and you won&#x27;t feel it anymore</li>
            <li>When I saw this kind in a two-pack for the same price as a single regular Sensodyne, I jumped at the deal, thinking it would be even better than regular Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have become a new believer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole new world.</li>
            <li>I have tried Arm and Hammer, Colgate Sensitive (close but not as good), Aqua Fresh Sensitive and a few generic types</li>
            <li>I think it definitely whitens better than the regular Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(After being a perfect angel child about brushing/candy and never having a single cavity--even through a few years of braces--until my early twenties, suddenly, boom--3 in one year.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High fluoride content and helps with sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste was highly recommended to me by our dentist.</li>
            <li>I think that it has really helped with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>i bought this not so much because i have sensitive teeth, but for the pro-namel.</li>
            <li>It is not quite normal toothpaste consistency, but who cares.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the pains, it does reduce it tremendously where it&#x27;s only a discomfort versus \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>I used to drink a lot of soda which caught up to me and about when I was 19 my teeth became very sensitive.</li>
            <li>using the toothpaste does the job, but I would also using another mechanism, if you have very sensitive teeth, like a mouth wash.</li>
            <li>but for some reason my teeth became very sensitive after i started using it.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive, and Sensodyne works well to alleviate that.  </li>
            <li>i really does work, but the downside for me was that the clean sensation doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t eat any more because of how bad it hurt, but I was actually able to finish it with that much pain.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>However, buyers should be aware that you must stick with it for a number of weeks in order for it to work properly.  </li>
            <li>This is a more expensive toothpaste, but it is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>As you put your favorite paste on a toothbrush, brush as usual.</li>
            <li>It will remineralize your teeth no better than most over-the-counter toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I tried some of the other Sensodyne toothpastes and all work quite well for sensitivity though I always go back to Sensodyne Pronamel because it is not gritty, has a mild mint flavor, and is smooth.</li>
            <li>Because there are a ton of other sensitivity toothpastes out there that address sensitivity and clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean (not stripped like other toothpastes</li>
            <li>It does not whiten very much, but I suspect that most whitening agents are probably not great for the enamel anyway.</li>
            <li>I also started using it while bleaching, and it completely cut out the sensitivity that comes along with that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years to handle my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Pronamel was recommended by my dentist for my sensitive teeth and works well.  </li>
            <li>My dentist told me to start using Pronamel because of my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>In my early days as a Prime member, I purchased some toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>and none can compare to the relief I get from Sensodyne Sensitive Teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only real change I made was switching to Pronamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth all of my life.</li>
            <li>sensitive problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>44 yrs old.</li>
            <li>And a soft tooth brush...</li>
            <li>My gum used to be quite sensitive until I use this tooth paste.</li>
            <li>hurt if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>My teeth are not as sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The only real difference between the two products is that ProNamel toothpaste does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.     </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than local shop.</li>
            <li>As far as sensitivity the stuff works.  </li>
            <li>As far as any help in heat/cold sensitivity, I don&#x27;t know if this product helps because I don&#x27;t have that issue (and don&#x27;t eat ice-cream or chew on ice).  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at the level of protection on my teeth that continues even after eating lunch.  </li>
            <li>my teeth were damn near clear after a month of using this product</li>
            <li>For years I thought I was sensitive to &#x27;mint&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive gums and this toothpaste was recommended by my DDS.  </li>
            <li>Dentist gave me a sample of ProEnamel and within a month my tooth was no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and ever since I discovered it I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Daytime I use regular fluoride toothpaste since the enamel protection wouldn&#x27;t really stay on as well,</li>
            <li>I bought this because Rembrandt canceled it&#x27;s Gentle White toothpaste.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this has (so far) saved me from dentures.</li>
            <li>As for restoring enamel, I suppose my teeth feel a bit stronger but only time and a dentist will really tell me.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It also has helped my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from sensitive teeth for years.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of using this toothpaste the pain went completely away.</li>
            <li>I have had sensitive teeth and gums for years and this Pronamel is a lighter consistency.</li>
            <li>I was much too lazy for the full Dr Ellie system--</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is fantastic, the flavor unlike another reviewer indicated is rather mellow compared to nearly every other toothpaste I have tried, the toothpaste is not gritty, and works</li>
            <li>can couple this purchase with other personal care items needed to get the \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; for orders over $25.</li>
            <li>When I use my mouth wash (crest pro-health), there&#x27;s even less pain when I eat something sweet or</li>
            <li>I felt a significant difference after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I had to use it for about one week and the difference compared to all other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used including the regular sensodyne is significant.</li>
            <li>and I end up with way more than I would usually use, and there&#x27;s this big GLOP of paste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive, but I can justify it because spending a bit more on toothpaste is a lot better than paying dental fee&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>this stuff is the same as Crest Sensitive as far as I&#x27;m concerned...and neither of them WORK like Sensodyne does in decreasing pain in sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>-- my teeth were back to normal in minutes.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive than regular toothpaste, but worth it.</li>
            <li>, one thing my dentist encouraged was the use of dental floss at least once a day and very light pressure for two minutes for the entire mouth.</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested that I try a toothpaste without SLS, since it&#x27;s known to irritate sores, and he thought it could be the reason my canker sores were getting so big and lasting so long instead of healing quickly and remaining</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve quite literally tried every toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my hands on, because my teeth are very sensitive to hot and cold.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were so sensitive - I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything too cold or too hot, and certainly not cold and hot together.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a bit more expensive than the regular fluoride toothpaste, but is worth it for the extra enamel protection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To say the least it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>(And I&#x27;m also pretty sure they&#x27;re also whiter than they used to be, when I was using whatever Colgate/Crest whitening nonsense and not drinking coffee--which is crazy.)</li>
            <li>Apparently, chronic sleep deprivation compromises your immune system in a way that can exacerbate tooth decay.</li>
            <li>The calcium trick not only fixed tooth sensitivity, my fillings stayed where they belonged.</li>
            <li>And, apparently, I am too aggressive with my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;There has been improvement.</li>
            <li>I used to use regular Sensodyne as I have sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li>Furthermore, many use cinnamon as a flavoring, which can also be irritating.</li>
            <li>If you look at the label and compare the active ingredients of both toothpastes, they are EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li>one day I experienced such painful sensitivity that I went in for a dentist&#x27;s appointment.  </li>
            <li>I also found the taste to be a little funny as well.    </li>
            <li>Just a little info first</li>
            <li>This is largely because of the fluoride but possibly also because of the potassium nitrate (KNO3) in ProNamel and other desensitizing toothpastes.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brand toothpastes and this is the only one that really seems to help.</li>
            <li>for a toothpaste purported to combat sensitivity, it&#x27;s strange how it made my teeth sensitive when i didn&#x27;t have problems with sensitivity to begin with.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I first started it, but after a few months, my sensitivity stopped.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true that this toothpaste has a rather...unpleasant taste (at least to me).  </li>
            <li>and although I still have a slight sensitivity, I find myself not thinking about it as much.</li>
            <li>Works well for sensitive teeth and doesn&#x27;t wear down an already soft enamel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice pain anymore when I eat certain things and the taste takes a little getting used to</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> My gums don&#x27;t hurt, and best of all I can brush 3 times a day like I&#x27;m supposed to and not have the pain associated with it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> I need a SLS-free brand, and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with Tom&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> Good marketing ploy, guys!</li>

            <li> Buying it at this price and having it delivered to my door is very nice.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  </li>
            <li> Also comes in 3 pleasant flavors, no after taste.  </li>
            <li> These are both funded by GSK so they should be looked with caution, but both point to superior mineralization using ProNamel.</li>
            <li> Good luck and remember to use Google Scholar (</li>
            <li> This is really a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so I guess it must be good.  </li>
            <li> so use it wisely.  </li>
            <li> Tastes good.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have SLS, the avoidance of which is supposed to be good for preventing cankers.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel good</li>
            <li> Cleans well and tastes good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> every so often there might be a sale promotion, but saving on fuel and hours shopping at the grocery store, why not use our time wisely and shop from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste foams nicely and tastes pleasant.</li>
            <li> kind of mint, just a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I whiten my teeth, and this helps me to take very good care of them and be free of any discomfort.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and I will continue using this brand which, in my opinion, is head and shoulders over the others.</li>
            <li> And the flavor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product for me, and I love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Using Pronamel has helped a great deal - now my teeth are smooth to my tongue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I honestly think this toothpaste has helped me with my sensitivity issues on my teeth.</li>
            <li> any kind of acids</li>
            <li> It effectively desesitizes teeth and smoothes them over.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> also tried sealing a crack in a piece of jewelry - it did that effectively too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My teeth are beautiful, and this product is part of my nice smile.</li>
            <li> Ideally, floss after each meal is the best protection (more important than brushing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deduct one point because like nearly all products on the market it has fluoride.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those that have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Best sensitive toothpaste that I have found.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have found for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for sensitive teeth &amp; the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste because it is perfect for my sensitive tooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes mildly and pleasantly minty.  </li>
            <li> Good mild but minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but I love it now.</li>
            <li> love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li> Being an Amazon Prime member, I immediately subscribed to Sensodyne toothpaste so that I can save even more.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, if you look at the reviews for the mouthwash you&#x27;ll see that most people agree with the staining issue.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say that I would do better if I used anything else.</li>
            <li> Magic; lifesaver--</li>
            <li> I had not been able to drink anything with ice without a straw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap, so the price always makes me think twice, but honestly, it&#x27;s worked so well</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and have outstanding results relieving sensitivity and have purchased it on Amazon with gift certificates earned by taking surveys that reward with Amazon Gift Certificates</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste</li>
            <li> many of my teeth were having</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended and I&#x27;m so glad he did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more medicine-like.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Japanese tooth paste doesn&#x27;t work well to me, but this is the best to me.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> I bought this paste which comes in a can with a dispenser top which when pushed dispenses a set amount of paste.</li>
            <li> Taste is okay</li>
            <li> Seems to a be better.</li>
            <li> It is perfect not only for sensitivity issues but also to protect and strengthen tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> I purchase it through subscribe and save to get more savings.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love Sensodyne toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love Sensodyne, but this product needs to be pulled from the shelves IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> That being said my teeth were healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using sensodyne toothpaste because I have had a crown split off in the root but with no sensitivity, and I heard it \\&quot;filled in &#x27;\\&quot; cracks!  </li>
            <li> And  4 dollars toothpaste or 600 dollars at the dentist for the works of a competent person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this for the convenience of having more than one tube on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I read many complaints on another review website about it after the fact.</li>
            <li> Once you switch, you&#x27;ll be amazed that your breath is awesome, mouth clean and fresh feeling without that super strong aftertaste.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the packaging is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste for those with any types of sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> There is no other on the regular market to match in being non abrasive, clean the teeth great, whiten and brighten, and have an excellent taste.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see how it has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about this product!  </li>
            <li> I use a Sonicare toothbrush and was brushing my teeth twice and flossing so many times just to get clean teeth.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> The slight touch of mint is quite delightful.</li>
            <li> ProNamel did clean my teeth, but I don&#x27;t think it is as good at preventing sensitivity as the regular kind.  </li>
            <li> There are pastes available on Amazon (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since my mouth has been this comfortable post brushing.</li>
            <li> Enjoy...</li>
            <li> Great price for an item I use twice daily.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist was surprised at how good the price was compared to brick and mortar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched over to Tom&#x27;s of Maine Sensitive toothpaste, however, and find it more effective at soothing/reducing sensitivity.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is of the best toothpastes you can buy and provided amazon doesn&#x27;t trick us by raising the price (as they are with too many other products), it&#x27;s priced very fairly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BTW, most of the top people in the FDA once worked as high level food industry executives.</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 days my teeth are feeling smooth and clean once again.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m more interested in enamel.</li>
            <li> Now that is worth it in itself!  </li>
            <li> I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> But then I discovered Pronamel (also by Sensodyne) and even though it costs more, I am willing to pay it because I like the toothpaste and the tube</li>
            <li> While the paste did get my teeth clean, there was no change in the sensitivity level.</li>
            <li> Save your money if you want clean teeth.</li>
            <li> anything cool</li>
            <li> I believe it really does work. : )</li>
            <li> do not have enough good things to say about this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great for people who have sensitivity in their teeth due to enamel erosion from drinking acidic or sweet beverages.  </li>
            <li> I can actually drink it, while eating hot soup - that&#x27;s how amazing this stuff is!</li>
            <li> This has helped that tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I think that is why it doesn&#x27;t tear up the inside of my mouth like many toothpastes with high SLS are prone to do.  </li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I ever used due to my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> so you go through the can faster and will need to buy MORE sooner than you might normally have.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about...definitely a high 5 star rating on this product!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally went again last week--no new cavities, everything in great shape.</li>
            <li> so I am well aware of what clean teeth should look and feel like.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth minty taste and texture but doesn&#x27;t foam much like some people appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I have a very reactive tongue and decided to try a toothpaste which is SLS free.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely helps with my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> so picking this up is worth it.</li>
            <li> Even better since this stuff doesn&#x27;t foam like many more popular toothpastes, I rarely vomit after brushing with Sensodyne (I&#x27;d vomit at least once a day for years on regular toothpaste).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive gums and protecting teeth against wear overall.</li>
            <li> It sure feels like it helps with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> the toothpaste itself is pretty good, the taste is somewhat strange, but it does work!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> what with all that relatively more frequent daytime eating activities.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money</li>
            <li> Everything GSK claims is true of Pronamel is equally true of regular Sensodyne or Crest Sensivity or good old flouride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had a really sensitive spot on one of my teeth, just under the gum line, and I thought for sure</li>
            <li> Unlike regular Synsodyne toothpaste, this one has a nice mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it and better than many other sensitivity toothpastes I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dentists highly recommend this toothpaste and that&#x27;s good enough for me!  </li>
            <li> After a week I noticed that my teeth were becoming sensitive.</li>
            <li> After about a month my teeth were becoming almost transparent and extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I thought the original was for the older generation</li>
            <li> I can definitely say though that for SLS-free options, I&#x27;ve found nothing better.</li>
            <li> The only way you&#x27;ll be able to see if it works for you is to try it.  </li>
            <li> Since I am an avid coffee drinker I figured that by switching to the ProNamel</li>
            <li> but there are many advances in medical science</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m definitely going out to get some more of this.</li>
            <li> This makes business breakfasts and everything else you eat so much better regardless of when your brushed your teeth.    </li>
            <li> The reason so many people have gum diseases and gum problems are we no longer drink grass feed (organic) mile or butter made from such milk.</li>
            <li> I have about used my first tube of toothpaste and my teeth</li>
            <li> Well for the first time ever I could feel it building up between all my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have immediate sensitivity along the gumline of my molars (what dentists call &amp;#34;young tooth&amp;#34;) when I eat fruit or add lemon juice to food and forget to swish some water in my mouth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste and my family&#x27;s also - only wish it came in larger size- a bit more spendy though.</li>
            <li> While my mouth is doing OK on it, the taste has left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> yourself the horror and buy regular Sensodyne, or like me, swap it for another favorite: Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste better than either of those brands&#x27; offerings by taste alone, but especially for the reduction in tooth sensitivity to temperature.</li>
            <li> ~SMILE~ That said, I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> One less trip to the store means more family time!</li>
            <li> It is easy to get out of the tube up to the last drop, doesn&#x27;t need to be folded from the bottom like other toothpaste and stands up nicely on the counter.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is I feel like it doesn&#x27;t keep my breath as fresh as some other toothpastes which another why using a mouthwash is good.</li>
            <li> Secondly, isn&#x27;t that clever of them, forcing you to use more than you really want</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very particular about her dental hygiene, she is the one who got me to switch from colgate/crest etc.  </li>
            <li> Now I can tolerate hot or cold with perfect comfort.</li>
            <li> This despite consuming, daily, a large number of chocolate or candied espresso beans, and about 3-5 cups of strong coffee/tea; plus I still don&#x27;t sleep much.</li>
            <li> Acid wear used to leave my teeth feeling gritty like fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste on a regular basis there has been a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had problems with my enamel my whole life, until this</li>
            <li> really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you, I still can&#x27;t bite straight into ice cream or anything...</li>
            <li> Is what I was looking for and came fast.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> you are experiencing issues with tooth sensitivity, you might want to give this product a try for a whole month.  </li>
            <li> It looked exactly like normal staining but appeared at an extreamly accelerated rate.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same experience with Crest Pro Health (alcohol free</li>
            <li> hope that one day, the manufactures of toothpaste will realize that not everyone wants to have fluoride in their toothpaste.</li>
            <li> really does help with sensitivity</li>
            <li> I was skeptic that it could really work, but it did.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Not as much fluoride as I would like to help protect enamel.</li>
            <li> There is a simple, cheap way to keep tooth surfaces from being eroded by food acids.</li>
            <li> have so much tartar build up</li>
            <li> Recently because of mouth and tongue sensitivity issues, my dentist witched me to Cari Free.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as intended and I really like the taste.</li>
            <li> I really look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> This formulation still cleans very well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much about it at the time and continued using it.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product since the original post back in 2014, and I&#x27;ve really come around to it.</li>
            <li> Most other SLS-free toothpastes on the market are \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (though Toms of Maine uses SLS) and a lot of them are slimy.</li>
            <li> price isn&#x27;t much more than buying any other toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have been using it like normal toothpaste, and the crack at the root and gum line is 90 percent healed!  </li>
            <li> Sensodyne ProNamel products seem to work pretty well for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you start using first time, you will probably feel that toothpaste kinda hurts your teeth, but that&#x27;s the protect action and you won&#x27;t feel it anymore</li>
            <li> When I saw this kind in a two-pack for the same price as a single regular Sensodyne, I jumped at the deal, thinking it would be even better than regular Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have become a new believer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole new world.</li>
            <li> I have tried Arm and Hammer, Colgate Sensitive (close but not as good), Aqua Fresh Sensitive and a few generic types</li>
            <li> I think it definitely whitens better than the regular Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (After being a perfect angel child about brushing/candy and never having a single cavity--even through a few years of braces--until my early twenties, suddenly, boom--3 in one year.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High fluoride content and helps with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was highly recommended to me by our dentist.</li>
            <li> I think that it has really helped with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> i bought this not so much because i have sensitive teeth, but for the pro-namel.</li>
            <li> It is not quite normal toothpaste consistency, but who cares.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the pains, it does reduce it tremendously where it&#x27;s only a discomfort versus \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> I used to drink a lot of soda which caught up to me and about when I was 19 my teeth became very sensitive.</li>
            <li> using the toothpaste does the job, but I would also using another mechanism, if you have very sensitive teeth, like a mouth wash.</li>
            <li> but for some reason my teeth became very sensitive after i started using it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive, and Sensodyne works well to alleviate that.  </li>
            <li> i really does work, but the downside for me was that the clean sensation doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t eat any more because of how bad it hurt, but I was actually able to finish it with that much pain.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> However, buyers should be aware that you must stick with it for a number of weeks in order for it to work properly.  </li>
            <li> This is a more expensive toothpaste, but it is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> As you put your favorite paste on a toothbrush, brush as usual.</li>
            <li> It will remineralize your teeth no better than most over-the-counter toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the other Sensodyne toothpastes and all work quite well for sensitivity though I always go back to Sensodyne Pronamel because it is not gritty, has a mild mint flavor, and is smooth.</li>
            <li> Because there are a ton of other sensitivity toothpastes out there that address sensitivity and clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean (not stripped like other toothpastes</li>
            <li> It does not whiten very much, but I suspect that most whitening agents are probably not great for the enamel anyway.</li>
            <li> I also started using it while bleaching, and it completely cut out the sensitivity that comes along with that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years to handle my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Pronamel was recommended by my dentist for my sensitive teeth and works well.  </li>
            <li> My dentist told me to start using Pronamel because of my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> In my early days as a Prime member, I purchased some toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> and none can compare to the relief I get from Sensodyne Sensitive Teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only real change I made was switching to Pronamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth all of my life.</li>
            <li> sensitive problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 44 yrs old.</li>
            <li> And a soft tooth brush...</li>
            <li> My gum used to be quite sensitive until I use this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> hurt if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> My teeth are not as sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The only real difference between the two products is that ProNamel toothpaste does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.     </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than local shop.</li>
            <li> As far as sensitivity the stuff works.  </li>
            <li> As far as any help in heat/cold sensitivity, I don&#x27;t know if this product helps because I don&#x27;t have that issue (and don&#x27;t eat ice-cream or chew on ice).  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at the level of protection on my teeth that continues even after eating lunch.  </li>
            <li> my teeth were damn near clear after a month of using this product</li>
            <li> For years I thought I was sensitive to &#x27;mint&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive gums and this toothpaste was recommended by my DDS.  </li>
            <li> Dentist gave me a sample of ProEnamel and within a month my tooth was no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and ever since I discovered it I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Daytime I use regular fluoride toothpaste since the enamel protection wouldn&#x27;t really stay on as well,</li>
            <li> I bought this because Rembrandt canceled it&#x27;s Gentle White toothpaste.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this has (so far) saved me from dentures.</li>
            <li> As for restoring enamel, I suppose my teeth feel a bit stronger but only time and a dentist will really tell me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It also has helped my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from sensitive teeth for years.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of using this toothpaste the pain went completely away.</li>
            <li> I have had sensitive teeth and gums for years and this Pronamel is a lighter consistency.</li>
            <li> I was much too lazy for the full Dr Ellie system--</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is fantastic, the flavor unlike another reviewer indicated is rather mellow compared to nearly every other toothpaste I have tried, the toothpaste is not gritty, and works</li>
            <li> can couple this purchase with other personal care items needed to get the \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; for orders over $25.</li>
            <li> When I use my mouth wash (crest pro-health), there&#x27;s even less pain when I eat something sweet or</li>
            <li> I felt a significant difference after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I had to use it for about one week and the difference compared to all other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used including the regular sensodyne is significant.</li>
            <li> and I end up with way more than I would usually use, and there&#x27;s this big GLOP of paste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but I can justify it because spending a bit more on toothpaste is a lot better than paying dental fee&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the same as Crest Sensitive as far as I&#x27;m concerned...and neither of them WORK like Sensodyne does in decreasing pain in sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> -- my teeth were back to normal in minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive than regular toothpaste, but worth it.</li>
            <li> , one thing my dentist encouraged was the use of dental floss at least once a day and very light pressure for two minutes for the entire mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I try a toothpaste without SLS, since it&#x27;s known to irritate sores, and he thought it could be the reason my canker sores were getting so big and lasting so long instead of healing quickly and remaining</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve quite literally tried every toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my hands on, because my teeth are very sensitive to hot and cold.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were so sensitive - I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything too cold or too hot, and certainly not cold and hot together.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a bit more expensive than the regular fluoride toothpaste, but is worth it for the extra enamel protection.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To say the least it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;m also pretty sure they&#x27;re also whiter than they used to be, when I was using whatever Colgate/Crest whitening nonsense and not drinking coffee--which is crazy.)</li>
            <li> Apparently, chronic sleep deprivation compromises your immune system in a way that can exacerbate tooth decay.</li>
            <li> The calcium trick not only fixed tooth sensitivity, my fillings stayed where they belonged.</li>
            <li> And, apparently, I am too aggressive with my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;There has been improvement.</li>
            <li> I used to use regular Sensodyne as I have sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Furthermore, many use cinnamon as a flavoring, which can also be irritating.</li>
            <li> If you look at the label and compare the active ingredients of both toothpastes, they are EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li> one day I experienced such painful sensitivity that I went in for a dentist&#x27;s appointment.  </li>
            <li> I also found the taste to be a little funny as well.    </li>
            <li> Just a little info first</li>
            <li> This is largely because of the fluoride but possibly also because of the potassium nitrate (KNO3) in ProNamel and other desensitizing toothpastes.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brand toothpastes and this is the only one that really seems to help.</li>
            <li> for a toothpaste purported to combat sensitivity, it&#x27;s strange how it made my teeth sensitive when i didn&#x27;t have problems with sensitivity to begin with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I first started it, but after a few months, my sensitivity stopped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true that this toothpaste has a rather...unpleasant taste (at least to me).  </li>
            <li> and although I still have a slight sensitivity, I find myself not thinking about it as much.</li>
            <li> Works well for sensitive teeth and doesn&#x27;t wear down an already soft enamel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice pain anymore when I eat certain things and the taste takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in nearly all toothpastes (not to mention shampoos and other washes) on the market.     </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth due to:&lt;br /&gt;Candy&lt;br /&gt;Ice</li>
            <li> As far as I can telle, ProNamel contains sodium fluoride (NaF) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) as active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using the regular sensodyne tooth paste for a long time due to my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> In fact, about 15 years ago, I was told there was nearly no enamel left on my teeth due in part from my frequent brushing and the pressure I applied.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not magic, but I can tolerate hot and cold much better.  </li>
            <li> I have been told that the chemistry of my mouth is not exactly normal, the permanent retainer cemented to the back of my lower teeth following braces all but crumbled off because my mouth \\&quot;rejected\\&quot; it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t taste like candy compared to other commonly sold toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, but I&#x27;ve actually come to enjoy the flavor from it.</li>
            <li> and they are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> After a few months, I noticed that my teeth were feeling sensitive each morning, so I asked a hygienist who told me some things that would cause such an issue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne for several years and have not had any trouble with sensitive teeth in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I used Tom&#x27;s of Maine (the SLS free paste)for several years which I always disliked (the taste is not pleasant).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ice water is my favorite thing to drink now, I never thought I&#x27;d say that, I&#x27;ve always been afraid of ice.  </li>
            <li> and I have minor gingivitis,</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as long as it has been on the market.</li>
            <li> I used Sensodyne some time ago to no clear effect.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive teeth for a very long time, Sensodyne is the only product I use that helps me deal with the pain from hot or cold foods.  </li>
            <li> Last, with so much of the paste in my mouth, I find it irritating to my lips and tongue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne products for a while, but this stuff left my teeth with dark brown streaks on my bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, my grinding took a heavy toll and ended up cracking my enamel.  </li>
            <li> have heard that once you loose your enamel</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I can easily drink cold beverages without straws.</li>
            <li> It took away all my sensitivity in a very short tome and it did slightly whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Before, I could barely handle hot or cold anything exposed to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> One of those things was the toothpaste I had ordered a few months back.    </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a tooth that was sensitive to hot and cold for years.</li>
            <li> So I completely credit Pronamel with keeping my teeth pain- and cavity-free for these past few years.</li>
            <li> In fact, as I&#x27;m typing this review, I cannot remember the last time I felt a hot or cold sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The deposit around my back teeth was unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I bought two tubes from Bartells and both tubes are half empty.</li>
            <li> ) mouthwash except that gave me a dark brown stain.    </li>
            <li> Not too long ago I was eating a lava cake and usually 2 bites in</li>
            <li> I still have two more tubes of this worthless stuff to use.  </li>
            <li> In a matter of 3 days my sensitivity had decreased dramatically and after 3 weeks the pain was completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Hands down even if another brand is on sale, I buy the Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> while I can&#x27;t verify if it works does seem to improve the look of my front teeth where I use to have two spots that look worn down from what I think is tooth decay.</li>
            <li> I feel that my sensitivity has gone down.  </li>
            <li> It turns out my enamel was worn down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me years of not wanting to spend the extra money before I actually bought it, how dumb!  </li>
            <li> used the whole tube despite the flavor (serious rinsing afterward!!)  </li>
            <li> I thought I had a serious problem for days until I brushed with my wife&#x27;s Crest toothpaste</li>
            <li> Weird Amazon only provide subscription for a specific version of this brand,</li>
            <li> I got it for a $1.00 less shopping on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I can see that some people have complained about this toothpaste as compared to other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; toothpastes, and apparently it&#x27;s not stellar, but I prefer it to the other varieties of Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist because I have a sensitivity to hot and cold.  </li>
            <li> It also helps with my sensitivity to hot and cold.</li>
            <li> toothpaste does not clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Doing a little research, I found two scientific articles on the topic:    </li>
            <li> A little over a week ago I switched to another toothpaste my teeth are no longer transparent looking</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both used Sensodyne Pronamel and ended up with SEVERE mouth pain, extremely red &amp; sensitive gums, painful tongue, and sores in mouth &amp; throat.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few years of struggling before I happened upon this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The flavor of this toothpaste is harsh, like all the newer \\&quot;freshness burst\\&quot; type gums, or like Altoids...</li>
            <li> This is absurd as NOTHING can repair or replace natural tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste is one of the few tooth paste that does not have that chemical which creates a lot of foams when you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> after few weeks of use, your gum and tooth got stronger by that time.</li>
            <li> you have to use this everyday</li>
            <li> I have receding gums at a few molars.</li>
            <li> I have horrible teeth from bad dental care as a child and this toothpaste is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Before using this all my dental cleanings were so painful, but after 2 years this seems to really help.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the product claim re: &amp;#34;Microhardens tooth enamel &amp;#34; because my dentist has indicated otherwise.</li>
            <li> still use this brand, not sure if im to stop after being healed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After going to the dentist for a small tooth ache and him finding nothing I decided to try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Slightly expensive for such a small tube.</li>

            <li> No more tooth aches from just brushing teeth anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a couple of weeks, the only downside is the taste is kinda weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it&#x27;s almost like a mint chalk.</li>
            <li> bulk (small).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months and my scaling appointments are far less painful.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s commonly recommended by dentists.  </li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste because I was having very severe tooth sensitivity that made it difficult to even drink cold water.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately the subscription was cancelled for it.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Before using this toothpaste, heat and cold would be so irritating in those spots.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended that I switch to an SLS-free toothpaste when I started getting really bad canker sores (aka aphthous ulcers, and not to be confused with cold sores).</li>
            <li> It seems to have improved my sensitivity to cold liquids.  </li>
            <li> About a year ago the sensitivity of my teeth made it difficult to eat and sometimes quite painful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I honestly think this toothpaste has helped me with my sensitivity issues on my teeth. I don&#x27;t notice pain anymore when I eat certain things and the taste takes a little getting used to but I love it now.</li>
            <li> My teeth were so sensitive - I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything too cold or too hot, and certainly not cold and hot together.  I&#x27;ve also had problems with my enamel my whole life, until this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me years of not wanting to spend the extra money before I actually bought it, how dumb!  I would pay any price for it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice water is my favorite thing to drink now, I never thought I&#x27;d say that, I&#x27;ve always been afraid of ice.  I can actually drink it, while eating hot soup - that&#x27;s how amazing this stuff is!</li>
            <li> Does what it advertises. Sincerely helps with my sensitive gums. Price is a premium, but you get what you pay for. The whitening version left a film on my lips and gums. DDS told me to stop using it and stick to this specific product. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I noticed a ProNamel product earlier, but it was discontinued before I could purchase it. As far as I can telle, ProNamel contains sodium fluoride (NaF) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) as active ingredients. I suspect that one of the reviewers may have been correct that the FTC or FDA asked GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to back up on the marketing. Doing a little research, I found two scientific articles on the topic:    [...]    These are both funded by GSK so they should be looked with caution, but both point to superior mineralization using ProNamel. This is largely because of the fluoride but possibly also because of the potassium nitrate (KNO3) in ProNamel and other desensitizing toothpastes.    Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) have another article pointing to lower plaque when using their product ([...]). However, I&#x27;m more interested in enamel. Plus the review mentioned above ([...]) says that in this formulation enamel isn&#x27;t remineralized at all.    I&#x27;m buying this. Good luck and remember to use Google Scholar ([...]) and PubMed for learning about these sorts of things.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week or so, I noticed a white gunk on my teeth.  It felt like I hadn&#x27;t brushed my teeth, but I couldn&#x27;t brush it all off, even with an Oral B electric brush.  The deposit around my back teeth was unbelievable.  It is starting to wear off, and I will not use this product again.  I cannot believe they would produce such a bad product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has helped with my sensitivity without a doubt.  Before, I could barely handle hot or cold anything exposed to my teeth.  Now, I can have either with no problems.  Mind you, I still can&#x27;t bite straight into ice cream or anything... it&#x27;s not magic, but I can tolerate hot and cold much better.  I also started using it while bleaching, and it completely cut out the sensitivity that comes along with that.  Now that is worth it in itself!  It has a smooth minty taste and texture but doesn&#x27;t foam much like some people appreciate.  I think that is why it doesn&#x27;t tear up the inside of my mouth like many toothpastes with high SLS are prone to do.  I will continue using this toothpaste... it&#x27;s worth it and better than many other sensitivity toothpastes I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great.  Is what I was looking for and came fast.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended that I switch to an SLS-free toothpaste when I started getting really bad canker sores (aka aphthous ulcers, and not to be confused with cold sores). Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in nearly all toothpastes (not to mention shampoos and other washes) on the market.     It took me a few years of struggling before I happened upon this toothpaste. Most other SLS-free toothpastes on the market are \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (though Toms of Maine uses SLS) and a lot of them are slimy. Furthermore, many use cinnamon as a flavoring, which can also be irritating. This toothpaste foams nicely and tastes pleasant. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and it&#x27;s the number one factor in controlling my canker sores.     I can see that some people have complained about this toothpaste as compared to other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; toothpastes, and apparently it&#x27;s not stellar, but I prefer it to the other varieties of Sensodyne. I can definitely say though that for SLS-free options, I&#x27;ve found nothing better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years to handle my sensitive teeth.  I know it works because when I try switching/using regular toothpaste, I experience pain from hypersensitivity.  Not sure about the product claim re: &amp;#34;Microhardens tooth enamel &amp;#34; because my dentist has indicated otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne for several years and have not had any trouble with sensitive teeth in a very long time.  It works very well for me.  I highly recommend it if you have tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Pronamel was recommended by my dentist for my sensitive teeth and works well.  I was also satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li> This review is being written 11/26/2013 for the Sensodyne ProNamel Mint Essence Toothpaste, 4 oz. (Pack of 4), advertised and sold by Amazon on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are experiencing issues with tooth sensitivity, you might want to give this product a try for a whole month.  It&#x27;s commonly recommended by dentists.  It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t taste like candy compared to other commonly sold toothpaste.  The only way you&#x27;ll be able to see if it works for you is to try it.  If you are hesitant, you might ask your dentist for a sample on your next visit.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great for people who have sensitivity in their teeth due to enamel erosion from drinking acidic or sweet beverages.  Sensitivity can be gone within 3 days and remain so with continued use. OF COURSE, not a substitute for flossing and periodic checkups.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to start using Pronamel because of my sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months and my scaling appointments are far less painful.</li>
            <li> I think the company probably got busted by the FDA.  They used to have displays everywhere saying that it \\&quot;re-builds your enamel!!!\\&quot;.  I fell for ... and bought it.  Then the displays went away, and the labeling changed.  Last I checked ..... YOU CANNOT RE-BUILD ENAMEL.  Once it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s gone.  So stopping smoking cigarettes, crack, and meth.  LOL</li>
            <li> This is really a good toothpaste. I think that it has really helped with my sensitive teeth. My gums don&#x27;t hurt, and best of all I can brush 3 times a day like I&#x27;m supposed to and not have the pain associated with it. I have become a new believer! What a great product.</li>
            <li> When you sign up for Amazon Prime, you immediately forget about going to the store because you can just order the things you need as soon as you think about it.  In my early days as a Prime member, I purchased some toothpaste.  After a few months, I noticed that my teeth were feeling sensitive each morning, so I asked a hygienist who told me some things that would cause such an issue.  One of those things was the toothpaste I had ordered a few months back.    Being an Amazon Prime member, I immediately subscribed to Sensodyne toothpaste so that I can save even more.  My hygienist was surprised at how good the price was compared to brick and mortar.  After just a week of use, my sensitivity is gone!</li>
            <li> I have been using the regular sensodyne tooth paste for a long time due to my sensitive teeth.  I am a nighttime teeth grinder and even with my dentist made mouth guard I often wake up with achy teeth and sore gums.  I use a sonicare electric toothbrush and am somewhat regular at flossing.  Since I am an avid coffee drinker I figured that by switching to the ProNamel I would be doing my mouth a favor.  I was so very wrong.  I have been using the ProNamel for about 3 months now and for the last 1 &amp; 1/2 months was wondering why my teeth were developing a yellow stain.  It looked exactly like normal staining but appeared at an extreamly accelerated rate.  I have had the same experience with Crest Pro Health (alcohol free) mouthwash except that gave me a dark brown stain.    I have been told that the chemistry of my mouth is not exactly normal, the permanent retainer cemented to the back of my lower teeth following braces all but crumbled off because my mouth \\&quot;rejected\\&quot; it.  Anyways, if you look at the reviews for the mouthwash you&#x27;ll see that most people agree with the staining issue.  ProNamel did clean my teeth, but I don&#x27;t think it is as good at preventing sensitivity as the regular kind.  All I can say is that this tooth paste did not work for me and I will not be recommending it to anyone, ever.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive teeth. In fact, about 15 years ago, I was told there was nearly no enamel left on my teeth due in part from my frequent brushing and the pressure I applied. I have tried Arm and Hammer, Colgate Sensitive (close but not as good), Aqua Fresh Sensitive and a few generic types and none can compare to the relief I get from Sensodyne Sensitive Teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that sometimes, I still experience sensitivity and I have minor gingivitis, but I can&#x27;t say that I would do better if I used anything else. Hands down even if another brand is on sale, I buy the Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that once you loose your enamel it doesn&#x27;t grow back.  So, I don&#x27;t know if I believe that this works but there are many advances in medical science so I guess its possible.  I think it definitely whitens better than the regular Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, one thing my dentist encouraged was the use of dental floss at least once a day and very light pressure for two minutes for the entire mouth. Ideally, floss after each meal is the best protection (more important than brushing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deduct one point because like nearly all products on the market it has fluoride. Despite all the \\&quot;benefits\\&quot; touted on commercials, fluoride is a by-product of the manufacture of fertilizer. It is a poison. It should not be in your home, let alone used in any way in conjunction with your body. The FDA which allows \\&quot;slime\\&quot; in your meat, antibotics and hormones in your meat and arsenic in your apple juice has dropped the ball big time. BTW, most of the top people in the FDA once worked as high level food industry executives. Caveat Emptor \\&quot;Buyer Beware\\&quot;. I refuse fluoride treatments when at the dentist, they make me sign a waiver, whatever. Do your research, the info. is out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that one day, the manufactures of toothpaste will realize that not everyone wants to have fluoride in their toothpaste. Anyone?</li>
            <li> really does help with sensitivity</li>
            <li> I used to drink a lot of soda which caught up to me and about when I was 19 my teeth became very sensitive. I should also mention I was using crest 3d white tooth pa ste which wears enamel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago ny dentist to try sensodyne. I thought the original was for the older generation so I went with pronamel. The toothpaste claims to rebuild your enamel and protect against acidic wear and tear from soda, orange juice, or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste on a regular basis there has been a huge difference. Not too long ago I was eating a lava cake and usually 2 bites in and I won&#x27;t eat any more because of how bad it hurt, but I was actually able to finish it with that much pain.&lt;br /&gt;Just using the toothpaste does the job, but I would also using another mechanism, if you have very sensitive teeth, like a mouth wash. When I use my mouth wash (crest pro-health), there&#x27;s even less pain when I eat something sweet or cold.&lt;br /&gt;The price isn&#x27;t much more than buying any other toothpaste so picking this up is worth it. The taste is okay, nothing special. The only downfall is I feel like it doesn&#x27;t keep my breath as fresh as some other toothpastes which another why using a mouthwash is good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those that have very sensitive teeth.  I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brand toothpastes and this is the only one that really seems to help.</li>
            <li> Packaged well. As advertised. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I find this tastes like brushing your teeth with minty vanilla candy. Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using Sensodyne Pronamel a few years ago after being tipped off to Dr. Ellie&#x27;s &amp;#34;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye&amp;#34; system (dumb name). Always used mainline toothpastes before, but it was time for a drastic change. (After being a perfect angel child about brushing/candy and never having a single cavity--even through a few years of braces--until my early twenties, suddenly, boom--3 in one year. Apparently, chronic sleep deprivation compromises your immune system in a way that can exacerbate tooth decay. And also cranberry juice.) I was so scarred from the Year of Cavities that I (counterintuitively) avoided the dentist&#x27;s for several years thereafter--just did my regular sonicare routine, plus some xylitol gum if I happened to have any around. I was much too lazy for the full Dr Ellie system--the only real change I made was switching to Pronamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally went again last week--no new cavities, everything in great shape. This despite consuming, daily, a large number of chocolate or candied espresso beans, and about 3-5 cups of strong coffee/tea; plus I still don&#x27;t sleep much. So I completely credit Pronamel with keeping my teeth pain- and cavity-free for these past few years. (And I&#x27;m also pretty sure they&#x27;re also whiter than they used to be, when I was using whatever Colgate/Crest whitening nonsense and not drinking coffee--which is crazy.) Magic; lifesaver--I will stockpile this if it ever ends production.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste because I was having very severe tooth sensitivity that made it difficult to even drink cold water.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I first started it, but after a few months, my sensitivity stopped.  I ran out and my husband bought something else (Colgate Total, I believe) and now my sensitivity is back.  So I&#x27;m definitely going out to get some more of this.</li>
            <li> Once you switch, you&#x27;ll be amazed that your breath is awesome, mouth clean and fresh feeling without that super strong aftertaste. This makes business breakfasts and everything else you eat so much better regardless of when your brushed your teeth.    I&#x27;ve quite literally tried every toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my hands on, because my teeth are very sensitive to hot and cold.  This has helped that tremendously.  Even better since this stuff doesn&#x27;t foam like many more popular toothpastes, I rarely vomit after brushing with Sensodyne (I&#x27;d vomit at least once a day for years on regular toothpaste).  I have a terrible gag reflex and that has been a problem all my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth all of my life. I had not been able to drink anything with ice without a straw. Since using this product, I can easily drink cold beverages without straws. I can bite ice cream or popsicles! It&#x27;s a whole new world. Ice against my teeth doesn&#x27;t make me shutter anymore. I&#x27;m cheap, so the price always makes me think twice, but honestly, it&#x27;s worked so well, I&#x27;ll keep on payin&#x27;!</li>
            <li> -Sensodyne is NOT the least expensive toothpaste on the market. If you have sensitivity issues, this is your toothpaste. I have used this product for a couple of years and have outstanding results relieving sensitivity and have purchased it on Amazon with gift certificates earned by taking surveys that reward with Amazon Gift Certificates so it&#x27;s actually \\&quot;free\\&quot;. ~SMILE~ That said, I would highly recommend this product.  -You can couple this purchase with other personal care items needed to get the \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; for orders over $25.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne ProNamel products seem to work pretty well for sensitive teeth.  It seems to have improved my sensitivity to cold liquids.  It does not whiten very much, but I suspect that most whitening agents are probably not great for the enamel anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as long as it has been on the market. I whiten my teeth, and this helps me to take very good care of them and be free of any discomfort. My teeth are beautiful, and this product is part of my nice smile. Buying it at this price and having it delivered to my door is very nice.</li>
            <li> I started using pronamel because it doesn&#x27;t use sulfate in the ingredients.  Bought the 4 pack awhile ago and still have one tube left!  Love this toothpaste</li>
            <li> my teeth were hurting so bad with anything cold,, i had to place my salads in the micro wave!  anything cool&lt;br /&gt;would kill me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this tooth for the completion of one tube,, and my mouth was healed!!  many of my teeth were having&lt;br /&gt;the sensitive problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this brand, not sure if im to stop after being healed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and its a miracle to me!!  44 yrs old.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist because I have a sensitivity to hot and cold.  I have been strictly using this toothpaste for a year and although I still have a slight sensitivity, I find myself not thinking about it as much. In fact, as I&#x27;m typing this review, I cannot remember the last time I felt a hot or cold sensitivity.  Also, with subscribe and save, it is a great value!</li>
            <li> Acid wear used to leave my teeth feeling gritty like fine sandpaper. Using Pronamel has helped a great deal - now my teeth are smooth to my tongue. It also helps with my sensitivity to hot and cold. The mint flavor is tasty, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> After going to the dentist for a small tooth ache and him finding nothing I decided to try this toothpaste. I felt a significant difference after a few weeks of use. Additionally after I stopped using it for a bit some of the sensitivity and acheness returned. Great product. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but I can justify it because spending a bit more on toothpaste is a lot better than paying dental fee&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth due to:&lt;br /&gt;Candy&lt;br /&gt;Ice tea&lt;br /&gt;LIMES&lt;br /&gt;and any kind of acids SO my dentist said that I need to use this since it will decrease the sensitivity of my teeth. And a soft tooth brush...</li>
            <li> Works well for sensitive teeth and doesn&#x27;t wear down an already soft enamel.</li>
            <li> The flavor of this toothpaste is harsh, like all the newer \\&quot;freshness burst\\&quot; type gums, or like Altoids...the flavor burns my tongue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the whole tube despite the flavor (serious rinsing afterward!!)  and did not note any difference at all with my sensitivy...this stuff is the same as Crest Sensitive as far as I&#x27;m concerned...and neither of them WORK like Sensodyne does in decreasing pain in sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THIS TOOTHPASTE SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF TELEVISION (AMONG OTHERS) AS they Suggest that their&lt;br /&gt;toothpaste can repair tooth enamel.  This is absurd as NOTHING can repair or replace natural tooth enamel. I will see what the National Dental Association has to say about all this false advertising. THEIR REPAIR AND PROTECT TOOTHPASTE DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> This is the worst toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne products for a while, but this stuff left my teeth with dark brown streaks on my bottom teeth.  I thought I had a serious problem for days until I brushed with my wife&#x27;s Crest toothpaste -- my teeth were back to normal in minutes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste recommended by my dentist so I guess it must be good.  Slightly expensive for such a small tube.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended and I&#x27;m so glad he did.  It has totally helped with my cold, painful sensations.  Receding gum line from a crown was making brushing painful, this toothpaste totally helped...I was skeptic that it could really work, but it did.  So happy I found this stuff!</li>
            <li> Just another one of those things I but online instead of at a grocery store or drug store.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  It effectively desesitizes teeth and smoothes them over.  However, buyers should be aware that you must stick with it for a number of weeks in order for it to work properly.  If you try it for a few days and claim it doesn&#x27;t work (like most negative reviewers probably do), then you&#x27;re fooling yourself.  With anything, you must give it a chance to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that this toothpaste has a rather...unpleasant taste (at least to me).  It&#x27;s hardly minty.  It&#x27;s more medicine-like.  But it&#x27;s not unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small container, so use it wisely.  A little goes a long way.  My tube lasted me around a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see why my dentist recommended this to me!  It&#x27;s great for sensitive gums and protecting teeth against wear overall.</li>
            <li> this is the way to buy this type of tooth paste.  i like that i can just get it via mail.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I ever used due to my sensitive teeth. It is expensive, but it is worth it. My dentist recommended Sensodyne and I do trust him.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste is one of the few tooth paste that does not have that chemical which creates a lot of foams when you brush your teeth.  Those foams are actually bad for your gum.  My gum used to be quite sensitive until I use this tooth paste. Taking co-enzyme (especially made by Jarrow) Q10 also helps my gum.  Another food that is also very good for gum is Clarified Butter, if you can find a good one like those that were made in India.  I bought the Purity Farms, Organic Ghee Clarified Butter.  The reason so many people have gum diseases and gum problems are we no longer drink grass feed (organic) mile or butter made from such milk.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste because it is perfect for my sensitive tooth. I used to subscribe to it and was happen with the discount on subscription. Unfortunately the subscription was cancelled for it. But I found the whitening version of this brand still has subscription. Weird Amazon only provide subscription for a specific version of this brand,</li>
            <li> This is a more expensive toothpaste, but it is so worth the money! It took away all my sensitivity in a very short tome and it did slightly whiten my teeth. I am very satisfied and I will continue using this brand which, in my opinion, is head and shoulders over the others. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good mild but minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Not as much fluoride as I would like to help protect enamel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for quite a while now and I love it. I believe it really does work. : )</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  But price keeps going up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for 2 years now.  Before using this all my dental cleanings were so painful, but after 2 years this seems to really help.  My teeth are not as sensitive.  It is more expensive than regular toothpaste, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m living in Japan and brought 4 pieces when I came here. Japanese tooth paste doesn&#x27;t work well to me, but this is the best to me.</li>
            <li> I used this product for several weeks with the hope that it would reduce sensitivity on my teeth. While the paste did get my teeth clean, there was no change in the sensitivity level. I also found the taste to be a little funny as well.    After doing some research and talking with my dentist, I discovered that this product is no different than regular Sensodyne toothpaste. If you look at the label and compare the active ingredients of both toothpastes, they are EXACTLY the same. The only real difference between the two products is that ProNamel toothpaste does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.     If you have canker sores and are looking for an SLS-free toothpaste, you might consider this product. Otherwise, I&#x27;d just stick with regular Sensodyne and save yourself a buck or two.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than local shop. Tastes good. If you start using first time, you will probably feel that toothpaste kinda hurts your teeth, but that&#x27;s the protect action and you won&#x27;t feel it anymore after few weeks of use, your gum and tooth got stronger by that time.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive teeth for a very long time, Sensodyne is the only product I use that helps me deal with the pain from hot or cold foods.  While it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the pains, it does reduce it tremendously where it&#x27;s only a discomfort versus \\&quot;Oh My God I can&#x27;t eat this\\&quot;.  The additional enamel strengthening while I can&#x27;t verify if it works does seem to improve the look of my front teeth where I use to have two spots that look worn down from what I think is tooth decay. Overall I recommend Sensodyne over any of those leading name brands like Colgate, Crest or Aquafresh.</li>
            <li> There is a simple, cheap way to keep tooth surfaces from being eroded by food acids. Just chew a calcium pill but do not swallow the chalky material. As you put your favorite paste on a toothbrush, brush as usual. Spit &amp; rinse. The chewed pill mixes with the paste, reacting with tooth surface calcium. I used Sensodyne some time ago to no clear effect. The calcium trick not only fixed tooth sensitivity, my fillings stayed where they belonged. There are pastes available on Amazon (Tom&#x27;s or Jason for instance) that have the added calcium - usually as Ca carbonate. Just read the label to find out which product has this sort of enamel protection.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothpaste!</li>
            <li> As far as sensitivity the stuff works.  That being said it still gets one star. Why? Because there are a ton of other sensitivity toothpastes out there that address sensitivity and clean my teeth.  I have about used my first tube of toothpaste and my teeth have so much tartar build up I can&#x27;t stand it. I just got my teeth cleaned when I started using this stuff.  Within a day I could feel the roughness building all over again.  I brush my teeth multiple times a day and even would floss them trying to reduce the tartar build up.  It just got worse.  The build up always starts on the bottom back of the front teeth.  Well for the first time ever I could feel it building up between all my teeth.  I have since gone back to my Crest Sensitivity tooth paste. After using it for 3 days my teeth are feeling smooth and clean once again.  Sensodyne toothpaste is over priced and this version does nothing for removing bacterial build up.  Your going through the motions and the only thing it is doing is address sensitivity.  I still have two more tubes of this worthless stuff to use.  I bought a 3 pack not a 4 pack at a local store but this is the same stuff.  Save your money if you want clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product.really helped eliminate sensitivity and it has a great flavor. On top of all that, the packaging is fantastic. Best tube design to date.</li>
            <li> Bought 4 tubes for $18.98 at the time I made my purchase.  I have immediate sensitivity along the gumline of my molars (what dentists call &amp;#34;young tooth&amp;#34;) when I eat fruit or add lemon juice to food and forget to swish some water in my mouth afterwards.  Simply rinsing my mouth with water immediately after can alleviate the issue entirely, when I manage to do it.  Sensodyne ProNamel, which I used for about six years, helped combat the problem, reducing the sensitivity within just a couple of brushings.  As far as any help in heat/cold sensitivity, I don&#x27;t know if this product helps because I don&#x27;t have that issue (and don&#x27;t eat ice-cream or chew on ice).  I&#x27;ve since switched over to Tom&#x27;s of Maine Sensitive toothpaste, however, and find it more effective at soothing/reducing sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I bought two tubes from Bartells and both tubes are half empty. I paid for buying air.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite toothpaste and I introduced it to my husband who loves it as well. There is no other on the regular market to match in being non abrasive, clean the teeth great, whiten and brighten, and have an excellent taste. Recently because of mouth and tongue sensitivity issues, my dentist witched me to Cari Free. However it is very expensive and when I travel, or go to the gym to work out, I take the Sensodyne with me as an alternative. My husband however continues to use this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste and my family&#x27;s also - only wish it came in larger size- a bit more spendy though.</li>
            <li> This is the toothpaste that our dentist recommends and I went to Amazon to buy in bulk and not have to purchase every time we are&lt;br /&gt;out.  I found in a 4 pack that made it cheaper than I could buy it at the grocery or drugstore.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste for those with any types of sensitive teeth.  No more tooth aches from just brushing teeth anymore.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the level of protection on my teeth that continues even after eating lunch.  I had to use it for about one week and the difference compared to all other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used including the regular sensodyne is significant. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have horrible teeth from bad dental care as a child and this toothpaste is wonderful.  It sure feels like it helps with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as intended and I really like the taste. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;knock you in the head&#x27; minty freshness!!!!!! kind of mint, just a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the exact one but I&#x27;ve been using sensodyne pro enamel and whitening you have to use this everyday my teeth were damn near clear after a month of using this product my teeth look GREAT I can&#x27;t stop smiling and trust I never do product reviews</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have SLS, the avoidance of which is supposed to be good for preventing cankers. So far so good. It is not quite normal toothpaste consistency, but who cares.</li>
            <li> I have a very reactive tongue and decided to try a toothpaste which is SLS free.  I used Tom&#x27;s of Maine (the SLS free paste)for several years which I always disliked (the taste is not pleasant).  Then decided to give this sensodyne ProNamel a try.  I have been ordering from Amazon ever since.  Not only does my tongue not react (no longer have deep fissures) but I feel it&#x27;s protecting the enamel of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Greatest toothpaste since the invention of toothpaste LOL.  If you have sensitivity to hot/cold, this is the product for you.  Also comes in 3 pleasant flavors, no after taste.  However a bit pricey on Amazon.  It&#x27;s cheaper at local Walmart!</li>
            <li> I am a serious teeth grinder.  For years, I&#x27;ve been grinding my teeth and one day I experienced such painful sensitivity that I went in for a dentist&#x27;s appointment.  Apparently, my grinding took a heavy toll and ended up cracking my enamel.  My dentist recommended Pronamel and within a day, my teeth sensitivity dramatically decreased.  My enamel has been restored and I am incredibly thankful for this toothpaste.  Though it is rather expensive, I feel like it has saved me hundreds of dollars in dental repair work!</li>
            <li> My mouth no longer burns or is irritated. For years I thought I was sensitive to &#x27;mint&#x27; but I was wrong. It&#x27;s been years since my mouth has been this comfortable post brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this paste which comes in a can with a dispenser top which when pushed dispenses a set amount of paste. I am really not pleased with this for a few reasons; first, because it doesn&#x27;t let ME determine how much paste I want to use and I end up with way more than I would usually use, and there&#x27;s this big GLOP of paste in my mouth. Secondly, isn&#x27;t that clever of them, forcing you to use more than you really want so you go through the can faster and will need to buy MORE sooner than you might normally have.  Good marketing ploy, guys! Last, with so much of the paste in my mouth, I find it irritating to my lips and tongue. If I were permitted to put the amount I want and need on my brush, I don&#x27;t believe I would experience this effect. Taste is okay and there&#x27;s lots of foam, but I will not buy this again because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Seems to a be better. I&#x27;ve been using a couple of weeks, the only downside is the taste is kinda weird / takes time to get used to. But overall I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive gums and this toothpaste was recommended by my DDS.  It is perfect not only for sensitivity issues but also to protect and strengthen tooth enamel. I like that I can purchase 4 tubes. A miracle product. Seller ships immediately. Arrives in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is of the best toothpastes you can buy and provided amazon doesn&#x27;t trick us by raising the price (as they are with too many other products), it&#x27;s priced very fairly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists highly recommend this toothpaste and that&#x27;s good enough for me!  Enjoy...great stuff...</li>
            <li> Best sensitive toothpaste that I have found.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product for me, and I love it! I purchase it through subscribe and save to get more savings.</li>
            <li> the toothpaste itself is pretty good, the taste is somewhat strange, but it does work!&lt;br /&gt;my dentist told me to use this toothpaste to help reduce sensitivity in my teeth. i really does work, but the downside for me was that the clean sensation doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a tooth that was sensitive to hot and cold for years. Dentist gave me a sample of ProEnamel and within a month my tooth was no longer sensitive. Now I only brush with ProEnamel.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste! My teeth feel clean (not stripped like other toothpastes make me feel) without irritating my gums and mouth. I really look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a caffeine and carbonated soda drinker.  And, apparently, I am too aggressive with my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;There has been improvement.</li>
            <li> The Sensodyne ProNamel is one of the best toothpastes around in my opinion. I have sensitive teeth and ever since I discovered it I won&#x27;t use anything else. Nothing to complain about...definitely a high 5 star rating on this product!!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a bit more expensive than the regular fluoride toothpaste, but is worth it for the extra enamel protection.  And if you have tooth sensitivity like I do, then this one is a no-brainer.  I use it at night for the extra enamel protection.  Daytime I use regular fluoride toothpaste since the enamel protection wouldn&#x27;t really stay on as well, what with all that relatively more frequent daytime eating activities.</li>
            <li> I had sensitivity issues, ironically, w/the whitening version of this paste I got at Costco in a 4 pack. This formulation still cleans very well but w/out the issues that the whitening version rendered.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
            <li> Everything GSK claims is true of Pronamel is equally true of regular Sensodyne or Crest Sensivity or good old flouride toothpaste. It will remineralize your teeth no better than most over-the-counter toothpastes. Why? Because the FDA has limits on fluoride-content and I assure you Pronamel does not exceed that.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums at a few molars. Before using this toothpaste, heat and cold would be so irritating in those spots. It&#x27;s amazing how well this works. Zero sensitivity now! And the flavor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!! It&#x27;s the best!! This was delivered on time and we had no issues!!</li>
            <li> About a year ago the sensitivity of my teeth made it difficult to eat and sometimes quite painful.  I eat alot of acidic foods so I started out with the sensodyne pronamel.  What a difference.  In a matter of 3 days my sensitivity had decreased dramatically and after 3 weeks the pain was completely gone.  This toothpaste is fantastic, the flavor unlike another reviewer indicated is rather mellow compared to nearly every other toothpaste I have tried, the toothpaste is not gritty, and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have enough good things to say about this toothpaste.  My dentist recommended the product to me on my next visit and the dental hygienist personally uses the same toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say the least it is fantastic.  I tried some of the other Sensodyne toothpastes and all work quite well for sensitivity though I always go back to Sensodyne Pronamel because it is not gritty, has a mild mint flavor, and is smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Rembrandt canceled it&#x27;s Gentle White toothpaste. I need a SLS-free brand, and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with Tom&#x27;s. While my mouth is doing OK on it, the taste has left a lot to be desired. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it&#x27;s almost like a mint chalk. I am going to keep using it only until I can find an alternative brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.22.17 Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product since the original post back in 2014, and I&#x27;ve really come around to it. It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, but I&#x27;ve actually come to enjoy the flavor from it. Not sure if something in the product changed - or if it&#x27;s just my taste buds!</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste because I couldn&#x27;t find anything at my local pharmacy that didn&#x27;t contain sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from chronic canker sores, sometimes the size of a 10 cent coin, which can make it almost impossible to speak or eat properly. My dentist suggested that I try a toothpaste without SLS, since it&#x27;s known to irritate sores, and he thought it could be the reason my canker sores were getting so big and lasting so long instead of healing quickly and remaining manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a bit of a difference in how the toothpaste felt initially, but I don&#x27;t notice it at all anymore, and when my girlfriend sleeps over she never complains about having to use it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste for me.If it will save me on dental bills i&#x27;m all for it.Also taste great.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this exclusively based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  I feel that my sensitivity has gone down.  my teeth feel good</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  Cleans well and tastes good.  In my opinion, this has (so far) saved me from dentures.</li>
            <li> I used to use regular Sensodyne as I have sensitive teeth and gums and I really liked it. But then I discovered Pronamel (also by Sensodyne) and even though it costs more, I am willing to pay it because I like the toothpaste and the tube it comes in. It is easy to get out of the tube up to the last drop, doesn&#x27;t need to be folded from the bottom like other toothpaste and stands up nicely on the counter. Sensodyne toothpaste has helped me with my tooth sensitivity and it is the only toothpaste I will use now.  I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that is it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I love Sensodyne toothpaste. When I saw this kind in a two-pack for the same price as a single regular Sensodyne, I jumped at the deal, thinking it would be even better than regular Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does not clean your teeth. My mother is a dental hygienist so I am well aware of what clean teeth should look and feel like. This leaves a film on your teeth and leaves lots of plaque. I use a Sonicare toothbrush and was brushing my teeth twice and flossing so many times just to get clean teeth. I love Sensodyne, but this product needs to be pulled from the shelves IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the horror and buy regular Sensodyne, or like me, swap it for another favorite: Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  Good product.  High fluoride content and helps with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this about one week (twice daily) and I already have no pain in eating or chewing (especially in molars). As for restoring enamel, I suppose my teeth feel a bit stronger but only time and a dentist will really tell me. I&#x27;d recommend this just for the pain relief alone.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it to protect teeth enamel. I have been using it for more than a year. I like the one with the Mint Essence.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  I got it for a $1.00 less shopping on Amazon.  I have extremely sensitive teeth and therefore this is the only toothpaste I use.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> i bought this not so much because i have sensitive teeth, but for the pro-namel. but for some reason my teeth became very sensitive after i started using it. the sensitivity went away when i switched to another toothpaste brand. for a toothpaste purported to combat sensitivity, it&#x27;s strange how it made my teeth sensitive when i didn&#x27;t have problems with sensitivity to begin with.</li>
            <li> Just a little info first I am a smoker. That being said my teeth were healthy. I did not have any sensitivity in my teeth. I take very good care of my teeth. I bought this as a precaution so I would never have any sensitivity. After a week I noticed that my teeth were becoming sensitive. I didn&#x27;t think much about it at the time and continued using it. After about a month my teeth were becoming almost transparent and extremely sensitive. A little over a week ago I switched to another toothpaste my teeth are no longer transparent looking and they are less sensitive. I wish that I had never tried this toothpaste. I will never buy this toothpaste again. I would never recommend anyone use this toothpaste EVER! I honestly don&#x27;t see how it has so many positive reviews. Huge waste of money and horrible for teeth.</li>
            <li> The only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t make my mouth peel.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes mildly and pleasantly minty.  My teeth are very sensitive, and Sensodyne works well to alleviate that.  My girlfriend is very particular about her dental hygiene, she is the one who got me to switch from colgate/crest etc.  I like this toothpaste better than either of those brands&#x27; offerings by taste alone, but especially for the reduction in tooth sensitivity to temperature.</li>
            <li> I had a really sensitive spot on one of my teeth, just under the gum line, and I thought for sure I&#x27;d have to go to the dentist for a cavity. Sensodyne has saved me! It took about 2 weeks, but the pain is gone. It&#x27;s still sensitive to cold &amp; heat, but at least it doesn&#x27;t hurt every time I touch it anymore!</li>
            <li> I have been using sensodyne toothpaste because I have had a crown split off in the root but with no sensitivity, and I heard it \\&quot;filled in &#x27;\\&quot; cracks!  I have been using it like normal toothpaste, and the crack at the root and gum line is 90 percent healed!  And the taste is like those candy cigarettes you got when you were a kid !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried sealing a crack in a piece of jewelry - it did that effectively too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about this product!  And  4 dollars toothpaste or 600 dollars at the dentist for the works of a competent person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its up to ya&#x27;ll!</li>
            <li> Great price for an item I use twice daily.  I will continue to purchase this for the convenience of having more than one tube on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> Unlike regular Synsodyne toothpaste, this one has a nice mint flavor.  It also has helped my sensitive teeth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from sensitive teeth for years. I finally went to the dentist because I could no longer stand having painful teeth every time I consumed slightly cold food. It turns out my enamel was worn down. My dentist recommended sensodyne. After a couple of weeks of using this toothpaste the pain went completely away. I have returned to regular toothpaste thinking the pain was gone, but it returned almost instantaneously. This is the best toothpaste I have found for sensitive teeth. Leaves breath smelling great also!</li>
            <li> Husband uses this and it is the same brand and type that I have to search for at a storel  I like to order in bulk (small).</li>
            <li> I like how me teeth feel when using this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentists because it is the best.  I use this since I have sensitivity following having crowns.  Now I can tolerate hot or cold with perfect comfort.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was highly recommended to me by our dentist. I have had sensitive teeth and gums for years and this Pronamel is a lighter consistency. The slight touch of mint is quite delightful. Again, our local store carries it and every so often there might be a sale promotion, but saving on fuel and hours shopping at the grocery store, why not use our time wisely and shop from Amazon. One less trip to the store means more family time! Great price for a pack of 4 that comes to your door!</li>
            <li> This product is the best for sensitive teeth &amp; the price can&#x27;t be beat. Set it up on subscribe mode &amp; you&#x27;ll never have to remember to pick some up at the store. It shows up automatically &amp; you never run out.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both used Sensodyne Pronamel and ended up with SEVERE mouth pain, extremely red &amp; sensitive gums, painful tongue, and sores in mouth &amp; throat.  Thank God we saw improvement after quitting the stuff.  It should be taken off the market ASAP!  Don&#x27;t try it.  I read many complaints on another review website about it after the fact.</li>
