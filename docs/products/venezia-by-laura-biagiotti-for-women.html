            <li>The fragrance lingers all day and smells wonderful and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great product and service.</li>
            <li>Great deal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years.  </li>
            <li>Also, has a Good Price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why, when something is so loved and popular, that it has to be discontinued and then</li>
            <li>I could never find a fragrance that i liked as well.</li>
            <li>of course, to each his own.</li>
            <li>All I can say is this is my most favorite scent ever!</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this perfume...</li>
            <li>I was told this is her favorite</li>
            <li>SO glad they are making Venezia again.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find Venezia anywhere</li>
            <li>Just as amazing as the original that was debuted in 1992.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to order this perfume after so many years of not having it.  </li>
            <li>It is an evening, strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is okay, but it is not the original formula, which I absolutely loved, and which lasted so much longer than the new formula.  </li>
            <li>Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li>I wish they would just make the original.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping this smelled like the original formula.</li>
            <li>I thought about returning it, but since it is the closest thing you can get to the original, I am going to keep it.  </li>
            <li>It hits the notes of the original when I first apply it, but really does not have the original&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li>I am on the second bottle of this parfum and love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad this fragrance is back.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally bought knock-offs which were ok.  </li>
            <li>and so glad it came back on the market in the USA!</li>
            <li>Smells like love but reminds me of New England summers and fall as a young girl</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe the scent...</li>
            <li>Not the real thing if you are looking for the original, but close enough for you to remember.</li>
            <li>Please go back to making the original.</li>
            <li>Bring back the original.</li>
            <li>It has the same scent as the original, just a bit lighter.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to see it come back.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those looking for something very adult/sensual/high class.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to push the new top down to far because the spritzer will get stuck in the top.</li>
            <li>This new Venezia is a lot like the knock-offs, maybe a little better.  </li>
            <li>This is the new and improved version of Venezia.</li>
            <li>(wished it was exact same product)</li>
            <li>This is the relaunch if an old perfume.</li>
            <li>I am so upset that it smells old and syrupy.  </li>
            <li>and I totally surprised her when it was delivered.</li>
            <li>Astronomical disappointment:(&lt;br /&gt;It differs from the original, so much so that I&#x27;d go so far as to say it is unpleasant.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the relaunch if an old perfume. While not exactly the same it&#x27;s pretty close. A little softer but it lasts just as long and still get lots if compliments.</li>
            <li> I am on the second bottle of this parfum and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! Hard to find except on line.</li>
            <li> I am so glad this fragrance is back.  I used it for years before it was discontinued.  I could never find a fragrance that i liked as well.</li>
            <li> This smells like I remember but the scent does not last. Please go back to making the original. I don&#x27;t understand why, when something is so loved and popular, that it has to be discontinued and then &amp;#34;brought back&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s different. Doesn&#x27;t the maker want to continue making money? Bring back the original.</li>
            <li> This is the new and improved version of Venezia. It has the same scent as the original, just a bit lighter. The fragrance lingers all day and smells wonderful and pleasant. Be careful not to push the new top down to far because the spritzer will get stuck in the top. I used a small fingernail clipper to get it out.</li>
            <li> Just as amazing as the original that was debuted in 1992.  This is my signature scent and was I very disappointed after it was discontinued.  Highly recommend to those looking for something very adult/sensual/high class.  Worth EVERY penny!</li>

            <li> I hate to give this two stars but I was hoping this smelled like the original formula. This was the perfume my mom wore all the time before she passed away and I was so excited to see it come back.  That is the reason I bought it to remind me of her.  I am so upset that it smells old and syrupy.  I wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years.  Been trying to find it everywhere but was said to be discontinued until I found it on Amazon! Love Love Love this perfume... Smells like love but reminds me of New England summers and fall as a young girl</li>
            <li> I have been searching for Venezia for YEARS! I bought before I read the reviews and was quite bummed when I read them. I received perfume today.  Yes it is slightly different  (wished it was exact same product) but Im very happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> The best Eau de Parfum! It is an evening, strong fragrance. Also, has a Good Price.</li>
            <li> My mother inlaw loves it I was told this is her favorite and I totally surprised her when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> SO glad they are making Venezia again. My favorite perfume every!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> Great price for the size!! Haven&#x27;t been able to find Venezia anywhere so I was very happy to see it here. Great deal and I would recommend it to everyone</li>

            <li> All I can say is this is my most favorite scent ever! Whenever I wear it everyone asks what it is.I can&#x27;t really describe the scent...it&#x27;s indescribable, nothing else like it and so glad it came back on the market in the USA!</li>
