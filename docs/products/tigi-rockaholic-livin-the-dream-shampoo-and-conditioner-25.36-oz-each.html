            <li> The shampoo and conditioner both smell great.  They leave my hair soft and shiny without being oily.  This is great for any hair type.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and condition is awesome. My hair designer recommend I try this after he colored my hair. He really know what he is talking about. This stuff is awesome! My hair was so soft and manageable not to mention it is great for keep the color in my hair longer because it is sulfate free. The pump help converse the amount of shampoo and condition you use too, saving you money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this product is awesome and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product and it smells amazing!  I would recommend it ti everyone.  It is very concentrated so it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I ordered TIGI Rockaholic \\&quot;Livin&#x27; The Dream Shampoo &amp; Conditioner\\&quot; off of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly, and everything came just as it should. I was very pleased I didn&#x27;t have to send anything back. This was my first time ordering Shampoo off of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I have always been a fan of TIGI&#x27;s product&#x27;s, but this shampoo/conditioner has to be one of my favorites from them. Leaves your hair very moisturized, managable, and the smell is delicious! Like..Coconut Lime Verbena.&lt;br /&gt;Also, let me not forget that this stuff is sulfate free so its really gentle on color treated hair and I noticed my color seemed to last longer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo/conditioner combo the smell is wonderful and it has greatly improved my hair since I started using it. A great plus is that it&#x27;s sulfate free and very gentle on my hilighted hair. I also have purchased dirty secret (the dry shampoo) and the rockaholic brand of hairspray is my favorite. Great overall collection of hair products!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Smells great. Works great on my hair, but the conditioner caused my back to break out a little bit. Make sure you rinse your skin well after you rinse your hair out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner but I don&#x27;t really see much difference in my hair. I have fine hair and it does seem to weigh it down. But it does keep it smooth looking</li>
            <li> smells great! makes your hair look and feel good. i also like the s factor smoothing creme shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I have been diligently searching for a good sulfate-free shampoo for awhile. I&#x27;ve been using Rockaholic Livin&#x27; The Dream for a couple months now, and I think I found the right one for me! Livin&#x27; The Dream leaves my hair feeling clean, soft, and moisturized without frizzies and that weighed-down feeling. My hair is shiny and has a bit of bounce, which is great since I have thin, flat hair. The price might seem a little high, but you get both the shampoo and conditioner in large pump bottles. I know that this is going to last me quite awhile, so it&#x27;s a good deal. The scent reminds me of coconut lime verbena, which isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s faint enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome sulfate-free shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great products - get my hair clean, shiny, and healthy-looking (my thick, coarse hair tends to get VERY dry).  It smells great, too - not overpowering, not floral or perfume-y.  Just right.  I would recommend this product set to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Did dry my hair out, but everyone is individual.  I still use the product, but just added a deep conditioner 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I like this product but wasn&#x27;t wowed by it.  I will not order it again because I have found ones I like better.</li>
            <li> TIGI Rockaholic is my favorite shampoo/conditioner combo.  It&#x27;s kind of pricey, which is almost a good thing; if I could buy it as often as I wanted, I&#x27;d never get out of the shower.  The stuff smells so. darned. good.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner leave my hair looking and feeling great, but the aroma...wow.</li>
            <li> I really love the product. It makes my hair feel and look great. Very shiny and soft. It smells great in the shower. I love that it is sulfate free it is healthier for my hair. My boyfriend also loves the smell and how it makes my hair look. I highly recommend it to people who have thin color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, Have been a long time user.</li>
            <li> this stuff isnt too shabby. a good everyday set. it wont do too much to super damaged hair like mine, but its gentle enough where i can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really good shampoo and conditioner based on the other reviews but oh my gosh! It does smell good but it has a weird underlying smell that i cannot really pin down the closest thing I can compare it to is has a semi - smoky smell? anyway it was like glue in my hands and after I got out of the shower it was like I washed me hair with candle wax. A day later I was combing my hair out to reveal tons of dandruff I just felt so gross after one day I went and washed my hair with my $3.99 suave shampoo and felt a thousand pounds lighter! I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch but I will never buy from here again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have purchased these big bottles of shampoo and conditioner. I have yet to find a better deal.</li>
            <li> not the same as what I&#x27;ve purchased in salons.  suspect this product may have been on the shelf a while.</li>
            <li> This product is great for taking care of color treated hair with a great scent and it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner especially since it is sulfate free.  Excellent product at an excellent price.  I have used this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> As an old lady with old lady hair, this shampoo and conditioner has made my hair feel and look great.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal on my favorite shampoo and conditioner. It was recommended by my hair stylist and I will continue to order it.</li>
