            <li>After the first use I noticed a difference.  </li>

            <li> (my hair is overprocessed and dry).  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;be applied even to dry hair....</li>
            <li> I use it both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> and I flat iron it everyday which causes damage and creates frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> But it weighs it down less than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I used about a nickel size drop on wet hair, then dried and styled.  </li>

            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> maybe too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I made the impulsive decision to buy a 6.8 fl oz bottle directly from the hair salon</li>
            <li> Otherwise it creates an oil slick</li>
            <li> My hair gets frizzy in the summer and it&#x27;s hard to comb through it.  </li>
            <li> Those who have thick hair or like to straighten their hair shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> He, like I, have thick and course hair.  </li>
            <li> Use a small amount for lots of coverage!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down either!!!!</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t figure out how to show before and after pictures.</li>

            <li> I have fine hair- maybe too heavy for my hair. My hair comes out looking a bit straw-like and no body.</li>
            <li> Works great but use just a little.  Like a dot on your finger. Otherwise it creates an oil slick</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair.  He uses it to get it straight.  Smells great, works great.  Too bad I can&#x27;t figure out how to show before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It smells great. I just have to be careful not to put too much because my hair is a little fine and wavy. Those who have thick hair or like to straighten their hair shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. I don&#x27;t heat style my hair at all, so I can&#x27;t say how it works with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that I only shampoo and condition my hair once a week, so I use this right after I get out of the shower after shampoo/conditioning (wet hair) and then throughout the week on dry hair as needed for frizzy, unruly hair. I used to use it along with argan oil when I had brown hair, which I had to stop because the oil stains my blonde, but this product works wonders as a stand alone! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the overwhelming positive reviews!!! So glad I did!  This product is amazing. My hair is naturally curly, shoulder length and I flat iron it everyday which causes damage and creates frizzy ends. After the first use I noticed a difference.  I used about a nickel size drop on wet hair, then dried and styled.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down either!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product- smooths without greasing or weighing down. I use this for a de tangled for my daughter as well and it makes such a difference!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great !!  Smells wonderful and smooths my hair very well without weighting it down -- I have fine hair and this is the only smoothing serum that I can use --</li>
            <li> I had purchased this from my beautician&#x27;s shop for much more $.&lt;br /&gt;I love the stuff, so to Amazon I went....&amp; the savings was great!</li>
            <li> Had a sample of this so I thought I would order some.  Got it today and even though I don&#x27;t have to use it as I have with the sample, I love this stuff.  It does not weigh your hair down, smells nice, has natural ingredients, and does not make hair oily or like straw.  I love it so far and will buy again.  quick shipping thank you.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Neuma by my hair stylist.  This stuff is awesome!  Where has it been my entire life?  Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey but if you are interested in your hair looking great, this is well worth the money.  It kept the flyaways to a minimum and helped with shine.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me, so I bought a bottle. I have very fine frizzy hair. Blonde and frizzy hair often has no shine. This has not only tamed the frizz quite a bit, it really leaves my curls soft and shiny. I can&#x27;t use enough to completely get rid of all frizz (and I live in a wet climate), or it weighs my fine hair down too much. But it weighs it down less than other products I&#x27;ve used. Unless and until I find something better, this is it.</li>
            <li> Does help with my fuzzy hair.</li>
            <li> Neuma Smoothing Creme keeps my hair tame and smooth even in south Florida! Nice, lightweight creme and smells great!  Use a small amount for lots of coverage!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It makes my hair really soft. I am using it along with soma straightener and its great result.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair gets frizzy in the summer and it&#x27;s hard to comb through it.  A dimes worth of smoothing creme rubbed in hair makes the biggest different.  It was smooth, easy to comb through and my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy.  I received it fast and packed well.  I will keep on buying this as long as it keeps on working.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product in the same way as many people on here did. My hair stylist used it on my hair after a fresh cut, then proceeded to blow dry straighten my hair. I fell in love the smell and product! Unfortunately I made the impulsive decision to buy a 6.8 fl oz bottle directly from the hair salon I go to. I ended up paying $23. Wish I just looked up the product on here first thing because I could have saved some money! All in all it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;m always blow dry straightening my hair, so I am lost without using this product to control my frizz. I recently purchase a bottle of blow dry lotion on here. The two are very similar. The money is worth it, so don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. Will be making another purchase once my bottles are done!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural hair (four months now) and have been straightening my hair in the process.  This is great for taming the hair during blow drying and even for smoothing after flat ironing.  It&#x27;s not especially oily and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh the hair down much.</li>
            <li> Im in love with Neuma!!! This is another must have. I have curly but chemically relaxed hair. I use this product before I dry my hair and it give me amazing results!</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizzies down.  I alternate this with the mousse product and it works well.</li>
            <li> Neuma is always wonderful and my stylist agree&#x27;s. I ordered more for my daughter who came over one day and asked what the lovely fragrance was. .she loves it too.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for smoothing and conditioning my hair.  I love how it leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I think the product prepares my hair for the blow dryer and styling that I put it through every day.  I love the scent!</li>
            <li> Smoothing creme and the blow drying lotion seem to do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair feel silky (my hair is overprocessed and dry).  The smoothing creme can&lt;br /&gt;be applied even to dry hair....Smoothed down the hair and made it shine.  Love&lt;br /&gt;the product.  Although it is pricey.</li>
            <li> The best ever! I use daily after I shower. Less frizz and my curls are a lot happier....me too!!!</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I use it both wet and dry. My hair tends to get frizzy, especially in humid weather. Neuma Smoothing Creme tames the frizzes.</li>
            <li> tried this product at my sons house.  He, like I, have thick and course hair.  Using a quarter size amount of this product s louts hair and smells great.  I even use it before a flat iron</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair smooth all day, i love the fresh smell it has.</li>
            <li> Excellent result, especially with my unruly hair. I can definitely rewind this product. A bit more pricey than other products but definitely worth it .</li>
            <li> perfect for my hair, love the smell, my curls are back to the way they used to be, 3-4 pumps are enough for my upper back length hair, great brand, great product. I pair it with their argan oil</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It seems to make my hair more managable and less frizzy.  I use it daily.  My daughter liked it so much, she bought it  and is also a regular user</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for taming my curly, wavy hair.. I love it.  The best part is that Amazon&#x27;s prices are about 33% lower than my stylist&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great pricing... who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> works great while blow drying..</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy but I am loving this creme.  I&#x27;m a product junkie and have tried everything. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> great for frizzy hair</li>
