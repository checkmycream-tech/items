            <li>The problem is for Los Angeles nights which are very warm, this water pillow is too &amp;#34;cold &amp;#34; for me, I tried sleeping once, and woke up in the midfleof the night with the vision loss in one of the eys</li>

            <li>Good product for pillow</li>
            <li>It was so good, I got one for my husband too.  </li>
            <li>well made, nice material, comfortable, very nice quality, nice details in the design, zipper works excellent, can not be beat</li>
            <li>My Chiroflow Pillow fit perfect in this, and I love the fact it protects my pillow!</li>
            <li>Hopefully this cover will add a couple more years of use to my Sleep Better pillow (which is awesome BTW).</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the pillow cover</li>
            <li>This quilted pillow cover does exactly what the seller claims and is perfect for the Waterbase Pillow.  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Could not recommend this item, any more!</li>
            <li>I love this cover!  </li>
            <li>Great fit.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>This pillow case cover fits well, washes nice, provides padding, and prevents allergens.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and fits the pillow nicely.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does in the picture, it&#x27;s not quilted on all sides..</li>
            <li>well and was nice quality.</li>
            <li>Nice pillow cover.  </li>
            <li>This pillow cover does the job quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice cover.</li>
            <li>The quilted side is a nice &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this thing would feel, but for me it is the perfect pillow.  </li>
            <li>I took them out of the package and was very impressed with just how soft they feel!  </li>
            <li>Very nice and adequate quilting.  </li>
            <li>Soft and squishy and fits the water pillow perfectly!!!</li>
            <li>By FAR, the best pillow on the market.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li>Very soft &amp; fit the pillow I also ordered perfectly.</li>
            <li>I tried varying levels of water in it, but my orthopedic pillow I had was much better (for me) than this one.  </li>
            <li>Zipper could be designed better though, part of it doesn&#x27;t fully zip because of the pillows shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s a good nights rest to you worth?</li>
            <li>I have neck issues and have tried many shape forming pillows.  </li>
            <li>She, too, is in love with this pillow and has gotten relief from her pain.  </li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>Better</li>
            <li>Sure Comfort Side Sleeper pillow</li>
            <li>The quilting is nice and of a comfortable density to sleep on.</li>
            <li>and are quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m entirely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I sleep better, feel more rested and don&#x27;t toss and turn all night.</li>
            <li>I have FINALLY FOUND the best pillow in the world!  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay a dollar or two more and have it quilted on both sides, so</li>
            <li>Could be quilted on both sides to make it even better.</li>
            <li>I love my Chiroflow pillow and this makes it even better.</li>
            <li>And I love that the firmness is adjustable by adding or removing water.  </li>
            <li>perfect fit for the pillow and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I believe it has added to better sleep for me.</li>
            <li>and I was in love.</li>
            <li>and i am buying four more for my sons.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PILLOW CASE..</li>
            <li>Great products &amp; very well made.  </li>
            <li>I love my water pillow.  </li>
            <li>My wife and son have also purchased the water pillow and they love them as well.</li>
            <li>So glad these covers are made for our Mediflow pillows.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace others that I&#x27;d used for years, that had seen better days at this point.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love these water pillow covers.</li>
            <li>This is my first review that I have done and it is for a good reason.</li>
            <li>fits great on the new water pillow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supportive and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, the pillow is amazingly comfortable, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>If you bought the Mediflow Water Based Pillows, don&#x27;t scrimp and get the covers, makes the pillows even more comfortable.</li>
            <li>However I can&#x27;t seem to feel the comfort I thought I would feel Maybe i need more water i filled it with 2 quarts.</li>
            <li>If someone has a bit of advice as to making it more comfortable</li>
            <li>Good quality pillow cover for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash.</li>
            <li>Comes with a spout adapter for easy filling.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>Easy to set up.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t washed it yet, so don&#x27;t know if it will shrink, but I think it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li>The cover is comfortable and well constructed.</li>
            <li>This is one fantastic pillow.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where I carry my stress and this allows me to sleep comfortably and not wake up in pain with muscle spasms.</li>
            <li>It fit with Chiroflow Premium Water Pillow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap looking compared to the price</li>
            <li>Fit pillow</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to lay on, and washes well.  </li>
            <li>This quilted cover is very nice and comfortable and protects the actual pillow from stains.</li>
            <li>This pillow is OK you have to put the right amount of water in itfor your sleep style.</li>
            <li>I am sure other people who use it is extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my new Chiroflow pillow and it works wonderful while adding extra comfort!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li>cover helps to keep the pillow clean.</li>
            <li>The concept sounded cool.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many pillows to support my neck and head and none of them have been as high quality of a product as this pillow!</li>
            <li>It helps me stay cool at night, too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a thick pillow and this works excellent for me.</li>
            <li>It just makes my pillow nice and soft now.  </li>
            <li>Other than this issue, it is great.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick &amp; on time.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much !</li>
            <li>Very high quality and easy to fill with the supplied funnel.</li>
            <li>I have mine for 3 years and love it, still look like new</li>
            <li>With exercise and stretching  I have had some relief but what really helped me was after just 1-2 nights using this pillow!!</li>
            <li>We purchased these pillow covers for our recently purchased water pillows (which we both love!)</li>
            <li>so I did not see it first hand, but received no complaints from her!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It is so comfortable and it really relieves my neck pain.  </li>
            <li>WOW is all I can say :-)</li>
            <li>Worth every $$$</li>
            <li>I washed it right away</li>
            <li>Who can&#x27;t use two, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more different types of &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; pillows, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Also the way they keep making everything cheaper the quality may not be as good down the road.</li>
            <li>: The case is great and has helped keep the pillow in excellent condition, but the zipper&#x27;s design is horrible...</li>
            <li>I feel like this is a fabulous benefit, as it keeps your pillow from wandering around or needing to be fluffed and constantly rearranged to get comfortable.  </li>
            <li>, Very much think it&#x27;s being over charged.</li>
            <li>I can sleep very comfortably on it whether on my back, side, or stomach.  </li>
            <li>As far as I know, it was fine and covered the pillow with no issues.  </li>
            <li>and I would still be using the first pillow that I purchased</li>
            <li>I guess the only reason I can think of as to not purchase this cover is to find out first if you like a water pillow before investing more money into it.</li>
            <li>Looks nice and performs as expected.</li>
            <li>Received mine last night, and was able to use it immediately.</li>
            <li>I bought my first 9 years ago</li>
            <li>THERE MUST&#x27;VE BEEN AN ERROR IN MANUFACTURING BECAUSE THE FIRST NIGHT I USED THE PILLOW</li>
            <li>I have a herniated disc in my neck &amp; since using this pillow, I have been able to lay &amp; sleep on my back.  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more for the rest of the bed pillows in the house.</li>
            <li>Gave it a 4 because you can by equal quality and/or better with a coupon at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li>This is very good for insulating and providing a little extra padding.</li>
            <li>Last time (about 7years ago) we bought a water filled pillow and really liked the pillow except it was hard to keep clean, hopefully with this cover it will continue to stay clean.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have definitely had more restful nights and less headaches.</li>
            <li>Seems to be well made, fits perfectly (and my pillow is a little oversized due to the type of pillow it is with a water bag inside).  </li>
            <li>It barely makes the pillow more soft and cushioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them on regular pillows, not waterbase ones, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>But with the water pillow it adds a nice little cushiony feel between you and the pillow.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>This pillow really lives up to its claims.  </li>
            <li>It is a great idea but it is not great in life.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can adjust the firmness of the pillow by how much water it contains.  </li>
            <li>Looks very well made &amp; is washable.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I finally found a pillow that allows me to sleep comfortably on my side.</li>
            <li>I bought the waterbase pillow with the quilted pillow cover, and I am very please with</li>
            <li>I really like this pillow cover.</li>
            <li>But I really like it and would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is a</li>
            <li>Thanks much</li>
            <li>I think it will extend the pillows life and keep them much cleaner.</li>
            <li>They wash very well too.</li>
            <li>It covers the pillow very well.</li>
            <li>Nice cover, definitely going to help the pillow last.</li>
            <li>Some people like a harder pillowwhich means more water some people like a softer uipillow which means less water just rememberthere the more water you put in it the heavier it getsdid.</li>
            <li>Provides great insulation from the cold &amp; is soft &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>You can change the amount of water you put in and it is very soft and large.</li>
            <li>I then purchased 2 more for my other new water pillows.  </li>
            <li>I use the down version) pillow itself clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>You need to order this at the same time as your pillow, because you won&#x27;t be able to find one in your local stores.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I like it a little better.</li>
            <li>and it gives the pillow a little more form</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>No funny smell, and every comfortable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I lay on my left side, on my right side or on my back - it conforms to my current position and is always comfortable.</li>
            <li>IT LEAKED ALL OVER MY FAIRLY NEW BED</li>
            <li>I bought this along with my new &#x27;water pillows&#x27; for a Christmas gift to myself.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that a ten plus year pillow that works for you is cheap if you compare it to a standard pillow.</li>
            <li>I have&#x27;nt tried other theraputic pillows, but I&#x27;m definately sleeping better with it vs a standard pillow.</li>
            <li>This pillow case is so soft!  </li>
            <li>The best pillow that I&#x27;ve ever bought it in the past two years I button quite a few and spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li>another thing when you closing the pillow after you add the water do not put on the cap do not twist it too tight or you will never be able to get it open againor</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit to figure out how much water the pillow needs to get to your comfort level, but is so worth the couple of nights of wrestling with the pillow.  </li>
            <li>It not only adds a little extra protection from hair and face oils for the pillow, but adds a touch of, &amp;#34;cush&amp;#34; because of the nice quilted affect.</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money on another Chiroflow pillow.  </li>
            <li>We have an almost year old HE washer and dryer.  </li>
            <li>It was sent directly to her with the pillow</li>
            <li>My old water pillow fell apart because I did not have this product.  </li>
            <li>They do constrict the pillows just a little which suits hubby just fine because he likes a firm full pillow.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and keep the expensive water pillow clean and free from stains.</li>
            <li>As stated in a previous review about the pillow protector, standard pillow cases don&#x27;t fit chiroflow pillows as they bunch the water bladder.  </li>
            <li>just exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>I have had such a difficult time finding a good pillow that would support me without being too firm, too soft, too hot, too something!  </li>
            <li>The ability to customize the firmness to suit my preference was a major selling feature.</li>
            <li>and you cannot see through the pillow to see how full it is if you don&#x27;t watch it you will overflow the pillow and have a big mess water everywhere on the pillow on your bed.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, the cover fits any standard size pillow.</li>
            <li>, I thought I had a stroke, even though I am young, but my vision came back in 50 min.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re only quilted on one side, but wash and wear nicely so far.</li>
            <li>hope it makes the pillow last longer as some reviews indicated will do new review next year.</li>
            <li>It has releaved my injured neck and the pain is not so bad any more!!</li>
            <li>With my bad neck that surgery a few years ago, this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had chronic problems with my neck for several years and have tried various treatments with little success.</li>
            <li>My last pillow was 10 years old and I&#x27;de still have it if I had a second barrier like this cover to obsorb my moisture and launder on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I washed these on the &#x27;delicate&#x27; and &#x27;warm water&#x27; settings with my Premier Softspun sheets (these wash settings are what&#x27;s on the sheets) and dried them together on low</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall seeing that in the description, 2)I wish the zipper key was either not as big or could be easily hidden as I do feel it through my pillow case and 3)I wish the quilting was on both sides so we didn&#x27;t feel the water pillow plug as much as we do.  </li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with the pillow cover</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Could not recommend this item, any more!</li>
            <li> I love this cover!  </li>
            <li> Great fit.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> This pillow case cover fits well, washes nice, provides padding, and prevents allergens.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and fits the pillow nicely.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does in the picture, it&#x27;s not quilted on all sides..</li>
            <li> well and was nice quality.</li>
            <li> Nice pillow cover.  </li>
            <li> This pillow cover does the job quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice cover.</li>
            <li> The quilted side is a nice &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this thing would feel, but for me it is the perfect pillow.  </li>
            <li> I took them out of the package and was very impressed with just how soft they feel!  </li>
            <li> Very nice and adequate quilting.  </li>
            <li> Soft and squishy and fits the water pillow perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> By FAR, the best pillow on the market.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Very soft &amp; fit the pillow I also ordered perfectly.</li>
            <li> I tried varying levels of water in it, but my orthopedic pillow I had was much better (for me) than this one.  </li>
            <li> Zipper could be designed better though, part of it doesn&#x27;t fully zip because of the pillows shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s a good nights rest to you worth?</li>
            <li> I have neck issues and have tried many shape forming pillows.  </li>
            <li> She, too, is in love with this pillow and has gotten relief from her pain.  </li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> Better</li>
            <li> Sure Comfort Side Sleeper pillow</li>
            <li> The quilting is nice and of a comfortable density to sleep on.</li>
            <li> and are quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m entirely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I sleep better, feel more rested and don&#x27;t toss and turn all night.</li>
            <li> I have FINALLY FOUND the best pillow in the world!  </li>
            <li> I would rather pay a dollar or two more and have it quilted on both sides, so</li>
            <li> Could be quilted on both sides to make it even better.</li>
            <li> I love my Chiroflow pillow and this makes it even better.</li>
            <li> And I love that the firmness is adjustable by adding or removing water.  </li>
            <li> perfect fit for the pillow and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> I believe it has added to better sleep for me.</li>
            <li> and I was in love.</li>
            <li> and i am buying four more for my sons.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PILLOW CASE..</li>
            <li> Great products &amp; very well made.  </li>
            <li> I love my water pillow.  </li>
            <li> My wife and son have also purchased the water pillow and they love them as well.</li>
            <li> So glad these covers are made for our Mediflow pillows.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace others that I&#x27;d used for years, that had seen better days at this point.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love these water pillow covers.</li>
            <li> This is my first review that I have done and it is for a good reason.</li>
            <li> fits great on the new water pillow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supportive and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, the pillow is amazingly comfortable, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> If you bought the Mediflow Water Based Pillows, don&#x27;t scrimp and get the covers, makes the pillows even more comfortable.</li>
            <li> However I can&#x27;t seem to feel the comfort I thought I would feel Maybe i need more water i filled it with 2 quarts.</li>
            <li> If someone has a bit of advice as to making it more comfortable</li>
            <li> Good quality pillow cover for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash.</li>
            <li> Comes with a spout adapter for easy filling.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> Easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t washed it yet, so don&#x27;t know if it will shrink, but I think it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li> The cover is comfortable and well constructed.</li>
            <li> This is one fantastic pillow.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where I carry my stress and this allows me to sleep comfortably and not wake up in pain with muscle spasms.</li>
            <li> It fit with Chiroflow Premium Water Pillow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap looking compared to the price</li>
            <li> Fit pillow</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to lay on, and washes well.  </li>
            <li> This quilted cover is very nice and comfortable and protects the actual pillow from stains.</li>
            <li> This pillow is OK you have to put the right amount of water in itfor your sleep style.</li>
            <li> I am sure other people who use it is extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my new Chiroflow pillow and it works wonderful while adding extra comfort!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> cover helps to keep the pillow clean.</li>
            <li> The concept sounded cool.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many pillows to support my neck and head and none of them have been as high quality of a product as this pillow!</li>
            <li> It helps me stay cool at night, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a thick pillow and this works excellent for me.</li>
            <li> It just makes my pillow nice and soft now.  </li>
            <li> Other than this issue, it is great.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick &amp; on time.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much !</li>
            <li> Very high quality and easy to fill with the supplied funnel.</li>
            <li> I have mine for 3 years and love it, still look like new</li>
            <li> With exercise and stretching  I have had some relief but what really helped me was after just 1-2 nights using this pillow!!</li>
            <li> We purchased these pillow covers for our recently purchased water pillows (which we both love!)</li>
            <li> so I did not see it first hand, but received no complaints from her!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It is so comfortable and it really relieves my neck pain.  </li>
            <li> WOW is all I can say :-)</li>
            <li> Worth every $$$</li>
            <li> I washed it right away</li>
            <li> Who can&#x27;t use two, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more different types of &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; pillows, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Also the way they keep making everything cheaper the quality may not be as good down the road.</li>
            <li> : The case is great and has helped keep the pillow in excellent condition, but the zipper&#x27;s design is horrible...</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a fabulous benefit, as it keeps your pillow from wandering around or needing to be fluffed and constantly rearranged to get comfortable.  </li>
            <li> , Very much think it&#x27;s being over charged.</li>
            <li> I can sleep very comfortably on it whether on my back, side, or stomach.  </li>
            <li> As far as I know, it was fine and covered the pillow with no issues.  </li>
            <li> and I would still be using the first pillow that I purchased</li>
            <li> I guess the only reason I can think of as to not purchase this cover is to find out first if you like a water pillow before investing more money into it.</li>
            <li> Looks nice and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Received mine last night, and was able to use it immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought my first 9 years ago</li>
            <li> THERE MUST&#x27;VE BEEN AN ERROR IN MANUFACTURING BECAUSE THE FIRST NIGHT I USED THE PILLOW</li>
            <li> I have a herniated disc in my neck &amp; since using this pillow, I have been able to lay &amp; sleep on my back.  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more for the rest of the bed pillows in the house.</li>
            <li> Gave it a 4 because you can by equal quality and/or better with a coupon at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li> This is very good for insulating and providing a little extra padding.</li>
            <li> Last time (about 7years ago) we bought a water filled pillow and really liked the pillow except it was hard to keep clean, hopefully with this cover it will continue to stay clean.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have definitely had more restful nights and less headaches.</li>
            <li> Seems to be well made, fits perfectly (and my pillow is a little oversized due to the type of pillow it is with a water bag inside).  </li>
            <li> It barely makes the pillow more soft and cushioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them on regular pillows, not waterbase ones, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> But with the water pillow it adds a nice little cushiony feel between you and the pillow.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This pillow really lives up to its claims.  </li>
            <li> It is a great idea but it is not great in life.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can adjust the firmness of the pillow by how much water it contains.  </li>
            <li> Looks very well made &amp; is washable.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I finally found a pillow that allows me to sleep comfortably on my side.</li>
            <li> I bought the waterbase pillow with the quilted pillow cover, and I am very please with</li>
            <li> I really like this pillow cover.</li>
            <li> But I really like it and would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really is a</li>
            <li> Thanks much</li>
            <li> I think it will extend the pillows life and keep them much cleaner.</li>
            <li> They wash very well too.</li>
            <li> It covers the pillow very well.</li>
            <li> Nice cover, definitely going to help the pillow last.</li>
            <li> Some people like a harder pillowwhich means more water some people like a softer uipillow which means less water just rememberthere the more water you put in it the heavier it getsdid.</li>
            <li> Provides great insulation from the cold &amp; is soft &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> You can change the amount of water you put in and it is very soft and large.</li>
            <li> I then purchased 2 more for my other new water pillows.  </li>
            <li> I use the down version) pillow itself clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> You need to order this at the same time as your pillow, because you won&#x27;t be able to find one in your local stores.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I like it a little better.</li>
            <li> and it gives the pillow a little more form</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> No funny smell, and every comfortable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I lay on my left side, on my right side or on my back - it conforms to my current position and is always comfortable.</li>
            <li> IT LEAKED ALL OVER MY FAIRLY NEW BED</li>
            <li> I bought this along with my new &#x27;water pillows&#x27; for a Christmas gift to myself.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that a ten plus year pillow that works for you is cheap if you compare it to a standard pillow.</li>
            <li> I have&#x27;nt tried other theraputic pillows, but I&#x27;m definately sleeping better with it vs a standard pillow.</li>
            <li> This pillow case is so soft!  </li>
            <li> The best pillow that I&#x27;ve ever bought it in the past two years I button quite a few and spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li> another thing when you closing the pillow after you add the water do not put on the cap do not twist it too tight or you will never be able to get it open againor</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to figure out how much water the pillow needs to get to your comfort level, but is so worth the couple of nights of wrestling with the pillow.  </li>
            <li> It not only adds a little extra protection from hair and face oils for the pillow, but adds a touch of, &amp;#34;cush&amp;#34; because of the nice quilted affect.</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money on another Chiroflow pillow.  </li>
            <li> We have an almost year old HE washer and dryer.  </li>
            <li> It was sent directly to her with the pillow</li>
            <li> My old water pillow fell apart because I did not have this product.  </li>
            <li> They do constrict the pillows just a little which suits hubby just fine because he likes a firm full pillow.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and keep the expensive water pillow clean and free from stains.</li>
            <li> As stated in a previous review about the pillow protector, standard pillow cases don&#x27;t fit chiroflow pillows as they bunch the water bladder.  </li>
            <li> just exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I have had such a difficult time finding a good pillow that would support me without being too firm, too soft, too hot, too something!  </li>
            <li> The ability to customize the firmness to suit my preference was a major selling feature.</li>
            <li> and you cannot see through the pillow to see how full it is if you don&#x27;t watch it you will overflow the pillow and have a big mess water everywhere on the pillow on your bed.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the cover fits any standard size pillow.</li>
            <li> , I thought I had a stroke, even though I am young, but my vision came back in 50 min.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re only quilted on one side, but wash and wear nicely so far.</li>
            <li> hope it makes the pillow last longer as some reviews indicated will do new review next year.</li>
            <li> It has releaved my injured neck and the pain is not so bad any more!!</li>
            <li> With my bad neck that surgery a few years ago, this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had chronic problems with my neck for several years and have tried various treatments with little success.</li>
            <li> My last pillow was 10 years old and I&#x27;de still have it if I had a second barrier like this cover to obsorb my moisture and launder on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I washed these on the &#x27;delicate&#x27; and &#x27;warm water&#x27; settings with my Premier Softspun sheets (these wash settings are what&#x27;s on the sheets) and dried them together on low</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall seeing that in the description, 2)I wish the zipper key was either not as big or could be easily hidden as I do feel it through my pillow case and 3)I wish the quilting was on both sides so we didn&#x27;t feel the water pillow plug as much as we do.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I can say slightly negative about it, is if you have weakness or are otherwise physically fragile, the water definitely makes your pillow heavy for lifting, (even heavier than high density memory foam styles) but who really lifts their pillow that often?  </li>
            <li> Hope they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> You sleep on the soft, down or foam padded side--never on the water-bladder side of the pillow.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it was made out of 100% cotton, which meant I had to wash it by hand and hang to dry.  </li>
            <li> ; unlike other slightly more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd water pillow and the previous two were used without the cover and after a couple of years the fabric and padding on the pillows had turned very yellow from the absorbtion of perspiration.</li>
            <li> had I known that it was hand washable only, due to nerve damage in my hands</li>
            <li> I imagine you could use it for other pillows of the same size.</li>
            <li> I have wide shoulders and have spent a lot of money trying all kinds of different pillows.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used this pillow I wake up only twice a night on average, where it used to be 4-5 times a night.  </li>
            <li> That is highly unlikely since the pressure you put on a pillow would increase the size of the presumed hole quickly causing it to make your bed wet in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I can determine if my pillow is hard or soft.</li>
            <li> but it makes the pillow harder and hotter for me</li>
            <li> Also you must be careful not to overfill it because there is no automatic shut off</li>
            <li> My husband tries to share or steal my Chiroflow pillow every night.  </li>
            <li> I have delt with a stiff neck and shoulder pain for years having to make regular visits to the chiropractor.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had our pillows to long, less then a week.</li>
            <li> The pillow cover is made extremely well and the cloth is alot heavier than I would have expected for the cost.  </li>
            <li> I had buy a new pillow because the old one got to dirty</li>
            <li> The zipper is inverted and folds inward at the ends so that it is impossible to completely zip, and after a while, the other end of the zipper became undone and thus cause the whole zipper to break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Japanese &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; pillows, every kind of husk pillow, buckwheat something or other, memory foam of different shapes and sizes, expensive fluffy down pillows, hypoallergenic fiber fill, some silly Tony Little pillow, YOU NAME IT!  </li>
            <li> I tried one other review&#x27;s suggestion by blowing air instead.</li>
            <li> I recomend it for other pillows too.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break down.</li>
            <li> This one beats them all hands down</li>
            <li> and that night I went to lay down</li>
            <li> At half the price of a cervical pillow, it&#x27;s truly a bargain.</li>
            <li> But I still wish the zipper could be hidden as it does irritate me some nights if I happen to grab at that corner of my pillow.</li>
            <li> The pillow case came with black hairs in it.</li>
            <li> Previous to this I slept on a buckwheat pillow.</li>
            <li> i wake up with a lot less pain (cover and pillow</li>
            <li> I have owned a half dozen or so Mediflow Waterbase pillows over the years, and I always use the quilted pillow cover.</li>
            <li> It seems that it&#x27;s impossible to find quilted pillow covers any more unless you want to pay ridiculous prices, which I didn&#x27;t, so I thought I&#x27;d try these out.</li>
            <li> (The other side is plain percale cotton.)</li>
            <li> Also they give you a little spout to connect to the pillow when adding water</li>
            <li> Felt like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> As thirteen years have passed since my diagnosis, my neck is definitely getting worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is heavy tho.  </li>
            <li> I just received my water pillow cover in the mail a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I have been sleeping on a Chiroflow water pillow for a few months.</li>
            <li> I just wish it did not have to be so heavy.</li>
            <li> I noticed other reviews stating that they thought the pillow had a slow leak which lead to mold.</li>
            <li> When I would go to sleep in the evening I would wake up with a stiff neck and have a headache all day from my neck problems.</li>
            <li> I still wake up with stiff and sore neck.</li>
            <li> I quess I am to sensitive to the cold water in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I did not order it earlier.  </li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> When my daughter complained about pain in her neck, I ordered another one and had it sent to her.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and durable cover.</li>
            <li> It provides an extra, cushiony feel and keeps the (expensive!</li>
            <li> it will be very difficult to open?.</li>
            <li> The condition of the product was not good.</li>
            <li> When we sleep we leave behind moisture via sweat</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would shrink and not fit the pillow.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pillow from my Chiropractor, but was not impressed with it at all.  </li>
            <li> And yes I have a twisted vertebrate in my neck.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I an used to moving my pillow during the night and it is difficult.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong buying this pillow.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, but remember they are heavy!!!</li>
            <li> I thought maybe with the water inside,  it would feel cold but with the quilted pillow cover you cant feel the temperature of it at all.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t attest for tummy sleepers since my disc disease prohibits me from sleeping that way any longer :(  </li>
            <li> I am a slide sleeper and hate gooshy pillows.  </li>
            <li> Very disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have delt with a stiff neck and shoulder pain for years having to make regular visits to the chiropractor. With exercise and stretching  I have had some relief but what really helped me was after just 1-2 nights using this pillow!! You won&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. I will be ordering more for my family members!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice quality and very good price but it makes the pillow harder and hotter for me so I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This quilted pillow cover does exactly what the seller claims and is perfect for the Waterbase Pillow.  The cover is sturdy, fits perfectly and is very comfortable.  To me it&#x27;s a must-have if you&#x27;re going to use the Waterbase Pillow.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pillow from my Chiropractor, but was not impressed with it at all.  I tried varying levels of water in it, but my orthopedic pillow I had was much better (for me) than this one.  I would not waste my money on another Chiroflow pillow.  To me, this pillow is way over-rated.</li>
            <li> This pillow is OK you have to put the right amount of water in itfor your sleep style. Some people like a harder pillowwhich means more water some people like a softer uipillow which means less water just rememberthere the more water you put in it the heavier it getsdid. Also they give you a little spout to connect to the pillow when adding water it&#x27;s not very big and water can grip on the pillow. Also you must be careful not to overfill it because there is no automatic shut off and you cannot see through the pillow to see how full it is if you don&#x27;t watch it you will overflow the pillow and have a big mess water everywhere on the pillow on your bed. another thing when you closing the pillow after you add the water do not put on the cap do not twist it too tight or you will never be able to get it open againor it will be very difficult to open?.</li>
            <li> Nice cover, definitely going to help the pillow last. Zipper could be designed better though, part of it doesn&#x27;t fully zip because of the pillows shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: The case is great and has helped keep the pillow in excellent condition, but the zipper&#x27;s design is horrible... It&#x27;s not the fault of the pillow as I said earlier. The zipper is inverted and folds inward at the ends so that it is impossible to completely zip, and after a while, the other end of the zipper became undone and thus cause the whole zipper to break. This has caused me to lower my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second (Chiropractor recommended) water based pillow and I would still be using the first pillow that I purchased if I had purchased one of these covers at the same time. The water based pillow never leaked. It didn&#x27;t break down. It just got moldy. YUK. I noticed other reviews stating that they thought the pillow had a slow leak which lead to mold. That is highly unlikely since the pressure you put on a pillow would increase the size of the presumed hole quickly causing it to make your bed wet in a hurry. When we sleep we leave behind moisture via sweat and (oh yeh) DRULE. My last pillow was 10 years old and I&#x27;de still have it if I had a second barrier like this cover to obsorb my moisture and launder on a regular basis. I have&#x27;nt tried other theraputic pillows, but I&#x27;m definately sleeping better with it vs a standard pillow. And yes I have a twisted vertebrate in my neck. So if YOU invest into a water based pillow, I gladdly propose you purchase this item before you have the same result I did. Keep in mind that a ten plus year pillow that works for you is cheap if you compare it to a standard pillow. What&#x27;s a good nights rest to you worth? I guess the only reason I can think of as to not purchase this cover is to find out first if you like a water pillow before investing more money into it. If I knew they existed 10 years ago, I would have purchased one. Hope this helps you in your decision to purchase or not.</li>
            <li> I will not hold it against the cover.  I did not like the medi-flow pillow.  The concept sounded cool.  Big disappointment.  The cover is comfortable and well constructed.</li>
            <li> Protects my pillow and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> i DO A LOT OF SWEATING AND IT GETS SOAKING WET.&lt;br /&gt;OTHERWISE IT IS COMPFORTABLE. DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY IT SHOULD GET SO&lt;br /&gt;WET.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful and smooth transaction. The item I purchased was as described, wonderful condition, and arrived on time. Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li> This is one fantastic pillow.  I have neck issues and have tried many shape forming pillows.  This one beats them all hands down</li>
            <li> This pillow has been everything everyone said.  It&#x27;s supportive and comfortable.  I have purchased many pillows to support my neck and head and none of them have been as high quality of a product as this pillow!</li>
            <li> I have mine for 3 years and love it, still look like new and I sleep so well! I even bring it on vacation! Just purchased another one for a gift. My mom as one for 8 years!</li>
            <li> I put the water pillow in this pillowcase and there it sits. Looks nice and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pillow for myself recently and I haven&#x27;t lost a night&#x27;s sleep since.  I&#x27;ve had chronic problems with my neck for several years and have tried various treatments with little success. I no longer have pain in my neck. When my daughter complained about pain in her neck, I ordered another one and had it sent to her.  She, too, is in love with this pillow and has gotten relief from her pain.  This pillow really lives up to its claims.  At half the price of a cervical pillow, it&#x27;s truly a bargain.</li>
            <li> Does not seem necessary at all. It barely makes the pillow more soft and cushioned. Felt like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the pillow cover and glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> well made, nice material, comfortable, very nice quality, nice details in the design, zipper works excellent, can not be beat</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it. This is my second one of these. Wait, I thought I already wrote a review of this product. Anyway, it&#x27;s great for my chronic neck aches. That&#x27;s where I carry my stress and this allows me to sleep comfortably and not wake up in pain with muscle spasms. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for use with a Sleep Better Sure Comfort Side Sleeper pillow and it fits perfectly. As far as I can tell, the cover fits any standard size pillow. The quilting is nice and of a comfortable density to sleep on. However, it is only quilted on one side! (The other side is plain percale cotton.) Seems to be well constructed and went through the washer and dryer without incident. Hopefully this cover will add a couple more years of use to my Sleep Better pillow (which is awesome BTW).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t actually say this is scientific evidence, but I track my sleep with a fitness band.  Since I&#x27;ve used this pillow I wake up only twice a night on average, where it used to be 4-5 times a night.  At any rate, the pillow is amazingly comfortable, and I absolutely love it.  Can&#x27;t imagine going back to a regular pillow!</li>
            <li> If you bought the Mediflow Water Based Pillows, don&#x27;t scrimp and get the covers, makes the pillows even more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great fit. Feels good (cushion). Easy to wash. Adds an insulating layer   between the pillow that virtually eliminates water noise.</li>
            <li> We purchased these pillow covers for our recently purchased water pillows (which we both love!) and are quite pleased.  I took them out of the package and was very impressed with just how soft they feel!  Very nice and adequate quilting.  My only issues - and the reason I am giving a 4 star and not a 5 star - are: 1)that they are handwash only (I try not to buy anything if it can&#x27;t go in my washer and dryer)and I don&#x27;t recall seeing that in the description, 2)I wish the zipper key was either not as big or could be easily hidden as I do feel it through my pillow case and 3)I wish the quilting was on both sides so we didn&#x27;t feel the water pillow plug as much as we do.  But I would probably purchase these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/10/12:  I admit I didn&#x27;t think to look on the care instructions when I threw these in the wash today and then while I was reviewing my reviews I read what I wrote...LOL!  We have an almost year old HE washer and dryer.  I washed these on the &#x27;delicate&#x27; and &#x27;warm water&#x27; settings with my Premier Softspun sheets (these wash settings are what&#x27;s on the sheets) and dried them together on low and they came out beautiful!  But I still wish the zipper could be hidden as it does irritate me some nights if I happen to grab at that corner of my pillow.</li>
            <li> best pillow i ever used.</li>
            <li> Totally awesome! Soft and squishy and fits the water pillow perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> This pillow is wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I lay on my left side, on my right side or on my back - it conforms to my current position and is always comfortable. I love it! P.S. I added water for a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; firmness to start, and never needed to change from there.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go on my Chiroflow Premium Water Pillow and I&#x27;m entirely satisfied.</li>
            <li> As stated in a previous review about the pillow protector, standard pillow cases don&#x27;t fit chiroflow pillows as they bunch the water bladder.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The condition of the product was not good. The pillow case came with black hairs in it. Very disgusting.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this pillow my neck never felt pain again.  I sleep better, feel more rested and don&#x27;t toss and turn all night. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My Chiroflow Pillow fit perfect in this, and I love the fact it protects my pillow! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> By FAR, the best pillow on the market.  I have degenerative disc disease in my neck and back; I was diagnosed in 2000 at only 24 years of age.  I have had such a difficult time finding a good pillow that would support me without being too firm, too soft, too hot, too something!  As thirteen years have passed since my diagnosis, my neck is definitely getting worse.  I&#x27;ve tried Japanese &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; pillows, every kind of husk pillow, buckwheat something or other, memory foam of different shapes and sizes, expensive fluffy down pillows, hypoallergenic fiber fill, some silly Tony Little pillow, YOU NAME IT!  I have FINALLY FOUND the best pillow in the world!  Think waterbed meets pillow - the only thing I can say slightly negative about it, is if you have weakness or are otherwise physically fragile, the water definitely makes your pillow heavy for lifting, (even heavier than high density memory foam styles) but who really lifts their pillow that often?  I feel like this is a fabulous benefit, as it keeps your pillow from wandering around or needing to be fluffed and constantly rearranged to get comfortable.  THIS WORKS FOR BACK OR SIDE SLEEPERS, but I can&#x27;t attest for tummy sleepers since my disc disease prohibits me from sleeping that way any longer :(  You simply fill the pillow to the desired level of firmness you want and close it back up.  Comes with a spout adapter for easy filling.  Will be buying another for a back up pillow, and one for my husband who has a neck and spine injury from Iraq.  Hope they never go out of business!!</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to figure out how much water the pillow needs to get to your comfort level, but is so worth the couple of nights of wrestling with the pillow.  Has helped alleviate neck and shoulder problems.</li>
            <li> We like this cover. It not only adds a little extra protection from hair and face oils for the pillow, but adds a touch of, &amp;#34;cush&amp;#34; because of the nice quilted affect. It zips on one end so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Keeps neck level with spine. Helps with neck pain/headache.3RD Pillow in about 10 years. Should purchase quilted pillow cover with this item .If you sweat at night you need the cover to wash regularly or pillow will change color.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with nerve,disc and arthritis in my neck. When I would go to sleep in the evening I would wake up with a stiff neck and have a headache all day from my neck problems. When I received my water pillow I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I can honestly say I have definitely had more restful nights and less headaches. The reason I rate it four stars is because my neck still bothers me at times.</li>
            <li> Pillow cover fits and works good and have had no problems</li>
            <li> It is a great idea but it is not great in life.  My chiropractor reccomended it, so I bought it.  The problem is for Los Angeles nights which are very warm, this water pillow is too &amp;#34;cold &amp;#34; for me, I tried sleeping once, and woke up in the midfleof the night with the vision loss in one of the eys, I thought I had a stroke, even though I am young, but my vision came back in 50 min.  In the morning I called my doctor Snd my chiropractor, both said do not use the pillow, it cut the blood supplie into my eye.  So I am not using it ever since and donated it to my chiropractor.  I quess I am to sensitive to the cold water in it.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this thing would feel, but for me it is the perfect pillow.  I am a slide sleeper and hate gooshy pillows.  I used to stack 2-3 pillows to try to get enough loft to keep my head aligned with my spine.  This pillow does it perfectly.  I got the quilted case as well, so it feels softer....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy tho.  Don&#x27;t try to have a pillow fight with it LOL&gt;</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can adjust the firmness of the pillow by how much water it contains.  It helps me stay cool at night, too.</li>
            <li> Great cover. You need to order this at the same time as your pillow, because you won&#x27;t be able to find one in your local stores. You will need this cover on your water pillow, to cover the opening to fill the pillow.</li>
            <li> This pillow case is so soft!  My husband tries to share or steal my Chiroflow pillow every night.  Guess I know what he&#x27;s getting for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is a quality piece and ads some further cushion to the pillow.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it&#x27;s only padded on one side.  I&#x27;m a side sleeper, so when I put my hand under my pillow, I can feel the plactic cap on the water pillow this product was designed for.  I would rather pay a dollar or two more and have it quilted on both sides, so I don&#x27;t keep getting waked up during the night.</li>
            <li> Works well on my water pillow.</li>
            <li> This pillow case cover fits well, washes nice, provides padding, and prevents allergens.  The only drawback I can see, is the quilting is only one-sided and it can only be used &amp;#34;one-side up&amp;#34; unlike other slightly more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Fits well.  Could be quilted on both sides to make it even better.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to sleep on this pillow without this pillow cover. Provides great insulation from the cold &amp; is soft &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> It fit with Chiroflow Premium Water Pillow</li>
            <li> I just received my water pillow cover in the mail a few days ago.  It is sturdy and fits the pillow nicely.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it was made out of 100% cotton, which meant I had to wash it by hand and hang to dry.  I was afraid it would shrink and not fit the pillow.  Other than this issue, it is great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does in the picture, it&#x27;s not quilted on all sides..It&#x27;s cheap looking compared to the price, Very much think it&#x27;s being over charged. If it stated that this Item was hand washable only, I missed reading it. I never would of purchased it at all had I known that it was hand washable only, due to nerve damage in my hands I do not purchase things that have to be washed by hand.</li>
            <li> just exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> good quality cover!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Merchandise Received on time an as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good cover for pillow.  Fits good and protects pillow.</li>
            <li> I ordered this quilted pillow cover to go with my Chiroflow Waterbase Pillow.  It fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Received mine last night, and was able to use it immediately. No funny smell, and every comfortable. Could not recommend this item, any more!</li>
            <li> Defenitly an upgrade from using the pillow without one .</li>
            <li> I love my Chiroflow pillow and this makes it even better. I am one my third pillow now, I tend to toss and turn a lot in the night and I tug my pillow around, I think this will help lengthen the life of my pillow.</li>
            <li> It is thick and durable cover. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more different types of &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; pillows, and this is by far my favorite.  I can sleep very comfortably on it whether on my back, side, or stomach.  And I love that the firmness is adjustable by adding or removing water.  It does not &amp;#34;slosh&amp;#34; if you follow the directions for removing the air pocket from the water &amp;#34;bladder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fit pillow well and was nice quality.</li>
            <li> Previous to this I slept on a buckwheat pillow. I left my pillow at a motel so I bought this. Great. You can change the amount of water you put in and it is very soft and large. I don&#x27;t like a thick pillow and this works excellent for me. Plus as I said you can adjust the water level to your specific needs.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Does what it should.  Easy to put on and take off.  Great product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had our pillows to long, less then a week. But we can&#x27;t wait to go to bed just to sleep on them..lol So comfy and for me with neck problems WOW is all I can say :-)</li>
            <li> perfect fit for the pillow and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never get another pillow.  I bought my first 9 years ago and I haven&#x27;t had a headache in the morning since, no neck pain either.</li>
            <li> only one side quilted, wish it was all over. Check out your walmart and bedbath&amp;beyond for all quilted one before buy this</li>
            <li> This pillow cover is wonderful!  Very soft &amp; fit the pillow I also ordered perfectly. Looks very well made &amp; is washable.  Delivery was quick &amp; on time.  Very happy with my purchase &amp; yes I would recommend this cover.</li>
            <li> This is the best pillow I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I highly recommend it.  The ability to customize the firmness to suit my preference was a major selling feature. Can&#x27;t say enough about the comfort. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up. Adjustable. Very comfortable to sleep on. I believe it has added to better sleep for me.I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Have been using this item for years.  It does eventually start leaking (about 7 years of use).  Best to get a cover with it as well.  Fast shipping  Thanks</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money. I am on my 3rd water pillow and the previous two were used without the cover and after a couple of years the fabric and padding on the pillows had turned very yellow from the absorbtion of perspiration. This will extend the life of a wonderful pillow.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting Quilted cover 100%&lt;br /&gt;I received a pillow covered on one side only.&lt;br /&gt;The backside covering like Gauze.</li>
            <li> This cover was perfect for what I needed. Well made, however I believe that this cover has to be washed by hand. But still, good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s personal preference and personal opinion. I tried different levels of water. the product didn&#x27;t some with the funnel/cap opener as described on the instruction. I tried one other review&#x27;s suggestion by blowing air instead. I like it a little better. Tried different air  levels. I still wake up with stiff and sore neck. It&#x27;s not for me. I am sure other people who use it is extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought the water pillow and then decided to buy this quilted cover a week later.  I then purchased 2 more for my other new water pillows.  This quilted cover is very nice and comfortable and protects the actual pillow from stains.</li>
            <li> very nice cover. made well and adds some extra comfort to the pillow. would recommend to anyone. i wake up with a lot less pain (cover and pillow go well together)</li>
            <li> Nice pillow cover.  Use with water pillow.  Good price.</li>
            <li> i you have the water pillow you need this cover so you can wash it without washing the pillow. and it gives the pillow a little more form</li>
            <li> I have been sleeping on a Chiroflow water pillow for a few months. I found this cover looking to buy an additional pillow for my wife and I was hesitant because of the price. The 1st thing that blew me away was that I ordered on a friday night at 11pm and monday morning there it was at my door. I washed it right away and that night I went to lay down and I was in love. This is my first review that I have done and it is for a good reason. If you are in the situation that I was in. I recommend to go for it and you would be happy with your purchase like I am..</li>
            <li> The best pillow that I&#x27;ve ever bought it in the past two years I button quite a few and spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars I&#x27;ve had nothing but a good night sleep ever since I got the pillow which I found this a lot sooner</li>
            <li> Ordered this cover for the pillow I had gotten as a gift for my best friend.  As far as I know, it was fine and covered the pillow with no issues.  It was sent directly to her with the pillow so I did not see it first hand, but received no complaints from her!</li>
            <li> I finally found a pillow that allows me to sleep comfortably on my side. I have wide shoulders and have spent a lot of money trying all kinds of different pillows. This product works the best. I just wish it did not have to be so heavy. I an used to moving my pillow during the night and it is difficult. That said, i would buy this product again and recommend others use it.</li>
            <li> Good product for pillow</li>
            <li> I got this for a specific type of pillow.  It fits and works perfectly.  I will definitely purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> I bought the waterbase pillow with the quilted pillow cover, and I am very please with it.&lt;br /&gt;It is so comfortable and it really relieves my neck pain.  I would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I did not put a lot of water in it, just enough to make it so it supports my neck all around.</li>
            <li> I love this cover!  It protects my water pillow from excess wear and tear.  My old water pillow fell apart because I did not have this product.  It is comfortable to lay on, and washes well.  I would advise anyone who buys sthe Mediflow Waterbase Pillow to purchase the quilted pillow cover</li>
            <li> If you get the pillow you need the cover.  This is very good for insulating and providing a little extra padding.</li>
            <li> I really like this pillow cover. It specifically fits the chiroflow pillow and it fits like a glove. I imagine you could use it for other pillows of the same size. But with the water pillow it adds a nice little cushiony feel between you and the pillow. I thought maybe it would interfere with the functionality of the pillow but not the case. Couldn&#x27;t imagine sleeping on my pillow now without it!! It just makes my pillow nice and soft now.  I may even get a couple spares to have on hand. Also the way they keep making everything cheaper the quality may not be as good down the road. But I really like it and would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have owned a half dozen or so Mediflow Waterbase pillows over the years, and I always use the quilted pillow cover. It provides an extra, cushiony feel and keeps the (expensive! I use the down version) pillow itself clean and fresh. It&#x27;s easier and cheaper to wash or replace the pillow cover than to replace the pillow. Yes, it&#x27;s quilted on one side only, but why would you need it quilted on both sides? The Waterbase Pillow can only be used on one side. You sleep on the soft, down or foam padded side--never on the water-bladder side of the pillow.</li>
            <li> THERE MUST&#x27;VE BEEN AN ERROR IN MANUFACTURING BECAUSE THE FIRST NIGHT I USED THE PILLOW IT LEAKED ALL OVER MY FAIRLY NEW BED THE LAKE WAS SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE FILL CAP</li>
            <li> I bought this for my new Chiroflow pillow and it works wonderful while adding extra comfort!&lt;br /&gt;It really is a must have if you have purchased the pillow!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as my husband was having neck pain and I must say it is great. My husband is the biggest critic out there and when he gives this a 5 it is!! You cant go wrong buying this pillow. Worth every $$$ and i am buying four more for my sons.</li>
            <li> Last time (about 7years ago) we bought a water filled pillow and really liked the pillow except it was hard to keep clean, hopefully with this cover it will continue to stay clean.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PILLOW CASE..FITS PERFECTLY ON MY MEDIFLOW WATERBASED PILLOW..WASN&#x27;T REALLY HAPPY FOR THE TIME IT WAS SHIPPED. HAD TO WAIT OVER 2 WEEKS BECAUSE THEY DIDN&#x27;T SHIP IT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD. THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY HOWEVER, KEPT IN TOUCH WHEN I WAS SENDING THE NASTY EMAILS ABOUT IT. SHE MADE IT EASIER TO TOLERATE NOT KNOWING WHEN I WOULD RECEIVE IT. DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I WOULD PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN, BUT DEFINATELY LIKE THE PILLOW COVER!</li>
            <li> I could not sleep in my bed before I got this pillow.  I have a herniated disc in my neck &amp; since using this pillow, I have been able to lay &amp; sleep on my back.  It was so good, I got one for my husband too.  He also has some neck issues.  Hope they last a long time.  I thought maybe with the water inside,  it would feel cold but with the quilted pillow cover you cant feel the temperature of it at all.  Great products &amp; very well made.  Thanks much</li>
            <li> The pillow covers  are excellent but what I don&#x27;t understand is why didn&#x27;t you package it together with the pillow covers so that they were all in one rather than 3 different parcels!</li>
            <li> This pillow cover does the job quite nicely.  Seems to be well made, fits perfectly (and my pillow is a little oversized due to the type of pillow it is with a water bag inside).  I am happy with it.  Haven&#x27;t washed it yet, so don&#x27;t know if it will shrink, but I think it will be just fine.  Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just got it .looks thicker than it actually is. fits great on the new water pillow. hope it makes the pillow last longer as some reviews indicated will do new review next year.</li>
            <li> I love my water pillow.  It has releaved my injured neck and the pain is not so bad any more!!</li>
            <li> Well I think I am still out on my pillow. All the reviews about how great it was encouraged me to purchase it. However I can&#x27;t seem to feel the comfort I thought I would feel Maybe i need more water i filled it with 2 quarts.If someone has a bit of advice as to making it more comfortable let me know.</li>
            <li> This is the best think I have ever bought. I can determine if my pillow is hard or soft. With my bad neck that surgery a few years ago, this is the best I have found. I take my pillow everywhere when I go. My wife and son have also purchased the water pillow and they love them as well. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, but remember they are heavy!!!</li>
            <li> So glad these covers are made for our Mediflow pillows. I think it will extend the pillows life and keep them much cleaner. They do constrict the pillows just a little which suits hubby just fine because he likes a firm full pillow.  They wash very well too.</li>
            <li> best investment ever!. now i sleep well at nights and don&#x27;t get neck aches.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with my new &#x27;water pillows&#x27; for a Christmas gift to myself. It was advertised with the pillow as &#x27;these were bought together&#x27; area of the checkout on Amazon and it lives up to ads. The cover protects the pillows as well as the noise from the water flowing back and forth is absent while this cover is on the pillow. Thanks for the fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I did not order it earlier.  The pillow cover is made extremely well and the cloth is alot heavier than I would have expected for the cost.  I would recommend if you buy the pillow definately buy this pillow cover.</li>
            <li> Bought these covers after searching everywhere for quilted ones. I needed to replace others that I&#x27;d used for years, that had seen better days at this point. It seems that it&#x27;s impossible to find quilted pillow covers any more unless you want to pay ridiculous prices, which I didn&#x27;t, so I thought I&#x27;d try these out. They&#x27;re only quilted on one side, but wash and wear nicely so far. I&#x27;m using them on regular pillows, not waterbase ones, but they work just fine. Will be back for more for the rest of the bed pillows in the house.</li>
            <li> Nice cover. Gave it a 4 because you can by equal quality and/or better with a coupon at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Who can&#x27;t use two, right?</li>
            <li> Very nice pillow cover, not something that you can &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; realistically. I like it very much ! Fits water pillow snugly so no slippage while in use. The quilted side is a nice &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good quality pillow cover for a reasonable price. This is the second time I have purchased this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> cover helps to keep the pillow clean. I had buy a new pillow because the old one got to dirty</li>
            <li> Nice cover, good quality!  Recently purchased one for a water pillow I also purchased through Amazon.  This is a second order of the same product.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love these water pillow covers. They are soft and keep the expensive water pillow clean and free from stains. They wash well.</li>
            <li> I consider that the quality is excellent. It covers the pillow very well. I recomend it for other pillows too.</li>
            <li> Best pillows I have ever owned. Very high quality and easy to fill with the supplied funnel. Definitely recommend these for back and side sleepers.</li>
