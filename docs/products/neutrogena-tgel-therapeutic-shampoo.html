            <li>Its not the most wonderful smelling hair product,but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and honestly, I like it!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very potent, but it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, a good product.</li>
            <li>, i guess all good potions stink.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good work done there by neutrogena.</li>
            <li>As of now it feels good to use this shampoo and my scalp is showing improvements.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the price was good.  </li>
            <li>Good service.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t they make a product smell good...</li>
            <li>The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for and this is a good example.</li>
            <li>were so good.</li>
            <li>Is Excellent product, for many year used for my family, all product from Neutrogena are EXCELLENT, thanks you for made happy life, recommend 100%</li>
            <li>The smell is not the best, but you get used to it quickly, and if you have a nice conditioner you like, you can just use that for the ends of your hair!</li>
            <li>And I am very appreciative you sent it so quickly!!  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
            <li>the smell is so much better!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This dandruff shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li>this stuff works amazing for itchy scalp and/or scalp sores.  </li>
            <li>I have many friends who use this product for the theraputic qualities and then soap up again with a good clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>he actually LIKED it.  </li>
            <li>I liked it because it had 4% coal tar and no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena T-Gel is effective at relief of an itchy, problematic scalp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am thrilled with it</li>
            <li>I rub it into my scalp, let it sit for about 2 minutes, and then rinse and use a nice smelling conditioner to neutralize the chemical odor.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure you have a good conditioner that moisturizes for use afterwards.</li>
            <li>A very useful product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, this product has a VERY strong, industrial smell that will linger in your hair for up to 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>the itching.&lt;br /&gt;it also had a very strong smell to it...</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good!</li>
            <li>Stores around our area don&#x27;t keep it in stock, so it is nice to be able to find it.</li>
            <li>By far the best shampoo ever made.  </li>
            <li>For those who have dandruff, itchy scalp, psoriasis this is by far the best thing I have used.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the product was received very fast.  </li>
            <li>I feel so much better</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the better it works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a tar smell to it that many people find objectionable.  </li>
            <li>I have used H&amp;S and it is okay.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve since found that rinsing it off well tends to remove most, but never all, of the odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>For those of you who were in the same boat, I hope y&#x27;all will experience the great outcome just like I did!</li>
            <li>Something you do not see with many cosmetic products in the market place.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m a girl and don&#x27;t love that.</li>
            <li>I am incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>More to come...</li>
            <li>It helped with the smell:))</li>
            <li>and he is pleased that I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neutragena always seems to make a better mouse trap</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ordering more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I discovered the product.</li>
            <li>hair smelled like shoe polish from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that potent....</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If nothing else works better I will continue to use the T-Gel.</li>
            <li>If you have dandruff and haven&#x27;t tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!</li>
            <li>:):)</li>
            <li>I had even been told by a hair stylist that I had ezcema, but then it seemed she told most of her customers that.</li>
            <li>My last problem has been, from as best as I can tell from my research, scaling, buildup and dandruff.</li>
            <li>T-Gel works better than all of those shampoos put together.</li>
            <li>so many people online say it worked for them.</li>
            <li>but today i used it again and made sure</li>
            <li>It got better after I used about 1/3 of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I got more pimples</li>
            <li>, I felt a lot better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be buying more of this for what it has done to me.</li>
            <li>The price is better on Amazon</li>
            <li>But the smell is so potent that I just couldn&#x27;t force myself to keep going.</li>
            <li>I did more research and found an alternative which i will use tomorrow called Nizoral.</li>
            <li>very happy with the product, I have a patch of psoriasis at the hairline and some damp scalp itch in back</li>
            <li>i had to keep my hair in a pony tail during the shower and made sure the product didn&#x27;t have prolonged contact on my skin.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the T/Sal.</li>
            <li>It works great &amp; fast.</li>
            <li>It smells very rich and earthy too, not perfumey at all.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the smell to get rid of all of that nonsense!!</li>
            <li>My wife wanted to try this item for her very long hair and is very happy with the results she is seeing after using it !</li>
            <li>and we just use a mild shampoo after to kind of soften up his hair and improve the smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell leaves something to be desired but the effect is the most important.</li>
            <li>He inspected my ears and the other areas on my face and chest and was duly impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>I question the \\&quot;Clean Scent\\&quot; in the product description; perhaps the marketer who labeled it considers the smell of diesel to be a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>My scalp is flake and itch free, and my hair smells good and is very managable.</li>
            <li>This product had a strong smell, even after rinsing with a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I used it 3 times, and had to change, because of the strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>and now my skin is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Although, I have never had dandruff or psoriasis, I have experienced burning and itchiness of my scalp for several months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;T-Gel weekly, even though I am flake free.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most effective product for dandruff fakes.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo was far more effective than the ketoconozale prescribed by my son&#x27;s dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it steadily for many many years, it&#x27;s the only one that can control my dandruff symptoms.</li>
            <li>Whether its helping me with the flaky skin I will update soon as I see significant change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li>But worth every penny IMHO!</li>
            <li>paired this with the conditioner I always use which is Natures Gate biotin conditioner which is a really rich, buttery conditioner.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but now I think of it as the &#x27;odor of psoriasis relief&#x27;, and I believe that it smells better than whatever coal tar shampoo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I still had dandruff that seemed to come and go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s like if you&#x27;ve ever tried to clean VOMIT smell out of upholstery with PINE-SOL.&lt;br /&gt;Or</li>
            <li>After the two shampoos my hair was literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My scalp did feel so clean, though--</li>
            <li>I have not felt it this clean in years, probably.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for people who experience a dry scalp.</li>
            <li>If clean smells like moth balls, then I want to be dirty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The odor was a bit strong for me, and I was concerned that , the tar might be absorbed into the scalp.  </li>
            <li>It the disctinction of t-gel that makes me think it&#x27;s doing something special to help my scalp.  </li>
            <li>but if your determined to get rid of your flakes suck it up because this is the right product!</li>
            <li>True, it doesn&#x27;t have an Herbal Essence smell</li>
            <li>Now the shampoo doesn&#x27;t do a bit of good for my dandruff and only makes my hair stink for a day.</li>
            <li>I was using a store brand for the same item, but since the price was good, thought I would try the name brand.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t let it sit for 3 mins or anything like that, but I just rubbed it in as good as possible.</li>
            <li>My doctor alone says he&#x27;s treated thousands of patients with SD with the steroidal and anti-fungal creams, most of whom, like me, can&#x27;t seem to find anything that works effectively for very long.</li>
            <li>other then that it is great.</li>
            <li>Purchased this due to the customer reviews and am extremely happy with the result.</li>
            <li>like some shampoos but the residual smell is mild and non-offensive.  </li>
            <li>I so appreciate the quick shipping on a stinky but QUALITY product.  </li>
            <li>Coal tar is highly carcinogenic and banned in many countries.</li>
            <li>I used so many products due to my itchy scalp, but this T-Gel has been amazing all the time.</li>
            <li>After searching and asking around, apparently there is not anything as effective that smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After first use:&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure that this stuff really cleans your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I was in need of something fast!!</li>
            <li>but it really works!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel anything the first couple of days, however within 6-8 days of use, i noticed significant results</li>
            <li>The dermatologist prescribed a shampoo that cost 50 or more dollars for a tiny bottle and T GEL works infinitely better, as well as better than head and shoulders or selsum blue.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a nice smell actually.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is coal tar based and smells like fresh asphalt</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Since then, she stopped scratching her head too often and finally focused on more important things than complaining about her scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena T-Gel for two months now and it&#x27;s not cutting it for me.</li>
            <li>After reading about how shampoo shouldn&#x27;t be used on the scalp directly, but more on the hair and tips, I stopped using conditioner all together.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair a bit rough feeling, but a good conditioner, preferably leave in(try not to get any of your scalp)and</li>
            <li>I am very happy as the itching was driving me mad &amp; my scalp was getting sore, one application of T gel has stopped the irritation in it&#x27;s tracks :)</li>
            <li>I used many other medicine including some steroid but this is way better</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and as effective as my old prescription shampoo (which cost 2X).</li>
            <li>It has a really clean scent and  suds very well.</li>
            <li>The only thing is when you use it - it has a VERY strong scent (smells like moth balls).</li>
            <li>Best product outside of a prescription that works well on dandruff, hands down.</li>
            <li>I think different users will experience different levels of effectiveness depending upon the underlying cause of their dandruff, and so others may find it to be a more effective treatment.  </li>
            <li>But the T/Gel does not tingle, it was more like a cooling sensation that was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I would use it twice a week and make sure to leave the product on for at least 5 minutes to let the magic work!  </li>
            <li>only down side is that it turned his beautiful bright grey hair a tad yellower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this works miracles, but it really does and does so pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>but since the product did absolutely nothing to my dry scalp issue, I would say I can find a much better smelling shampoo to just clean my hair...</li>
            <li>I have used many of the different shampoos for dandruff.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more obvious.</li>
            <li>Up to now have used this shampoo on two occasions and it worked after the first application - no flakes.</li>
            <li>forward to about 2 months ago when I saw my dermatologist to renew my seborrheic dermatitis prescription and asked him exactly what SD was.  </li>
            <li>I used this shampoo and at first I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I stopped scratching my scalp which saved me For many years, I would be embarrassed of scratching in public.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE; Since I first reviewed this shampoo, over 2 months ago, I have not had a recurrence of dandruff and flakes.</li>
            <li>This product really smells!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than regular therapeutic and certainly better than CVS Extra Strength.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to anyone searching for a dandruff shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li>and then I have to use a deep condtioner, giving me even MORE dandruff.</li>
            <li>MG217, T/Sal, Head and Shoulders, Nizoral, Free &amp; Clear, Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea tree, etc...</li>
            <li>and so glad I finally have a solution to my itching, flaking, peeling scalp.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a miracle the first time you use it, but follow the instructions and it will do its&#x27; job.  </li>
            <li>Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really did work!  </li>
            <li>The first usage, I followed the instructions which say to apply twice, basically.</li>
            <li>the first time i used it i had alittle itching</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed that this product did nothing for me all I want is a cure!</li>
            <li>At first, it didn&#x27;t seem to help.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle had ran out about a week ago.</li>
            <li>I sent it to him overseas and even the shipping costs where well worth because this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful I ran into this product.</li>
            <li>It causes flaking and itching in several prominent areas under my hair and at the the hairline.</li>
            <li>I use it at time more often than a regular one.</li>
            <li>This did ease some itching at first</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks 4 washes later, my scalp is soooo much better.</li>
            <li>I actually felt better after the the first use.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and curly and I have fair, sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when the other products that smelled better weren&#x27;t effective, I always went back to TGel to solve the problem.  </li>
            <li>As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn&#x27;t be</li>
            <li>Since coal tar is the active ingredient it kind of smell exactly how you would expect.</li>
            <li>My scalp still felt amazingly clean that week, and the itching was down even more.</li>
            <li>now &amp; a friend at work recently suggested T- Gel, WOW, amazing.  </li>
            <li>Using T/Gel for a week gets it under control if there is a major breakout, and I&#x27;m comfortable using it weekly after it&#x27;s cleared up just to keep it at bay, but often times forget about it.</li>
            <li>I think this is the reason why I did not have that medicated smell that much like I did the first time.</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t care for is if he takes a shower before me, I come into the bathroom to a very overwhelmingly strong unpleasant medicine-y odor that I feel isn&#x27;t good to breathe into the lungs, so I am imagining my spouse breathing this in far more than me while he is using it in a hot steaming shower.  </li>
            <li>I would actually disagree with some of the comments by the most popular review here (by Shelley), but the basic sentiment is the same, i.e. this works wonders.    </li>
            <li>you have used this and have noticed it is less effective than before, try Psoriatrax.</li>
            <li>and now I no longer have a dry scalp :)</li>
            <li>My scalp gets extremely dry in the winter and starts to flake at the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of \\&quot;standard\\&quot; coal tar shampoo isn&#x27;t necessarily pleasant, but at least it&#x27;s just one smell.  </li>
            <li>I was using head and shoulders for a few months which worked ok, but then my scalp itch returned in full force while still using head and shoulders</li>
            <li>It was pure torture.  </li>
            <li>It was like every inch of my scalp would flake, sometimes in large scales.</li>
            <li>new Neutrogena junk smells like they tried to cover the old shampoo scent with CHEAP CHEMICAL PERFUMEY STINKNESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main ingredient is coal tar and that seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is not specially made for infants, toddlers or children, so it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;tear-free.&amp;#34; It does have a strong smell, but it&#x27;s a clean smell</li>
            <li>I also notice that I have to apply twice in one shower because the first application does not produce enough suds to make me feel like my hair is getting clean.  </li>
            <li>Only used it for a few days, and it&#x27;s worked great.  </li>
            <li>Really well.  </li>
            <li>It is very chemical-like and it made my eyes sting even after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>After using t-gel for about 6 months, I can say it truly does work very well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but it worked fast.</li>
            <li>I really want to recommend people who suffered from seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>So much so that it was making me cough in the shower</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Which is still something I am very grateful for</li>
            <li>for this shampoo itself, be warned: it has a very distinct/strong smell (you get used to it eventually</li>
            <li>Rinse with another shampoo afterwards to help eliminate the smell if it bothers you too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.  </li>
            <li>I had to switch to the T -Gel because it was much stronger and worked on my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing comes up in my fingernails now.</li>
            <li>but i dont think i washed very well</li>
            <li>Thanks to the effectiveness of this product</li>
            <li>product was really made for what it said.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really worked to get rid of both.</li>
            <li>This product really helped me alot.</li>
            <li>My first impression is this is most normal feeling shampoo hiding sharp tar smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried the generic equivalent with some success, and sometimes find this brand at an equal or better price in the local store, but props to the seller for quick and efficient shipping.</li>
            <li>used it two days in a row, then every other day for about 4 more days.</li>
            <li>I just make sure to use it once a week, then use other shampoos, too.</li>
            <li>I purchased Nutrogena T-Gel Extra Strength \\&quot;Clean</li>
            <li>The smell was worth it for the first two weeks of using it, but after two weeks my dandruff started coming back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and definitely worth the smell - you won&#x27;t have to use it long.</li>
            <li>I had read a review before buying that said T-Gel lathers a lot easier the second application in a row, and I found that to be true.</li>
            <li>red, oily patches are probably 90% better but the flakes are only maybe 40% improved.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been to the dermatologist, but after researching/looking at many photos, it is apparent I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, eyebrows, ear canal and a very, very minor case of it on the sides of my nostrils.</li>
            <li>We had a hard time finding a shampoo that helped with his scalp, especially with dry weather in winter, but over time this product was the best for our situation.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I often wondered why there wasn&#x27;t some kind of soap or cleanser that I could use in the shower for people like me with this common, stubborn skin condition.</li>
            <li>Those pharmaceutical companies probably won&#x27;t like it, but I no longer need to apply a prescription anti-fungal or steroidal creams 2x a day and this is something that I can use during my normal dandruff regimen - IN THE SHOWER!&lt;br</li>
            <li>His ears &amp; scalp are now normal...</li>
            <li>Definitely using this as rarely as I can get away with.</li>
            <li>I am very fussy with products I use on my scalp &amp; hair &amp; normally use organic, sulphate &amp; silicone free products so was a bit nervous of using the T gel, especially as it comes with several warnings on the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is safe for everyday use</li>
            <li>in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  </li>
            <li>This&#x27;ll make your hair smell like a car dealership or a new set of tires.  </li>
            <li>BEWARE of the \\&quot;NEW SCENT.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;before</li>
            <li>Anyway I bit the bullet &amp; used it as directed by the instructions, it smelled a bit odd but lathered easily &amp; didn&#x27;t sting or burn my scalp at all.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for a specific issue and my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>If I had had time, I would have taken another shower and used my old shampoo to try to rinse the smell out!</li>
            <li>I have used Neutrogena T-Gel Extra strenght shampoo for more than 15 years and have recommended it to other people.  </li>
            <li>FYI, I first used it daily for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it comes and goes, but it&#x27;s better than before, and I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
            <li>first I used the shampoo daily as directed on the bottle, leaving the product in my hair for about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>It started working upon first use and has only improved since then.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked - mainly because, for a number of reasons, I didn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t follow through with the number of treatments per day that each required (Walking around with oil on my scalp and a shower cap on my head for at least 4 hours a day once a week just didn&#x27;t fit into my life style!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now growing my hair out, and right now, it is six inches long.</li>
            <li>The soars and scabs that appear only on the crown of my head (for twenty years), have not been positively affected.</li>
            <li>It actually hurt my head applying it at first because I had dug my scalp so much I had open sores.  </li>
            <li>so clear.</li>
            <li>and my skin has completely clear.  </li>
            <li>so much cheaper than my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>After 2 days / 2 treatments the rash was completely gone from all parts of my body.  </li>
            <li>It has only been a week and my scalp is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time already and it never fails to cure my psoriasis whenever I get them in my head.  </li>
            <li>WOW did it work.  </li>
            <li>, my spouse has sensitive skin so reading the warnings concerns me.  </li>
            <li>This was our experience with it, so far.  </li>
            <li>At that point, the smell was really getting to my boyfriend and I slacked off to 3 times a week for another 2 weeks, and then finally stopped using it at all.</li>
            <li>My 10 month old has eczema and this shampoo was suggested by a pediatric dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>After only two shampoos the problem was much reduced.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is one of the solutions i use (along with some things like anti bacterial soap, antifungal shampoo, and some natural oils).</li>
            <li>I used every product you can imagine (natural and prescribed) to fight the symptoms and nothing seemed to work until I used this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does really help in comparison with a regular one.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll notice a considerable difference within one shower.</li>
            <li>my hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li>I used it every other day for the first 2 weeks - apply, lather, rinse, reapply and let sit - and I am SO AMAZED by the results!  </li>
            <li>(luckily i have dark hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am going to have him buy the regular strength for the second bottle because the extra strength worked so quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>This product smells not horrible but definitely not good</li>
            <li>I used a little conditioner after the shampoo to soften my hair, kind of in hopes it&#x27;d take the edge off of the odor, and it did a little.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had itchy and scaly scalp (after extensive research online, I diagnosed myself with seborrheic dermatitis) for many years in high school until I decided to look up reviews for a drugstore good product that could end this awful condition!!!  </li>
            <li>The t-gel really does help (even in the 1st use) with dry scalp.</li>
            <li>The second time I used T-Gel, there were no flakes at all for that whole week, at least not from dandruff--probably more from dry scalp</li>
            <li>I never had dry scalp issues in my life, so I was really a rookie at finding a product to use.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that consistently gets rid of my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li>This definitely helped reduce the symptoms in a huge way (less red spots and bumps, reduced/eliminate itching).</li>
            <li>I did like always and placed my fingers where the sensations were and in some of those spots I did feel scaling and flakes or clumps, generally trying to come up</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was coincidence and went back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>As an African American who has long, unaltered natural hair, this product is very drying to my strands, but works wonders on my scalp.</li>
            <li>My solution is to condition my hair, prior to shampooing, then applying the tgel directly to the scalp, let it sit 4-6 minutes then wash it all out together.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by a dermatologist to eradicate several patches of scaly areas that had developed on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Changing back to my old shampoo didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>i thought it would make my sensitive skin break out, but it actually made me have an eczema flare</li>
            <li>I wash as instructed, and a week later, it is about 90% back to normal.</li>
            <li>The flakes and itching were definitely cut down and the itching probably was more similar to what the average person goes through with theirscalp.    </li>
            <li>I was using the new Selsun Blue (the greenish or blue see-through bottles with Aloe Vera/vitamins or whatever, 3% Salicylic Acid) before this and was having those problems mentioned above.</li>
            <li>It did smell bad, but honestly I didn&#x27;t really care and still don&#x27;t, if it&#x27;s going to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to write reviews (especially negative ones), but I must be honest in saying that I was unpleasantly surprised at the results of using this T-Gel shampoo for one week.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena product are known for their high quality, low cost, products and compare quite favorably with the substantially more expensive products being sold by medical professionals.</li>
            <li>I couldn’t care less about the smell, because it really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it had to do with my daily hair washings that might have dried out my scalp to the point of itchiness, but it wasn&#x27;t the case at all</li>
            <li>Then I proceeded to use what I normally use in my hair--no other shampoos, just a moisturizer and a conditioner/moisturizer.     </li>
            <li>Usually, I&#x27;d put my fingers where the sensation was and feel either flakes forming (not completely above the surface, but I could feel them) or already there (i.e. could scratch them right off my scalp).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but the results are worth it, as I notice a difference after a single shampoo.</li>
            <li>Is a bad deal but the shampoo is good</li>

            <li> Why can&#x27;t they make a product smell good...</li>
            <li> The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for and this is a good example.</li>

            <li> And I am very appreciative you sent it so quickly!!  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> the smell is so much better!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This dandruff shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li> this stuff works amazing for itchy scalp and/or scalp sores.  </li>
            <li> I have many friends who use this product for the theraputic qualities and then soap up again with a good clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> he actually LIKED it.  </li>
            <li> I liked it because it had 4% coal tar and no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena T-Gel is effective at relief of an itchy, problematic scalp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am thrilled with it</li>
            <li> I rub it into my scalp, let it sit for about 2 minutes, and then rinse and use a nice smelling conditioner to neutralize the chemical odor.</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure you have a good conditioner that moisturizes for use afterwards.</li>
            <li> A very useful product at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, this product has a VERY strong, industrial smell that will linger in your hair for up to 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> the itching.&lt;br /&gt;it also had a very strong smell to it...</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good!</li>
            <li> Stores around our area don&#x27;t keep it in stock, so it is nice to be able to find it.</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo ever made.  </li>
            <li> For those who have dandruff, itchy scalp, psoriasis this is by far the best thing I have used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the product was received very fast.  </li>
            <li> I feel so much better</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the better it works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a tar smell to it that many people find objectionable.  </li>
            <li> I have used H&amp;S and it is okay.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve since found that rinsing it off well tends to remove most, but never all, of the odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> For those of you who were in the same boat, I hope y&#x27;all will experience the great outcome just like I did!</li>
            <li> Something you do not see with many cosmetic products in the market place.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m a girl and don&#x27;t love that.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> More to come...</li>
            <li> It helped with the smell:))</li>
            <li> and he is pleased that I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neutragena always seems to make a better mouse trap</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ordering more.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I discovered the product.</li>
            <li> hair smelled like shoe polish from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that potent....</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If nothing else works better I will continue to use the T-Gel.</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff and haven&#x27;t tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!</li>
            <li> :):)</li>
            <li> I had even been told by a hair stylist that I had ezcema, but then it seemed she told most of her customers that.</li>
            <li> My last problem has been, from as best as I can tell from my research, scaling, buildup and dandruff.</li>
            <li> T-Gel works better than all of those shampoos put together.</li>
            <li> so many people online say it worked for them.</li>
            <li> but today i used it again and made sure</li>
            <li> It got better after I used about 1/3 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I got more pimples</li>
            <li> , I felt a lot better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be buying more of this for what it has done to me.</li>
            <li> The price is better on Amazon</li>
            <li> But the smell is so potent that I just couldn&#x27;t force myself to keep going.</li>
            <li> I did more research and found an alternative which i will use tomorrow called Nizoral.</li>
            <li> very happy with the product, I have a patch of psoriasis at the hairline and some damp scalp itch in back</li>
            <li> i had to keep my hair in a pony tail during the shower and made sure the product didn&#x27;t have prolonged contact on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the T/Sal.</li>
            <li> It works great &amp; fast.</li>
            <li> It smells very rich and earthy too, not perfumey at all.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the smell to get rid of all of that nonsense!!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try this item for her very long hair and is very happy with the results she is seeing after using it !</li>
            <li> and we just use a mild shampoo after to kind of soften up his hair and improve the smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell leaves something to be desired but the effect is the most important.</li>
            <li> He inspected my ears and the other areas on my face and chest and was duly impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> I question the \\&quot;Clean Scent\\&quot; in the product description; perhaps the marketer who labeled it considers the smell of diesel to be a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> My scalp is flake and itch free, and my hair smells good and is very managable.</li>
            <li> This product had a strong smell, even after rinsing with a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I used it 3 times, and had to change, because of the strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> and now my skin is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Although, I have never had dandruff or psoriasis, I have experienced burning and itchiness of my scalp for several months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;T-Gel weekly, even though I am flake free.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective product for dandruff fakes.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo was far more effective than the ketoconozale prescribed by my son&#x27;s dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it steadily for many many years, it&#x27;s the only one that can control my dandruff symptoms.</li>
            <li> Whether its helping me with the flaky skin I will update soon as I see significant change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li> But worth every penny IMHO!</li>
            <li> paired this with the conditioner I always use which is Natures Gate biotin conditioner which is a really rich, buttery conditioner.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but now I think of it as the &#x27;odor of psoriasis relief&#x27;, and I believe that it smells better than whatever coal tar shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I still had dandruff that seemed to come and go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s like if you&#x27;ve ever tried to clean VOMIT smell out of upholstery with PINE-SOL.&lt;br /&gt;Or</li>
            <li> After the two shampoos my hair was literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My scalp did feel so clean, though--</li>
            <li> I have not felt it this clean in years, probably.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for people who experience a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> If clean smells like moth balls, then I want to be dirty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The odor was a bit strong for me, and I was concerned that , the tar might be absorbed into the scalp.  </li>
            <li> It the disctinction of t-gel that makes me think it&#x27;s doing something special to help my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but if your determined to get rid of your flakes suck it up because this is the right product!</li>
            <li> True, it doesn&#x27;t have an Herbal Essence smell</li>
            <li> Now the shampoo doesn&#x27;t do a bit of good for my dandruff and only makes my hair stink for a day.</li>
            <li> I was using a store brand for the same item, but since the price was good, thought I would try the name brand.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t let it sit for 3 mins or anything like that, but I just rubbed it in as good as possible.</li>
            <li> My doctor alone says he&#x27;s treated thousands of patients with SD with the steroidal and anti-fungal creams, most of whom, like me, can&#x27;t seem to find anything that works effectively for very long.</li>
            <li> other then that it is great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this due to the customer reviews and am extremely happy with the result.</li>
            <li> like some shampoos but the residual smell is mild and non-offensive.  </li>
            <li> I so appreciate the quick shipping on a stinky but QUALITY product.  </li>
            <li> Coal tar is highly carcinogenic and banned in many countries.</li>
            <li> I used so many products due to my itchy scalp, but this T-Gel has been amazing all the time.</li>
            <li> After searching and asking around, apparently there is not anything as effective that smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After first use:&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure that this stuff really cleans your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I was in need of something fast!!</li>
            <li> but it really works!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything the first couple of days, however within 6-8 days of use, i noticed significant results</li>
            <li> The dermatologist prescribed a shampoo that cost 50 or more dollars for a tiny bottle and T GEL works infinitely better, as well as better than head and shoulders or selsum blue.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a nice smell actually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is coal tar based and smells like fresh asphalt</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Since then, she stopped scratching her head too often and finally focused on more important things than complaining about her scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena T-Gel for two months now and it&#x27;s not cutting it for me.</li>
            <li> After reading about how shampoo shouldn&#x27;t be used on the scalp directly, but more on the hair and tips, I stopped using conditioner all together.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a bit rough feeling, but a good conditioner, preferably leave in(try not to get any of your scalp)and</li>
            <li> I am very happy as the itching was driving me mad &amp; my scalp was getting sore, one application of T gel has stopped the irritation in it&#x27;s tracks :)</li>
            <li> I used many other medicine including some steroid but this is way better</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and as effective as my old prescription shampoo (which cost 2X).</li>
            <li> It has a really clean scent and  suds very well.</li>
            <li> The only thing is when you use it - it has a VERY strong scent (smells like moth balls).</li>
            <li> Best product outside of a prescription that works well on dandruff, hands down.</li>
            <li> I think different users will experience different levels of effectiveness depending upon the underlying cause of their dandruff, and so others may find it to be a more effective treatment.  </li>
            <li> But the T/Gel does not tingle, it was more like a cooling sensation that was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I would use it twice a week and make sure to leave the product on for at least 5 minutes to let the magic work!  </li>
            <li> only down side is that it turned his beautiful bright grey hair a tad yellower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this works miracles, but it really does and does so pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> but since the product did absolutely nothing to my dry scalp issue, I would say I can find a much better smelling shampoo to just clean my hair...</li>
            <li> I have used many of the different shampoos for dandruff.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more obvious.</li>
            <li> Up to now have used this shampoo on two occasions and it worked after the first application - no flakes.</li>
            <li> forward to about 2 months ago when I saw my dermatologist to renew my seborrheic dermatitis prescription and asked him exactly what SD was.  </li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and at first I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I stopped scratching my scalp which saved me For many years, I would be embarrassed of scratching in public.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE; Since I first reviewed this shampoo, over 2 months ago, I have not had a recurrence of dandruff and flakes.</li>
            <li> This product really smells!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than regular therapeutic and certainly better than CVS Extra Strength.</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to anyone searching for a dandruff shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li> and then I have to use a deep condtioner, giving me even MORE dandruff.</li>
            <li> MG217, T/Sal, Head and Shoulders, Nizoral, Free &amp; Clear, Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea tree, etc...</li>
            <li> and so glad I finally have a solution to my itching, flaking, peeling scalp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a miracle the first time you use it, but follow the instructions and it will do its&#x27; job.  </li>
            <li> Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really did work!  </li>
            <li> The first usage, I followed the instructions which say to apply twice, basically.</li>
            <li> the first time i used it i had alittle itching</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed that this product did nothing for me all I want is a cure!</li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t seem to help.  </li>
            <li> My first bottle had ran out about a week ago.</li>
            <li> I sent it to him overseas and even the shipping costs where well worth because this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful I ran into this product.</li>
            <li> It causes flaking and itching in several prominent areas under my hair and at the the hairline.</li>
            <li> I use it at time more often than a regular one.</li>
            <li> This did ease some itching at first</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks 4 washes later, my scalp is soooo much better.</li>
            <li> I actually felt better after the the first use.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and curly and I have fair, sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when the other products that smelled better weren&#x27;t effective, I always went back to TGel to solve the problem.  </li>
            <li> As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn&#x27;t be</li>
            <li> Since coal tar is the active ingredient it kind of smell exactly how you would expect.</li>
            <li> My scalp still felt amazingly clean that week, and the itching was down even more.</li>
            <li> now &amp; a friend at work recently suggested T- Gel, WOW, amazing.  </li>
            <li> Using T/Gel for a week gets it under control if there is a major breakout, and I&#x27;m comfortable using it weekly after it&#x27;s cleared up just to keep it at bay, but often times forget about it.</li>
            <li> I think this is the reason why I did not have that medicated smell that much like I did the first time.</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t care for is if he takes a shower before me, I come into the bathroom to a very overwhelmingly strong unpleasant medicine-y odor that I feel isn&#x27;t good to breathe into the lungs, so I am imagining my spouse breathing this in far more than me while he is using it in a hot steaming shower.  </li>
            <li> I would actually disagree with some of the comments by the most popular review here (by Shelley), but the basic sentiment is the same, i.e. this works wonders.    </li>
            <li> you have used this and have noticed it is less effective than before, try Psoriatrax.</li>
            <li> and now I no longer have a dry scalp :)</li>
            <li> My scalp gets extremely dry in the winter and starts to flake at the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of \\&quot;standard\\&quot; coal tar shampoo isn&#x27;t necessarily pleasant, but at least it&#x27;s just one smell.  </li>
            <li> I was using head and shoulders for a few months which worked ok, but then my scalp itch returned in full force while still using head and shoulders</li>
            <li> It was pure torture.  </li>
            <li> It was like every inch of my scalp would flake, sometimes in large scales.</li>
            <li> new Neutrogena junk smells like they tried to cover the old shampoo scent with CHEAP CHEMICAL PERFUMEY STINKNESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main ingredient is coal tar and that seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not specially made for infants, toddlers or children, so it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;tear-free.&amp;#34; It does have a strong smell, but it&#x27;s a clean smell</li>
            <li> I also notice that I have to apply twice in one shower because the first application does not produce enough suds to make me feel like my hair is getting clean.  </li>
            <li> Only used it for a few days, and it&#x27;s worked great.  </li>
            <li> Really well.  </li>
            <li> It is very chemical-like and it made my eyes sting even after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> After using t-gel for about 6 months, I can say it truly does work very well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but it worked fast.</li>
            <li> I really want to recommend people who suffered from seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> So much so that it was making me cough in the shower</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Which is still something I am very grateful for</li>
            <li> for this shampoo itself, be warned: it has a very distinct/strong smell (you get used to it eventually</li>
            <li> Rinse with another shampoo afterwards to help eliminate the smell if it bothers you too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.  </li>
            <li> I had to switch to the T -Gel because it was much stronger and worked on my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing comes up in my fingernails now.</li>
            <li> but i dont think i washed very well</li>
            <li> Thanks to the effectiveness of this product</li>
            <li> product was really made for what it said.</li>
            <li> and this stuff really worked to get rid of both.</li>
            <li> This product really helped me alot.</li>
            <li> My first impression is this is most normal feeling shampoo hiding sharp tar smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried the generic equivalent with some success, and sometimes find this brand at an equal or better price in the local store, but props to the seller for quick and efficient shipping.</li>
            <li> used it two days in a row, then every other day for about 4 more days.</li>
            <li> I just make sure to use it once a week, then use other shampoos, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased Nutrogena T-Gel Extra Strength \\&quot;Clean</li>
            <li> The smell was worth it for the first two weeks of using it, but after two weeks my dandruff started coming back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and definitely worth the smell - you won&#x27;t have to use it long.</li>
            <li> I had read a review before buying that said T-Gel lathers a lot easier the second application in a row, and I found that to be true.</li>
            <li> red, oily patches are probably 90% better but the flakes are only maybe 40% improved.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to the dermatologist, but after researching/looking at many photos, it is apparent I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, eyebrows, ear canal and a very, very minor case of it on the sides of my nostrils.</li>
            <li> We had a hard time finding a shampoo that helped with his scalp, especially with dry weather in winter, but over time this product was the best for our situation.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I often wondered why there wasn&#x27;t some kind of soap or cleanser that I could use in the shower for people like me with this common, stubborn skin condition.</li>
            <li> Those pharmaceutical companies probably won&#x27;t like it, but I no longer need to apply a prescription anti-fungal or steroidal creams 2x a day and this is something that I can use during my normal dandruff regimen - IN THE SHOWER!&lt;br</li>
            <li> His ears &amp; scalp are now normal...</li>
            <li> Definitely using this as rarely as I can get away with.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy with products I use on my scalp &amp; hair &amp; normally use organic, sulphate &amp; silicone free products so was a bit nervous of using the T gel, especially as it comes with several warnings on the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is safe for everyday use</li>
            <li> in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  </li>
            <li> This&#x27;ll make your hair smell like a car dealership or a new set of tires.  </li>
            <li> BEWARE of the \\&quot;NEW SCENT.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;before</li>
            <li> Anyway I bit the bullet &amp; used it as directed by the instructions, it smelled a bit odd but lathered easily &amp; didn&#x27;t sting or burn my scalp at all.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for a specific issue and my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> If I had had time, I would have taken another shower and used my old shampoo to try to rinse the smell out!</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena T-Gel Extra strenght shampoo for more than 15 years and have recommended it to other people.  </li>
            <li> FYI, I first used it daily for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it comes and goes, but it&#x27;s better than before, and I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
            <li> first I used the shampoo daily as directed on the bottle, leaving the product in my hair for about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> It started working upon first use and has only improved since then.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked - mainly because, for a number of reasons, I didn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t follow through with the number of treatments per day that each required (Walking around with oil on my scalp and a shower cap on my head for at least 4 hours a day once a week just didn&#x27;t fit into my life style!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now growing my hair out, and right now, it is six inches long.</li>
            <li> The soars and scabs that appear only on the crown of my head (for twenty years), have not been positively affected.</li>
            <li> It actually hurt my head applying it at first because I had dug my scalp so much I had open sores.  </li>
            <li> so clear.</li>
            <li> and my skin has completely clear.  </li>
            <li> so much cheaper than my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> After 2 days / 2 treatments the rash was completely gone from all parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> It has only been a week and my scalp is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time already and it never fails to cure my psoriasis whenever I get them in my head.  </li>
            <li> WOW did it work.  </li>
            <li> , my spouse has sensitive skin so reading the warnings concerns me.  </li>
            <li> This was our experience with it, so far.  </li>
            <li> At that point, the smell was really getting to my boyfriend and I slacked off to 3 times a week for another 2 weeks, and then finally stopped using it at all.</li>
            <li> My 10 month old has eczema and this shampoo was suggested by a pediatric dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> After only two shampoos the problem was much reduced.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the solutions i use (along with some things like anti bacterial soap, antifungal shampoo, and some natural oils).</li>
            <li> I used every product you can imagine (natural and prescribed) to fight the symptoms and nothing seemed to work until I used this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does really help in comparison with a regular one.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll notice a considerable difference within one shower.</li>
            <li> my hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day for the first 2 weeks - apply, lather, rinse, reapply and let sit - and I am SO AMAZED by the results!  </li>
            <li> (luckily i have dark hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am going to have him buy the regular strength for the second bottle because the extra strength worked so quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> This product smells not horrible but definitely not good</li>
            <li> I used a little conditioner after the shampoo to soften my hair, kind of in hopes it&#x27;d take the edge off of the odor, and it did a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy and scaly scalp (after extensive research online, I diagnosed myself with seborrheic dermatitis) for many years in high school until I decided to look up reviews for a drugstore good product that could end this awful condition!!!  </li>
            <li> The t-gel really does help (even in the 1st use) with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The second time I used T-Gel, there were no flakes at all for that whole week, at least not from dandruff--probably more from dry scalp</li>
            <li> I never had dry scalp issues in my life, so I was really a rookie at finding a product to use.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that consistently gets rid of my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> This definitely helped reduce the symptoms in a huge way (less red spots and bumps, reduced/eliminate itching).</li>
            <li> I did like always and placed my fingers where the sensations were and in some of those spots I did feel scaling and flakes or clumps, generally trying to come up</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was coincidence and went back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> As an African American who has long, unaltered natural hair, this product is very drying to my strands, but works wonders on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My solution is to condition my hair, prior to shampooing, then applying the tgel directly to the scalp, let it sit 4-6 minutes then wash it all out together.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a dermatologist to eradicate several patches of scaly areas that had developed on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Changing back to my old shampoo didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> i thought it would make my sensitive skin break out, but it actually made me have an eczema flare</li>
            <li> I wash as instructed, and a week later, it is about 90% back to normal.</li>
            <li> The flakes and itching were definitely cut down and the itching probably was more similar to what the average person goes through with theirscalp.    </li>
            <li> I was using the new Selsun Blue (the greenish or blue see-through bottles with Aloe Vera/vitamins or whatever, 3% Salicylic Acid) before this and was having those problems mentioned above.</li>
            <li> It did smell bad, but honestly I didn&#x27;t really care and still don&#x27;t, if it&#x27;s going to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews (especially negative ones), but I must be honest in saying that I was unpleasantly surprised at the results of using this T-Gel shampoo for one week.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena product are known for their high quality, low cost, products and compare quite favorably with the substantially more expensive products being sold by medical professionals.</li>
            <li> I couldn’t care less about the smell, because it really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it had to do with my daily hair washings that might have dried out my scalp to the point of itchiness, but it wasn&#x27;t the case at all</li>
            <li> Then I proceeded to use what I normally use in my hair--no other shampoos, just a moisturizer and a conditioner/moisturizer.     </li>
            <li> Usually, I&#x27;d put my fingers where the sensation was and feel either flakes forming (not completely above the surface, but I could feel them) or already there (i.e. could scratch them right off my scalp).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but the results are worth it, as I notice a difference after a single shampoo.</li>
            <li> Is a bad deal but the shampoo is good</li>
            <li> This new scent, on the other hand, is giving me a headache!  </li>
            <li> Using T-gel every other day has cured the problem completely.  </li>
            <li> Smells worse in the bottle than in clean hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to a regular store shampoo for the last 2 months and have not had a single dandruff itch or flake.</li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant but it&#x27;s so effective and totally worth it to avoid the pain and itch and embarrassment of serious dandruff and dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the medication in it and how his scalp would feel while we washed his hair because as much as we tried to keep him from scratching, he did have small red/rough/raw areas on his head, but he never acted like it bothered him in the slightest.</li>
            <li> (the T/Sal dried up my scalp), and wow it has worked wonders and was exactly I have been looking for for the past year.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I found to be working long term.</li>
            <li> seeing little signs of improvement so far, after i finished the bottle i found it cheaper at a local store in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have had chronic dry scalp for about a year now and this essentially cured that as soon as I started using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a lot of research, and from what I know now, dandruff and dry scalp are two totally different things.</li>
            <li> I took the long path and spent a solid two months trying different shampoos, conditioners, with nothing working.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I was super excited to purchase this shampoo to cure the annoying side effects that my dry scalp has caused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ):  I recently bought a bottle for a relative who was suffering from a sever dandruff due stressful situations, IT WORKED FOR HIM TOO.</li>
            <li> my scalp and Keracare Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp shampoo and conditioner and none of those products actually took care of my dry, itchy, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> Yes it stinks, but most of that washes out when you rinse.</li>
            <li> occasional dandruff has gradually worsened as I&#x27;ve aged and about 2 years ago the dermatologist also diagnosed me with seborrheic dermatitis (&#x27;SD&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I will continue using this shampoo as long as it is made; it has been a life-changing product for me.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a coal tar product, so you have the smell.&lt;br /&gt;However, as a life long sufferer of plaque psoriasis</li>
            <li> It does not clear up my dandruff.</li>
            <li> However, I can now wear black again without having to constantly check my back for \\&quot;snowflakes.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> My hair also seemed less dry generally with just one application, basically like it used to look before I started using T-Gel.</li>
            <li> No matter what other shampoo I try, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This product was obviously formulated in Neutrogena&#x27;s OTHER lab.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but man is it worth it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders, Selsun Blue, store Nizoral and prescription Nizoral (as well as other things</li>
            <li> The first application was not terribly lathery, and I squeezed T-Gel from the bottle into my palm multiple times so that I could work it into especially troubled spots (um, basically everywhere)</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other day as part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I try this shampoo for help with my dry scalp and dandruff woes.  </li>
            <li> T Gel works so well on dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I did use head and shoulder dry scalp conditioner.</li>
            <li> After a thorough rinse I conditioned my hair again, then let it dry.</li>
            <li> and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.    </li>
            <li> It stopped the itching from the dry weather we&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> After seeing a few others with similar issues in the comments I suggest you look for this in your local CVS or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It has the same active ingredient as my prescription shampoo and</li>
            <li> After continuing to use this shampoo though I realized one day that I had not had a single flake in weeks.</li>
            <li> When I received the item it was already far past</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that only a small application would do, at least not the first application (and</li>
            <li> I have gone back to using other stuff and after a few days, the flakes are back.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that Neutrogena would recommend it, but I was desperate to find something that effectively controlled my SD and this has been a life-changing discovery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl with itchy,dry and red scalp!!</li>
            <li> and I can smell it while it&#x27;s wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It helps a little with the dandruff, only because I&#x27;m not scratching my scalp every 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have troublesome itchy, sometimes tiny little scabs on my scalp (don&#x27;t know why)</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little.  </li>
            <li> and you only have to use it for a little while to get rid of the dandruff</li>
            <li> , just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!months since you only need a little dab.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an extremely itchy, dry, and flaky scalp caused from a combination of the dry/cold air and excess hair product.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this and it solved her problem of extremely itchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a black female and suffered with an extremely flaky scalp for years.</li>
            <li> My husband has complained loudly about my persistent \\&quot;aroma\\&quot; and has requested I cease using it for his sake.  </li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve washed my hair in the past, no matter how long I let the shampoo sit, no matter how vigorously I rubbed, I&#x27;d always have a sticky, slimy white film on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and he said absolutely not</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but for this mom, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo only a few times</li>
            <li> It may take a few washes before it kicks in, but then nearly cures the issue with occasional repeat use (at least for this customer).  </li>
            <li> T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  </li>
            <li> (I limited my hair washing to every other day)!   </li>
            <li> Still, I could see that everything in stores for dandruff/itch all had one of two or so active ingredients in them, which is partially why none of them would work for me.</li>
            <li> i know that not every active ingredient will work for someones problems, so i still do recommend that someone tries this shampoo because it seems to have worked for lots of people.</li>
            <li> I was unable to keep from scratching my scalp - even in public - and my psoriasis was spreading to new areas of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t, my scalp would get extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d used TGel during the past 8 or so years off and on to control my dandruff but didn&#x27;t like using it simply because the odor made my hair smell like I was trying to ward off a swarm of mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after experiencing extreme dandruff, to the point that I thought I had psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not using it for dandruff or any other scalp problems, it has almost cure my itchiness and rash.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty irrelevant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a \\&quot;vacation\\&quot; and use another shampoo to \\&quot;liven up\\&quot; my hair.</li>
            <li> But you should also consider other things that you need to improve like sleep schedule and diet.</li>
            <li> He said it worked when other products have also failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now wash my hair every other day and include this into my routine.</li>
            <li> I use it every other shampoo, now.</li>
            <li> little tips: If you can&#x27;t determine what is causing your scalp to flake, dandruff, dry scalp, etc, go to a doctor to have it diagnosed.</li>
            <li> It turns out, that the seborrheic dermatitis would get particularly bad under stress, which I didn&#x27;t notice as a kid, or even as an adult until the dermatologist pointed it out, and I really paid attention after that.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dried out a bit but nothing serious, and the itching stopped instantly &amp; hasn&#x27;t returned yet (48 hours later).</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from an extremely itchy scalp for over a month, initially I was convinced that I had caught lice of the kids but couldn&#x27;t find any evidence of them no matter how hard I looked.</li>
            <li> The dry scalp is nowhere near that bad as far as the visibility of flakes.</li>
            <li> is so much less then using other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find it in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I had huge chucks of scales on all over my scalp, it was was bad.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair though</li>
            <li> I shampoo about twice a week with t-gel (leaving it in for a few minutes before rinsing) and then follow with my regular shampoo and/or small amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t wear anything dark anymore.  </li>
            <li> I could have used this for the last 20 years but its never to late to fix the scalp skin issues.  </li>
            <li> If I remember correctly, Nizoral smelled similar to T-Gel, at least once my hair was done--not the smell in the shower.    </li>
            <li> Even if this shampoo had worked like magic, I would probably still hate it because of the smell.</li>
            <li> the down side is it will smell like a tire shop</li>
            <li> While it did not eliminate the dandruff issue, it cut down on the flaking by about 40%.  </li>
            <li> Do not drop in shower, bottle will fracture and contents will go down the drain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not as if I never get itches or any flakes whatsoever, but this has cut all that down dramatically.</li>
            <li> I really thought it was all due to my bad diet and not enough sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning this shampoo did change my hair color slightly from dark brown to brown.</li>
            <li> no more dry scaly patches on his head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend this for dry scalp issues, but I would for dandruff, buildup, eczema/dermatitis and those sorts of issues.</li>
            <li> Slight smell (tar)</li>
            <li> I actually FORGOT about my ridiculous scalp problems.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days of use I started to see results, scalp is less scaly and head feels moisturized.  </li>
            <li> but, I could care less....</li>
            <li> upside is that he is losing SIGNIFICANTLY less hair in just the month that he has been using this.  </li>
            <li> half way through bottle now:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This review is from the perspective of a black user.</li>
            <li> As a black person, I use T-Gel once a week.</li>
            <li> (I may be wrong about that, but regular dandruff shampoo, even extra strength, didn&#x27;t work for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick white hair and consequently sometimes my head itches due to perspiration.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to make the shower too hot, lest it ignite.  </li>
            <li> but at first it might drive you crazy).</li>
            <li> My beautician told me that tea tree oil dried out Black hair</li>
            <li> Since he was a baby, he had very dry scaly skin behind his ears &amp; dry scaly patches on his scalp.  </li>
            <li> and he said a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Who cares if it smells a little like tar, I can touch my head again without pain.</li>
            <li> the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it makes my hair very frizzy and crazy looking</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I used to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> and my ears still eventually dried out, itched, cracked and bled.</li>
            <li> Just few weeks of use, I am using it along with biotin supplement to treat my psoriatic scalp.</li>
            <li> The smell does go away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Regular shampoos sometimes made it worse.</li>
            <li> This one cleared it all up within a few days.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend noticed that her dandruff was getting worse recently, so I got this for her.</li>
            <li> I tried the Head &amp; Shoulders and Selsun Blue and, if anything, it made it itch even worse.  </li>
            <li> Soon my entire head had dandruff (it had started on my scalp behind my ears)</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and went to work thinking the smell would release after it dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with seb dermatitis for a few years now and every once in awhile</li>
            <li> that would turn my hair green.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I changed shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I had pimples on my scalp for a few months.</li>
            <li> Eventually they all disappeared within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using it for another few days in a las ditch effort, but I&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to leave it on a few minutes, then rinse and repeat.</li>
            <li> Had been using Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue until now to no affect (hair was getting dried out and dandruff was worse than ever).</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was dandruff or scalp psoriasis or what, but it was extreme!</li>
            <li> In a previous review for some horrible product that Amazon tried to pass off as this, which is what I was really trying to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells and can burn your eyes if you aren&#x27;t careful, but it will definitely stop your dandruff, psoriasis or leprosy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find but works extremely well!</li>
            <li> it flares up pretty bad</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad dandruff</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it non stop for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> It was extremely harsh, and I&#x27;m usually tolerant towards things.</li>
            <li> If it helps someones dryness on the scalp that&#x27;s great, but it did nothing for my hair unfortunately so I will not be using this horribly smelling item any longer since there is no use</li>
            <li> Also on the plus side, it cleared up the dry scaly skin just inside and behind his ears as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly felt that crawling sensation at all and did not have any clumps/scaling, not even where I would feel the crawling sensation a little.</li>
            <li> Used it once and my scalp is seriously covered completely in flakes and itches so much worse!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d forgotten to apply the cream one morning or one evening, I&#x27;d be sorry by the end of the day or by the next morning.  </li>
            <li> No more itching, scaling, or flaking.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are complaining about the odor, you must not be uncomfortable enough.</li>
            <li> so the smell was a small price to pay for results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also placed a small amount in my eyebrows and ear canal for a minute or so 2 times a week</li>
            <li> Compared to name brand stuff for regular use, this is way expensive.</li>
            <li> However, there was still itching, just not as much as usual.</li>
            <li> but i have used it twice in the past four days.</li>
            <li> I was using a small dollop, about the &#x27;size of a nickel&#x27;, as someone here suggested.  </li>
            <li> The first few days were BAD!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s bad enough, but it stinks to high heaven.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product and when it arrived it had a strong medicinal odor, but I have very bad itchy, flaking scalp.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make it hard to handle.</li>
            <li> so its hard to</li>
            <li> Managing my scalp with growing hair has become hard, but this has made it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because my head had been itching alot lately.  </li>
            <li> Despite what the package says it&#x27;s not effective on psoriasis</li>
            <li> Give it at least a week to see if it helps eliminate the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup</li>
            <li> i used this shampoo five days a week (the bottle says to use at LEAST twice a week) and followed up with a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t cover the other, you just get TWO AWFUL STINKS LAYERED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find the extra strength version in stores, and when I do it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I knew I had used T-Gel a long time ago but couldn&#x27;t remember anything about how it worked except it smelled bad and dried my hair out</li>
            <li> Worst of all, there&#x27;s a note on the box that says &amp;#34;New Clean Scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was using the T Sal at first because i just came out of a weave, and my scalp was very bad.</li>
            <li> My very long hair still stinks.  </li>
            <li> i tried a few dandruff shampoos my scalp was very itchy still and very bad!</li>
            <li> Smell is little bit weird</li>
            <li> Yes it does have a smell, but it was not that bad in my opinion and it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> If you have bad scalp problems you should definitely try it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has had bad dandruff with a red, scaly scalp for 11 years.  </li>
            <li> When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> It is really doing the trick where other shampoos failed miserably...  </li>
            <li> There are some strange alchemy going on in this product for it to work so well, and smell so bad.  </li>
            <li> i have very thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> Also, my mild/moderate dandruff was made worse by this shampoo and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all to help with the itchiness.</li>
            <li> It aggravated the problem and I&#x27;m not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my scalp psoriasis was getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Several things, I hate the smell</li>
            <li> My psoriases got worse after using this.</li>
            <li> It was an irritating sensation that made it seem as if something was crawling in my scalp.</li>
            <li> My three-month-old son had a severe case of cradle cap that spread to his forehead and the side of his face, including the area behind his ears.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad dandruff the past year and nothing was working</li>
            <li> They were small but painful.</li>
            <li> , large flakes would come off, it was horrible, it was painful and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely weird</li>
            <li> if you follow it up with a H&amp;S conditioner, your hair won&#x27;t stink like that weird smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It does smell weird, but with the conditioner, no problem.</li>
            <li> the only reason that i wouldn&#x27;t rate a 5 is because of the horrible smell that for me, smells like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer consumed with  thinking about how uncomfortable my scalp is any longer.</li>
            <li> day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive</li>
            <li> My scalp would itch to the point of making it difficult to sleep at night for just feeling the urge to scratch.</li>
            <li> and i will continue to use this product although it was alittle expensive for the bottle size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using t-gel for years and coal tar is not a delicious smell, but it&#x27;s not noxious or overpowering either.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that an over-the-counter product would work for me, but I bought it anyhow.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately since I no longer have insurance I started looking for over the counter alternatives.</li>
            <li> sadly though, this shampoo did not get rid of the dandruff that caused</li>
            <li> My ears have been the worst though as they itched constantly and eventually would crack and bleed so it then became an itching AND painful problem.</li>
            <li> this stuff stinks like hell</li>
            <li> I had an issue with clumps of scalp that would flake like crazy when I scratched them.</li>
            <li> I would be afraid to use it for fear that my hair would smell and I might not get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> My scalp used to go crazy every time I wore a hat, and now I can wear hats without feeling like something&#x27;s crawling all over my scalp.     </li>
            <li> However, the stuff smells bad and leaves you hair smelling bad.  </li>
            <li> It smelled bad and the scent clung to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had a bad scalp problem forever</li>
            <li> It smells bad to me, but it works.</li>
            <li> But it smells BAD.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this offilne and Omgoodness, it smells SO BAD.</li>
            <li> although it smells bad.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist sort of steered me away from coal tar shampoo because it &#x27;smelled so bad&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, which leaves my scalp itchy and painful.</li>
            <li> what a disappointment!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, after one week of use, I&#x27;ve noticed NO improvement in the health of my hair/scalp and the annoying side effects continue to occur.</li>
            <li> but it was very uncomfortable until i found T GEL!</li>
            <li> It is so bad!  </li>
            <li> I just started using this this morning, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness just yet, however, the smell alone is just disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I hated the smell!  </li>
            <li> It smells horrific.</li>
            <li> GRUESOME product!  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible - my boyfriend nuzzled my head and recoiled.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have to comment on the smell; it&#x27;s terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Helps control dandruff. I am very satisfied. No matter what other shampoo I try, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad dandruff the past year and nothing was working and I saw this and I thought why not nothing else is working. Best shampoo ever. My dandruff has gone away in two days time. I feel so much better the down side is it will smell like a tire shop but with some conditioner and some spray that smell is gone. The smell is definitely weird but if your determined to get rid of your flakes suck it up because this is the right product!</li>
            <li> If this product worked great, I wouldn&#x27;t care about the generator car smell...but since the product did absolutely nothing to my dry scalp issue, I would say I can find a much better smelling shampoo to just clean my hair...If it helps someones dryness on the scalp that&#x27;s great, but it did nothing for my hair unfortunately so I will not be using this horribly smelling item any longer since there is no use</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I try this shampoo for help with my dry scalp and dandruff woes.  It is really doing the trick where other shampoos failed miserably...  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that consistently gets rid of my dry scalp issues. Only one I use now.</li>
            <li> cant beat the prices when it&#x27;s on sale here... so much cheaper than my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it steadily for many many years, it&#x27;s the only one that can control my dandruff symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have found it to work wonders.  The more I use it, the better it works.  I have tried all of the products from the beauty salons, and all of the commercial dandruff treatments and nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a tar smell to it that many people find objectionable.  I have many friends who use this product for the theraputic qualities and then soap up again with a good clarifying shampoo. I am told that the combo works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the different shampoos for dandruff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NONE of the Head &amp; Shoulder shampoos or Selsun Blues work.  Tea Tree oil sort of helped.  Sebulex sort of worked.  And regular strength coal tar shampoos (.5%) sort of work.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Prescription shampoos never worked for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This stuff works.  Really well.  I have gone back to using other stuff and after a few days, the flakes are back.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if you follow it up with a H&amp;S conditioner, your hair won&#x27;t stink like that weird smelling shampoo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does smell weird, but with the conditioner, no problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I never flake anymore.  Ever.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I used to wash my hair everyday. If I didn&#x27;t, my scalp would get extremely itchy. Now I wash my hair every 2-3 days and no itch! It helps a little with the dandruff, only because I&#x27;m not scratching my scalp every 5 seconds. But by day 3 I&#x27;ll see flakes in my hair. I have dark hair though so it&#x27;s more obvious.</li>
            <li> I have an itchy scalp, but no dandruff.  I have used H&amp;S and it is okay.  I used this and a lot of the itchiness goes away.  However, the stuff smells bad and leaves you hair smelling bad.  So beware of that.  Otherwise, a good product.</li>
            <li> Up to now have used this shampoo on two occasions and it worked after the first application - no flakes. Had been using Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue until now to no affect (hair was getting dried out and dandruff was worse than ever). Slight smell (tar) but the smell dissipates after some conditioner. Key is to follow instructions on the bottle. Highly recommend it and as effective as my old prescription shampoo (which cost 2X). If you have dandruff this is the one for you (extra strength).</li>
            <li> Take this review with a grain of salt since it might not work for everyone:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My occasional dandruff has gradually worsened as I&#x27;ve aged and about 2 years ago the dermatologist also diagnosed me with seborrheic dermatitis (&#x27;SD&#x27;) that affects both of my ears, under and around my eyes, nose, chest, etc.  My ears have been the worst though as they itched constantly and eventually would crack and bleed so it then became an itching AND painful problem. It was pure torture.  He prescribed a couple of different steroidal and then anti-fungal creams that I had to apply 2x a day and my ears still eventually dried out, itched, cracked and bled. If I&#x27;d forgotten to apply the cream one morning or one evening, I&#x27;d be sorry by the end of the day or by the next morning.  I often wondered why there wasn&#x27;t some kind of soap or cleanser that I could use in the shower for people like me with this common, stubborn skin condition. My doctor alone says he&#x27;s treated thousands of patients with SD with the steroidal and anti-fungal creams, most of whom, like me, can&#x27;t seem to find anything that works effectively for very long. But 99% of dermatologist recommend TGel to control dandruff, etc conditions on the scalp so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;d used TGel during the past 8 or so years off and on to control my dandruff but didn&#x27;t like using it simply because the odor made my hair smell like I was trying to ward off a swarm of mosquitoes. However, when the other products that smelled better weren&#x27;t effective, I always went back to TGel to solve the problem.  If I could just put up with the smell for 2 or 3 hours after using it, my itching, flaking, etc was immediately arrested - for days, even weeks at a time. (I&#x27;ve since found that rinsing it off well tends to remove most, but never all, of the odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to about 2 months ago when I saw my dermatologist to renew my seborrheic dermatitis prescription and asked him exactly what SD was.  He said that it&#x27;s a fungus related to the same fungus that causes scalps to break out in dandruff.  With that in mind, I figured I&#x27;d give TGel a try on the stubborn SD in my ears, on my face, etc. and realized THAT DAY that my SD problems could be solved in the shower.  After one treatment the itching was gone.  After 2 days / 2 treatments the rash was completely gone from all parts of my body.  I&#x27;m not sure that Neutrogena would recommend it, but I was desperate to find something that effectively controlled my SD and this has been a life-changing discovery.  After two days of applying it in the shower as I would to stop a dandruff outbreak, my ears stopped itching, the skin around my nose and under my eyes stopped scaling and is softer and younger feeling than it has been since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 46). And that&#x27;s not an exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw my dermatologist again last month and mentioned my discovery.  He inspected my ears and the other areas on my face and chest and was duly impressed with the results.  He took notes on my experience and said that he&#x27;d bring it up to his peers in the dermatological society he&#x27;s been a part of during his 30+ years at the Stanford Medical Institute.  I asked him if TGel could damage my skin or if there was any reason to be concerned about using it for this application and he said absolutely not and just look at my results for the proof.  Those pharmaceutical companies probably won&#x27;t like it, but I no longer need to apply a prescription anti-fungal or steroidal creams 2x a day and this is something that I can use during my normal dandruff regimen - IN THE SHOWER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you, thank you Neutrogena! I can&#x27;t say enough what a difference it&#x27;s made in my life.  I just hope it keeps working this well for the rest of it and that you find some value in my experience.</li>
            <li> Even if this shampoo had worked like magic, I would probably still hate it because of the smell. It is very chemical-like and it made my eyes sting even after rinsing it out. I heard that the smell would go away as hair dries, but it didn&#x27;t. If I had had time, I would have taken another shower and used my old shampoo to try to rinse the smell out! Also, my mild/moderate dandruff was made worse by this shampoo and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all to help with the itchiness. Overall, this shampoo gets a big \\&quot;fail\\&quot; in my book.</li>
            <li> this stuff stinks like hell, i guess all good potions stink. seeing little signs of improvement so far, after i finished the bottle i found it cheaper at a local store in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I am a black female and suffered with an extremely flaky scalp for years. I am not sure if it was dandruff or scalp psoriasis or what, but it was extreme! It was like every inch of my scalp would flake, sometimes in large scales. (Gross, I know.) I would wash my hair and literally it would be flaky the very next day or sooner. I used this shampoo and at first I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. It smelled bad and the scent clung to my hair. After continuing to use this shampoo though I realized one day that I had not had a single flake in weeks. I actually FORGOT about my ridiculous scalp problems. I thought maybe it was coincidence and went back to my old shampoo. Again, within a couple of days the flakes returned. I will continue using this shampoo as long as it is made; it has been a life-changing product for me.</li>
            <li> I have troublesome itchy, sometimes tiny little scabs on my scalp (don&#x27;t know why) but it was very uncomfortable until i found T GEL! It really works. The dermatologist prescribed a shampoo that cost 50 or more dollars for a tiny bottle and T GEL works infinitely better, as well as better than head and shoulders or selsum blue. Try it! It might work for you too!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after experiencing extreme dandruff, to the point that I thought I had psoriasis.  Within 3 days of use I started to see results, scalp is less scaly and head feels moisturized.  Would definitely recommend to anyone suffering with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning this shampoo did change my hair color slightly from dark brown to brown.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my head had been itching alot lately.  Only used it for a few days, and it&#x27;s worked great.  My scalp doesnt itch all the time anymore.  One con... the smell.  It didnt bug my husband... he actually LIKED it.  said it reminded him of soap he used when he was younger.  But it&#x27;s very potent, but it worked great.  I used a little conditioner after the shampoo to soften my hair, kind of in hopes it&#x27;d take the edge off of the odor, and it did a little.  Smells worse in the bottle than in clean hair.  But It does its job well!</li>
            <li> Seems to be the same as Head and Shoulders, although smellier. The soars and scabs that appear only on the crown of my head (for twenty years), have not been positively affected. I move on.</li>
            <li> T Gel works so well on dry scalp. the only reason that i wouldn&#x27;t rate a 5 is because of the horrible smell that for me, smells like chemicals. other then that it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy and scaly scalp (after extensive research online, I diagnosed myself with seborrheic dermatitis) for many years in high school until I decided to look up reviews for a drugstore good product that could end this awful condition!!!  Until then, I would scratch constantly and aggressively to the point where my scalp bled. NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR YOUR SCALP AND HAIR!  At first, I thought it had to do with my daily hair washings that might have dried out my scalp to the point of itchiness, but it wasn&#x27;t the case at all (I limited my hair washing to every other day)!   Finally, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel and within a month, my scalp stopped itching!!! I would use it twice a week and make sure to leave the product on for at least 5 minutes to let the magic work!  I even felt my scalp and noticed that it became smoother and not scaly-feeling! I stopped scratching my scalp which saved me For many years, I would be embarrassed of scratching in public. However, I can now wear black again without having to constantly check my back for \\&quot;snowflakes.\\&quot;  THANK YOU NEUTROGENA! :D   For those of you who were in the same boat, I hope y&#x27;all will experience the great outcome just like I did!</li>
            <li> This product functions as claimed. Something you do not see with many cosmetic products in the market place. Neutrogena product are known for their high quality, low cost, products and compare quite favorably with the substantially more expensive products being sold by medical professionals.</li>
            <li> This&#x27;ll make your hair smell like a car dealership or a new set of tires.  Some guys might dig it.  But I&#x27;m a girl and don&#x27;t love that.</li>
            <li> I purchased Nutrogena T-Gel Extra Strength \\&quot;Clean Scent\\&quot; in an attempt to control some persistent postpartum dandruff that did not respond to Nizoral or tea tree oil shampoo.  While it did not eliminate the dandruff issue, it cut down on the flaking by about 40%.  I think different users will experience different levels of effectiveness depending upon the underlying cause of their dandruff, and so others may find it to be a more effective treatment.  Regardless, this product has a VERY strong, industrial smell that will linger in your hair for up to 24 hours.  My husband has complained loudly about my persistent \\&quot;aroma\\&quot; and has requested I cease using it for his sake.  I question the \\&quot;Clean Scent\\&quot; in the product description; perhaps the marketer who labeled it considers the smell of diesel to be a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> After using t-gel for about 6 months, I can say it truly does work very well. I shampoo about twice a week with t-gel (leaving it in for a few minutes before rinsing) and then follow with my regular shampoo and/or small amount of conditioner. My scalp is flake and itch free, and my hair smells good and is very managable. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product and when it arrived it had a strong medicinal odor, but I have very bad itchy, flaking scalp.  I have been using this for about a week and it is working wonderfully.  You only have to use a little.  Good product.</li>
            <li> BEWARE of the \\&quot;NEW SCENT.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;before buying online, go to your local drugstore and test the ODOR first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never know how this product works because I&#x27;ll never use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of \\&quot;standard\\&quot; coal tar shampoo isn&#x27;t necessarily pleasant, but at least it&#x27;s just one smell.  I really don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;This new Neutrogena junk smells like they tried to cover the old shampoo scent with CHEAP CHEMICAL PERFUMEY STINKNESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like if you&#x27;ve ever tried to clean VOMIT smell out of upholstery with PINE-SOL.&lt;br /&gt;Or tried to get DOG POO out of shag carpet with SIMPLE GREEN.&lt;br /&gt;Or mask SKUNK JUICE with CHANEL No.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One smell doesn&#x27;t cover the other, you just get TWO AWFUL STINKS LAYERED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years - gets rid of the red skin found around your hair line as well as flakes.</li>
            <li> I have had a bad scalp problem forever and I never found anything that actually worked. I&#x27;ve used Sulfur 8 on my scalp and Keracare Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp shampoo and conditioner and none of those products actually took care of my dry, itchy, flaky scalp. I would still see flakes even immediately after washing my hair. My beautician told me that tea tree oil dried out Black hair so I never tried it. But after 1 use of the T/Gel, I found that it definitely works! No more itching, scaling, or flaking. When I used the Keracare, my scalp would tingle. I guess from the menthol. But the T/Gel does not tingle, it was more like a cooling sensation that was barely noticeable. Yes it does have a smell, but it was not that bad in my opinion and it doesn&#x27;t last. The conditioner has a nice smell actually. If you have bad scalp problems you should definitely try it.</li>
            <li> Bottle is brittle plastic.  Do not drop in shower, bottle will fracture and contents will go down the drain.  Neutrogena needs to package in different plastic.  Shampoo seems like it might work, will have to wait to see.  2 oz left for prob 6 shampoo applications.</li>
            <li> Although, I have never had dandruff or psoriasis, I have experienced burning and itchiness of my scalp for several months. I have used T-Gel Extra Strength for several days.  I am incredibly pleased with the results. For those of you who are complaining about the odor, you must not be uncomfortable enough. True, it doesn&#x27;t have an Herbal Essence smell but, I could care less....I&#x27;m no longer consumed with  thinking about how uncomfortable my scalp is any longer.</li>
            <li> In a previous review for some horrible product that Amazon tried to pass off as this, which is what I was really trying to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells and can burn your eyes if you aren&#x27;t careful, but it will definitely stop your dandruff, psoriasis or leprosy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Just few weeks of use, I am using it along with biotin supplement to treat my psoriatic scalp. My first impression is this is most normal feeling shampoo hiding sharp tar smell. Good work done there by neutrogena. Whether its helping me with the flaky skin I will update soon as I see significant change. As of now it feels good to use this shampoo and my scalp is showing improvements.</li>
            <li> Used it once and my scalp is seriously covered completely in flakes and itches so much worse! It aggravated the problem and I&#x27;m not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena T-Gel Extra strenght shampoo for more than 15 years and have recommended it to other people.  I liked it because it had 4% coal tar and no fragrance.  It was darker than the regular strength T-Gel.  Suddenly, sometime in the last year, the shampoo sold as Extra Strength became lighter and had a fragrance; it also started stinging my eyes.  I suspected that they simply started making only one strength and put it in the two different bottles in order to keep from losing the market.  I contacted one of their reps who called on my Dermatologist&#x27;s office to push his products, and he denied that Neutrogena had changed its formula for the Extra Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I noticed that my scalp psoriasis was getting worse and worse. I have now switched to Psoriatrax 5%.  It has only been a week and my scalp is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used this and have noticed it is less effective than before, try Psoriatrax.</li>
            <li> Have used it just once and have already noticed a difference. I&#x27;d been suffering an itchy scalp for a couple of months and looked up several solutions. Purchased this due to the customer reviews and am extremely happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with clumps of scalp that would flake like crazy when I scratched them. I tried a couple of the well known dandruff shampoos, but the shampoo that finally got rid of it in 1 week is Neutrogena T-Gel Therapeutic Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It is coal tar based and smells like fresh asphalt but it worked fast. The smell does go away after a few hours. I was desparate so the smell was a small price to pay for results.&lt;br /&gt;I used it two days in a row, then every other day for about 4 more days. That was about 6 weeks ago. I have used it about 4 times since. John&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; Since I first reviewed this shampoo, over 2 months ago, I have not had a recurrence of dandruff and flakes. I continue to use&lt;br /&gt;T-Gel weekly, even though I am flake free. As a side note, I was experiencing a cracked and peeling condition on my hands. Likely exzema, but that too has cleared up.I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> My son has psorasis , he was diagnosed @ 5 or 6.  Since he was a baby, he had very dry scaly skin behind his ears &amp; dry scaly patches on his scalp.  I used to douse him with olive oil  &amp; comb it out...it was gross.  He&#x27;s12 now &amp; a friend at work recently suggested T- Gel, WOW, amazing.  His ears &amp; scalp are now normal...no more dry scaly patches on his head.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but for this mom, worth every penny.  I even told him when he showers to get some of that lather on his knees &amp; elbows.  Heck, it works.</li>
            <li> great shampoo! have been using it for 7 years!</li>
            <li> I just started using this this morning, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness just yet, however, the smell alone is just disgusting.  I smell like a railroad tie.  I thought it would rinse out, but it hasn&#x27;t and I&#x27;m sitting at work hoping no one approaches me.  My co-workers are going to wonder who&#x27;s paving a driveway.  I&#x27;m going to stick with this for a week, if I can handle the smell.  I don&#x27;t feel any relief, even though the claim on the box says you will get relief even after one treatment.  More to come...</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve washed my hair in the past, no matter how long I let the shampoo sit, no matter how vigorously I rubbed, I&#x27;d always have a sticky, slimy white film on my scalp. It was especially noticeable at my hairline. I would then scrub my hairline with a wash rag, then pick the individual flakes out of my strands.    I haven&#x27;t been to the dermatologist, but after researching/looking at many photos, it is apparent I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, eyebrows, ear canal and a very, very minor case of it on the sides of my nostrils. As an African American who has long, unaltered natural hair, this product is very drying to my strands, but works wonders on my scalp. My solution is to condition my hair, prior to shampooing, then applying the tgel directly to the scalp, let it sit 4-6 minutes then wash it all out together. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo only a few times and I&#x27;ve NEVER saw my scalp so clear. I&#x27;ve also placed a small amount in my eyebrows and ear canal for a minute or so 2 times a week and I am thrilled with the result. Prior, I&#x27;d apply neosporin in attempt of keeping flakes away from my face.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time already and it never fails to cure my psoriasis whenever I get them in my head.  I just use it twice a week and my psoriasis disappears.  I guess the frequency of using it depends on the condition of a person&#x27;s psoriasis.  This is a great product !!!!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena T-Gel is effective at relief of an itchy, problematic scalp.  Several things, I hate the smell and I feel like it lingers for days.  After searching and asking around, apparently there is not anything as effective that smells fresh.  So I am back to the T Gel.  I also notice that I have to apply twice in one shower because the first application does not produce enough suds to make me feel like my hair is getting clean.  With the second application, it suds quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to try the conditioner.</li>
            <li> While I wish I didn&#x27;t need this product, I do. It smells bad to me, but it works. Will buy again if/when needed.</li>
            <li> I would advise against this product. Coal tar is highly carcinogenic and banned in many countries. I would limit use as much as possible</li>
            <li> This product had a strong smell, even after rinsing with a conditioner.  The odor was a bit strong for me, and I was concerned that , the tar might be absorbed into the scalp.  I used it 3 times, and had to change, because of the strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> My skull doesn&#x27;t itch anymore! I just make sure to use it once a week, then use other shampoos, too. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> The only shampoo to which I have no allergic reactions. Smells like the Packer Tar shampoo my mother used on me.</li>
            <li> Since she was born, my daughter has had scalp issues. Regular shampoos sometimes made it worse. This one cleared it all up within a few days. Awesome product. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This products works as advertised for my husband.  Stores around our area don&#x27;t keep it in stock, so it is nice to be able to find it.</li>
            <li> This product really smells! The smell was worth it for the first two weeks of using it, but after two weeks my dandruff started coming back. Now the shampoo doesn&#x27;t do a bit of good for my dandruff and only makes my hair stink for a day.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for my face.  I had a flaky skin condition.  Using T-gel every other day has cured the problem completely.  FYI, I first used it daily for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try this item for her very long hair and is very happy with the results she is seeing after using it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl with itchy,dry and red scalp!! I was in need of something fast!! My scalp was so tender and hurt!! Used this shampoo and instantly could tell!!! I would recommend for anybody!!! I did use head and shoulder dry scalp conditioner. It helped with the smell:))</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo ever made.  And I have no further comment.</li>
            <li> Good product, and good price!</li>
            <li> So for the only thing that has worked on my scalp.  But it smells BAD.  My very long hair still stinks.  I may try the advice of another reviewer and shampoo after with a regular shampoo.  Definitely using this as rarely as I can get away with.</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from an extremely itchy scalp for over a month, initially I was convinced that I had caught lice of the kids but couldn&#x27;t find any evidence of them no matter how hard I looked. My scalp was not flakey or red at all, just infuriatingly itchy! I am very fussy with products I use on my scalp &amp; hair &amp; normally use organic, sulphate &amp; silicone free products so was a bit nervous of using the T gel, especially as it comes with several warnings on the box. Anyway I bit the bullet &amp; used it as directed by the instructions, it smelled a bit odd but lathered easily &amp; didn&#x27;t sting or burn my scalp at all. I covered the length of my hair in conditioner prior to putting the T gel on my scalp to try to protect it from the drying effects of the shampoo. After a thorough rinse I conditioned my hair again, then let it dry. My hair was dried out a bit but nothing serious, and the itching stopped instantly &amp; hasn&#x27;t returned yet (48 hours later). I am very happy as the itching was driving me mad &amp; my scalp was getting sore, one application of T gel has stopped the irritation in it&#x27;s tracks :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was good.  I was using a store brand for the same item, but since the price was good, thought I would try the name brand.  I hated the smell!  It is so bad!  I went back to the store brand.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend noticed that her dandruff was getting worse recently, so I got this for her. Since then, she stopped scratching her head too often and finally focused on more important things than complaining about her scalp.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has had bad dandruff with a red, scaly scalp for 11 years.  He does not overwash his hair--only shampooing about once a week.  I FINALLY convinced him to try this shampoo.  Dandruff, redness, scales gone in two washes.  It does not smell &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; like some shampoos but the residual smell is mild and non-offensive.  Also on the plus side, it cleared up the dry scaly skin just inside and behind his ears as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with it and he is pleased that I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it turned his beautiful bright grey hair a tad yellower. Nobody would notice but me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is that he is losing SIGNIFICANTLY less hair in just the month that he has been using this.  I think a healthier scalp is keeping the hair in place.  His hair looks and feels thicker and looks shinier and healthier than it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have him buy the regular strength for the second bottle because the extra strength worked so quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> Every year I had skin problem but it really works!! After using for 2-3 weeks (every1-2 days) my flake was gone and radish skin also disappeared. I really want to recommend people who suffered from seborrheic dermatitis. Smell is little bit weird but it goses away soon. I used many other medicine including some steroid but this is way better and now my skin is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> A very useful product at a great price.  Good service.  A must for people who suffer from scalp issues as a way to find relief.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than regular therapeutic and certainly better than CVS Extra Strength. Neutragena always seems to make a better mouse trap so given a choice, that&#x27;s who I go with.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for me. I love it and would recommend it to anyone searching for a dandruff shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Although I&#x27;m not using it for dandruff or any other scalp problems, it has almost cure my itchiness and rash.  I&#x27;m really happy with the results and I&#x27;m ordering more.  I have tried everything in the market, with and without a prescription, and it would only relieve the problem for a day or so.  With this product, since I began using it, the itchiness is almost gone and my skin has completely clear.  I love this product.  This product is wonderful and is effective to kill bacterias, rashes, yeast infections, fungus and jocker&#x27;s itch.  I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find the extra strength version in stores, and when I do it&#x27;s very expensive.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The t-gel really does help (even in the 1st use) with dry scalp. I&#x27;ve have had chronic dry scalp for about a year now and this essentially cured that as soon as I started using. The only thing is when you use it - it has a VERY strong scent (smells like moth balls). So much so that it was making me cough in the shower lol I use this product maybe once every 2 weeks and then in between I use Head and Shoulders scalp clinical strength and now I no longer have a dry scalp :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena T-Gel for two months now and it&#x27;s not cutting it for me. It does not clear up my dandruff. What it will do is make my hair smell minty and &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; esque, calming the dandruff for the rest of the day; Then it needs to be rewashed again immediately in the morning because, SURPRISE, the dandruff is back! I even bought it a second time (the extra strength version) and it works the same. It dries my hair out and then I have to use a deep condtioner, giving me even MORE dandruff. I&#x27;m going to move onto a different product that may work.</li>
            <li> This dandruff shampoo is amazing.  I had this bottle in my bathroom for some time (wife bought it by mistake), and over the weekend I noticed some dandruff, so I decided I&#x27;d use it.  WOW did it work.  One use, no dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must caution that it smells like jet fuel.  Or the coating Northrop-Grumman uses on their stealth aircraft.  I was afraid to make the shower too hot, lest it ignite.  Michael Jackson&#x27;s Pepsi Commercial all over again, you know.  There are some strange alchemy going on in this product for it to work so well, and smell so bad.  This product was obviously formulated in Neutrogena&#x27;s OTHER lab.  You know—the one in the DANK CASTLE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all: MG217, T/Sal, Head and Shoulders, Nizoral, Free &amp; Clear, Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea tree, etc...and none of it worked. I had a back and forth self diagnosis of either psoriasis or sebhorreic dermatitis, but ultimately I think I had the latter. And finally I got to T/Gel (the T/Sal dried up my scalp), and wow it has worked wonders and was exactly I have been looking for for the past year. I wash as instructed, and a week later, it is about 90% back to normal. I&#x27;m excited and so glad I finally have a solution to my itching, flaking, peeling scalp. The smell is not the best, but you get used to it quickly, and if you have a nice conditioner you like, you can just use that for the ends of your hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my spouse who had flaky scalp issues.  About a week after use I asked him if he saw improvement and he said a little bit.  The thing I don&#x27;t care for is if he takes a shower before me, I come into the bathroom to a very overwhelmingly strong unpleasant medicine-y odor that I feel isn&#x27;t good to breathe into the lungs, so I am imagining my spouse breathing this in far more than me while he is using it in a hot steaming shower.  I do not like the warnings on the bottle either, my spouse has sensitive skin so reading the warnings concerns me.  This was our experience with it, so far.  After he is done with the bottle I&#x27;m going to try a Neem Oil based shampoo from the health food store.</li>
            <li> It smells horrific. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> GRUESOME product!  First of all, package states (in small print) that it HAS caused cancer.  Nor that it &amp;#34;MIGHT&amp;#34; cause cancer or &amp;#34;COULD&amp;#34; cause cancer....but that it HAS and DOES cause cancer.  That&#x27;s bad enough, but it stinks to high heaven.  I would be afraid to use it for fear that my hair would smell and I might not get rid of it.  I had ordered this because it was a Neutrogena product....what a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from an increasing degree of dandruff for two years. I tried the Head &amp; Shoulders and Selsun Blue and, if anything, it made it itch even worse.  I tried ignoring it; like THAT worked... Soon my entire head had dandruff (it had started on my scalp behind my ears) and I couldn&#x27;t wear anything dark anymore.  I would have a SHOWER of flakes with just a couple digs with my fingernails.  Finally I said ENOUGH - I&#x27;ve got to do something. So I did some research and found Neutrogena T/Gel.  Why not? I said. It&#x27;s expensive, but man is it worth it!  It actually hurt my head applying it at first because I had dug my scalp so much I had open sores.  But I persevered and used it every day for 3 weeks.  At that point, the smell was really getting to my boyfriend and I slacked off to 3 times a week for another 2 weeks, and then finally stopped using it at all. So, in 5 weeks, my dandruff was GONE.  Two years of hell had disappeared in 5 weeks.  If you have stubborn dandruff that just WILL NOT GO AWAY, give this a try. It&#x27;s worth the money and definitely worth the smell - you won&#x27;t have to use it long. I&#x27;ve gone back to a regular store shampoo for the last 2 months and have not had a single dandruff itch or flake.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible. Absolutely horrible - my boyfriend nuzzled my head and recoiled. But you should buy it anyway. I have seborrheic dermatitis, which leaves my scalp itchy and painful. I use this 2 or 3 times a week and problem solved. I rub it into my scalp, let it sit for about 2 minutes, and then rinse and use a nice smelling conditioner to neutralize the chemical odor. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. The smell is unpleasant but it&#x27;s so effective and totally worth it to avoid the pain and itch and embarrassment of serious dandruff and dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Smells like asphalt paving machine and leaves your hair with the smell. Recommended by allergist, but I asked for another alternative.</li>
            <li> Despite what the package says it&#x27;s not effective on psoriasis but then again, what is?</li>
            <li> I could have used this for the last 20 years but its never to late to fix the scalp skin issues.  I am glad I discovered the product.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t they make a product smell good...&lt;br /&gt;I used this today.... And damn...&lt;br /&gt;My hair smelled like shoe polish from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that potent.... I am not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;Gross.... Never ever using this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this offilne and Omgoodness, it smells SO BAD. I washed my hair and went to work thinking the smell would release after it dried. NOPE!!!!! How embarassing?! Only having used it once, I don&#x27;t care if this product works or not, the smell is unbearable. Never again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. no side effect. although it smells bad. but u can cover it by a conditioner</li>
            <li> My hubby swears by this and Nizoral so he switches back and forth. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on the advice of my dermatologist for control of seborrheic keratosis. Works quite well. I use it a couple of times a week and it keeps the condition in check.</li>
            <li> My 10 month old has eczema and this shampoo was suggested by a pediatric dermatologist.  It works very well.  We had a hard time finding a shampoo that helped with his scalp, especially with dry weather in winter, but over time this product was the best for our situation.  I was worried about the medication in it and how his scalp would feel while we washed his hair because as much as we tried to keep him from scratching, he did have small red/rough/raw areas on his head, but he never acted like it bothered him in the slightest. This shampoo is not specially made for infants, toddlers or children, so it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;tear-free.&amp;#34; It does have a strong smell, but it&#x27;s a clean smell and we just use a mild shampoo after to kind of soften up his hair and improve the smell.  We have been using it for over 2 months. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle the first time you use it, but follow the instructions and it will do its&#x27; job.  T-Gel has multiple products that work just as well, if your needs and situation is different.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a dermatologist to eradicate several patches of scaly areas that had developed on my scalp.  After only two shampoos the problem was much reduced.  Eradication here I come.</li>
            <li> For those who have dandruff, itchy scalp, psoriasis this is by far the best thing I have used. I used so many products due to my itchy scalp, but this T-Gel has been amazing all the time. There are two versions of the T-Gel, extra Strength (product in this review) and the &amp;#34;Original Shampoo&amp;#34;. Both of them differ in the % of coal tar. My doctor recommended to use 2 bottles of this and then 1 bottle of the &amp;#34;Original Shampoo&amp;#34;. I have observed my hair getting stronger and healthier after this use. I do not use any conditioner even.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a cheap shampoo. Compared to name brand stuff for regular use, this is way expensive. But worth every penny IMHO!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I found to be working long term. Its not the most wonderful smelling hair product,but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so it&#x27;s pretty irrelevant.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It does what it says its supposed to do.  No issues here.  The product works great.  I never thought something would help but this definitely does.</li>
            <li> My condition:&lt;br /&gt;I had red, blotchy oily patches on my scalp as well as scaly dandruff patches. My hair is dry and curly and I have fair, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first use:&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure that this stuff really cleans your hair and scalp. After the two shampoos my hair was literally squeaky clean. You can feel it stripping the dirt and oils off your head.&lt;br /&gt;I paired this with the conditioner I always use which is Natures Gate biotin conditioner which is a really rich, buttery conditioner. This helped bring the moisture back into the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over half way through bottle now:&lt;br /&gt;The red, oily patches are probably 90% better but the flakes are only maybe 40% improved. Which is still something I am very grateful for but I was hoping for a bigger improvement especially because this product dries my face and hair out quite a lot and I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;I am going to see it through to the end of the bottle and then try some different products instead. If nothing else works better I will continue to use the T-Gel.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for me and lessens dandruff for me. The smell leaves something to be desired but the effect is the most important. Since coal tar is the active ingredient it kind of smell exactly how you would expect.</li>
            <li> My psoriases got worse after using this.</li>
            <li> I have very thick white hair and consequently sometimes my head itches due to perspiration. The Neutrogena T-Gel Therapeutic Shampoo helps and doesn&#x27;t discolor my hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it hard to handle. It has a really clean scent and  suds very well. I have used it for years and honestly, I like it!</li>
            <li> This product is really great for dandruff.Not a fan of the smell but it does it&#x27;s job and you only have to use it for a little while to get rid of the dandruff then you can go back to whatever shampoo u want.</li>
            <li> Bottle had split open and so I could not use it.  Cost money to send it back do I will not order anything again.</li>
            <li> This is the only product out of dozens that have blocked the dandruff for any period of time. It&#x27;s main ingredient is coal tar and that seems to work pretty well. It was recommended by a salon worker and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with seb dermatitis for a few years now and every once in awhile it flares up pretty bad (luckily i have dark hair so its hard to see)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is if you have this problem, is to try multiple solutions at the same time instead of 1 by 1. This shampoo is one of the solutions i use (along with some things like anti bacterial soap, antifungal shampoo, and some natural oils). This definitely helped reduce the symptoms in a huge way (less red spots and bumps, reduced/eliminate itching). Give it at least a week to see if it helps eliminate the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this shampoo itself, be warned: it has a very distinct/strong smell (you get used to it eventually but at first it might drive you crazy). Rinse with another shampoo afterwards to help eliminate the smell if it bothers you too much.</li>
            <li> I have been a sufferer of dandruff ever since I was a child. When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn&#x27;t be so overt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  The doctor said, \\&quot;Neutrogena T-Gel.\\&quot; I asked, \\&quot;Is that a prescription?\\&quot; \\&quot;No,\\&quot; he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has been a life-saver. It&#x27;s not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair.  The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a \\&quot;vacation\\&quot; and use another shampoo to \\&quot;liven up\\&quot; my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year. About 30% of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used to color my hair, I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn&#x27;t seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dandruff and haven&#x27;t tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!months since you only need a little dab.

            <li> Yes, this is a coal tar product, so you have the smell.&lt;br /&gt;However, as a life long sufferer of plaque psoriasis, I will&lt;br /&gt;tell you, this stuff works. It keeps scales away, and the flakes&lt;br /&gt;that come from it. It does lighten your hair, but I like that effect.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, it works!</li>
            <li> I so appreciate the quick shipping on a stinky but QUALITY product.  During a scuba dive I received a number of jellyfish stings on my scalp, the dermatologist recommended this product for the hives and itching they caused.  And Finally relief! It really did work!  And I am very appreciative you sent it so quickly!!  Thanks again.  :):)</li>
            <li> This is my go-to in the winter! My scalp gets extremely dry in the winter and starts to flake at the top of my scalp. Helps every time!</li>
            <li> I can already see a difference in the amount of flakes.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good. I was using the T Sal at first because i just came out of a weave, and my scalp was very bad. I had huge chucks of scales on all over my scalp, it was was bad. I had to switch to the T -Gel because it was much stronger and worked on my itchy scalp. It worked pretty good!</li>
            <li> This review is from the perspective of a black user. As a black person, I use T-Gel once a week. I would actually disagree with some of the comments by the most popular review here (by Shelley), but the basic sentiment is the same, i.e. this works wonders.    I have tried seemingly everything for my scalp, and it seems I&#x27;ve had a variety of problems over the years--dry scalp, dandruff, scaling, etc. I had even been told by a hair stylist that I had ezcema, but then it seemed she told most of her customers that. My last problem has been, from as best as I can tell from my research, scaling, buildup and dandruff. My scalp would itch to the point of making it difficult to sleep at night for just feeling the urge to scratch. I had clumps of flakes in my scalp, and I could often feel them rising to the surface. It was an irritating sensation that made it seem as if something was crawling in my scalp. Usually, I&#x27;d put my fingers where the sensation was and feel either flakes forming (not completely above the surface, but I could feel them) or already there (i.e. could scratch them right off my scalp). It seemed like something always came out of my fingernails, whether it was flakes or white gunk.     I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders, Selsun Blue, store Nizoral and prescription Nizoral (as well as other things I can&#x27;t remember). I was using the new Selsun Blue (the greenish or blue see-through bottles with Aloe Vera/vitamins or whatever, 3% Salicylic Acid) before this and was having those problems mentioned above. T-Gel works better than all of those shampoos put together. I knew I had used T-Gel a long time ago but couldn&#x27;t remember anything about how it worked except it smelled bad and dried my hair out (I also had different issues with my scalp back then). Still, I could see that everything in stores for dandruff/itch all had one of two or so active ingredients in them, which is partially why none of them would work for me. Neutrogena didn&#x27;t have those ingredients, and I&#x27;d read so many people online say it worked for them. So I decided to try it again.    The first usage, I followed the instructions which say to apply twice, basically. I didn&#x27;t find that only a small application would do, at least not the first application (and therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t say one $10 bottle lasts months). I had read a review before buying that said T-Gel lathers a lot easier the second application in a row, and I found that to be true. The first application was not terribly lathery, and I squeezed T-Gel from the bottle into my palm multiple times so that I could work it into especially troubled spots (um, basically everywhere) good. It did smell bad, but honestly I didn&#x27;t really care and still don&#x27;t, if it&#x27;s going to work. I didn&#x27;t let it sit for 3 mins or anything like that, but I just rubbed it in as good as possible. Then I proceeded to use what I normally use in my hair--no other shampoos, just a moisturizer and a conditioner/moisturizer.     I did feel like the smell was following me around. I had my mother smell my hair and she said the only reason she noticed it was because I pointed it out. I kept trying to pinpoint what I smelled like, and I realized I just basically smelled like I had something medicated in my hair. If I remember correctly, Nizoral smelled similar to T-Gel, at least once my hair was done--not the smell in the shower.    Later that same night, I laid in bed and started feeling that sensation like something&#x27;s crawling in my scalp. I did like always and placed my fingers where the sensations were and in some of those spots I did feel scaling and flakes or clumps, generally trying to come up but a couple times were already up. My scalp did feel so clean, though--I have not felt it this clean in years, probably. There was just no buildup. However, there was still itching, just not as much as usual. The flakes and itching were definitely cut down and the itching probably was more similar to what the average person goes through with theirscalp.    The second time I used T-Gel, there were no flakes at all for that whole week, at least not from dandruff--probably more from dry scalp, i.e. T-Gel does make your hair/scalp drier. I hardly felt that crawling sensation at all and did not have any clumps/scaling, not even where I would feel the crawling sensation a little. The dry scalp is nowhere near that bad as far as the visibility of flakes. When I used T-Gel this second time, I did not apply it twice. I think this is the reason why I did not have that medicated smell that much like I did the first time. My hair also seemed less dry generally with just one application, basically like it used to look before I started using T-Gel. My scalp still felt amazingly clean that week, and the itching was down even more. Absolutely nothing comes up in my fingernails now. My scalp used to go crazy every time I wore a hat, and now I can wear hats without feeling like something&#x27;s crawling all over my scalp.     Bottom line: I don&#x27;t know why this works miracles, but it really does and does so pretty quickly. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend this for dry scalp issues, but I would for dandruff, buildup, eczema/dermatitis and those sorts of issues. If you&#x27;ve tried everything and none of it has worked, this is for you. You just need to make sure you have a good conditioner that moisturizes for use afterwards. It&#x27;s also not as if I never get itches or any flakes whatsoever, but this has cut all that down dramatically.</li>
            <li> i have had an itchy scalp for probably about a year now. i tried a few dandruff shampoos my scalp was very itchy still and very bad! then i saw this product in walgreens and i got the x-tra stregnth and used it..it works wonders!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is safe for everyday use but i have used it twice in the past four days. the first time i used it i had alittle itching but i dont think i washed very well but today i used it again and made sure i got everywhere and also put it on my problem area in the back of my head and massaged as directed. that was this morning and i havent itched one. iam so happy. and i have also noticed the amount of hair i lose in the shower is so much less then using other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair very frizzy and crazy looking but i actually dont mind it. i have very thick wavy hair and i will continue to use this product although it was alittle expensive for the bottle size but you get what you pay for and this is a good example.</li>
            <li> This product smells not horrible but definitely not good and I can smell it while it&#x27;s wet or dry. My dandruff was not cured in the slightest. I saw no difference and I&#x27;ve been using it non stop for the past few weeks and I followed the instructions to wash then repeat... I&#x27;m very dissapointed that this product did nothing for me all I want is a cure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using t-gel for years and coal tar is not a delicious smell, but it&#x27;s not noxious or overpowering either.  And I&#x27;ve gotten used to it--fond even.  It the disctinction of t-gel that makes me think it&#x27;s doing something special to help my scalp.  This new scent, on the other hand, is giving me a headache!  I may have to return it and try to find an unscented version.  Neutrogena, please try again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective product for dandruff fakes.  It may take a few washes before it kicks in, but then nearly cures the issue with occasional repeat use (at least for this customer).  I have tried the generic equivalent with some success, and sometimes find this brand at an equal or better price in the local store, but props to the seller for quick and efficient shipping.</li>
            <li> I tried every cream, shampoo, foam, and oil that my dermatologist prescribed for me over the last 15 years.  Nothing worked - mainly because, for a number of reasons, I didn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t follow through with the number of treatments per day that each required (Walking around with oil on my scalp and a shower cap on my head for at least 4 hours a day once a week just didn&#x27;t fit into my life style!) My dermatologist sort of steered me away from coal tar shampoo because it &#x27;smelled so bad&#x27;.  Through the years I tried all sorts of different shampoos and combinations of over-the-counter treatments, all the while scratching the heck out of my scalp.  I was leaving clumps of white flakes wherever I went.  I was unable to keep from scratching my scalp - even in public - and my psoriasis was spreading to new areas of my scalp.  In researching solutions for this problem, I found wonderful reviews for T/Gel Therapeutic Shampoo.  I was skeptical that an over-the-counter product would work for me, but I bought it anyhow.  I used it every other day for the first 2 weeks - apply, lather, rinse, reapply and let sit - and I am SO AMAZED by the results!  I have been using it for 2 months and I have NO symptoms of psoriasis!  No flaking, no itching!  At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but now I think of it as the &#x27;odor of psoriasis relief&#x27;, and I believe that it smells better than whatever coal tar shampoo the doctor would have prescribed.  I have short hair, so the smell does not stay with me as it would for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product through Amazon Prime, but it was fulfilled by &amp;#34;Ganesheis&amp;#34;. When I received the item it was already far past it&#x27;s expiration date, which was 09/2013. For reference, the date I received this item was 01/07/2014. I won&#x27;t be using the product they sent me or ever ordering from &amp;#34;Ganesheis&amp;#34; again as this company has a no returns policy. Thankfully it was only 10 dollars. After seeing a few others with similar issues in the comments I suggest you look for this in your local CVS or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Shampoo expires in 05/2013. I&#x27;m going to lose one of them.  Is a bad deal but the shampoo is good</li>
            <li> Neutrogena T/Gel Therapeutic Shampoo is excellent for cradle cap!!! My three-month-old son had a severe case of cradle cap that spread to his forehead and the side of his face, including the area behind his ears. This shampoo was far more effective than the ketoconozale prescribed by my son&#x27;s dermatologist. It only took one use (three shampoos in a row) to remove the stubborn scales. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for people who experience a dry scalp. It seems to thicken the hair as well. If you suffer from dandruff/ flaky scalp, try the T/Sal version. It worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I used this product  twice a week for 2 weeks and the itching was gone. Dandriff  gone after one week  and Yes I works on Bald Heads too.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I changed shampoo.  Within a week, my head was furiously itching.  Changing back to my old shampoo didn&#x27;t help.  Someone recommended T/Gel.  Desperation knows no bounds, so I ordered it.  At first, it didn&#x27;t seem to help.  I was using a small dollop, about the &#x27;size of a nickel&#x27;, as someone here suggested.  I doubled the amount, and started seeing improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even now, the itching isn&#x27;t permanently gone.  But it&#x27;s gone for days at a time.  Not sure why it comes and goes, but it&#x27;s better than before, and I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the product was received very fast.  This product works very well for a specific issue and my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> THE STINK…. will last for a week in your hair even though you wash it a thousand times with regular shampoo after.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work! I had pimples on my scalp for a few months. They were small but painful. I really thought it was all due to my bad diet and not enough sleep. After changing all of that I still had these pimples. I searched online and found out about this shampoo. It got better after I used about 1/3 of the bottle. The first few days were BAD! I got more pimples and I thought I was allergic to this. I didn&#x27;t want to give up considering the reviews were so good. Eventually they all disappeared within a few weeks. My first bottle had ran out about a week ago. The pimples didn&#x27;t come back but I think I should continue for another bottle. If you have similar problems give this a try. But you should also consider other things that you need to improve like sleep schedule and diet.</li>
            <li> Yes it stinks, but most of that washes out when you rinse. I have pretty bad dandruff and it works wonders for me! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I suffered from seborrhoeic dermatitis for 6 YEARS!!. I used every product you can imagine (natural and prescribed) to fight the symptoms and nothing seemed to work until I used this shampoo. I had severe seborrhoeic dermatitis on my scalp, it covered about 25% of my scalp. My scalp would bleed, itch, large flakes would come off, it was horrible, it was painful and embarrassing. Thanks to the effectiveness of this product I can happily say that I stopped suffering from it.&lt;br /&gt;At first I used the shampoo daily as directed on the bottle, leaving the product in my hair for about 10 mins.  I didn&#x27;t feel anything the first couple of days, however within 6-8 days of use, i noticed significant results and I couldn&#x27;t believed it, I felt a lot better. After 3 weeks of use I saw that the condition improved 100%. Now I use it every other day as part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;This product was really made for what it said. I couldn’t care less about the smell, because it really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, if you are suffering like I did, tried this shampoo, follow the instructions, be patient and have faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (1.5 year later):  I recently bought a bottle for a relative who was suffering from a sever dandruff due stressful situations, IT WORKED FOR HIM TOO. I sent it to him overseas and even the shipping costs where well worth because this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful I ran into this product.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Use it occasionally on advice of my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews (especially negative ones), but I must be honest in saying that I was unpleasantly surprised at the results of using this T-Gel shampoo for one week. I&#x27;ve got an extremely itchy, dry, and flaky scalp caused from a combination of the dry/cold air and excess hair product. Based on the reviews, I was super excited to purchase this shampoo to cure the annoying side effects that my dry scalp has caused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, after one week of use, I&#x27;ve noticed NO improvement in the health of my hair/scalp and the annoying side effects continue to occur. Additionally, I have to comment on the smell; it&#x27;s terrible! It reminds me of moth balls from my grandmothers attic. Worst of all, there&#x27;s a note on the box that says &amp;#34;New Clean Scent&amp;#34;. If clean smells like moth balls, then I want to be dirty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using it for another few days in a las ditch effort, but I&#x27;m not convinced. Will update if results change!</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis of my scalp. It causes flaking and itching in several prominent areas under my hair and at the the hairline. As a kid, Mom would buy me head and shoulders, as that&#x27;s what my dad used for his dandruff. I&#x27;m pretty sure I still had dandruff that seemed to come and go. It turns out, that the seborrheic dermatitis would get particularly bad under stress, which I didn&#x27;t notice as a kid, or even as an adult until the dermatologist pointed it out, and I really paid attention after that.  Using T/Gel for a week gets it under control if there is a major breakout, and I&#x27;m comfortable using it weekly after it&#x27;s cleared up just to keep it at bay, but often times forget about it. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but the results are worth it, as I notice a difference after a single shampoo. Letting it go results in embarrassing dandruff, oily hair, itchy scalp, and sometime sores on my scalp if I can&#x27;t control the itching. It&#x27;s definitely worth the smell to get rid of all of that nonsense!!</li>
            <li> I take care of my hair and scalp the best I can. But sometimes, my scalp just dries out and becomes unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of research, and from what I know now, dandruff and dry scalp are two totally different things. (I may be wrong about that, but regular dandruff shampoo, even extra strength, didn&#x27;t work for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product stops my scalp from flaking and normalizes it. I use this about once every three days or so and it has ALWAYS worked for me. A family member of mine has the same condition, flaking scalp, and I recommended this to him. He said it worked when other products have also failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of this for what it has done to me. I&#x27;m now growing my hair out, and right now, it is six inches long. Managing my scalp with growing hair has become hard, but this has made it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My little tips: If you can&#x27;t determine what is causing your scalp to flake, dandruff, dry scalp, etc, go to a doctor to have it diagnosed. I took the long path and spent a solid two months trying different shampoos, conditioners, with nothing working. After reading about how shampoo shouldn&#x27;t be used on the scalp directly, but more on the hair and tips, I stopped using conditioner all together. I now wash my hair every other day and include this into my routine.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find but works extremely well! Best product outside of a prescription that works well on dandruff, hands down. I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> I use it at time more often than a regular one. It does really help in comparison with a regular one.</li>
            <li> this stuff works amazing for itchy scalp and/or scalp sores.  I was using head and shoulders for a few months which worked ok, but then my scalp itch returned in full force while still using head and shoulders so my doctor recommended this T-Gel.  It started working upon first use and has only improved since then.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this and it solved her problem of extremely itchy dry skin.  Her condition ceased to be a problem after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Always used this product.  It is getting hard to find it in local stores.  The price is better on Amazon</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me! I had a prescription shampoo for my dermatitis of the scalp and it worked wonders. Unfortunately since I no longer have insurance I started looking for over the counter alternatives. I was told by the target pharmacists to try this product. This did ease some itching at first and it probably would have worked if I continued to use it. But the smell is so potent that I just couldn&#x27;t force myself to keep going. It  was as if someone dumped kerosine on my head. It was extremely harsh, and I&#x27;m usually tolerant towards things. I did more research and found an alternative which i will use tomorrow called Nizoral. It has the same active ingredient as my prescription shampoo and the smell is so much better! I opened the box in the store to check.</li>
            <li> very happy with the product, I have a patch of psoriasis at the hairline and some damp scalp itch in back and this stuff really worked to get rid of both. I use it every other shampoo, now. It smells very rich and earthy too, not perfumey at all.</li>
            <li> this shampoo worked great on the stubborn itch i had. i was literally itching my scalp until it bled. sadly though, this shampoo did not get rid of the dandruff that caused the itching.&lt;br /&gt;it also had a very strong smell to it...i had to keep my hair in a pony tail during the shower and made sure the product didn&#x27;t have prolonged contact on my skin. i thought it would make my sensitive skin break out, but it actually made me have an eczema flare up.&lt;br /&gt;just remember to lather, rinse and REPEAT. it only works that way! each lather should be on your head for several minutes. you&#x27;ll notice a considerable difference within one shower. i used this shampoo five days a week (the bottle says to use at LEAST twice a week) and followed up with a moisturizing conditioner. the weekends i would do moisture treatments.&lt;br /&gt;the smell will linger on your hair, no matter you do...so don&#x27;t fight it. just be grateful that the itch is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m going to try a difference anti-dandruff shampoo. i know that not every active ingredient will work for someones problems, so i still do recommend that someone tries this shampoo because it seems to have worked for lots of people.</li>
            <li> Is Excellent product, for many year used for my family, all product from Neutrogena are EXCELLENT, thanks you for made happy life, recommend 100%</li>
            <li> This shampoo helped me a lot. Works much better than the T/Sal. After 2 weeks 4 washes later, my scalp is soooo much better. Don&#x27;t forget to leave it on a few minutes, then rinse and repeat. Who cares if it smells a little like tar, I can touch my head again without pain. It leaves my hair a bit rough feeling, but a good conditioner, preferably leave in(try not to get any of your scalp)and my hair is silky soft. Try it!</li>
            <li> This product really helped me alot. I actually felt better after the the first use. It stopped the itching from the dry weather we&#x27;ve been having. I never had dry scalp issues in my life, so I was really a rookie at finding a product to use.I recommend this product .  It works great &amp; fast.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS LIKE MOTH BALLS!</li>
