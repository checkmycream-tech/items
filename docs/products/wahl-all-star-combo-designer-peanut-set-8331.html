    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for trimming necks, sideburns, and even eyebrows and ear hair, which both my husband and father have.</li>
            <li>Some of the best trimmed guys I know, if I do say so myself.</li>
            <li>Very very happy with the Designer clipper.</li>
            <li>it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and will recommend it to others...</li>
            <li>They get the job done, very good set.</li>
            <li>Great savings at the barber shop.</li>
            <li>Two great corded devices.</li>
            <li>Works great would buy again if needed too.</li>
            <li>But works great.</li>
            <li>But the Peanut is great for clildren heads its adjusted</li>
            <li>They work great</li>
            <li>Received promply 2-3 days in good shape.</li>
            <li>This is a good starter set.  </li>
            <li>works good though.</li>
            <li>so you can give them a nice hairline and neckline without the teeth biting and scaring them.</li>
            <li>Does a real nice job of trimming a full beard but bit large to drive up the schnozze!</li>
            <li>more money in my pocket.</li>
            <li>I need six more words</li>
            <li>Just make sure to brush it off well and keep it oiled between each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>From one time to the next, they&#x27;ll tell me, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s perfect, don&#x27;t change a thing.&amp;#34; Or, &amp;</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t apply to most of you who are probably barbers or hair stylists.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price and the little bonus peanut trimmer is a nice add on.  </li>
            <li>It cuts my hair and I enjoy that it cuts my hair.</li>
            <li>It cuts so smooth</li>
            <li>at the time of the purchase, clippers was $30 cheaper than sally&#x27;s beauty supply with discount which is by far the cheapest until now! !!!!!  </li>
            <li>So far we are very pleased.  </li>
            <li>are great except for the #1 attachment, it didnt click on like the rest and felt loose on the machine</li>
            <li>Instead, I use a hand and nail brush, which provides more surface area for cleaning the blades and the guides, and gets the job done much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>both come with a full set of guides.</li>
            <li>Cuts great and the little peanut tool does the edges just fine.</li>
            <li>As this is the third one for me, I knew what to expect, and these are nothing short of excellent for beard trimming, and a hair shave twice per month.</li>
            <li>As they got older, they each started to prefer a more tapered look.</li>
            <li>the peanut clipper is a great little clipper.</li>
            <li>I used this last night and it was amazing</li>
            <li>The guards from our former Wahl clippers fit better on the Designer series.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Bought three sets and didn&#x27;t get the right color as advertise.</li>
            <li>i recently bought an andis \\&quot;outliner II\\&quot; because of how many barbers use it and live by it, but i find that the peanut is better for gettin closer cuts.</li>
            <li>The peanut clipper is a little bit more noisy, but works ok.</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay MUCH more to get a better clipper but was told by a \\&quot;haircutting pro\\&quot; not to waste the money.  </li>
            <li>overall i love this set, and it is truly an ALL-STAR in my book.</li>
            <li>But with so many different blades to choose from, I can taper with just my Wahl, no scissors needed.</li>
            <li>Thx you for being reasonable your tools pricing, ive told all my coworkers about your store!</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 other brands of buzzers and so I decided to try one more because all of the rest sucked!</li>
            <li>Overall from reviews of other like products this one is the best and from the use of it so far it has lived up to it&#x27;s name</li>
            <li>The thing I liked about this kit is the other set of large clippers as well.</li>
            <li>The Designer is an okay clipper for fading it just dont get as clean and tight like Andis does.</li>
            <li>This clipper is at least as good as our first \\&quot;Racine\\&quot; clipper that lasted for 25 years.  </li>
            <li>This clipper set works very well for my purpose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a disaster, really.</li>
            <li>The peanut set that comes with this is an absolute must.</li>
            <li>Nothing much else to say.</li>
            <li>I had a different hairclipper, was not cutting my hair right.</li>
            <li>as I won&#x27;t use them often, they should last many years.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon continues to be my go-to for a lot of purchases, due to the wide variety of products, good packaging/shipping, and reliability.</li>
            <li>They also put a few redken samples in the shipping box which I thought was a very nice and personal touch on their part.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy guides as big as a size 12, and have used that size several times.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t drop it on concrete floor)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too clumsy to try using scissors for any kind of cut.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps someone make a choice thats in transition of making a new clipper purchase.</li>
            <li>#34;I think I want it a little longer/shorter this time/next time.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s hard to keep up with that many different preferences, so I keep that paper handy for reference.</li>
            <li>The peanut is actually louder than the large trimmers.</li>
            <li>odly enough the peanut is louder than the designer but it gets real close to the skin.</li>
            <li>Really wanted the white one</li>
            <li>This was by far the cheapest anywhere, even with &#x27;professional discount&#x27; that we get in the supply stores....</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>: I do notice that the dust-off brushes that come with the Wahl clippers don&#x27;t really get the job done for removing the hair, and they don&#x27;t last long anyhow.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come in white just normal red .</li>
            <li>Other than being a little noisey they work fine.</li>
            <li>The peanut electric clippers shaves you down very close to your skin like shaving.you can shave your face with it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a different hairclipper, was not cutting my hair right. someone told me about the Wahl clippers. Since I purchased the kit, I use it almost every week. Great savings at the barber shop. more money in my pocket.</li>
            <li> This clipper set works very well for my purpose. And yes I would call it a value pack. They get the job done, very good set.</li>
            <li> Other than being a little noisey they work fine. Received promply 2-3 days in good shape.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter set.  Just a note the Peanut set is corded, for some reason I thought it was cordless.</li>
            <li> Two great corded devices. Well worth the money spent. The guards from our former Wahl clippers fit better on the Designer series.</li>
            <li> Works great would buy again if needed too. Overall from reviews of other like products this one is the best and from the use of it so far it has lived up to it&#x27;s name</li>
            <li> i purchased this clipper set around christmas time and have been using them about 1-3 times a week without a problem. i paid around 100 dollars at a retail store so buying it here for around 60 is a bargain! (just wish i had known that)     the designer clipper is very quiet, friends even ask me if the machine is on when they are watching me cut hair. one thing i like about the clipper is that u can purchase face plates and personalize it to match ur style. the guide combs it comes with are great except for the #1 attachment, it didnt click on like the rest and felt loose on the machine but i have never used it since i use the \\&quot;speed-o-guide\\&quot; attachments.    the peanut clipper is a great little clipper. odly enough the peanut is louder than the designer but it gets real close to the skin. i recently bought an andis \\&quot;outliner II\\&quot; because of how many barbers use it and live by it, but i find that the peanut is better for gettin closer cuts. it comes with guide combs also but i never use them because i use the peanut as an outliner.    overall i love this set, and it is truly an ALL-STAR in my book.</li>
            <li> It cuts my hair and I enjoy that it cuts my hair. I need six more words so it cuts hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come in white just normal red . But works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using the peanut since about 1994, and this was a purchase to replace a broken one.

The thing I liked about this kit is the other set of large clippers as well. Typical Wahl quality, and as I won&#x27;t use them often, they should last many years.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon continues to be my go-to for a lot of purchases, due to the wide variety of products, good packaging/shipping, and reliability.</li>
            <li> It started out with my 5 boys, because barbershop visits are so expensive. I used to just scalp them using a #2. As they got older, they each started to prefer a more tapered look. I was able to buy guides as big as a size 12, and have used that size several times. All of my boys have gone through the longer hairstyle stage. I&#x27;m too clumsy to try using scissors for any kind of cut. It&#x27;s a disaster, really. But with so many different blades to choose from, I can taper with just my Wahl, no scissors needed. The peanut set that comes with this is an absolute must. It&#x27;s perfect for trimming necks, sideburns, and even eyebrows and ear hair, which both my husband and father have. Oh, I forgot. After I started cutting my boys&#x27; hair, my husband and dad both started asking for haircuts, too. So....every month, I line &#x27;em up and crank &#x27;em out. Some of the best trimmed guys I know, if I do say so myself. And I still consider myself a complete amateur. Even someone as untalented as me can&#x27;t go wrong with this set from Wahl. Just make sure to brush it off well and keep it oiled between each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do notice that the dust-off brushes that come with the Wahl clippers don&#x27;t really get the job done for removing the hair, and they don&#x27;t last long anyhow. Instead, I use a hand and nail brush, which provides more surface area for cleaning the blades and the guides, and gets the job done much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, if you&#x27;re cutting more than one person in the family, it&#x27;s helpful to keep a little piece of paper in your haircut caddy with the different sizes you use on each person. From one time to the next, they&#x27;ll tell me, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s perfect, don&#x27;t change a thing.&amp;#34; Or, &amp;#34;I think I want it a little longer/shorter this time/next time.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s hard to keep up with that many different preferences, so I keep that paper handy for reference. This won&#x27;t apply to most of you who are probably barbers or hair stylists. But&#x27;s it&#x27;s helpful for amateurs like me.</li>
            <li> The Designer is an okay clipper for fading it just dont get as clean and tight like Andis does.But the Peanut is great for clildren heads its adjusted just right so you can give them a nice hairline and neckline without the teeth biting and scaring them.I hope this review helps someone make a choice thats in transition of making a new clipper purchase.Also this is a well built and heavy duty product meaning it could last 15 plus years.</li>
            <li> Have used the Wahl products for years.  Amazon has the best price and the little bonus peanut trimmer is a nice add on.  both come with a full set of guides.</li>
            <li> Cuts great and the little peanut tool does the edges just fine. I wish I&#x27;d have purchased this years ago.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking I was getting what was pictured. When I received it they were not the same color. Really wanted the white one so I return it.</li>
            <li> The clipper:  My wife has been cutting my hair for 40 years.  This clipper is at least as good as our first \\&quot;Racine\\&quot; clipper that lasted for 25 years.  Subsequent purchases were all disappointing. I was willing to pay MUCH more to get a better clipper but was told by a \\&quot;haircutting pro\\&quot; not to waste the money.  So far we are very pleased.  The Peanut:  Ok. Does a real nice job of trimming a full beard but bit large to drive up the schnozze!</li>
            <li> I cut lots of hair and replace clippers often. This was by far the cheapest anywhere, even with &#x27;professional discount&#x27; that we get in the supply stores....at the time of the purchase, clippers was $30 cheaper than sally&#x27;s beauty supply with discount which is by far the cheapest until now! !!!!!  They also put a few redken samples in the shipping box which I thought was a very nice and personal touch on their part. My future clippers will defiantly will be from here! Thx you for being reasonable your tools pricing, ive told all my coworkers about your store!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Wahl! Nothing much else to say. Came with everything and works well. The peanut is actually louder than the large trimmers.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, I was wanting it white, I got it red. works good though. Just not the color I expected.</li>
            <li> Picture show white clipper but I got a brown set. Bought three sets and didn&#x27;t get the right color as advertise.</li>
            <li> The peanut electric clippers shaves you down very close to your skin like shaving.you can shave your face with it. And my wife cannot tell if I used a razor or not.</li>
            <li> I used the set a couple of times. Very very happy with the Designer clipper. It cuts hairs almost with no effort, and the noise is quite acceptable. The peanut clipper is a little bit more noisy, but works ok.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other brands of buzzers and so I decided to try one more because all of the rest sucked! I used this last night and it was amazing it only took me 10 minutes to shave my dog. It cuts so smooth I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and will recommend it to others...</li>
            <li> They work great but they came in red not white. I wanted white</li>
            <li> Actually for only having a month the trimmer is during😕 very disappointed</li>
