            <li>My fiance wanted me to get this cologne, because she found it at Bath &amp; Body works, and liked it.  </li>
            <li>i really love the smell, i even have it on antibacterial gel! :)</li>
            <li>Great body cologne that is not over the top, or too powerful.</li>
            <li>I honestly love all of the scents for the men&#x27;s at B&amp;BW.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t decided which I like better; the bottle or the body spray.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I do wish the top spray piece didn&#x27;t leak if you move it</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Love this smell , I love smelling goooood</li>
            <li>I love the scent and so does he.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong which is good, but it fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean smell which I love.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, and she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s got a more mellow smell to it that is able to be masculine without resorting to figuratively punching you in the face with brass</li>
            <li>Clean smell.</li>
            <li>This has a Fantastic fresh and clean smell for a teenager to use and is not over powering in any way.</li>
            <li>Good buy compared to if I purchased it at the actual store.  </li>
            <li>but other then the the product is great</li>
            <li>and it actually smells quite amazing as well.</li>
            <li>It smells great and fresh, NOT to heavy!</li>
            <li>It is definitely one of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>Ladies love it, however the smell does not last at all.</li>
            <li>sticking  very trying but the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance</li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute;e got the cologne, body wash, and body lotion for me for Christmas this past year, and I have to say, this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite next to the Twilight Woods.</li>
            <li>This smell is my main scent I like to smell and seems like others like it also.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is definitely worth it, if you don&#x27;t mind spraying yourself multiple times during the day to keep the scent on you.</li>
            <li>worth the price, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 20 year old son, and he loves it!</li>
            <li>I would compare this to Nautica Blue, Cool Water, and Polo Blue.</li>
            <li>I got this from the store as a set to try out something different, being a guy that buys 70 dollar colognes I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li>Ocean isn&#x27;t like other colognes because it doesn&#x27;t have that distinctly \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; scent to it (you know, like when you smell rubbing alcohol and you feel it in your eyes?)</li>
            <li>we looked at other places for this particular brand and the prices seemed to be double what we paid for it here!</li>
            <li>, she definitely buried her head a little deeper into me when cuddling hahaha</li>

            <li> It saves you a few bucks from buying it in person in store.</li>
            <li> If you blind buying or getting it as a gift, GO for it.</li>
            <li> but my girlfriend went crazy over it</li>

            <li> perfect! just as it is when in the  store.</li>
            <li> I honestly love all of the scents for the men&#x27;s at B&amp;BW. This is my second favorite next to the Twilight Woods. I bought this for my Father-in-law for Christmas and I know he&#x27;s going to love it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t decided which I like better; the bottle or the body spray. Both are excellent products! Just adhere to the &amp;#34;2 inch rule&amp;#34; and life will be good.</li>
            <li> This product smells great.  Good buy compared to if I purchased it at the actual store.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously not anything fancy.  For the price though its a good smelling cologne although after about and hour the scent dissipates and goes away.  Like i said in the title, for the money...not too shabby.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have gotten it a a lower price and still at good quality. Fantastic! hope to buy again</li>
            <li> I got this from the store as a set to try out something different, being a guy that buys 70 dollar colognes I didn&#x27;t expect much but my girlfriend went crazy over it, she definitely buried her head a little deeper into me when cuddling hahaha</li>

Ocean isn&#x27;t like other colognes because it doesn&#x27;t have that distinctly \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; scent to it (you know, like when you smell rubbing alcohol and you feel it in your eyes?), it&#x27;s got a more mellow smell to it that is able to be masculine without resorting to figuratively punching you in the face with brass knuckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, and I think you&#x27;ll really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Mucho commentos! smelling like a million bucks for less than $30 --one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..</li>
            <li> Was bought at a nice price l, cheaper then the store but I do wish the top spray piece didn&#x27;t leak if you move it but other then the the product is great</li>
            <li> I have bought this for bf a couple of times here. It saves you a few bucks from buying it in person in store. It is definitely one of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This smell is my main scent I like to smell and seems like others like it also.</li>
            <li> My fiance wanted me to get this cologne, because she found it at Bath &amp; Body works, and liked it.  It smells pretty good, and she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 20 year old son, and he loves it! Not too strong. Good scent for any man.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after smelling it at bath &amp; body works. We both loved it so I knew I had to get it for him. It&#x27;s about 10 dollars cheaper online and it&#x27;s legit. It lasts all day but its not overpowering. It&#x27;s a very clean smell which I love. I would compare this to Nautica Blue, Cool Water, and Polo Blue.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not to overwhelming. Good for day-to-day use.</li>
            <li> In store at B&amp;BW this cologne is $35, I found it online for only $20 including shipping. Absolutely great bargain. Made for a perfect gift and it actually smells quite amazing as well. Definitely best bang for your buck. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Your basic shower/light scent. If you like polo blue then you can beat this one for the price. If you blind buying or getting it as a gift, GO for it. Clean smell.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for&lt;br /&gt;years very happy with the results&lt;br /&gt;one problem is the spray nozzle&lt;br /&gt;keep sticking  very trying but the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance ok</li>
            <li> This cologne is very nice. The smell is not too strong which is good, but it fades rather quickly. For the price, it is definitely worth it, if you don&#x27;t mind spraying yourself multiple times during the day to keep the scent on you.</li>
            <li> i really love the smell, i even have it on antibacterial gel! :)</li>
            <li> we looked at other places for this particular brand and the prices seemed to be double what we paid for it here!</li>
            <li> This has a Fantastic fresh and clean smell for a teenager to use and is not over powering in any way.</li>
            <li> Love this smell , I love smelling goooood</li>
            <li> Great body cologne that is not over the top, or too powerful.</li>
            <li> Great smell no doubt about it! Ladies love it, however the smell does not last at all. If you carry it around with you and douche yourself down with it every hour the fragrance will last, if not, forget about it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend for valentines day. It is an amazing price for this product. It smells great and fresh, NOT to heavy! I love the scent and so does he. I&#x27;m definitely going to order this again soon. Maybe I&#x27;ll keep it for myself. LOL.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift for my dad and it smells great. worth the price, definitely recommend it. great gift option.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product</li>
