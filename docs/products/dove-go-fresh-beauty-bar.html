            <li> Dove is always a great clean product. I have used it my whole life:)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t tell anyone this, but my husband loves this soap.  Before I met him, he was all about the liquid soaps and shower gels.  He skin dries out really easily and he thought all bar soap made it worse.  Well of course Zest and Irish spring do, but the Dove soap is different.  The advertisements say it&#x27;s 1/4 moisturizing cream.  I don&#x27;t exactly know what that means, but I do know that my skin feels good after I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar of soap is very soft.  It doesn&#x27;t exactly melt in the shower, but there&#x27;s always a little pool of soap drippings in the soap dish.  We go through about a bar a week between the two of us.  It has a sweet but not flower smell to it. It rinses off very well.  We have super soft water and it takes me forever to rinse conditioner out of my hair.  No problems with this soap though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value on my subscribe and save order.  Oh, and don&#x27;t tell my husband I told you he loves this soap. Now if I could just steer him away from that stinky Pert shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells great and delivered very quick</li>
            <li> I received this product fast and  it was an excellent  buy. I &#x27;m happy I was able to purchase through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap/beauty bar for about 50 years. I love the mild fragrance, I love the way it does not leave a feeling on your skin, I love the fact the price has not gone up terribly much over the years. I carry slivers of it in my pocket when I travel so I don&#x27;t have to use the harsh smelling soap in the public bathroom dispensers. A tiny sliver is all you need for one hand wash, then throw it away.</li>
            <li> We have used this before and really like it.</li>
            <li> This soap smells really good. It is pretty too. I wish I could purchase in stores and not have to wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. When you open the box, it makes the whole room smell so good.</li>
            <li> Would never purchase any other brand</li>
            <li> Absolutely hated the smell. It was over-powering and gave me a headache. Had to return&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(David&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> Best value. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the toxic chemicals they use in this product! Read &amp;#34;the safe shopper&#x27;s bible&amp;#34; by dave &amp; sam epstein for more info...</li>
            <li> Cannot tolerate the smell just removing plastic ran us outta room</li>
