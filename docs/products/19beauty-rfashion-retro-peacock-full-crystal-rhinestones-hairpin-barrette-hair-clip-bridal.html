It isn&#x27;t noticeable unless you look up close, but it would be nice to have all the sparkling gems in place. This was a gift from my son and I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him about it. I didn&#x27;t realize I could go to the seller because he used my account. We&#x27;ll see what the seller can do about it.</li>
