            <li>Bought this after reading the reviews it seems ok</li>
            <li>Works great very close</li>
            <li>It feels as if they cut better.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that these are sharper than the ones that came with my trimmers, so I am glad that they are not 100%</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite trimmer blade I use.</li>
            <li>But love the crispness the blade provide sharpest blade on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a great blade...put it on my wahl hero and cuts way better highly recommend this for any wahl trimmer.</li>

            <li>Better than the original</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this blade for any Wahl you may have.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp but provide a superb outline!</li>
            <li>Perfect fit and really sharp!</li>
            <li>the cut I get is much better than when I first bought my Wahl Detailers!</li>
            <li>Line ups look sharply detailed.</li>
            <li>Great blade, replaced my standard blades on my 5 â˜† detailer after 5yrs.</li>
            <li>These fit my Hero clippers.</li>
            <li>So far this is a good replacement blade. .</li>
            <li>I use these for shaving because my face is sensitive to razors, and it the walh detailer is next best thing to shaving for me.</li>
            <li>Cuts very well and is very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>it cuts clean and close, be sure your not heavy handed because you will cut somebody, but this is a great upgrade blade from the standard detailer blade</li>
            <li>They are super sharp and a great addition to my collection...</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>quick swell all the way in the uk</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li>These blades are Very REAL!</li>
            <li>They cut pretty smooth once zero&#x27;d</li>
            <li>These are of the same or somehow better quality as original!</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust really close to get those crispy edge ups.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my trimmers!</li>
            <li>Just what i needed to get that clean, crisp line.</li>
            <li>These blades are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They are worth buying.</li>
            <li>This blade isnt worth it because you have to keep adjusting them until it gets the way you want it</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the small blade and larger blade once placed together fit perfectly</li>
            <li>and I was right.  </li>
            <li>This blade right here 1 word \\&quot;sharp\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Very nice and very sharp recommend buying it way better than standard wahl 5 star blade!!</li>
            <li>Actually I should have bought 2! :)</li>
            <li>I get a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>and you can see the crisp on the line up</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t much of a believer,But BELIEVE me!</li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone you wont be sorry that you brought this item trust me the best out there</li>
            <li>First the item was packaged well and shipping was timely.</li>
            <li>A dynamic duo love it, hey almost cut my face.  </li>
            <li>Was a very excited when I received my package and opened it up and put in on my edgers to find out two days later that it was not the appropriate head for my edgers (but did state prior to me buying the product that it was comparable) face broke out</li>
            <li>They cutter very close right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>nice product, and already even for sharp cuts</li>
            <li>Sharp, detailed and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Real and this review is real!</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp no BS, well the clipper is not that powerful as my outliner experience, but I really love this duo.  </li>
            <li>Easy to switch out and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>They are good and they are wide enough and they don&#x27;t get as hot as others do</li>
            <li>The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I only used them a handful of times even though I took very good care of my bladesk and now their dull again</li>
            <li>I highly recommended and will be buying the Seniors clippers pretty soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>is not that much wider than the one on the Hero</li>
            <li>of use with VERY acceptable results.</li>
            <li>but also you have balance both blades to able to get a sharp line.</li>
            <li>This blade makes it easier for me to trim around my son&#x27;s ears, since I&#x27;m an amateur, not a professional, and feel like I&#x27;m all thumbs when trying to hold the clipper, a comb, and hold my precious son&#x27;s precious little ear : )</li>
            <li>It saved me from having to buy a whole new set of clippers, that would havve cost me 60$.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but after the second use I applied the right amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>Just invest in a new trimmer</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>This item is pretty straight forward shipping was on time, and the blades were sharp and ready to go, even came with extra screws.</li>
            <li>If you do have sensitive skin, I would recommend that you install the blade as is.</li>
            <li>it already comes sharp right out the box you can feel the sharpness</li>

            <li> If you do have sensitive skin, I would recommend that you install the blade as is.</li>
            <li> it already comes sharp right out the box you can feel the sharpness</li>
            <li> but they are all true, I bought these with the wahl detailers and they hit, and I mean hard, be careful zero gapping these, cause they will slice i cut my arm up when they were zero gapped just testing them out, luckily i wasnt lining sombody up, cop these</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s far cheaper than some other prices reported.</li>
            <li> The cutting is crisp as I tried it right away.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t knick and cut you like the regular wide blade.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it because I have the Wahl Hero which already has a T blade and the double wide</li>
            <li> Purchased this double wide T blade to for my Wahl Heros.</li>
            <li> If the blade is too close it will cut the heck out of you, and if you move the blade down just a little bit it wont cut at all!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m highly disapointed</li>
            <li> These blades were kinda dull.. actually wish i would&#x27;ve stuck with my old ones</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this piece because I figured the wide blade would make the edge up easier to do</li>
            <li> Be careful zero-gapping because these are sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this blade for my wahl heros and the blade is extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> A little rough when removing hair on neck but</li>
            <li> Very sharp blade.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, reliable blades.</li>
            <li> got rusted less than a week of use</li>
            <li> Just zero gap because you will slice someone and as it is it cuts sharp!!</li>
            <li> Sharpest blade ever made but this is not ment for the heavy handed</li>
            <li> By far this is one of the closest cutting clipper attachments.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with wahl considering all the rave about the wahl being the hot item in the hair grooming industry.</li>
            <li> This blade on any Wahl trimmer hits hard.</li>
            <li> No happy medium.</li>
            <li> But take time have patience til they are broken in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how they do after they are broken in.</li>
            <li> If you have any wahl detailers but don&#x27;t have these, you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.  </li>

            <li> Exactly what I needed for my trimmers! Saved me money! Sally Beauty supply had this for $22! Came pretty quickly also!!! Will defiantly be buying again! Actually I should have bought 2! :)</li>
            <li> Very nice and very sharp recommend buying it way better than standard wahl 5 star blade!! Just zero gap because you will slice someone and as it is it cuts sharp!!</li>
            <li> This is a great blade...put it on my wahl hero and cuts way better highly recommend this for any wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Cuts very well and is very smooth on the skin. I would suggest adjusting the blades for zero gap to get the closest cut. You can youtube how to do this</li>
            <li> Super product great price....AAAAAA++++++++ Thx</li>
            <li> I have been clipping/shaving my head for numerous years. By far this is one of the closest cutting clipper attachments. Very pleased and will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Better than the original</li>
            <li> Sharp, detailed and easy to use. It is by far the best blade I own. The precision you get from this is second to none. Line ups look sharply detailed.</li>
            <li> Everything great.... Thanks</li>
            <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li> Awesome, my brother uses it</li>
            <li> I use these for shaving because my face is sensitive to razors, and it the walh detailer is next best thing to shaving for me. I get a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sever aftermarket trimmer blades but these are by far the best.  I tried to zero them.  Bad idea.  They cutter very close right out of the box.  All you need to do it touch and go.  If you have any wahl detailers but don&#x27;t have these, you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> this blade does make a difference</li>
            <li> It saved me from having to buy a whole new set of clippers, that would havve cost me 60$. i bought two of them.</li>
            <li> got rusted less than a week of use</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but also you have balance both blades to able to get a sharp line.</li>
            <li> Best Whal blade to use for detailers and the Hero it already comes sharp right out the box you can feel the sharpness and you can see the crisp on the line up</li>
            <li> Very good balde. It does require, if you are looking for a  close cut, some adjustments. There are many videos on YouTube that explains how to &amp;#34;zero gap&amp;#34; the blade. If you do have sensitive skin, I would recommend that you install the blade as is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Real and this review is real! When it comes to reading these reviews? If you&#x27;re anything like me!? I wasn&#x27;t much of a believer,But BELIEVE me! These blades are Very REAL! the cut I get is much better than when I first bought my Wahl Detailers! These blades are worth every penny.I plan on purchasing 1 or 2 more so I may have for future use.</li>
            <li> I only used them a handful of times even though I took very good care of my bladesk and now their dull again these are the second pair the I buy. Just invest in a new trimmer</li>
            <li> nice product, and already even for sharp cuts</li>
            <li> They cut pretty smooth once zero&#x27;d out. They don&#x27;t knick and cut you like the regular wide blade. I would give them a five but the do require readjustment every 7 or so cuts.</li>
            <li> Very low quality product. The blade stared to rust after a week.</li>
            <li> Great blades, easy to install on my G-Whiz trimmer.  Nice crisp lines!  Be careful zero-gapping because these are sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and really sharp! Just what i needed to get that clean, crisp line. Easy to switch out and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations. Disappointed with wahl considering all the rave about the wahl being the hot item in the hair grooming industry. When I brought these I zero gapped them,and if set to close they cut the skin. If they&#x27;re not set close enough they just don&#x27;t cut at satifaction. No happy medium.</li>
            <li> This blade saved my life. This is a good brand as well and you would be happy to have it in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> They are worth buying. They are good and they are wide enough and they don&#x27;t get as hot as others do</li>
            <li> Very sharp blade. Great replacement. Really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
            <li> Great outlined. Better than Andis T outliner. A little rough when removing hair on neck but otherwise a great machine. Must add the t-wide blade.</li>
            <li> This was a great blade. Been using it for a while now. But you have to use the blade a couple times and really figure out how to get the best cut.</li>
            <li> So far this is a good replacement blade. . I own many trimmers and this one seems to shave close than most,  This fits just as well as the blade from the factory and it&#x27;s far cheaper than some other prices reported. Be sure to oil the blade after each use to maximize effectiveness. The review is based on the product and not the prices (which change constantly on Amazon) so overall I really like this.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty straight forward shipping was on time, and the blades were sharp and ready to go, even came with extra screws.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp but provide a superb outline! I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this product for the price!</li>
            <li> Very good outliner blades,works wonders!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great produvt</li>
            <li> these blades are the bomb!!!!!!!!!you mou</li>
            <li> Sharpest blade ever made but this is not ment for the heavy handed</li>
            <li> This replacement was a Perfect fit!! Couldn&#x27;t wait to get back to work and use them! I Will order them again!</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to do!</li>
            <li> I zero gapped these and wow! I cut the h*ll out of my neck! They are super sharp and a great addition to my collection... I have the Hero&#x27;s, Detailer&#x27;s &amp; 2 pair of outlines... Only been using Wahl.. Wonder if Andis Zero Gapper will work for these? Great buy just have to get used to them or try ungapped...</li>
            <li> great product !!! would recommend to anyone you wont be sorry that you brought this item trust me the best out there</li>
            <li> Like this blade a lot for edge ups</li>
            <li> This blade isnt worth it because you have to keep adjusting them until it gets the way you want it and it STILL won&#x27;t cut to satisfaction. If the blade is too close it will cut the heck out of you, and if you move the blade down just a little bit it wont cut at all!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m highly disapointed</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading the reviews it seems ok but I haven&#x27;t used it because I have the Wahl Hero which already has a T blade and the double wide is not that much wider than the one on the Hero</li>
            <li> These blades are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> works great!! Appreciate the expedite service</li>
            <li> Works great very close</li>
            <li> Replacing was a breeze. It feels as if they cut better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this piece because I figured the wide blade would make the edge up easier to do and I was right.  First the item was packaged well and shipping was timely. I also noticed that the small blade and larger blade once placed together fit perfectly I did not have to do any adjusting( you still can if you know how but not neccessary). The cutting is crisp as I tried it right away. Very pleased with this item from Wahl! I highly recommended and will be buying the Seniors clippers pretty soon.</li>
            <li> Was a very excited when I received my package and opened it up and put in on my edgers to find out two days later that it was not the appropriate head for my edgers (but did state prior to me buying the product that it was comparable) face broke out and I cleaned them again and oil and did the same thing again. I will not use these things ever again, I would recommend replacing your entire edger</li>
            <li> Purchased this double wide T blade to for my Wahl Heros. I have the blade setter that came with my Heros but I didn&#x27;t have to set these at all. They came in almost zero gapped once I put these on my trimmers. However, I noticed that these are sharper than the ones that came with my trimmers, so I am glad that they are not 100% zero gapped if they cut or nick someone when giving a edge up.</li>
            <li> Great blade, replaced my standard blades on my 5 â˜† detailer after 5yrs. of use with VERY acceptable results. These are of the same or somehow better quality as original! Very sharp, reliable blades. You cant go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> This blade right here 1 word \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; it cuts clean and close, be sure your not heavy handed because you will cut somebody, but this is a great upgrade blade from the standard detailer blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow IG: Moblie_cutz</li>
            <li> A dynamic duo love it, hey almost cut my face.  The blade is sharp no BS, well the clipper is not that powerful as my outliner experience, but I really love this duo.  I invited you to purchase the dynamic duo .</li>
            <li> These blades were kinda dull.. actually wish i would&#x27;ve stuck with my old ones</li>
            <li> These blades take time to break in. I put them on my Wahl hero Nd these things cut sooooo good. I&#x27;m amazed, honestly. But take time have patience til they are broken in. keep em oiled before every use. You&#x27;ll be amazed .</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite trimmer blade I use. I put this blade on any and every Wahl trimmer I have. Easy to adjust really close to get those crispy edge ups. This blade on any Wahl trimmer hits hard. I strongly recommend this blade for any Wahl you may have.</li>
            <li> I bought this blade for my wahl heros and the blade is extremely sharp. Slice myself 1st use, but after the second use I applied the right amount of pressure. Gotta break these blades in. But love the crispness the blade provide sharpest blade on the market. I can&#x27;t wait to see how they do after they are broken in. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> good quality strong blade very impressed, did exactly as i expected it to . got to me quick swell all the way in the uk</li>
            <li> I honestly thought all the reviews were just hype but they are all true, I bought these with the wahl detailers and they hit, and I mean hard, be careful zero gapping these, cause they will slice i cut my arm up when they were zero gapped just testing them out, luckily i wasnt lining sombody up, cop these</li>
            <li> These fit my Hero clippers. This blade makes it easier for me to trim around my son&#x27;s ears, since I&#x27;m an amateur, not a professional, and feel like I&#x27;m all thumbs when trying to hold the clipper, a comb, and hold my precious son&#x27;s precious little ear : )</li>
