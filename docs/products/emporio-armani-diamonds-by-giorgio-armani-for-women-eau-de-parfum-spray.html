            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>A very nice scent and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a very nice sexy scent for the evening.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m reunited with my true love</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite perfume I&#x27;ve ever had&#x3D; Armani Diamonds for women!</li>
            <li>It is very feminine, althought after 3 or 4 hours you can&#x27;t feel it that much, unless you pour a ton of it all over yourself, including clothes, lol.</li>
            <li>This perfume is light and sensual.  </li>
            <li>It is still nice, but not what I really wanted.</li>
            <li>I did very well 100% effective, I recommend</li>
            <li>I wish I could rate this fragrance higher because I LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>she liked it and excited for a big bottle.</li>
            <li>This perfume is original, smells exactly like the one I bought from the store.</li>
            <li>I also Emporio Armani Intense, now if I can find that as well!!</li>
            <li>Thank you everyone for your thoughts as it helped me make the right choice.</li>
            <li>The spray is not as strong as it use to be....time to find a new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I originally came across it while sampling perfumes in a department store for one to buy, I was between this and one other kind and ended up choosing this one.</li>
            <li>Loved it, identical to my previous purchase from Giorgio Armani.</li>
            <li>I use 2 pumps in the morning and that is more than a enough!</li>
            <li>Item was $12.00 higher than the Invoiced pricing</li>
            <li>However I did not purchase the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>last more than two hours.</li>
            <li>I am a perfume fanatic and just love love this one..  </li>
            <li>One would think that the numerous high ratings for the perfume would cause the company to rethink its strategy, but there must be more to the story than has to-date been revealed.</li>
            <li>like I said before, very feminine, and this one man I know loves it when I&#x27;m wearing it, so</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>so it might be discontinued or something, but very glad I can still find it online at least.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, I suspect it will last for the next 10 years or so.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li>This product is identical to the bottle I purchased at a high end department store but the price was a considerable savings.</li>
            <li>My original bottle was a white bottle, and the one I received from Amazon was an off white color.  </li>
            <li>Surprised that Armani has stopped producing it, but there are ample sources of it still.</li>
            <li>No difference between the ones they previously sold at a fragrance department or this fragrance sold on amazon, I was actually pretty  scared that it would be a rip off, but</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, it has become increasingly hard to find,  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sad this product is discontinued.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scent dissipates within an hour or two of applying it and &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; the fragrance isn&#x27;t an option since the lotion is no where to be found on the internet or discount stores that might still carry this discontinued scent.</li>
            <li> It must be fake, that&#x27;s why it dosn&#x27;t</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> got it for my sis. she liked it and excited for a big bottle. she love it, but i don&#x27;t like the smell. of course she had it before.</li>
            <li> I really love this Fragance !</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my lady. She loves this perfume and now has added it to lineup. ff the reviews of others I made this purchase. Thank you everyone for your thoughts as it helped me make the right choice. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought it recently and I think it is a nice perfume. I got a compliment yesterday. But I am not sure if it lasts for longer than 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s my go to perfume. And everyone I come in contact with loves how it smells on me.</li>
            <li> A really nice scent, I think it was her favorite gift of all this year. Packed and shipped promptly, everything just as promised!</li>
            <li> I get a lot ofcompliments from women whenever I&#x27;m wearing this perfume. It is very feminine, althought after 3 or 4 hours you can&#x27;t feel it that much, unless you pour a ton of it all over yourself, including clothes, lol. But it smells great, like I said before, very feminine, and this one man I know loves it when I&#x27;m wearing it, so I guess it should be somewhat men&#x27;s taste.</li>
            <li> This really is the best for my skin. I love the fragrance and it lasts a long, long time. People have commented each time I wear it!</li>
            <li> I just realized that I did not receive the product that I ordered, but a different scent.  I thought that I had received an inferior knockoff product and just now realize that I was sent the wrong item by Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This perfume is light and sensual.  The cent is not offensive at all.  I am a perfume fanatic and just love love this one..  You won&#x27;t regret buying it and the prices is perfect.</li>
            <li> The spray is not as strong as it use to be....time to find a new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I have to use double the amount, and even then it wears off too soon.</li>
            <li> This is a nice perfume. I often receive compliments when I wear it. I was a bit disappointed though, as I am a real fan of patchouli and this was listed as having a patchouli base and I just don&#x27;t smell it. It is still nice, but not what I really wanted.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent and I always get compliments wearing it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love this scent!  😊  It makes me want to have sex with myself.  Ha ha</li>
            <li> Why wife loves this perfume and gets constant praises for it. And I get her love for making sure she has an ample supply. Surprised that Armani has stopped producing it, but there are ample sources of it still. I&#x27;ll have to buy a lot of the remaining supply before it dries up. One would think that the numerous high ratings for the perfume would cause the company to rethink its strategy, but there must be more to the story than has to-date been revealed. After all, in the end it&#x27;s all about money.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it&#x27;s my summer scent and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it. Also very pleased with the price on Amazon. Elsewhere it much more pricey.</li>
            <li> I get many complements on this perfume! It was a gift and it&#x27;s not something I would pick for myself, but it is nice! The thing I love the most is that it lasts all day! It is definitely on the heavier side in term of it&#x27;s scent tones, but it is not overpowering. I use 2 pumps in the morning and that is more than a enough! I noticed vanilla, cedar flora, and amber tones in this. The bottle itself is beautiful and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a cap that I will misplace. Overall, a very nice sexy scent for the evening.</li>
            <li> This perfume is original, smells exactly like the one I bought from the store. It&#x27;s sad this product is discontinued. If you appreciate this perfume you should not wait and buy it now, before Amazon runs out of it. You cannot find it in stores anymore!</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume several years and always get compliments.  However, it has become increasingly hard to find,  I do hope it is not being discontinued1</li>
            <li> The smell is great and very potent. The bottle is huge, I suspect it will last for the next 10 years or so. haha</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite perfume I&#x27;ve ever had&#x3D; Armani Diamonds for women! I originally came across it while sampling perfumes in a department store for one to buy, I was between this and one other kind and ended up choosing this one. Now that I&#x27;m in love with it, I cant find it in store anymore so it might be discontinued or something, but very glad I can still find it online at least. 100 % Worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate this fragrance higher because I LOVE the scent. Unfortunately, the scent dissipates within an hour or two of applying it and &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; the fragrance isn&#x27;t an option since the lotion is no where to be found on the internet or discount stores that might still carry this discontinued scent.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere else. Love this cologne!</li>
            <li> Good price, good size, best price for the size I  can say, wife loves it and I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> She liked it and I liked it on her.  A very nice scent and a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ll be buying it for here again.</li>
            <li> Item was $12.00 higher than the Invoiced pricing</li>
            <li> I love it, I have been wearing this perfume over&lt;br /&gt;five years ago and when the department store stop selling it, I was devastated, I tried to find something close to it (I love the sweet smell!!!) I found a perfume that was ok but something was missing, when I found Emporio Armani my heart skip a beat and now I&#x27;m reunited with my true love I also Emporio Armani Intense, now if I can find that as well!!</li>
            <li> COULDN&#x27;T FIND IN THE STORE AND HERE IT WAS! I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND IT!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT AND I WILL LOOK FOR MORE THERE</li>
            <li> I did very well 100% effective, I recommend</li>
            <li> Perfume was to my house in time for the holiday.  Everything was perfect for the holidays because you cannot find this in the stores.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, its smells amazing!!! No difference between the ones they previously sold at a fragrance department or this fragrance sold on amazon, I was actually pretty  scared that it would be a rip off, but nope! :) very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Same great fragrance as before! I&#x27;m glad to have found it, it&#x27;s my favorite still and has been for years!</li>
            <li> Loved it, identical to my previous purchase from Giorgio Armani. This is my when I&#x27;m stepping out fragrance. Definitely a head spinner.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s best spray ever for the last 7 years !</li>
            <li> BEST FRAGRANCE ON EARTH!! CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT.  I RECEIVE NOTHING BUT COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR IT. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This product is identical to the bottle I purchased at a high end department store but the price was a considerable savings. I will be buying through here again.</li>
            <li> It smells the same.  The only difference was the color of the bottle.  My original bottle was a white bottle, and the one I received from Amazon was an off white color.  However I did not purchase the first bottle.  It was given to me as a gift and I fell in love with it.  Overall I don&#x27;t see any difference and I will re-purchase another bottle from amazon when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> It must be fake, that&#x27;s why it dosn&#x27;t last more than two hours. This perfume is discontinued.  I had bought one before recently and the same happened to me.</li>
