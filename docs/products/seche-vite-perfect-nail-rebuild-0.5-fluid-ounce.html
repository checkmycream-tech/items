            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item that helps splitting nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the reviews were great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>hole line is great my nails are healing now</li>
            <li>one use great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use the $1 basecoat from the drug store and have great nails, than this.</li>
            <li>I find the quality to be so much better, and the rebuild worked great!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome my nails are strong and don&#x27;t chip</li>
            <li>helps rebuild nail strength, good under polish or by itself.</li>
            <li>As you apply additional coats a milky cast appears but still looks good.</li>
            <li>My nails have never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>If anything I feel like it made my nails chip even more!</li>
            <li>Has a strong odor, but works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, one of the nails that split was growing in whole.  </li>
            <li>I used the product twice and liked it</li>
            <li>This product was surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>Would be most effective for peeling nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think you would be surprised just what a great product this is ,It does work!</li>
            <li>but it works quicker and more effectively for strong nails.</li>
            <li>I love both of these products-</li>
            <li>but like this better.</li>
            <li>I love all the seche vite products.</li>
            <li>your nails will love you.</li>
            <li>However, it does make some polishes more susceptible to peeling.</li>
            <li>That seems to have more to do with the polish brand than Seche, as it does not happen every time.</li>
            <li>My nails peel and break MORe with this</li>
            <li>I love the Seche line of polish.  </li>
            <li>thought I was ordering top coat which I love and these people</li>
            <li>I have used Seche Vite and love it and figured I would try this.</li>
            <li>have tried OPI&#x27;s nail strengthener and this is SO much better.</li>
            <li>and my nails have NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li>its better to take biotin or something else because this still doesnt allow your nails to breathe.</li>
            <li>In fact, I am wondering if it is making my nails peel even more.  </li>
            <li>so deffinetly keep it safe</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my nails, protects them and strengthens them.</li>
            <li>Love this product and just bought another bottle.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product, does what it says... adds some thickness to your nail.  </li>
            <li>I keep them healthy and strong</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and I love the semi-gloss finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of nail products and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found that helps keep my nails long and strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I received it really quickly and it has made my nails so strong.  </li>
            <li>it is great for soft nails</li>
            <li>Both the rebuilder and the top coat are FANTASTIC products.</li>
            <li>but I do know on my nails it peels off easily.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important</li>
            <li>I can only find it on amazon.com and for a great price also.</li>
            <li>product is great for fragile nails.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to also keep the cuticles soft by using a good cuticle oil.</li>
            <li>: the white tint looks like a manicure or shellac (pretty!), makes nails stronger but not too strong, doesn&#x27;t burn or hurt, goes on easy, looks great and DOES strengthen nails.</li>
            <li>I just got this today, and was so excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>Mine came packaged in the original box, with no damage.</li>
            <li>Polish lasts so much longer with this top coat.</li>
            <li>I used this for a good 4 months religiously.</li>
            <li>apply 2 coats of colored polish, followed by sheche vite top coat,  the NEXT day apply another coat of set vite  top coat.  </li>
            <li>When I took my top coat off to put on a new layer of the REBUILD, AS THEY INSTRUCT, I saw another of my nails had begun peeling beneath the polish.</li>
            <li>but it does really make them strong</li>
            <li>My nails are now very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Rebuild leaves a light, translucent, shiny coat on your nails.  </li>
            <li>With that said, Quimica seems to have more of it because it is much easier to have sore nails from putting too much on</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if getting a refund on a $5 bottle of toxic polish is worth the bother when you have to pay $2.oo</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>&quot; I was expecting it to be a clear top coat.</li>
            <li>This one was not the right one for me.</li>
            <li>I put any old top coat on 1x day for 4 days, I would get same or better results.</li>
            <li>polish dries quickly and is very protected.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, when purchasing a base coat, you need to find the one that works best with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li>However, Quimica is more likely to &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks, Seche!  </li>
            <li>It LQQKS really pretty</li>
            <li>The seller sent me another bottle and this one was packaged exactly as the first.</li>
            <li>It peels off after my hands get in hot water.</li>
            <li>First of all it says to apply it up to twice a day.</li>
            <li>Seche&#x27;s light white tint is gorgeous, and still works, but not as well (less formaldehyde?).  </li>
            <li>this product does do exactly what it claims to do &#x27;rebuild&#x27; your nails to strong healthy hard nails.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about a month and can see a difference in how strong my nail have become.  </li>
            <li>I change up my manis every day and use pure acetone to remove my nail polish</li>
            <li>Studies have found formaldehyde to cause cancer, but it really does strengthen and improve nails, so that is a decision each person has to make for themselves.  </li>
            <li>At this point, though, I decided to take the Rebuild off for a while, because I was using too much polish remover, albeit non-acetone.  </li>
            <li>Item as described, fast delivery, would purchase again</li>
            <li>It really works if you use it consistantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very thing nails that never grew because of peeling and breaking.</li>
            <li>After using this product they are growing and much stronger.</li>
            <li>Everyone compliments my longer stronger nails and now my mom wants a bottle.</li>
            <li>My nails are very thing and brittle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brands Rebuild and fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li>I have dry brittle nails that split and break easily.</li>
            <li>The first two applications, one a day, look quite clear and have a shine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use fake nails, so for strengthening super soft nails, Seche may be the better option because Quimica is too strong.</li>
            <li>It may be too soon to tell but they do seem to be a bit better and are peeling less.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I clean my nails and dry them and wipe them with alcohol or acetone before application</li>
            <li>Great for troubled nails, splitting, peeling etc.</li>
            <li>I am trying to get a refund and/or a new bottle of it, but until I do, this review will be here for</li>
            <li>but the bottle is very sensitive to breaks.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other similar products and always settled for less-than-desirable results.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product!  </li>
            <li>This product is the first one after trying several that works.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t peel off like many other similar products.  </li>
            <li>I have never had natural nails as long as I have right now.</li>
            <li>nails used to crack on the side way above the quick - haven&#x27;t had that issue since starting to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, does that mean that since I live in Ohio the cancer thing is null and void?</li>
            <li>I have not had success in the past with any of the other products I have tried, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>It comes in 3 different strengths and i bought the most concentrated and would just use it once a week (not every other day as the product company suggests)...as it can tend to make your nails so hard they become brittle so go easy on the amount of times u use it.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of the product and have used it on its own in hopes that it helps rebuild the strength of my nails, but as a base coat, it wasn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
            <li>The nails were growing, and even without the Rebuild they had a soft shine.  </li>
            <li>I looked where I keep my nail polish and sure enough the second bottle broke, same as the last, around the neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am using Seche Natural, not Rebuild, but I imagine they are quite similar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my nails are no longer soft and brittle.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive nails tha break and split and never hold polish.</li>
            <li>(I am really rough on my nails though!), and it seems that I am using more of this nail polish than other polishes.  </li>
            <li>I love the THEORY of this product, because my nails always get that tiny tear in the corner, and in the past, they&#x27;ve peeled a lot.</li>
            <li>After three weeks, two of the nails were whole, and the healthier nails were long.  </li>
            <li>I had this polish on my nightstand and placed another nail polish next to it and touched the &amp;#34; Rebuild&amp;#34; bottle moderately, not hard though and the &amp;#34; Rebuild&amp;#34; one cracked</li>
            <li>After two days, the nail polish seems to separate from my nail (peel off), which is possibly from chewing them or putting too much on, but might also be from the actual nail polish and it is something</li>
            <li>they are my top 2 nail strengtheners, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with either, but it really depends on what you are looking for in a polish.</li>
            <li>In the reviews and specs it says you can use it under other polishes but for me it peels off on some nails after the first day.</li>
            <li>Apparently... You have to follow the directions to a t!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product I thought it was going to work amazingly, I was wrong.</li>
            <li>Also have seen a vast reduction in the amount of peeling that happens - which used to be frequent.  </li>
            <li>using this product totally restored my nails as they were when i was 20 years old.</li>
            <li>It barely stayed on for two days and would peel at the edges, taking layers of my nail off with it.</li>
            <li>The very next day after I put it on, I noticed that my polish (over top, I used this as a base coat) had chipped off and shortly afterwards, I noticed the top layer of the nail itself was starting to peel.</li>
            <li>Also, 3 nails split down the middle, the result of using too much acetone based polish remover.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, Quimica is more likely to &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks, Seche!  </li>
            <li> It LQQKS really pretty</li>
            <li> The seller sent me another bottle and this one was packaged exactly as the first.</li>
            <li> It peels off after my hands get in hot water.</li>
            <li> First of all it says to apply it up to twice a day.</li>
            <li> Seche&#x27;s light white tint is gorgeous, and still works, but not as well (less formaldehyde?).  </li>
            <li> this product does do exactly what it claims to do &#x27;rebuild&#x27; your nails to strong healthy hard nails.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month and can see a difference in how strong my nail have become.  </li>
            <li> I change up my manis every day and use pure acetone to remove my nail polish</li>
            <li> Studies have found formaldehyde to cause cancer, but it really does strengthen and improve nails, so that is a decision each person has to make for themselves.  </li>
            <li> At this point, though, I decided to take the Rebuild off for a while, because I was using too much polish remover, albeit non-acetone.  </li>
            <li> Item as described, fast delivery, would purchase again</li>
            <li> It really works if you use it consistantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very thing nails that never grew because of peeling and breaking.</li>
            <li> After using this product they are growing and much stronger.</li>
            <li> Everyone compliments my longer stronger nails and now my mom wants a bottle.</li>
            <li> My nails are very thing and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brands Rebuild and fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li> I have dry brittle nails that split and break easily.</li>
            <li> The first two applications, one a day, look quite clear and have a shine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use fake nails, so for strengthening super soft nails, Seche may be the better option because Quimica is too strong.</li>
            <li> It may be too soon to tell but they do seem to be a bit better and are peeling less.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I clean my nails and dry them and wipe them with alcohol or acetone before application</li>
            <li> Great for troubled nails, splitting, peeling etc.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get a refund and/or a new bottle of it, but until I do, this review will be here for</li>
            <li> but the bottle is very sensitive to breaks.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other similar products and always settled for less-than-desirable results.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product!  </li>
            <li> This product is the first one after trying several that works.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t peel off like many other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I have never had natural nails as long as I have right now.</li>
            <li> nails used to crack on the side way above the quick - haven&#x27;t had that issue since starting to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, does that mean that since I live in Ohio the cancer thing is null and void?</li>
            <li> I have not had success in the past with any of the other products I have tried, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> It comes in 3 different strengths and i bought the most concentrated and would just use it once a week (not every other day as the product company suggests)...as it can tend to make your nails so hard they become brittle so go easy on the amount of times u use it.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of the product and have used it on its own in hopes that it helps rebuild the strength of my nails, but as a base coat, it wasn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
            <li> The nails were growing, and even without the Rebuild they had a soft shine.  </li>
            <li> I looked where I keep my nail polish and sure enough the second bottle broke, same as the last, around the neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am using Seche Natural, not Rebuild, but I imagine they are quite similar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my nails are no longer soft and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive nails tha break and split and never hold polish.</li>
            <li> (I am really rough on my nails though!), and it seems that I am using more of this nail polish than other polishes.  </li>
            <li> I love the THEORY of this product, because my nails always get that tiny tear in the corner, and in the past, they&#x27;ve peeled a lot.</li>
            <li> After three weeks, two of the nails were whole, and the healthier nails were long.  </li>
            <li> I had this polish on my nightstand and placed another nail polish next to it and touched the &amp;#34; Rebuild&amp;#34; bottle moderately, not hard though and the &amp;#34; Rebuild&amp;#34; one cracked</li>
            <li> After two days, the nail polish seems to separate from my nail (peel off), which is possibly from chewing them or putting too much on, but might also be from the actual nail polish and it is something</li>
            <li> they are my top 2 nail strengtheners, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with either, but it really depends on what you are looking for in a polish.</li>
            <li> In the reviews and specs it says you can use it under other polishes but for me it peels off on some nails after the first day.</li>
            <li> Apparently... You have to follow the directions to a t!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product I thought it was going to work amazingly, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Also have seen a vast reduction in the amount of peeling that happens - which used to be frequent.  </li>
            <li> using this product totally restored my nails as they were when i was 20 years old.</li>
            <li> It barely stayed on for two days and would peel at the edges, taking layers of my nail off with it.</li>
            <li> The very next day after I put it on, I noticed that my polish (over top, I used this as a base coat) had chipped off and shortly afterwards, I noticed the top layer of the nail itself was starting to peel.</li>
            <li> Also, 3 nails split down the middle, the result of using too much acetone based polish remover.  </li>
            <li> I apply two coats initially and one coat each day and usually will strip it and start new every 4 days as it starts to peel/flake.</li>
            <li> but they were flaky and i was unable to keep them a decent length as they would just flake and start to peel at the ends at a certain point...</li>
            <li> They are truly strengthened and long.</li>
            <li> It helps my nails grow and stay long, I&#x27;ve tried the Retain</li>
            <li> People often think I have acrylics because my nails are almost always long.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m in need of a good base coat.</li>
            <li> , the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> However, NONE of the nails which previously split are splitting, and once I put this back on, the peeling stopped.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product without very high expectations because nothing else I have ever tried helped my thin peeling fingernails.  </li>
            <li> my nails if I put too much on or my nail is too thin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I decided not to send the product back, \\&quot;Rebuild\\&quot; just sat on my nite table for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only top coat and base I use.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it has a cloudy look and not clear.</li>
            <li> To get extremely hard/strong nails, Quimica is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, which is very disappointing because I love Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Some of my nails started peeling, and I had to file them down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this countless times with other polishes and no bottle has ever broken on me, and for no reason I can come up with either.</li>
            <li> so I am a little disppointed.</li>
            <li> Recently I had acrylic nails removed and as you may know, that leaves your natural nails in bad shape.  </li>
            <li> I wrecked my cuticles, and so the nails peel, break, and grow in unevenly.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if the uneven nails will grow well.  </li>
            <li> but this is a waste for me.</li>
            <li> it says you have to put on like two coats like everyday.</li>
            <li> It peels after a few days but noticeable stronger nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails that start to curl the second they grow, this doesn&#x27;t stop that all together</li>
            <li> Waste of my money</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only base coat that keeps my nails from peeling and breaking off.  </li>
            <li> I carefully opened the package and the bottle was broken and the contents all over the package.</li>
            <li> After using for the past month, my nails are stronger and longer than before.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has very thin fragile nails, but you must follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> It only works while you are wearing it, and you need to reapply daily, and makes a crappy base coat for polish.</li>
            <li> It stays on forever, and sometimes even make my nails too hard.</li>
            <li> Seche Rebuild loses 1 star for the formaldehyde, but gets 4 stars for performance.</li>
            <li> (my job is tough on nail polish, so I was taking this off a lot).</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and split.  </li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin</li>
            <li> My nails were not paper thin...</li>
            <li> I have really thin nails that chip and peel all the time.</li>
            <li> nails were looking really bad, so I broke down, and opened the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This formula strengthens my very weak, ridged nails.</li>
            <li> would not let me return wrong item</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> Later that night I smelled that awful smell again.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Spilled into box, unable to use, you could smell the product when you opened the box, I am trying to get a refund.</li>
            <li> As someone who paints their nails often, it&#x27;s tedious to use as directed</li>
            <li> I am amazed how well my nails look after using this three times a week ,my nails were breaking ,very thin and since I have been using this they have become stronger and are growing .I</li>
            <li> The smell emanating from the mailbox was really bad.</li>
            <li> as base coat, use 2 coats.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to use as a base coat</li>
            <li> I use along with another base coat and notice my nail polish lasts longer when I do keep my nail polish on for a week</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this as a base coat when I do a color manicure.</li>
            <li> I am displeased with the performance of this base coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with OPI&#x27;s nail strengthening base coat.</li>
            <li> There was a review here that did say you could use it as a base coat, but I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend that.  </li>
            <li> I am very angry!</li>
            <li> My nails have been in awful shape for years.</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> The packaging was clearly terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seche Vite Rebuild likes: the white tint looks like a manicure or shellac (pretty!), makes nails stronger but not too strong, doesn&#x27;t burn or hurt, goes on easy, looks great and DOES strengthen nails. Would be most effective for peeling nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite Rebuild dislikes: instructions- paint nails, apply daily, remove weekly, and repeat, (that is a lot of work!), the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on very long (I am really rough on my nails though!), and it seems that I am using more of this nail polish than other polishes.  After two days, the nail polish seems to separate from my nail (peel off), which is possibly from chewing them or putting too much on, but might also be from the actual nail polish and it is something I dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite vs. Quimica Alemana: To get extremely hard/strong nails, Quimica is the way to go.  However, Quimica is more likely to &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my nails if I put too much on or my nail is too thin.  It stays on forever, and sometimes even make my nails too hard. Some people are horrified at the thought of a formaldehyde containing nail polish.  Studies have found formaldehyde to cause cancer, but it really does strengthen and improve nails, so that is a decision each person has to make for themselves.  With that said, Quimica seems to have more of it because it is much easier to have sore nails from putting too much on but it works quicker and more effectively for strong nails. Seche&#x27;s light white tint is gorgeous, and still works, but not as well (less formaldehyde?).  I don&#x27;t use fake nails, so for strengthening super soft nails, Seche may be the better option because Quimica is too strong. I love both of these products- they are my top 2 nail strengtheners, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with either, but it really depends on what you are looking for in a polish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works to grow/rebuild nails but I do know on my nails it peels off easily. In the reviews and specs it says you can use it under other polishes but for me it peels off on some nails after the first day. I am a picker and rehabilitated nail biter so the peeling is unacceptable for me. I had high hopes for this so I am a little disppointed. I clean my nails and dry them and wipe them with alcohol or acetone before application and it still peels. I will keep trying and applying until the bottle is gone but I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I could go on &amp; on and try to describe the results of Seche Perfect Nail Rebuild.  But simply said \\&quot;it is the BEST\\&quot;.  I have tried so many other similar products and always settled for less-than-desirable results.  Recently I had acrylic nails removed and as you may know, that leaves your natural nails in bad shape.  Seche nail rebuild is wonderful to use in this circumstance.  And always makes a perfect base/top coat!!  Thanks, Seche!  Great product.</li>
            <li> This Nail Rebuild is great. I have never had natural nails as long as I have right now. They are truly strengthened and long.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it is a very good price with good delivery.I will purchase it again if it is on sale.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and was so excited to use it.  I opened the box, and what was staring me in the face?&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Great! NO THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the vendor was gracious enough to offer to take back the product.  However, I don&#x27;t know if getting a refund on a $5 bottle of toxic polish is worth the bother when you have to pay $2.oo (AGAIN) for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;********************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Review&lt;br /&gt;Since I decided not to send the product back, \\&quot;Rebuild\\&quot; just sat on my nite table for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;My nails were looking really bad, so I broke down, and opened the bottle.  It didn&#x27;t smell too bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got 3 coats on now, and let me tell you!! THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;The split nail I had is patched up, so it doesn&#x27;t tear my hair out.  My nails are now very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Rebuild leaves a light, translucent, shiny coat on your nails.  It LQQKS really pretty and natural.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m changing my rating from 1 to 4 stars.  Seche Rebuild loses 1 star for the formaldehyde, but gets 4 stars for performance.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It helps my nails grow and stay long, I&#x27;ve tried the Retain but like this better. I have nails that peel and almost always have polish or wraps on them so it&#x27;s important I keep them healthy and strong so they don&#x27;t break. I&#x27;ve tried tons of nail products and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found that helps keep my nails long and strong. People often think I have acrylics because my nails are almost always long. I highly recommend this brands Rebuild and fast dry top coat. It&#x27;s the only top coat and base I use. Also if you swipe rubbing alcohol on your nails before painting then your polish will last a lot longer. Especially people with oily nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I actually had a bottle for a couple of years, but had given up on my nails. When I read the reviews here, I decided to try it.  My nails have been in awful shape for years. I wrecked my cuticles, and so the nails peel, break, and grow in unevenly. Also, 3 nails split down the middle, the result of using too much acetone based polish remover.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles, so I decided to give this a month.  Within a week, there was a difference.  The nails were growing, and even without the Rebuild they had a soft shine.  Best of all, one of the nails that split was growing in whole.  After three weeks, two of the nails were whole, and the healthier nails were long.  At this point, though, I decided to take the Rebuild off for a while, because I was using too much polish remover, albeit non-acetone.  (my job is tough on nail polish, so I was taking this off a lot). I wanted to give the nails a chance to breathe, and to try something else.  This is when I discovered the only drawback to this product, and the reason I took off a star.  You have to keep using it.  Some of my nails started peeling, and I had to file them down. However, NONE of the nails which previously split are splitting, and once I put this back on, the peeling stopped.  Time will tell if the uneven nails will grow well.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this.  My recommendation is to also keep the cuticles soft by using a good cuticle oil. Give this a try.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product,fast shipping with good service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I received it really quickly and it has made my nails so strong.  I love all the seche vite products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  don&#x27;t use as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apply as base coat, use 2 coats.  apply 2 coats of colored polish, followed by sheche vite top coat,  the NEXT day apply another coat of set vite  top coat.  my mani&#x27;s always last me 10+ days without chipping.  and i do a lot of housework.  always use a cuticle oil at night,  if you don&#x27;t have, you can use coconut oil or vaseline.  your nails will love you.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome my nails are strong and don&#x27;t chip anymore👌</li>
            <li> This formula strengthens my very weak, ridged nails. I put it on before every manicure. However, it does make some polishes more susceptible to peeling. That seems to have more to do with the polish brand than Seche, as it does not happen every time. Definitely worth the money. Has a strong odor, but works great.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how well my nails look after using this three times a week ,my nails were breaking ,very thin and since I have been using this they have become stronger and are growing .I use this 3 times a week you could wear this alone by the way almost looks like a French manicure or with a color over it .My suggestion is read the directions well and I think you would be surprised just what a great product this is ,It does work!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my nails at all!</li>
            <li> My nails peel and break MORe with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read directions- they want you to apply every day for 4 days, then remove and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I put any old top coat on 1x day for 4 days, I would get same or better results.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast delivery, would purchase again</li>
            <li> I love the Seche line of polish.  I find the quality to be so much better, and the rebuild worked great!  I have not had success in the past with any of the other products I have tried, and I have tried many.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great item that helps splitting nails. It really works if you use it consistantly. I can only find it on amazon.com and for a great price also. I love it!</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger and healthier</li>
            <li> I like it. Works well for me! Mine came packaged in the original box, with no damage.</li>
            <li> thought I was ordering top coat which I love and these people would not let me return wrong item</li>
            <li> Great for troubled nails, splitting, peeling etc. helps rebuild nail strength, good under polish or by itself. Would recommend product to anyone</li>
            <li> This product does everything it stated.  I&#x27;ve always had very thing nails that never grew because of peeling and breaking. After using this product they are growing and much stronger.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were great.  My nails are thin and split.  This does not help with either.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Apparently... You have to follow the directions to a t! I applied this and left it on several days... As it wore off it peeled my nails layers with it.  I don&#x27;t get to do my nails every two-three days like the directions advise. I was hoping to use as a base coat but this is a waste for me.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give 0 stars. I am very angry! I ordered this product, and when it came, the bottle was shattered and the nail polish was leaked everywhere. It smelled terrible. The packaging was clearly terrible. I am trying to get a refund and/or a new bottle of it, but until I do, this review will be here for everyone to see.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> As a nail artist, my nails go through a lot. I change up my manis every day and use pure acetone to remove my nail polish so I&#x27;m in need of a good base coat. My nails have always been thin so I this is helping to strengthen my nails. I use along with another base coat and notice my nail polish lasts longer when I do keep my nail polish on for a week a so.</li>
            <li> The moment I opened my mailbox I knew something was wrong. The smell emanating from the mailbox was really bad. I carefully opened the package and the bottle was broken and the contents all over the package. I contacted the seller and they said they knew already because the post office contacted them. They never let me know. The seller sent me another bottle and this one was packaged exactly as the first. The second time I used it I put it with the rest of my nail polish. Later that night I smelled that awful smell again. I looked where I keep my nail polish and sure enough the second bottle broke, same as the last, around the neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used the product twice and liked it but the bottle is very sensitive to breaks. I had this polish on my nightstand and placed another nail polish next to it and touched the &amp;#34; Rebuild&amp;#34; bottle moderately, not hard though and the &amp;#34; Rebuild&amp;#34; one cracked and I had to throw it out. Wish they made the bottle sturdier cause I never had a polish that broke on me even if it would fall on the ground.</li>
            <li> polish dries quickly and is very protected.  Great product.  I highly recommend.  Polish lasts so much longer with this top coat.</li>
            <li> I have used this befor it is great for soft nails&lt;br /&gt;The hole line is great my nails are healing now&lt;br /&gt;After one use great product</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work!!!!!  Do not waste your money on this product!  It did not do anything that it claims to do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rebuild for a month and this is my second bottle.  This product works.  I&#x27;ve seen an increase in overall strength in my nails and haven&#x27;t had a break or a split since I started using it.  Also have seen a vast reduction in the amount of peeling that happens - which used to be frequent.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> this product does do exactly what it claims to do &#x27;rebuild&#x27; your nails to strong healthy hard nails. It comes in 3 different strengths and i bought the most concentrated and would just use it once a week (not every other day as the product company suggests)...as it can tend to make your nails so hard they become brittle so go easy on the amount of times u use it.  Just use it every time u change your nail polish and that should do the trick. I have the same bottle i bought 3 months ago and used it once a week for 3 mnths and no longer need to use it. My nails were not paper thin...but they were flaky and i was unable to keep them a decent length as they would just flake and start to peel at the ends at a certain point...using this product totally restored my nails as they were when i was 20 years old. Incredible!</li>
            <li> I have had problems with peeling nails for years. After using this product for months, I still have problems with peeling nails. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, which is very disappointing because I love Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This product came to me in a broke bottle with its contents spilled all over the packaging. Needless to say, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This product was surprisingly effective. I used it according to directions and voila! Long-ish and strong-ish nails! Am re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> This product is the first one after trying several that works. My nails were splitting in layers at the tips. This product seals the layers together and within two weeks my nails showed improvement. I have continued to use this as a base coat when I do a color manicure. Otherwise I use it regularly by itself to protect my nails. The first two applications, one a day, look quite clear and have a shine. As you apply additional coats a milky cast appears but still looks good. After four coats you remove and start over.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local Marshall&#x27;s store. I have used Seche Vite and love it and figured I would try this. I am using Seche Natural, not Rebuild, but I imagine they are quite similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried OPI&#x27;s nail strengthener and this is SO much better. I found that the OPI product actually made my nails worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for probably a month now and my nails have NEVER looked better. I apply two coats initially and one coat each day and usually will strip it and start new every 4 days as it starts to peel/flake. It dries very quickly and I love the semi-gloss finish. It makes my nails look whiter, like I&#x27;ve had a French mani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails used to crack on the side way above the quick - haven&#x27;t had that issue since starting to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Marshall&#x27;s on the weekend and saw that they still had some so I bought the last 4 bottles they had in stock. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have brittle nails that crack? Give it a go - you never know.</li>
            <li> Both the rebuilder and the top coat are FANTASTIC products. I&#x27;ve used both for one month&#x27;s time and see and incredible differnce in my nails.</li>
            <li> i used it but learn from my experience. its better to take biotin or something else because this still doesnt allow your nails to breathe.</li>
            <li> There were no contents.  Spilled into box, unable to use, you could smell the product when you opened the box, I am trying to get a refund.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has very thin fragile nails, but you must follow the instructions. My nails looks very&lt;br /&gt;healthy now.</li>
            <li> great for a base coat but i could never see myself using it the way they want. it says you have to put on like two coats like everyday.</li>
            <li> It peels after a few days but noticeable stronger nails. Everyone compliments my longer stronger nails and now my mom wants a bottle. Only complaint is it has a cloudy look and not clear.</li>
            <li> My nails are very thing and brittle.  I have only been using this product for about a month and can see a difference in how strong my nail have become.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love the THEORY of this product, because my nails always get that tiny tear in the corner, and in the past, they&#x27;ve peeled a lot. However, they haven&#x27;t peeled in quite a while, until I put this product on. Which, ironically, I bought to PREVENT my nails from peeling. The very next day after I put it on, I noticed that my polish (over top, I used this as a base coat) had chipped off and shortly afterwards, I noticed the top layer of the nail itself was starting to peel. When I took my top coat off to put on a new layer of the REBUILD, AS THEY INSTRUCT, I saw another of my nails had begun peeling beneath the polish. Yes, this tends to be a problem for me historically, but my nails haven&#x27;t peeled in 8 months, so... I&#x27;d rather use the $1 basecoat from the drug store and have great nails, than this. Won&#x27;t buy it again, will actually probably throw it out. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails that start to curl the second they grow, this doesn&#x27;t stop that all together but it does really make them strong and it doesn&#x27;t peel off like many other similar products.  It does have a beige hue which I like.  My nails have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I am displeased with the performance of this base coat.  It chips the next day and doesn&#x27;t seem to be improving my nail strength.  In fact, I am wondering if it is making my nails peel even more.  I&#x27;m going to stick with OPI&#x27;s nail strengthening base coat.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on your nails but mine broke and all was fall the carpet so deffinetly keep it safe</li>
            <li> This does nothing for my nails. It peels off after my hands get in hot water. My nails still broke. Waste of my money</li>
            <li> So far this is the only base coat that keeps my nails from peeling and breaking off.  Every time I try something different I lose my nails and have to start all over.</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my nails, protects them and strengthens them.</li>
            <li> I have really thin nails that chip and peel all the time. After reading the reviews on this product I thought it was going to work amazingly, I was wrong. First of all it says to apply it up to twice a day. I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to keep adding layer upon layer. I didn&#x27;t like that it left my nails looking \\&quot;foggy\\&quot; I was expecting it to be a clear top coat. Not to mention the fact that it didn&#x27;t work AT ALL. If anything I feel like it made my nails chip even more! It barely stayed on for two days and would peel at the edges, taking layers of my nail off with it. The bottle also cracked and broke after not even a month of having it. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002U8L18K Seche REBUILD]]&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for fragile nails.  I have been using it for abut a month now and my nails are no longer soft and brittle.  Love this product and just bought another bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this for a good 4 months religiously. I have dry brittle nails that split and break easily. I used this in combination with a cuticle oil hoping to improve my nails. I personally didn&#x27;t see a change. As someone who paints their nails often, it&#x27;s tedious to use as directed but I stuck with it&#x27;s instructions to no avail. May work for some, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Seche Vite lover and recommend all their products. I have sensitive nails tha break and split and never hold polish. Love this stuff, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product without very high expectations because nothing else I have ever tried helped my thin peeling fingernails.  This stuff is amazing.  It is the only thing I have tried, and I have tried everything I could find, that has helped.</li>
            <li> i bought this to help with my nails pealing and cracking. After using for the past month, my nails are stronger and longer than before. I suggest this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I hope that by continuing to use Seche Rebuild my nails will improve. It may be too soon to tell but they do seem to be a bit better and are peeling less.</li>
            <li> It only works while you are wearing it, and you need to reapply daily, and makes a crappy base coat for polish.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!  I&#x27;ve ordered this several times</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, does what it says... adds some thickness to your nail.  There was a review here that did say you could use it as a base coat, but I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend that.  My polish didn&#x27;t stay on too well.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when purchasing a base coat, you need to find the one that works best with your body chemistry. This one was not the right one for me. I love the idea of the product and have used it on its own in hopes that it helps rebuild the strength of my nails, but as a base coat, it wasn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it does work well. My only concern was that on the box it states that this product has been known to cause cancer in the state of California. Ok, does that mean that since I live in Ohio the cancer thing is null and void? And also, for some reason the bottle is fragile. I took it to work with me in my bag, and after just placing it back in my bag to take home, the bottle broke at the neck andI had polish everywhere. I&#x27;ve done this countless times with other polishes and no bottle has ever broken on me, and for no reason I can come up with either.</li>
