            <li>They are good to use for many things.</li>
            <li>They effectively hold things that you put in them.</li>
            <li>3 days top, I had almost forgot to write a review.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love having these around to give samples of my MAC pigments to my sister and friends.</li>
            <li>I love the size.</li>
            <li>These little guys are the perfect way to resize lip balms for pockets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my most worth while Amazon buys in quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipper.</li>
            <li>worked ok next time will pay more for the silicone style</li>
            <li>just wish the quantity was higher!</li>
            <li>Great little containers.</li>
            <li>They were smaller than I expected but turned out to be a perfect size for my sample sized organic lipsticks, I decorated these little jars with rhinestones, flowers and lady bugs and they turned out just fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, I will order again!</li>
            <li>Right size to give when someone asks me for a sample of a body cream.</li>
            <li>Gives my customers the right amount to try before they buy.</li>
            <li>Better quality than I need, actually.  </li>
            <li>I put a first run of lip balm in them and it didn&#x27;t work out so well.</li>
            <li>These seal well, are a very small size for tiny samples, and are perfectly see-through</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I had just purchased some loose powder makeup samples from Shiro Cosmetics (love it, BTW)</li>
            <li>Nice little containers.</li>
            <li>This way,I can give her some without having to give the whole thing to her.</li>
            <li>I give these little jars a full 5 stars because they came so quick.</li>
            <li>I love these little jars for UL backpacking.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a complaint, of course.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these shipped before the expected date, they close properly, you can see the makeup color in them, and I love the sound they made in their little shipping envelope, but that&#x27;s just me!</li>
            <li>I chose these because they are a little smaller than most, 3 grams.  </li>
            <li>Seal completely too.</li>
            <li>far, I have found that only one gel has leaked during air travel.  </li>
            <li>They are hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore them, you can tap the excess powder from your brush on the lid, I haven&#x27;t yet spilled any powder, the pot is wide enough to pour makeup in there.</li>

            <li> Very sturdy I have dropped them on hard floors and not a crack on them</li>
            <li> I would feel it would be a waste of space to put a couple of drops or a tiny scoop of product into a 5 gram pot which seems to be the standard size.  </li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little bigger</li>
            <li> I use them for lipstick or other makeup products.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I don&#x27;t think it was the container as the container sealed tight.  </li>
            <li> I had a really tough time getting it back out.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my Flybag for small quantity gels and creams.  </li>
            <li> - so I now travel with that gel in a small dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> These are small but sturdy.</li>
            <li> Thick quality plastic.  </li>
            <li> All things I use very small quantities of.  </li>

            <li> Great product as described. Quick shipper.</li>
            <li> They are good to use for many things. I even keep stones and herbs in some. Very sturdy I have dropped them on hard floors and not a crack on them</li>
            <li> I give these little jars a full 5 stars because they came so quick. 3 days top, I had almost forgot to write a review.

            <li> I bought this product because I had just purchased some loose powder makeup samples from Shiro Cosmetics (love it, BTW) and I wanted to take them out of the sample bags. These pots were the perfect size, they look wonderful in my makeup collection, and they are great to open and close, even with one hand. I absolutely adore them, you can tap the excess powder from your brush on the lid, I haven&#x27;t yet spilled any powder, the pot is wide enough to pour makeup in there. I am planning to fill one up with lipgloss for my purse too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these shipped before the expected date, they close properly, you can see the makeup color in them, and I love the sound they made in their little shipping envelope, but that&#x27;s just me! One of my most worth while Amazon buys in quite some time.  :)</li>
            <li> worked ok next time will pay more for the silicone style</li>
            <li> I love having these around to give samples of my MAC pigments to my sister and friends. My sister comes over and asks to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; my pigments(that arent cheap,at all),and I never see them again. This way,I can give her some without having to give the whole thing to her. I love having these handy!!</li>
            <li> I love the size. I use them for my lotion samples.Gives my customers the right amount to try before they buy.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my Flybag for small quantity gels and creams.  (Eye cream, eye gel, acne gel, hair paste, lip balm)  All things I use very small quantities of.  These little guys are the perfect way to resize lip balms for pockets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have found that only one gel has leaked during air travel.  Because I always put the gels in a tiny ziploc bag before putting them in my Flybag, it was not a catastrophe.  For whatever reason, I don&#x27;t think it was the container as the container sealed tight.  The gel that leaked was an eye gel - so I now travel with that gel in a small dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> They effectively hold things that you put in them.</li>
            <li> These seal well, are a very small size for tiny samples, and are perfectly see-through so you can tell which one you need to open.  I would purchase these again!</li>
            <li> These are small but sturdy. They are hard to clean. I put a first run of lip balm in them and it didn&#x27;t work out so well. I had a really tough time getting it back out.</li>
            <li> Nice little containers. I expected them to be a little bigger but I like them in any case.</li>
