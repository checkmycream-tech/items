            <li>I have been using Maroccan oil shampoo and conditioner for more than 7 months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is authentic.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love ti Shampoo</li>
            <li>It smells great and you don&#x27;t need a lot for your whole head</li>
            <li>Love this stuff-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for so many years</li>
            <li>I have searched everywhere for a shampoo to love</li>
            <li>and I finally found this stuff, its the best!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair quality is 100% better then before.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>A fantastic product!</li>
            <li>has bought more</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Sometimes there&#x27;s an issue ordering from Amazon but so far so good!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and beautiful again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and my hair is healthy and strong, even though I do color treat it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use kerastase and l&#x27;oreal professional line, wich are great, but don&#x27;t even come close to what moroccanoil did to my hair.</li>
            <li>I can tell you from my wife&#x27;s happiness that it is the real thing</li>
            <li>Such good shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I super recommend it!</li>
            <li>I received this order in a VERY TIMELY fashion and it was packaged nice and securely--</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel smooth and looks silky.  </li>
            <li>The results really are amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s important to keep my hair moisturized to help keep the color from fading.</li>
            <li>It also does not make your scalp itch and works great with the same moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After those treatments you have to use shampoos that are phosphate and sulfite free, otherwise you would undo the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to get it in this size and you only need a nickel-size amount for it to work.</li>
            <li>even though i dont use it daily(i use it about 2x a week), my hair is already in better condition, i can tell by the feel of it and my stylist said i have less split ends and was happy i started using it.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time...and is great quality.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricy, but if you want your hair too look healthy, shiny and strong I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have a very dry curly hair and this shampoo provides a great moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I love (and use) the whole line.</li>
            <li>, I had a full head of brunette hair...</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel so soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Smells delish and great for DRY hair!!!</li>
            <li>I will continue to be loyal to MOROCCANOIL Products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product regularly and it has helped my hair (fine hair) become thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li>However, the quality of this product is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The pump is also useful.</li>
            <li>I have sensitivities to many shampoos but absolutely no problem with the Moroccan oil, I love how well it cleans my hair.</li>
            <li>Curly hair is the driest hair there is, so I love how it keeps my hair soft and never frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty oily scalp and it&#x27;s strong enough to get my head clean without stripping the natural moisture from my hair (which is fine and frizzy).</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to them from my hairdresser and was immediately drawn in by it&#x27;s intoxicating smell.  </li>
            <li>With one pump you get exactly what you&#x27;re u</li>
            <li>I also opted for the bigger bottles because that&#x27;s how you get the most for your money.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty penny</li>
            <li>it is the real deal !  </li>
            <li>My hair feels really soft and looks clean and shimmery.</li>
            <li>and we look to take more and in future thanks</li>
            <li>My hairdresser charged 60 dollars for the large bottle of oil when it&#x27;s on here for 40.  </li>
            <li>Will last a long time and offers great value.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my highlighted hair but just a small note to the people whos looking for silicone free hair product; this is only sulfate free but not silicone free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overnight fix but a real a winner.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and so far I think it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have a few favorite shampoo and conditioner sets but this one is definitely my number one favorite.</li>
            <li>Makes the hair very manageable and gives it lots of shine and controllability .</li>
            <li>There was a time when I would have never paid this much for shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and looks healthier since using this.  </li>
            <li>This larger size is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Intense Hydrating Mask (Argan Oil Enriched)     </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a product that really moisturizes like it says it will, though, so I will stick with this one and just realize my hair will never be Lauren Conrad-perfect.</li>
            <li>so her new hair stylist recommended this repair shampoo and the first time she used it</li>
            <li>just received it awhile ago, havent really noticed any dramatic differences on my hair but love the scent !!</li>
            <li>so i only use it when i have a date another special occasion.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need that much shampoo to clean your hair (I have long hair) and mine is curly</li>
            <li>I think the large bottle will last for a couple of years, so the expense is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you can afford it</li>
            <li>now, my daughter and I both use the shampoo and conditioner, i cant use them on a daily basis because i have a sensitive scalp that will break out from time to time when using a rich product.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s overall economical.  </li>
            <li>Smells normal.</li>
            <li>I sometimes ask if they want to try something new, but they never do.</li>
            <li>I found that I could buy these same products on line for MUCH CHEAPER!....</li>
            <li>(I have kind of thick hair but its pretty long).</li>
            <li>I have ordered the large size(33.8oz) from Amazon several times.</li>
            <li>I live in dry, hot Arizona.  </li>
            <li>Do you want ladies to be all \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>When I went to USA last week, I bought the whole line from amazon.</li>
            <li>i was concerned if this was really a larger size and worried that it might not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Lathers well and is soft on my hair without the weight ...</li>
            <li>Makes my naturally wavy hair shine and the smell is divine.</li>
            <li>I color my hair somewhat regularly and this is really gentle on the color, too.</li>
            <li>It rejuvenates your hair and leaves it so soft - but not fly-away.</li>
            <li>leaves her hair soft and silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable, less frizzy and not too dry nor too oily.  </li>
            <li>when used with the Moroccan Oil Hydrating conditioner, it makes your hair hold vibrant color and retains treatment of both Brazillian blow out or keratin treatments for a longer period of anything I have used in the last 10 years.  </li>
            <li>and this helps to calm it down.  </li>
            <li>When I washed my newly grown back hair, it was like I poured cement in it.  </li>
            <li>her whole life and this shampoo is one of the few shampoos that will get her hair the way she wants it to be.</li>
            <li>The old stuff definitely clarified it alright and made my hair feel stringy and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product for dry chemically treated frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>for normal to dry hair</li>
            <li>bought this to replace it and it is much gentler and easier on my hair than the other version.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is a little pricy compared to the &#x27;big box run of the mill&#x27; shampoos that can&#x27;t compare to Moroccan Oil Repair Shampoo, it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>After using this shampoo for the last six years my 60 year old, post chemo, hair looks much younger.  </li>
            <li>The color is of the shampoo is off, the smell is not the same and my hair has been dry after blow drying instead of the normal silky results.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the seller that I normally order from was sold out, so I purchased it from the next available seller.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair very oily- not clean.</li>
            <li>very concentrated so only need a little bit.</li>

            <li> I have been using Maroccan oil shampoo and conditioner for more than 7 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is authentic.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love ti Shampoo</li>
            <li> It smells great and you don&#x27;t need a lot for your whole head</li>
            <li> Love this stuff-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for so many years</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for a shampoo to love</li>
            <li> and I finally found this stuff, its the best!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair quality is 100% better then before.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product!</li>
            <li> has bought more</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there&#x27;s an issue ordering from Amazon but so far so good!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and beautiful again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and my hair is healthy and strong, even though I do color treat it.  </li>
            <li> I used to use kerastase and l&#x27;oreal professional line, wich are great, but don&#x27;t even come close to what moroccanoil did to my hair.</li>
            <li> I can tell you from my wife&#x27;s happiness that it is the real thing</li>
            <li> Such good shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I super recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received this order in a VERY TIMELY fashion and it was packaged nice and securely--</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel smooth and looks silky.  </li>
            <li> The results really are amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s important to keep my hair moisturized to help keep the color from fading.</li>
            <li> It also does not make your scalp itch and works great with the same moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After those treatments you have to use shampoos that are phosphate and sulfite free, otherwise you would undo the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to get it in this size and you only need a nickel-size amount for it to work.</li>
            <li> even though i dont use it daily(i use it about 2x a week), my hair is already in better condition, i can tell by the feel of it and my stylist said i have less split ends and was happy i started using it.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time...and is great quality.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricy, but if you want your hair too look healthy, shiny and strong I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry curly hair and this shampoo provides a great moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I love (and use) the whole line.</li>
            <li> , I had a full head of brunette hair...</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel so soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Smells delish and great for DRY hair!!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to be loyal to MOROCCANOIL Products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product regularly and it has helped my hair (fine hair) become thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li> However, the quality of this product is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The pump is also useful.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivities to many shampoos but absolutely no problem with the Moroccan oil, I love how well it cleans my hair.</li>
            <li> Curly hair is the driest hair there is, so I love how it keeps my hair soft and never frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty oily scalp and it&#x27;s strong enough to get my head clean without stripping the natural moisture from my hair (which is fine and frizzy).</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to them from my hairdresser and was immediately drawn in by it&#x27;s intoxicating smell.  </li>
            <li> With one pump you get exactly what you&#x27;re u</li>
            <li> I also opted for the bigger bottles because that&#x27;s how you get the most for your money.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty penny</li>
            <li> it is the real deal !  </li>
            <li> My hair feels really soft and looks clean and shimmery.</li>
            <li> and we look to take more and in future thanks</li>
            <li> My hairdresser charged 60 dollars for the large bottle of oil when it&#x27;s on here for 40.  </li>
            <li> Will last a long time and offers great value.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my highlighted hair but just a small note to the people whos looking for silicone free hair product; this is only sulfate free but not silicone free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overnight fix but a real a winner.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and so far I think it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have a few favorite shampoo and conditioner sets but this one is definitely my number one favorite.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair very manageable and gives it lots of shine and controllability .</li>
            <li> There was a time when I would have never paid this much for shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and looks healthier since using this.  </li>
            <li> This larger size is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Intense Hydrating Mask (Argan Oil Enriched)     </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a product that really moisturizes like it says it will, though, so I will stick with this one and just realize my hair will never be Lauren Conrad-perfect.</li>
            <li> so her new hair stylist recommended this repair shampoo and the first time she used it</li>
            <li> just received it awhile ago, havent really noticed any dramatic differences on my hair but love the scent !!</li>
            <li> so i only use it when i have a date another special occasion.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need that much shampoo to clean your hair (I have long hair) and mine is curly</li>
            <li> I think the large bottle will last for a couple of years, so the expense is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you can afford it</li>
            <li> now, my daughter and I both use the shampoo and conditioner, i cant use them on a daily basis because i have a sensitive scalp that will break out from time to time when using a rich product.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s overall economical.  </li>
            <li> Smells normal.</li>
            <li> I sometimes ask if they want to try something new, but they never do.</li>
            <li> I found that I could buy these same products on line for MUCH CHEAPER!....</li>
            <li> (I have kind of thick hair but its pretty long).</li>
            <li> I have ordered the large size(33.8oz) from Amazon several times.</li>
            <li> I live in dry, hot Arizona.  </li>
            <li> Do you want ladies to be all \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> When I went to USA last week, I bought the whole line from amazon.</li>
            <li> i was concerned if this was really a larger size and worried that it might not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Lathers well and is soft on my hair without the weight ...</li>
            <li> Makes my naturally wavy hair shine and the smell is divine.</li>
            <li> I color my hair somewhat regularly and this is really gentle on the color, too.</li>
            <li> It rejuvenates your hair and leaves it so soft - but not fly-away.</li>
            <li> leaves her hair soft and silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable, less frizzy and not too dry nor too oily.  </li>
            <li> when used with the Moroccan Oil Hydrating conditioner, it makes your hair hold vibrant color and retains treatment of both Brazillian blow out or keratin treatments for a longer period of anything I have used in the last 10 years.  </li>
            <li> and this helps to calm it down.  </li>
            <li> When I washed my newly grown back hair, it was like I poured cement in it.  </li>
            <li> her whole life and this shampoo is one of the few shampoos that will get her hair the way she wants it to be.</li>
            <li> The old stuff definitely clarified it alright and made my hair feel stringy and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product for dry chemically treated frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> for normal to dry hair</li>
            <li> bought this to replace it and it is much gentler and easier on my hair than the other version.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is a little pricy compared to the &#x27;big box run of the mill&#x27; shampoos that can&#x27;t compare to Moroccan Oil Repair Shampoo, it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for the last six years my 60 year old, post chemo, hair looks much younger.  </li>
            <li> The color is of the shampoo is off, the smell is not the same and my hair has been dry after blow drying instead of the normal silky results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the seller that I normally order from was sold out, so I purchased it from the next available seller.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair very oily- not clean.</li>
            <li> very concentrated so only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I always buy the large size and it usually lasts from one Christmas to the next.  </li>
            <li> They are a little pricey, but so worth the cost - and truly a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde frizzy hair that I blow dry every three days.</li>
            <li> have for a long time.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s 100% grey and ...</li>
            <li> Product was shipped very timely from this vender as has not been the case from other sources in the past.</li>
            <li> When I finally washed out the shampoo, the conditioner helped only a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dry hair and this moisturizes but never oily.</li>
            <li> I have chemically treated hair which of course is dry.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hightlights and this product leave my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth every penny if you need to repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I had soft, thick hair before I went through chemotherapy and radiation for over a year.  </li>
            <li> and it looked unfamiliar, certainly never heard of it</li>
            <li> resulting in a very big mess and loss of product!</li>
            <li> The larger quantity and pump is helpful to use at home and fill my small containers for travel.</li>
            <li> This happening is not a first accident.</li>
            <li> A small bottle lasted six months of almost daily washing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it but lots of other people do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other shampoos (Redken, Pureology, etc.)</li>
            <li> This is a large and fairly expensive one time purchase</li>
            <li> But its not cheap and usually comes in small bottles that dont last very long</li>
            <li> the only downside was when we opened the package the pump had already been twisted to the open position and a lot of shampoo was all over the bag it was in.......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using non-stop for 3 years now and my hair is less frizzy than its every been.  </li>
            <li> It still feels a little straw-like.</li>
            <li> Need just a little.</li>
            <li> It has soon become my everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a few years and would never think of changing.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband suggested I get help because it was so stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair with lights and other treatments that made my hair really dry and broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shampoo is completely different from any Moroccan Oil shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;Clarifying&#x27; version of Moroccan oil shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dull or leave a yellowing afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Have thick, frizzy hair if I don&#x27;t use these products.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted to have long hair, but because of split ends I ended up cutting it.</li>
            <li> A little expensive thOuch.</li>
            <li> The pump of the bottle was broken and the shampoo was leaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of buying all these products that the beauty supply sales assoc.</li>
            <li> I have at least 9 bottles/jars of expensive shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately , the bottle was not packed well</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though the item was wrapped in plastic wrap the bottle still opened and some spilled.</li>
            <li> My poor wife has really bad hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair was recently badly damaged by improper coloring at a salon</li>
            <li> how frustrated</li>
            <li> Try the conditioner as well you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> say are \\&quot;Fantastic\\&quot; and they&#x27;re beyond AWFUL!  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately , the bottle was not packed well&lt;br /&gt;And the shampoo leaked in the box..please make&lt;br /&gt;Sure that the nozzle is secured well before packing.</li>

            <li> The Moroccanoil Repair Shampoo is the very best that I have tried and actually does what it claims to do !!  I have chemically treated hair which of course is dry.  This shampoo restores the shine and softness to my hair.  It has soon become my everyday go to shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Keeps my color shining bright and everyone compliments me on how good my hair smells!  The larger quantity and pump is helpful to use at home and fill my small containers for travel.</li>

            <li> Such good shampoo!  Just what you want - concentrated so it doesn&#x27;t take too much to get a good lather, cleans well, rinses easily and has a great fragrance.  This is a large and fairly expensive one time purchase but I think it&#x27;s overall economical.  It lasts a long time...and is great quality.  I love (and use) the whole line.</li>

            <li> Have used this product for years, and it is excellent.Great for processed hair. Also use Moroccan Oil, and Moroccan Oil Moisture Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The largest sizes are your best value.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  With one pump you get exactly what you&#x27;re u need.  A little expensive thOuch.</li>
            <li> Im a dude....this stuff makes my hair smell amazing...ladies love that.  Are you a dude?  Do you want ladies to be all \\&quot;wow, your hair looks so healthy and smells wonderful!\\&quot;?  Yeah, you want that.  Get this shampoo.  DO IT!</li>
            <li> the Moroccanoil shampoo repair and conditioner are amazing.both my daughter and i wanted to try them because it smells so wonderful when they use it at charles penzones hair salon. It leaves your hair smelling so good all day. now, my daughter and I both use the shampoo and conditioner, i cant use them on a daily basis because i have a sensitive scalp that will break out from time to time when using a rich product. even though i dont use it daily(i use it about 2x a week), my hair is already in better condition, i can tell by the feel of it and my stylist said i have less split ends and was happy i started using it. my daughter uses the oil during the week while she is away at college and the shampoo and conditioner when she is  home.(she has never had a problem with it).  i love the way it makes my hair smell.and it lasts all day. sometimes i dont even wear perfume haha. anyway, the product is a bit pricey so i only use it when i have a date another special occasion. I also opted for the bigger bottles because that&#x27;s how you get the most for your money. and because of the pump provided i can just refill the smaller bottles when they need it.  i just hope i can always purchase it on amazon for such a great price!!!</li>
            <li> I used it for my hair and make different after a month. I used it with another shampoo but this just for make it healthy.</li>
            <li> I was just recently introduced to MoroccanOil off the shelf at the salon. I didn&#x27;t buy it but I saw it sitting there and it looked unfamiliar, certainly never heard of it but the girls at the salon were bragging about what a great product it was. I ordered the Moisture Repair Shampoo and Conditioner off Amazon. It was a pretty penny but I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and so far I think it is definitely worth the price. It smells really good, almost like a fragrance for your hair. I love it. My hair feels really soft and looks clean and shimmery. I have a few favorite shampoo and conditioner sets but this one is definitely my number one favorite.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair very manageable and gives it lots of shine and controllability . I have been using the product for over a year now</li>
            <li> It was as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> A great smelling and great working product. This is my top shampoo. A bit pricy, but if you want your hair too look healthy, shiny and strong I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There was a time when I would have never paid this much for shampoo.  However, the quality of this product is well worth the price.  My hair is so much softer and looks healthier since using this.  I keep reordering!!</li>
            <li> great for  chemically treated hair</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo and noticed it does not smell as good as when I bought it from an authorized retailer.</li>
            <li> Great product, my daughter had the Brazillian treatment done and we were told to use to keep from having the hair striped. It works great so I started to use it on my hair which is color treated and my hair stil never has looked so good.</li>
            <li> I am from Brazil and here everybody is talking about the moroccanoil products. When I went to USA last week, I bought the whole line from amazon. The results really are amazing. I have very thick hair with lights and other treatments that made my hair really dry and broken. The moroccan oil products made my hair shiny and everybody asked what I did to make it so beautiful. I used to use kerastase and l&#x27;oreal professional line, wich are great, but don&#x27;t even come close to what moroccanoil did to my hair. I super recommend it!</li>
            <li> I always dye my hair and this shampoo is  sooooo moisturizing I absolutely love it and would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love all the Morrocan Oil products. I received this order in a VERY TIMELY fashion and it was packaged nice and securely--no leakage whatsoever. Also a GREAT price comparatively speaking.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Moisture Repair is my wifes favorite shampoo.  But its not cheap and usually comes in small bottles that dont last very long and the cost adds up.  This larger size is fantastic.  Will last a long time and offers great value.  i was concerned if this was really a larger size and worried that it might not be the real thing.  I can tell you from my wife&#x27;s happiness that it is the real thing and it is like three or four of the regular size bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great product, outstanding value.  You save money and dont have to buy as often. The pump is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  My hair feels great and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and really like it.  I color my hair and it&#x27;s important to keep my hair moisturized to help keep the color from fading.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo...have for a long time. Only problem with product is the pump does not work. Good thing I have smaller Moroccan Oil Shampoo bottles I can use.</li>
            <li> The Moroccan shampoo is all leaking and another item in the box ,which I ordered through Amazon besides of the Shampoo, is covered with the shampoo liquid. This happening is not a first accident. how frustrated</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and when used with the Moroccan Oil Hydrating conditioner, it makes your hair hold vibrant color and retains treatment of both Brazillian blow out or keratin treatments for a longer period of anything I have used in the last 10 years.  I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> very concentrated so only need a little bit. Lathers well and is soft on my hair without the weight ...</li>
            <li> Recommend this to everyone. This size is used at salons and is cost effective at this size. The pump is also useful.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair!  Cannot use it all the time because my hair needs a rest, but it needs this rest from every shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo came in when it stated it would. I love this size and will continue to buy again this way</li>
            <li> Thank you it is vvvvvvvvvery good and more on time and we look to take more and in future thanks</li>
            <li> I stay in India, and got this product delivered to my cousin who was visiting me. The package was delivered in an unacceptable state. The pump of the bottle was broken and the shampoo was leaking. My cousin didnt have time to return it and she was leaving USA for good, and therefore just threw away the product</li>
            <li> Love love love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hightlights and this product leave my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> great shampoo and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair very oily- not clean. I only used it twice (to reconfirm my conclusion) and the seller, The Beauty Supply Place,  would not take it back, even though the product does not work. Furthermore, it smells different from what the salon sells!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and my hair is healthy and strong, even though I do color treat it.  A small bottle lasted six months of almost daily washing.  I think the large bottle will last for a couple of years, so the expense is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price here makes it even better.</li>
            <li> for normal to dry hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped return the moisture to my hair and made it look healthy again. Hurray!</li>
            <li> Excellent price for the amount of shampoo you get.  Love this shampoo, have frizzy hair and this helps to calm it down.  I also use moroccan oil after I comb out my hair, just scrunch it in and that defines the curls.  Have thick, frizzy hair if I don&#x27;t use these products.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great products! I use most all of them.  MOROCCANOIL by Moroccanoil: MOISTURE REPAIR SHAMPOO 33.8 OZ   MOROCCANOIL Gold Glimmer Shine 3.4oz   MOROCCANOIL Intense Hydrating Mask (Argan Oil Enriched)     I&#x27;m tired of buying all these products that the beauty supply sales assoc. say are \\&quot;Fantastic\\&quot; and they&#x27;re beyond AWFUL!  I have at least 9 bottles/jars of expensive shampoo/conditioners., etc. and will be giving all to my neighbors. I  I&#x27;m constantly asking for samples of these referred products b/4 I purchase and the sales people say \\&quot;We don&#x27;t have samples\\&quot;  I will continue to be loyal to MOROCCANOIL Products.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair feel like silk and the smell is fabulous!  A great product at a great price!  Try the conditioner as well you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it&lt;br /&gt;My hair shines a lot&lt;br /&gt;I receive a lot of compliments&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil products for the last 4 years.  They are great for keep my hair in good conditioning shape.  Once you start using this product, nothing else will do!</li>
            <li> I have been using Maroccan oil shampoo and conditioner for more than 7 months. I have bleached blonde frizzy hair that I blow dry every three days. The product is excellent and helps your hair grow healthy. I always wanted to have long hair, but because of split ends I ended up cutting it. After using this product I cut my hair once in 3-4 months instead of every month as I did before. Highly recommend the product for dry chemically treated frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and it is an awesome price</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil products religiously since they hit the market several years ago. I have ordered the large size(33.8oz) from Amazon several times. Unfortunately the seller that I normally order from was sold out, so I purchased it from the next available seller. Unfortunately the shampoo is completely different from any Moroccan Oil shampoo I have ever used. I don&#x27;t think it is authentic. The color is of the shampoo is off, the smell is not the same and my hair has been dry after blow drying instead of the normal silky results. Very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money here. Move on to the next seller.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job on my hair. I have sensitivities to many shampoos but absolutely no problem with the Moroccan oil, I love how well it cleans my hair. Also, I get so many compliments about smelling good. I don&#x27;t wear perfume, it is the shampoo. I don&#x27;t notice it but lots of other people do.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my naturally wavy hair shine and the smell is divine. I use it with the Hair Repair oil....</li>
            <li> I have a very dry curly hair and this shampoo provides a great moisture to my hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Know the product.  Shipping and price-excellent</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a few years and would never think of changing.  I have thin......curly hair.  Curly hair is the driest hair there is, so I love how it keeps my hair soft and never frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love ti Shampoo it is the real deal !  Will never use anything else !  My hair never looked so healthy !</li>
            <li> This shampoo is moisturing without leaving your hair oily. It also does not make your scalp itch and works great with the same moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I started using after I had a keratin protein treatment to straighten my hair.  After those treatments you have to use shampoos that are phosphate and sulfite free, otherwise you would undo the treatment.  I&#x27;ve been using non-stop for 3 years now and my hair is less frizzy than its every been.  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it to me.  Best shape my hair has ever been in.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product regularly and it has helped my hair (fine hair) become thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair shiny, glossy and manageable!  I was happy to get it in this size and you only need a nickel-size amount for it to work.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - I buy the product every year for my three girls, all in their thirties.  I always buy the large size and it usually lasts from one Christmas to the next.  I sometimes ask if they want to try something new, but they never do.</li>
            <li> I want to love this stuff! It smells great and you don&#x27;t need a lot for your whole head (I have kind of thick hair but its pretty long). It lathers nicely. My only gripe is that I don&#x27;t feel like it moisturizes my hair. It still feels a little straw-like. I haven&#x27;t found a product that really moisturizes like it says it will, though, so I will stick with this one and just realize my hair will never be Lauren Conrad-perfect. Sigh.</li>
            <li> I live in dry, hot Arizona.  The sun can take it&#x27;s toll on hair and skin, but this shampoo is amazing for these conditions.  My hair is more manageable, less frizzy and not too dry nor too oily.  I highly recommend this shampoo.  Even though it is a little pricy compared to the &#x27;big box run of the mill&#x27; shampoos that can&#x27;t compare to Moroccan Oil Repair Shampoo, it is so worth it.  This 33.8 ounce bottle is a great bargain as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- it works so well  but it&#x27;s pricey. This is where I&#x27;ve found the best price tho. Highly recommend if you can afford it but I would use it with the conditioner</li>
            <li> This product is the very best.  I&#x27;ve been using it for so many years, I had a full head of brunette hair... now it&#x27;s 100% grey and ... it doesn&#x27;t dull or leave a yellowing afterwards.  Perfect product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smells amazing. I have searched everywhere for a shampoo to love and I finally found this stuff, its the best!</li>
            <li> just received it awhile ago, havent really noticed any dramatic differences on my hair but love the scent !! I purchased this for my highlighted hair but just a small note to the people whos looking for silicone free hair product; this is only sulfate free but not silicone free!</li>
            <li> My poor wife has really bad hair. It has been a pain her whole life and this shampoo is one of the few shampoos that will get her hair the way she wants it to be. Her hair was recently badly damaged by improper coloring at a salon so her new hair stylist recommended this repair shampoo and the first time she used it we could all tell the difference it made. Her hair came back to life, got rid of the split ends and stopped breaking. This was a month ago. Today her was is almost 100% repaired and she started using the hydrating mask with this shampoo. It is expensive but worth every penny if you need to repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;Clarifying&#x27; version of Moroccan oil shampoo.  My hair is processed from straightening it. The old stuff definitely clarified it alright and made my hair feel stringy and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace it and it is much gentler and easier on my hair than the other version.  It bubbles up and cleans and rinses well.  My hair is soft, supple and shiny after use and I am very happy I switched versions!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love it. My hair quality is 100% better then before. I would like to recommend this product to others for it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I have a pretty oily scalp and it&#x27;s strong enough to get my head clean without stripping the natural moisture from my hair (which is fine and frizzy). I color my hair somewhat regularly and this is really gentle on the color, too. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other shampoos (Redken, Pureology, etc.) and this is the best balance of cleansing and hydrating for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for about one year and I have seen the change in my hair. Even my hair stylist noticed it. You don&#x27;t need that much shampoo to clean your hair (I have long hair) and mine is curly so it helps with the curls too. It doesn&#x27;t look freezy at all</li>
            <li> I would recommend Moroccan Oil products to anyone! It rejuvenates your hair and leaves it so soft - but not fly-away. I use the shampoo/conditioner/oil treatment.  They are a little pricey, but so worth the cost - and truly a little goes a long way. You&#x27;re going to love the way your hair looks and feels!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and it seems to be legit. Smells normal. Sometimes there&#x27;s an issue ordering from Amazon but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works wonderfully on any hair type.  It also smells heavenly.  My hair always feels so good after using it and the shine is amazing.  My husband states that this shampoo makes my hair so touchable and he loves the way it smells.  A fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Not for me but for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;She likes it and it makes her hair look wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;She has bought more</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Need just a little. Makes your hair feel so soft and nice. I pair it with the oil daily.</li>
            <li> Smells delish and great for DRY hair!!!</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for my daughter for mother&#x27;s day. She LOVES it...leaves her hair soft and silky and shiny. Unfortunately, though the item was wrapped in plastic wrap the bottle still opened and some spilled. This wouldn&#x27;t be too big a deal if the shampoo wasn&#x27;t so expensive...with shampoo this pricey every drop counts!</li>
