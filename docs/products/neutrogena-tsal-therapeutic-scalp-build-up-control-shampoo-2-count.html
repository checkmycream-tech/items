    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is incredible!  </li>
            <li>This is truly a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>, I rotate this stuff with Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength and get great results that way.  </li>
            <li>If follow the directions, hair and scalp feel great and healing occurs.  </li>
            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t great, but product works.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, my scalp feels so much better!  </li>
            <li>The scent is fairly medicinal, but tolerable.  </li>
            <li>But when I got home and saw the mistake, I decided to keep I anyway because the label says it&#x27;s good for seborrheic dermatitis, just like T-Gel.</li>
            <li>and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>If anything, the smell is quite nondescript and does not have a nice fruity scent or whatever.</li>
            <li>I tried every kind of anti dandriff shampoo before stumbing onto the diagnosis that I had scalp psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions say to leave in for 7 minutes or something and is sometimes a nice way to stay in a shower longer, but sometimes it&#x27;s just not convenient.</li>
            <li>area of my scalp and kind of avoid the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; area of my scalp</li>
            <li>but I did not find that I needed it on top of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like T/Gel a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>use make sure to follow the directions.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that controls my flake build up in my scalp and it feels great too.</li>
            <li>This product is not always available in the pharmacy in this size.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well or rinse out as well.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li>After months of using a prescription shampoo without success I decided to give this a try today.</li>
            <li>It goes very fast.</li>
            <li>but I also know that what works for one person isn&#x27;t so hot for another....</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first time you put it in, you wont get any lather, but scrub your head with it, leave it in for 5 minutes, then rinse and repeat.  </li>
            <li>This was purchased for someone else, so I don&#x27;t have any personal experience with it, but the person who I bought if for is enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>Well about a year ago I started noticing very large scaley flakes, and head was getting very itchy</li>
            <li>Your results maybe different, but it&#x27;s totally works, so continue to use this product for a while to get good results.</li>
            <li>Over time it is slightly less effective but still works</li>
            <li>As I rinsed her hair large flakes of dermatitis started sliding out.</li>
            <li>My husband says this works very well.  </li>
            <li>it works very well for her problem skin.</li>
            <li>helps with dermatitis or just for itchy scalp and is gentle</li>
            <li>That being said I really recommend this product if you are suffering from severe seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>shampoo left my hair a little &amp;#34;rough,&amp;#34; and not really all that wonderful smelling...</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with it although I find it expensive.</li>
            <li>I use this interchangeably with my normal routine of baking soda and apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have been trying everything I could get my hands on to control my dry, itchy scalp, w/o much success.  </li>
            <li>While IT is costly, it MAY be a little cheaper at your local drugstore--worth looking before purchasing here on Amazon :)</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely fashion and has helped clear my daughter&#x27;s condition</li>
            <li>It also leaves hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have scalp psoriasis and so far this has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon carries this because it is hard to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li>me personally, healing began at the first wash--it take a few uses from my scalp to completely heal.</li>
            <li>Hope it helps, Scalp Psoriasis sucks, but luckily you have stumbled on to the cure...</li>

            <li> Hope it helps, Scalp Psoriasis sucks, but luckily you have stumbled on to the cure...</li>
            <li> I have used one and one half bottles so far on a regular basis leaving it on my scalp for 3 to 5 minutes then rinsing well seven days a week.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for the past 4 years and really likes how it makes his scalp feel and how his hair feels also.</li>
            <li> I only had some minor pimples but they were persistent and would not go away.</li>
            <li> I was becoming so insecure about the scaley build up, and now, my hair is long, flowing and looking sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single break out since about two weeks after starting.....</li>
            <li> If you have long hair I would expect it to go faster.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on the T/Sal thinking that it would probably only work as marginally well as the other products.  </li>
            <li> He used to have a dry, 2&amp;#34; eczema-like patch on his scalp &amp; it is virtually gone.</li>
            <li> It seems that sometime a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; itchy scalp is actually an oily heavy sediment scalp that needs to be thoroughly clarified and cleaned to finally heal.  </li>
            <li> After trying other several other dandruff shampoos, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.</li>
            <li> This is a product that really works if you have tough hair/scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> He recommended that I try this at least twice a week but as frequently as I wanted....</li>
            <li> I have very long hair for a guy (down to my shoulders).</li>
            <li> (granted I&#x27;m in my late 20s, which is when scalp psoriasis generally comes on).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive</li>
            <li> Dose not seem to help my problem, I have an itchy and oily scalp due to rosacea.</li>
            <li> At my dermatologists recommendation I use the for scalp therapy every other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I used it every wash until the skin build up was gone, but now use it every other for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is 3% salicylic acid which is usually the active ingredient in acne wash for the face.</li>
            <li> Especially when the weather was getting in the triple digits, they would get worse.</li>
            <li> T/Sal shampoo works for decreasing scalp acne after using for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not fantastic but it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair at all.</li>
            <li> I mean the smell isn&#x27;t THAT bad, but definitely not your normal herbally shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I use T-Gel, I can go at least a week and a half before having to wash again, sometimes 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it is a little difficult to rinse out of our hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner, so if you do, you may want to use it.</li>
            <li> But with something so exposed to the elements as a scalp is, it is hard to say with 100% certainty that this product is the cause.</li>
            <li> this is very hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Made my condition worse.</li>
            <li> Boy was i wrong.  </li>
            <li> I did not find the smell bad.</li>
            <li> I use Organix Macadamia oil conditioner, which is bad</li>
            <li> I was told by a doctor to try this because I get painful pimple-like bumps on my scalp and have for years.  </li>
            <li> my condition was really bad and painful</li>
            <li> No luck for me with this product :(.</li>

            <li> I like this shampoo but I also know that what works for one person isn&#x27;t so hot for another....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive but it does the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you may like it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that controls my flake build up in my scalp and it feels great too. I am glad that Amazon carries this because it is hard to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I know that the description of the product does not list it as a treatment for acne, but it worked for me. The active ingredient is 3% salicylic acid which is usually the active ingredient in acne wash for the face. I only had some minor pimples but they were persistent and would not go away. Especially when the weather was getting in the triple digits, they would get worse. I used this shampoo for a couple of weeks and it is all gone. I did not find the smell bad. If anything, the smell is quite nondescript and does not have a nice fruity scent or whatever. I also have the conditioner but I did not find that I needed it on top of the shampoo. I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner, so if you do, you may want to use it. Overall, very happy with it although I find it expensive.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Only negative is that it is a little difficult to rinse out of our hair.</li>
            <li> I was told by a doctor to try this because I get painful pimple-like bumps on my scalp and have for years.  Turns out I had an infection which was aggravated by over-the-counter shampoos.  He recommended that I try this at least twice a week but as frequently as I wanted....I use it once to twice a day and have so for months.  I haven&#x27;t had a single break out since about two weeks after starting.....I won&#x27;t try another shampoo now.</li>
            <li> This product needs to come in a bigger size</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion and has helped clear my daughter&#x27;s condition</li>
            <li> My husband says this works very well.  Over time it is slightly less effective but still works &amp; he continues to use it.  He used to have a dry, 2&amp;#34; eczema-like patch on his scalp &amp; it is virtually gone.</li>
            <li> My daughter has seborrheic dermatitis. After months of using a prescription shampoo without success I decided to give this a try today. I rubbed it in and let it set for about 3 minutes.  As I rinsed her hair large flakes of dermatitis started sliding out.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this shampoo, and buying online keeps us well-stocked and ends up saving us money and time.</li>
            <li> this is very hard to find in the stores.  I got it for my dog on the advise of my vet. it works very well for her problem skin.</li>
            <li> T/Sal shampoo works for decreasing scalp acne after using for a few days.  The scent is fairly medicinal, but tolerable.  It also leaves hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I use this interchangeably with my normal routine of baking soda and apple cider vinegar.  I dislike shampoo, but using this twice a week or so keeps the flaky bits away.</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and so far this has worked for me. The smell is not fantastic but it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair at all. I most definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Dose not seem to help my problem, I have an itchy and oily scalp due to rosacea. I have used one and one half bottles so far on a regular basis leaving it on my scalp for 3 to 5 minutes then rinsing well seven days a week.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff with itchy scalp and hair loss for years.  This shampoo is the only one that took away my flakes.  My scalp is still itchy and hair loss severe, but this got rid of one issue and I am grateful.  I only used this until the flakes were gone.  I tried another shampoo recently with Zinc Pyrithione that brought my flakes back and T-Sal cleared them up again!</li>
            <li> Accidentally bought this when what I intended to buy was T-Gel. But when I got home and saw the mistake, I decided to keep I anyway because the label says it&#x27;s good for seborrheic dermatitis, just like T-Gel. Um, no. When I use T-Gel, I can go at least a week and a half before having to wash again, sometimes 2 weeks. With this my head was itching again within 4 days, with flakes! So now I have T-Gel coming through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save so I don&#x27;t make this mistake again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, my scalp feels so much better!  and it doesn&#x27;t stink like T/Gel with that tar smell.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo after our dermatologist recommended it for his &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; scalp.  He&#x27;s been using it for the past 4 years and really likes how it makes his scalp feel and how his hair feels also.</li>
            <li> At my dermatologists recommendation I use the for scalp therapy every other shampoo.  This product is not always available in the pharmacy in this size.</li>
            <li> I like T/Gel a lot better.  This one didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well or rinse out as well.</li>
            <li> I have had scalp psoriasis for years.  I have tried everything but nothing worked....until T/Sal.  This is incredible!  Love it.  Will continue to order it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair for a guy (down to my shoulders). I love it, my lady loves, dudes are envious, it&#x27;s kinda my thing.  Well about a year ago I started noticing very large scaley flakes, and head was getting very itchy (granted I&#x27;m in my late 20s, which is when scalp psoriasis generally comes on).  I tried every kind of anti dandriff shampoo before stumbing onto the diagnosis that I had scalp psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I found this product, and it is a life send!  I was becoming so insecure about the scaley build up, and now, my hair is long, flowing and looking sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing about this product....YOU HAVE TO USE IT TWICE.  Repeat, Use it TWICE when washign it the shower.  The first time you put it in, you wont get any lather, but scrub your head with it, leave it in for 5 minutes, then rinse and repeat.  The second time you put it in your hair it&#x27;s like BAM and you will get CRAZY amount of lather, i don&#x27;t know how they do it, but style yourself a nice soup Fro and let it sit another 5 minutes and wash it out. I use Organix Macadamia oil conditioner, which is bad ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I rotate this stuff with Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength and get great results that way.  Hope it helps, Scalp Psoriasis sucks, but luckily you have stumbled on to the cure...use make sure to follow the directions.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for someone else, so I don&#x27;t have any personal experience with it, but the person who I bought if for is enjoying it.  She has a scalp issue and this product is helping her.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, guess I have a problem with my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it works. But with something so exposed to the elements as a scalp is, it is hard to say with 100% certainty that this product is the cause. It goes very fast. I have 7/8&amp;#34; shaved hair and can use a bottle every 6 months. If you have long hair I would expect it to go faster. The directions say to leave in for 7 minutes or something and is sometimes a nice way to stay in a shower longer, but sometimes it&#x27;s just not convenient.</li>
            <li> helps with dermatitis or just for itchy scalp and is gentle</li>
            <li> If follow the directions, hair and scalp feel great and healing occurs.  Smell isn&#x27;t great, but product works.  Would recommend additional use of a neutrogena conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is a product that really works if you have tough hair/scalp issues.  I have been trying everything I could get my hands on to control my dry, itchy scalp, w/o much success.  I took a chance on the T/Sal thinking that it would probably only work as marginally well as the other products.  Boy was i wrong.  It seems that sometime a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; itchy scalp is actually an oily heavy sediment scalp that needs to be thoroughly clarified and cleaned to finally heal.  After only two or three treatments I can dramatically feel the difference.  HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Made my condition worse. I have used TGel and it worked amazingly. No luck for me with this product :(.</li>
            <li> I have/had problems with scalp build, possibly seborrheic dermatitis (SD). After trying other several other dandruff shampoos, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. The bottom line: it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my condition was really bad and painful I used it every wash until the skin build up was gone, but now use it every other for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to leave this product on your scalp/head for several minutes. When I do use this product, I usually lather this into my hair first, put on a bathrobe and cover my head with a shower cap, put on a bathrobe and do some chores i.e. fold clothes, wash the pots and pans etc. After 5-10 minutes, I&#x27;ll rinse my head and wash my face and whatever else it is I do in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo left my hair a little &amp;#34;rough,&amp;#34; and not really all that wonderful smelling...I mean the smell isn&#x27;t THAT bad, but definitely not your normal herbally shampoo. I use leave-in conditioner so I can spray the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; area of my scalp and kind of avoid the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; area of my scalp (I have this theory about product build up!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me personally, healing began at the first wash--it take a few uses from my scalp to completely heal. Your results maybe different, but it&#x27;s totally works, so continue to use this product for a while to get good results. That being said I really recommend this product if you are suffering from severe seborrheic dermatitis. This is truly a wonderful product. While IT is costly, it MAY be a little cheaper at your local drugstore--worth looking before purchasing here on Amazon :)</li>
