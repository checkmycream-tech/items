            <li>I buy that for my wife,she has dry Mouthand dry throut for years,and finaly a very good Doctor recomend the Mouth Kote,after using one day the problem is gone.very very happy.</li>
            <li>There was only one brand available to me locally, and it was about as delightful as Listerine with citric acid.  </li>

            <li>LAST LONG, WORKS PERFECTLY</li>
            <li>The Mouth Kote does exactly what it advertises!  </li>
            <li>It works well, but I am not crazy about the lemon flavor.</li>
            <li>I have to keep reaching for it throughout the night, but its spray bottle is very user friendly and I can practically do it in my sleep.</li>
            <li>Print off the ingentents to your dentist, see what they say, Because it has all the right ones.</li>
            <li>I am a mouth breather at night and many times I have come out of a sound sleep choking because of dry mouth..</li>
            <li>works better than biotene or any other dry mouth spray I&#x27;ve tried and a great deal on Amazon</li>
            <li>I tried to use it according to the direction in the package, but I did not get very much relief from the problem.  </li>
            <li>, Is so much better tasting and acting than bio/</li>
            <li>First the product never got delivered from the vendor and when I phone regarding status they had run out of the product.  </li>
            <li>Mouth Kote tasted much better than the other products on the market right now and although it was a bit &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; I consider it worth it because I have to use it so often.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I do not like to drink water before going to bed, that many times means a dry mouth.</li>
            <li>The spray is fine enough to spread throughout my mouth.</li>

            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really work well for me.  </li>
            <li>Mouth coat doesn&#x27;t really coat your mouth.</li>
            <li>Mouth Kote gives me some relief, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Mouth Kote was an absolute life saver.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for 10 years and it really saves me.  </li>
            <li>If I drink too much water,I will need to &amp;#34; get up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>One of the few products of this kind with a helpful herb ingredient, and a non-mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>I mainly use it at night.  </li>
            <li>Better than allot of more expensive mouth moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So much better then Biotene especially since they changed their formula and put extra shots of mint in it.</li>
            <li>Biotene mouthwash works much better but it only works for a short while.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I take a lot of meds and they make my mouth super dry.  </li>
            <li>Yerba Santa and citrus flavor make this oral moisturizer better tasting and more long lasting than others I have tired</li>
            <li>It keeps my mouth from being bone dry during the night, unlike the other popular brand that claims to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>Mouth Kote has helped me considerably.</li>
            <li>She takes two squirts before eating or drinking and it almost completely eliminates the metallic taste.  </li>
            <li>I find Mouth Kote Dry Mouth Spray to be okay, but my condition is not standard dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>None of the other dry mouth products I have tried have worked either, but at least they tasted OK.</li>

            <li> I tend to sleep with my mouth open and get dry mouth.</li>
            <li> The Mouth Kote Dry Mouth Spray always helps with my dry mouth &amp; throat to stop it being dry for several  hours.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Better than Biotene which leaves an aftertaste &amp; has a dairy component</li>
            <li> so I can claim it on my income taxes along with a host of other need over the counter items I need for medical reasons, (All with prescription from a doctor)</li>
            <li> Due to a recent complication from a stomach surgery, where I became septic,  I had not had anything to eat or drink in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I try using an oral moisturizer, since I seem to have a &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth you have got to get this stuff.</li>
            <li> This leads to dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying this product to anyone with my issues or dry mouth from medications.</li>
            <li> Perhaps for people the just have dry mouth</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth quite a bit because I am on oxygen at night.  </li>
            <li> My main complaint is the product itself which I obtained from another vendor.  </li>
            <li> I am a  handicapped person and my movements are limited to shorter, slower moves.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me a dry tongue that&#x27;s cracked cannot take mint!</li>
            <li> It seemed to help a little, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long; I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have a very dry mouth during the night.  </li>
            <li> Other the the lemony freshness, this product does nothing for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have chronic dry mouth and burning tongue and palate due to Sjogrens.  </li>
            <li> I spent about two hours researching this and</li>
            <li> THE LEMON FLAVOR IS NOT VERY SOOTHING AT NIGHT.  </li>
            <li> I am diabetic and get severe dry mouth at night and decided to give this a try, boy what a mistake!!</li>
            <li> but actually one uses very little</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it, I just decided that this product was not right for me.</li>
            <li> Due to heavy radiation I have no taste buds nor saliva glands.</li>
            <li> I keep it bedside and squirt a little in my mouth</li>
            <li> Taste took me a little getting used to, but it works and I am ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this through several re-orders and I wake up without those uncomfortable dry mouth symptoms.</li>
            <li> it is very watery and doesn&#x27;t stay in the mouth as a coating very long,  disappointed.</li>
            <li> I take gabapentin, which creates serious dry mouth, this product did not work at all !</li>
            <li> the lid was not on tight and some of the liquid had oozed out!</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasing, but not overwhelmingly one note or another like some others which are too minty.</li>
            <li> I carry a small spray bottle of Mouth Kote and it gives me some relief.</li>
            <li> You can swallow the liquid, but I usually swish, hold for 30 seconds, then spit.  </li>
            <li> If I forget to spray, I wake up in a panic unable to get enough moisture to swallow and am grabbing for my water bottle.</li>
            <li> If you are a diabetic or any one who suffers from dry mouth,this is the product !  </li>
            <li> Seems expensive</li>
            <li> but of course nighttime is the worst time for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I take a medication that leaves my mouth dry, especially annoying at night when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Medications make my mouth horrible at night and this is never out of reach.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The Mouth Kote Dry Mouth Spray always helps with my dry mouth &amp; throat to stop it being dry for several  hours.  I use a C-Pap machine every night &amp; it helps with the dryness that I experience most nights.  Sometimes I forget to use it &amp; wish I had use the Mouth Kote to prevent the dryness at night.  I also have to use it some during the day.  I am on a LOT of medication so therefore the dryness.  RLT</li>
            <li> Again, Cancer folks recommenced and no way to know if it really helps, yet does seem to.</li>
            <li> way too expensive--would not repurchase</li>
            <li> If you are a diabetic or any one who suffers from dry mouth,this is the product !  The taste is pleasant, not overpowering at all. I keep it bedside and squirt a little in my mouth and I can go back to sleep.  Works anytime but of course nighttime is the worst time for dry mouth.  Seems expensive but actually one uses very little and it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Would like refill size</li>
            <li> It was suggested to me (by my dental hygenist)that I try using an oral moisturizer, since I seem to have a &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;.  There was only one brand available to me locally, and it was about as delightful as Listerine with citric acid.  They did have a sample of this moisturizer in the office, and I MUCH preferred it--so ordered it from Amazon (along with some books,cds, etc).  It arrived before anything else in the order, and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.  It really does taste like lemonade-- sort of tart/sweet--and after using it, I don&#x27;t have the &#x27;mummified mouth&#x27; feeling for hours.</li>
            <li> The spray is fine enough to spread throughout my mouth. The taste is pleasing, but not overwhelmingly one note or another like some others which are too minty. (I don&#x27;t detect any mint taste.) I&#x27;ve been using this through several re-orders and I wake up without those uncomfortable dry mouth symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but I much prefer it to Biotene for many reasons.  It is all natural and the flavor is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Yerba Santa and citrus flavor make this oral moisturizer better tasting and more long lasting than others I have tired</li>
            <li> It kills mouth bacteria and helps out on dry mouth from various medications.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and the local store had it on backorder.  I was glad to find another source in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Very disapoonted.  Other the the lemony freshness, this product does nothing for dry mouth. Stay with the Biotene products and spray, much more effective.</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth you have got to get this stuff. Print off the ingentents to your dentist, see what they say, Because it has all the right ones. And it tastes great, works well, Is so much better tasting and acting than bio/whatever ( You too will forget it&#x27;s name ones you more one to Kote. It is just Awesome. I take 16 different pills for several different disease (MS, Diabetes, artritis Etc) And I take many sevral times a day. This leads to dry mouth. But Kote cures that, and my dentist give sometime so I can claim it on my income taxes along with a host of other need over the counter items I need for medical reasons, (All with prescription from a doctor) So come tax time I can use them as part of my dedutions. I know not just them but I have a lot of needs. They add up. Anyway, Kote Rocks my world and is a needed item. It really works well.</li>
            <li> the lid was not on tight and some of the liquid had oozed out!</li>
            <li> Non-allergic for me - a +&lt;br /&gt;Not long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Better than Biotene which leaves an aftertaste &amp; has a dairy component&lt;br /&gt;Using it on &amp; off for a month</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really work well for me.  I was excepting something more like Biotene mouth spray, which is viscous and stays in your mouth and throat.  Mouth coat doesn&#x27;t really coat your mouth.</li>
            <li> One of the few products of this kind with a helpful herb ingredient, and a non-mint flavor. Leaves a milder odor for the next talent when working in voiceover studios (where ventilation is off to reduce noise). An essential product for long voiceover sessions!</li>
            <li> I have a very dry mouth during the night.  This did nothing for me. I do not recommend this for anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the mouth coats that are on the market today. This seams to last the longest about 10 min&#x27;s for me. I don&#x27;t have a clue how it tastes. Due to heavy radiation I have no taste buds nor saliva glands.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of meds and they make my mouth super dry.  I carry a small spray bottle of Mouth Kote and it gives me some relief.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have chronic dry mouth and burning tongue and palate due to Sjogrens.  The taste is citrusy and not what I was expecting.  I have problems sometimes with products that are too minty and sting my tongue or palate, so this may be the thing.  The product works well otherwise and comes in handy spray bottle.  It is good to have around for quick spritzing after eating or drinking and I have been using it every 2-3 hours with good results.  You can swallow the liquid, but I usually swish, hold for 30 seconds, then spit.  I recommend trying this product to anyone with my issues or dry mouth from medications.</li>
            <li> The Mouth Kote does exactly what it advertises!  It keeps my mouth from being bone dry during the night, unlike the other popular brand that claims to do the same thing. This is my second time ordering this fine product and I will order again.  It has a very refreshing taste, as well!</li>
            <li> LAST LONG, WORKS PERFECTLY</li>
            <li> I take gabapentin, which creates serious dry mouth, this product did not work at all ! In fact it made my mouth drier.</li>
            <li> Best product for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Good concept but it doesn&#x27;t really do a very good job of moisturizing my mouth. Doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t compare to Biotene mouth spray.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this! Medications make my mouth horrible at night and this is never out of reach. Taste took me a little getting used to, but it works and I am ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help a little, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long; I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it helps to prevent cavities.</li>
            <li> Got this product because of a condition I have with not producing enough mopisture in my mouth at times &amp;amp; mouth kote works great! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I find Mouth Kote Dry Mouth Spray to be okay, but my condition is not standard dry mouth.  I have &amp;#34;burn mouth&amp;#34; also, and it feels like my mouth has been scalded.  Mouth Kote gives me some relief, but not too much.  Perhaps for people the just have dry mouth it would be totally effective,</li>
            <li> Due to a recent complication from a stomach surgery, where I became septic,  I had not had anything to eat or drink in 3 months.  Mouth Kote was an absolute life saver.  I just wish I had  found out about it before my 2nd month of hhospitalization.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! I am a mouth breather at night and many times I have come out of a sound sleep choking because of dry mouth.. This product eases that problem. I can spray before bedtime and again if I waken during the night and the panic problem is gone. If I forget to spray, I wake up in a panic unable to get enough moisture to swallow and am grabbing for my water bottle. I am a  handicapped person and my movements are limited to shorter, slower moves. Mouth Kote has helped me considerably. Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I tried to use it according to the direction in the package, but I did not get very much relief from the problem.  After about a week of using it, I just decided that this product was not right for me.</li>
            <li> it is very watery and doesn&#x27;t stay in the mouth as a coating very long,  disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works excellent! My mom tried everything&lt;br /&gt;And this works the best!!</li>
            <li> I buy that for my wife,she has dry Mouthand dry throut for years,and finaly a very good Doctor recomend the Mouth Kote,after using one day the problem is gone.very very happy.</li>
            <li> This item works well at night but not so well durning the day so I give it  four big stars</li>
            <li> I do not like to drink water before going to bed, that many times means a dry mouth. It works as advertised. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> It works well, but I am not crazy about the lemon flavor.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the reviews on this one and also should of remembered that you get what you pay for. I am diabetic and get severe dry mouth at night and decided to give this a try, boy what a mistake!! This stuff lasts for about 10 minutes and then you are spraying again. Save your money and use Dr. Thayers dry mouth spray that will last all night.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 10 years and it really saves me.  I mainly use it at night.  Glad someone invented it.</li>
            <li> Mouth Kote tasted much better than the other products on the market right now and although it was a bit &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; I consider it worth it because I have to use it so often. I use Spiriva in the morning and the dryness in my mouth last all day.</li>
            <li> My mom was having an issue related to chemotherapy.  Basically everything she ate or drank tasted metallic and made her gag.  I spent about two hours researching this and many cancer support groups seemed to think Mouth Kote would help with the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my delight it has been a wonderful help to my mom.  She takes two squirts before eating or drinking and it almost completely eliminates the metallic taste.  Obviously this is not the intended purpose of this product, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully someone else with the same problem is helped by this review.</li>
            <li> Better than allot of more expensive mouth moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. I have to keep reaching for it throughout the night, but its spray bottle is very user friendly and I can practically do it in my sleep. Yeah, it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I take a medication that leaves my mouth dry, especially annoying at night when I&#x27;m trying to sleep. This spray IS helpful but I&#x27;d wake up several times and need to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try it during the day so it may be wonderful as a day-use product.</li>
            <li> I mix with Biotene for best results</li>
            <li> this product is great and I will recommend it to everyone and have already told my friends and family to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver.  I have dry mouth quite a bit because I am on oxygen at night.  It is great.</li>
            <li> So much better then Biotene especially since they changed their formula and put extra shots of mint in it. If you&#x27;re like me a dry tongue that&#x27;s cracked cannot take mint! This mouthcote is great!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> First the product never got delivered from the vendor and when I phone regarding status they had run out of the product.  They did refund promptly, however.  My main complaint is the product itself which I obtained from another vendor.  It did not work for me at all and the taste was a kind of medicinal cloying lemon lime flavor.  None of the other dry mouth products I have tried have worked either, but at least they tasted OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best dry mouth remedy I&#x27;ve come across, and I&#x27;ve tried many. I just wish it was more readily available. Great product!</li>
            <li> works much better than the brand they advertise on tv.  i even recommended it to my dentist.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and has a lime taste which is better than others.</li>
            <li> OASIS IS SO MUCH BETTER.  THE LEMON FLAVOR IS NOT VERY SOOTHING AT NIGHT.  MOUTH KOTE IS ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE.  NOT RECCOMENED</li>
            <li> works better than biotene or any other dry mouth spray I&#x27;ve tried and a great deal on Amazon</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Very disappointed. Biotene mouthwash works much better but it only works for a short while. I did get something from my dentist that you stick on your gums that works, by far, the best of anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> MY SON LIKES IT BUT LIKES THE PACKETS BETTER.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to over hydrate at night for obvious reasons try this product. I tend to sleep with my mouth open and get dry mouth. If I drink too much water,I will need to &amp;#34; get up&amp;#34; more than I want to get up. One or two quick sprays and you feel like you just drank a glass of water.</li>
