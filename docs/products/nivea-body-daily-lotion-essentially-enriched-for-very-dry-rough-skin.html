            <li>I was very happy and satisfied with this product.    </li>
            <li>Lotion needs to smell good and can&#x27;t be overpowering</li>
            <li>This is good for a man&#x27;s lotion too, and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a woman...</li>
            <li>I look good, I don&#x27;t look like a crack-smoking zombie.</li>
            <li>was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Has a smell and just can&#x27;t replace the marvelous Nivea Original which I have used for forty five years.</li>
            <li>where else, so we she is so happy that we are able to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Pump can also be lock which is a nice feature, because you can assure lotion is not spilled everywhere if you travel with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps your skin nicely moisturized but takes its</li>
            <li>(too add I had the best sellers in the whole world).</li>
            <li>Cetaphil and Aveeno, very happy, this is far superior, though stronger.</li>
            <li>Ple the makeup can be applied on top of it, and it looks really good.</li>
            <li>This is, in my estimation, the very best moisturizer that Nivea makes - I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores (the new products are quit watery)  </li>
            <li>Good bye dryness, dullness, flakyness, the fine wrinkles around my nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is the perfect way to explain it, but if you can get past that, it works great.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too strong, but really nice one.   </li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>

            <li>I think it might be better used as a night</li>

            <li>I have it on reorder...  :)   </li>
            <li>Top quality  -  Top Value  -  Top Supplier .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Nivea lotion for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love the Nivea that says &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; on container.  </li>
            <li>I love the glow after I put it on.</li>
            <li>My skin looks firmer, moisturized, and healthy.</li>
            <li>sure you pick the correct front panel because they have a lot of choices.</li>
            <li>anyone with skin :)</li>
            <li>OK but package ftoze twice.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed receiving this package.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and smooth with a pleasant scent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of strong, flowery, perfumey scents which is another reason I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best lotion for dry skin and deff helps keep the skin moisturized .</li>
            <li>Lovely light powdery scent.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but the more consistently it&#x27;s used the more your skin improves.</li>
            <li>Got the lotion quickly and safe.</li>
            <li>and my skin is still smooth.</li>
            <li>It also has a great smell but not too overpowering at the same time.</li>
            <li>The scent is just light.</li>
            <li>Best used in winter, but can also be used year round.</li>
            <li>just fantastic</li>
            <li>This is a light yet rich feeling formula that leaves my skin looking and feeling like satin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite because it works!</li>
            <li>this product is great if you have very dry, wrinkly skin.</li>
            <li>Everything you read about this cream is true, except that it smells like Raid.</li>
            <li>Also good as a facial lotion.</li>
            <li>This formula is very rich, so you have to rub it in really well</li>
            <li>It soaks in fairly quickly and does work all day.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and mingles with your own scent for a subtle but good smell that lasts throughout the day.     </li>
            <li>SO GLAD TO HAVE IT BACK AFTER DOING WITHOUT ANY NIVIA FOR MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing - like fresh clean and mildly sweet with a tiny hint of baby powder.</li>
            <li>The seller was nice enough to refund the money.</li>
            <li>I look young, refreshed, and healthy.</li>
            <li>applied right after shower, no itching, hooray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps with my skin tone on my hands, arms, and body and has helped the dry, itchy skin on my legs look healthy again!    </li>
            <li>If you like light and  fast absorbing lotions, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>The lotion also keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I prefer this overall to a lighter lotion (Aveeno, which I use in the hottest summer months) because it keeps my skin better moisturized for longer.</li>
            <li>I will order more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>and this is  the only lotion that keeps my skin moist and healthy.</li>
            <li>but sometimes I have to apply three to four times , because my skin seems to get dry very easily.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy especially when you want to buy several quantities in bulk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy , absorbs really well and leaves your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>A great whole body moisturizer and the price is right - try it, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unattractive...</li>
            <li>I guess this thing really did work when you use it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use it much to get results, immediately it absorbs into your skin and moisturizes and retains the moisture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts throughout the day without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>but it does really sink into the skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>And the moisturizing action is just right for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for more than three years and haven&#x27;t found any other lotion that compares.    </li>
            <li>It just that Eucerin lotions are mainly fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>-  Seriously not recommended&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product.</li>
            <li>If you have a bottle for a long time, 8 months to a year or so, it will form little bits of grain in it making it not as pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Nivea products, and this one is good for cold, dry days.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s mostly disappeared since I started using this lotion a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Incredibly moisturizing to the degree that it changes skin appearance, non-greasy, long lasting, gives gentle sheen (not shine) to skin, the one that signals strong hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My while family has dry skin issues, but this lotion makes our skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thick and great for my dry skin</li>
            <li>The only problem is at work where we had a black counter tops (the kind like in H.S. science labs)</li>
            <li>this lotion is really thick but smooth, it looks and feels very greasy when you first put it on</li>
            <li>tHE BODY WASH IS NEW TO ME AND</li>
            <li>My legs allways looked terrible, but because of this lotion, they feel smooth and look nice :) something I&#x27;d never think would happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because the scent, while pleasant to most people (reminiscent of baby powder), smells very artificial and chemically-influenced.  </li>
            <li>it has a very light , delicate scent which won&#x27;t offend or bother anyone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is just as effective but cost about 40-50% less than the other two mentioned brands.</li>
            <li>My only problem with it is that I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>you have to be near sensitive surfaces soon after applying this</li>
            <li>Have used this before and this is all I use for my face in winter (and I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>My face looks like when I was 22 years old.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m surprised that I haven&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li>Nivea lotions are good but this dry rough skin lotion are very thick so gets over quickly.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen and loose powder goes over it after few minutes so the lotion gets absorbed first.</li>
            <li>This lotion works really well for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works so well though I just switched to using it at night; it has time to sink in then and really healed my dry</li>
            <li>It has really turned around my winter dry skin issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves a slightly oily/tacky sensation on skin that disappears over time as it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft and never dry.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other day shower 1-2 times a day with hot water</li>
            <li>hydrates and stays on like no other.</li>
            <li>The body lotion is thick and rich.</li>
            <li>Locks in moisture and keeps your skin soft and supple all day long.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look more vibrant/moisturized and less dull.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is very good for my skin</li>
            <li> My wife uses it just about everywhere. she likes it.</li>
            <li> My while family has dry skin issues, but this lotion makes our skin so smooth and soft. I have an 8 month old and any other lotion we used broke him out and dried him or. We started using thirds lotion and have no more skin issues with him anymore. I would recommend it to anyone. With dry skin and without. Got the lotion quickly and safe. I am 100% happy.</li>
            <li> This lotion works really well for my dry skin. My legs allways looked terrible, but because of this lotion, they feel smooth and look nice :) something I&#x27;d never think would happen. My only problem with it is that I really dislike the smell. Sunscreen is the perfect way to explain it, but if you can get past that, it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who grew up stubborn and never put lotion on her legs. Now that I&#x27;m 20ish, I noticed I have wrinkles - WRINKLES!! - on my legs. It&#x27;s very unattractive... -.-  So I switched my lotion to this and I noticed the difference within about 2 weeks. My skin was softer and FIRMER. I think it had something to do with the salt. I was very happy and satisfied with this product.    After finishing the bottle, I kept forgetting to buy it and just used whatever lotion was in my parents house. To my horror, my skin started to wrinkle again. I guess this thing really did work when you use it. The only downside is that even though it heals your skin, you need to use it for probably longer than a year to get long-term effects. [The one bottle only lasted me about 8 months].    So yeah this product is great if you have very dry, wrinkly skin.</li>
            <li> Thick and great for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I received the package within 3 days. I&#x27;m a Nivea fan since I was a kid but never use this enriched lotion b4. I used other Nivea lotions but my skin is so dry &amp; didn&#x27;t last for 24 hours. But now it seems to work with this type. I start using it &amp; like it.Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy especially when you want to buy several quantities in bulk. The only problem is that they tend to have leaked a little of the contents (~3 ml) when you receive the package. This is frustrating cleaning the bottle and storing it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy. The lotion also keeps my skin smooth and soft. It&#x27;s so rich I use it every other day shower 1-2 times a day with hot water and my skin is still smooth. It also has a great smell but not too overpowering at the same time. Pump can also be lock which is a nice feature, because you can assure lotion is not spilled everywhere if you travel with it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not too strong, but really nice one.   And the moisturizing action is just right for me. Not too oily too.</li>
            <li> This is a light yet rich feeling formula that leaves my skin looking and feeling like satin. The only problem is at work where we had a black counter tops (the kind like in H.S. science labs) and I wound up leaving little oily \\&quot;prints\\&quot; everywhere on the counters. It works so well though I just switched to using it at night; it has time to sink in then and really healed my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to be near sensitive surfaces soon after applying this I think it might be better used as a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with a note to the caveat mentioned.</li>
            <li> Nivea lotions are good but this dry rough skin lotion are very thick so gets over quickly. If you dont have an excessively dry skin, choose the regular one.</li>
            <li> The content had leaked into the plastic wrap. The seller was nice enough to refund the money. Have used this before and this is all I use for my face in winter (and I have sensitive skin). Sunscreen and loose powder goes over it after few minutes so the lotion gets absorbed first.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and this is my go-to lotion now. This product gets 5 stars for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It works and works well. It soaks in fairly quickly and does work all day. I have to re-apply it far less than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used. It makes my skin look more vibrant/moisturized and less dull. I&#x27;m thinking this is due to the combination of sea minerals and almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells amazing - like fresh clean and mildly sweet with a tiny hint of baby powder. The scent is just light. Lotion needs to smell good and can&#x27;t be overpowering or I don&#x27;t want to put it on my skin. The Nivea is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s priced appropriately. I&#x27;m tired of paying for expensive moisturizers that don&#x27;t seem to make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have lived in Michigan for years, and it&#x27;s the ONLY lotion that keeps my skin hydrated during the dry and cold winters.</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion.  It is great!  I have it on reorder...  :)   Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I prefer this overall to a lighter lotion (Aveeno, which I use in the hottest summer months) because it keeps my skin better moisturized for longer. I have thin, delicate skin that is sun-sensitive and prone to damage due to a recent medical treatment, and this lotion definitely keeps my skin happy.</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich lotion. Locks in moisture and keeps your skin soft and supple all day long. Lovely light powdery scent. Leaves a slightly oily/tacky sensation on skin that disappears over time as it is absorbed. Some people don&#x27;t like these kinds of lotions so beware. If you like light and  fast absorbing lotions, this is not for you. But if you&#x27;re a fan of Keri or Eucerin Intensive Repair, give this a try. I&#x27;d say this is just as effective but cost about 40-50% less than the other two mentioned brands. This is the richest of the Nivea lotions in my opinion. And Nivea and Eucerin is made by the same company, Beiersdorf, so they&#x27;re very similar. It just that Eucerin lotions are mainly fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything....Cocoa butter, Shea butter, oils, pomades, etc. nothing works on my skin during the winter. This does. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Top quality  -  Top Value  -  Top Supplier .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your skin nicely moisturized but takes its&lt;br /&gt;time soaking in  -  Seriously not recommended&lt;br /&gt;for anyone thinking of driving a car, boat, train,&lt;br /&gt;plane or tractor for at least twenty minutes after&lt;br /&gt;application .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Saying  .................... PC  -  LA  .</li>
            <li> I have at least 5 different kinds of lotion in rotation between my house, work, and car but this is by far my favorite because it works! I have been using this brand for more than three years and haven&#x27;t found any other lotion that compares.    You don&#x27;t have to use it much to get results, immediately it absorbs into your skin and moisturizes and retains the moisture but the more consistently it&#x27;s used the more your skin improves. It helps with my skin tone on my hands, arms, and body and has helped the dry, itchy skin on my legs look healthy again!    I&#x27;m not a fan of strong, flowery, perfumey scents which is another reason I love this lotion. The scent is clean and mingles with your own scent for a subtle but good smell that lasts throughout the day.     The only drawback to this product... If you have a bottle for a long time, 8 months to a year or so, it will form little bits of grain in it making it not as pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Best used in winter, but can also be used year round. This is the only lotion I can trust that beats dry skin depending on the cold climate but sometimes I have to apply three to four times , because my skin seems to get dry very easily.</li>
            <li> i wish i could by 50 for less..in price...great job....it last for hours...any where any time you can use it.......</li>
            <li> I have used Nivea lotion for many years.  I continue to buy it because it hydrates well, absorbs and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Nivea products, and this one is good for cold, dry days.  It takes some effort to lather it on and rub it in, but it lasts a long time and protects form cold and wind.  For warmer days I would recommend their lighter lotion, which comes in a white bottle.</li>
            <li> This is one of the Only hand lotions that does NOT have alcohol!-  Other brands use alcohol to keep you constantly using it (hands will keep drying out!)!    This is good for a man&#x27;s lotion too, and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a woman... (no chemical perfume)!  Con- Makes my hands a little soft for rough work, so I only use it in the evening.    BTW- I bought \\&quot;one\\&quot; 13.5oz bottle at Wally World for 1/3 this price (about the same)!  Another reviewer said it gets bits of sand like particles after 8-12 months (no date on bottle?), so I&#x27;ll stick to one bottle at a time.</li>
            <li> Nivea one word. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! my skin feels like butter in these nasty cold harsh winters. (too add I had the best sellers in the whole world). Can you tell am Happy!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope this product is around for ever. ****great smell, great on kids....just fantastic**** Dont know what else to say!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Nivea that says &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; on container.  I ordered this product by mistake.  Has a smell and just can&#x27;t replace the marvelous Nivea Original which I have used for forty five years.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth with a pleasant scent! I will order more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Everything you read about this cream is true, except that it smells like Raid. Actually, does not smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly moisturizing to the degree that it changes skin appearance, non-greasy, long lasting, gives gentle sheen (not shine) to skin, the one that signals strong hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Nivea goodness without needing a paddle to apply and feeling like you&#x27;re about to be baked in the oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used Cetaphil and Aveeno, very happy, this is far superior, though stronger.</li>
            <li> The body lotion is thick and rich. I love the glow after I put it on. My skin looks like silk. I purchased a travel size just in case I didn&#x27;t like it. Now I am hooked. My official go to lotion. I hope they don&#x27;t change the formula.</li>
            <li> I have very but very dry skin, since I was a little kid. It eihert didn&#x27;t help moving from the Caribbean to upstate NY. I have try all the ones at the pharmacy, even those of the specialized \\&quot;body shops\\&quot;. and I keep coming back to this lotion. My skin looks firmer, moisturized, and healthy. It last throughout the day. Is very thick yet it absorbs quickly. After two years using, I got fed up with all the different facial moisturizer I was using. So I decided to use it for my face. Guess what? My face looks like when I was 22 years old. Good bye dryness, dullness, flakyness, the fine wrinkles around my nose and eyes. I look good, I don&#x27;t look like a crack-smoking zombie. I look young, refreshed, and healthy. Ple the makeup can be applied on top of it, and it looks really good. And I&#x27;m surprised that I haven&#x27;t break out. I can&#x27;t believe I spent 40 dollars for a facial moisturizer, and this cream was better than the expensive one.   Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is, in my estimation, the very best moisturizer that Nivea makes - I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores (the new products are quit watery)  was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy , absorbs really well and leaves your skin soft and supple. it has a very light , delicate scent which won&#x27;t offend or bother anyone.  Hope Amazon continues to carry it.  A great whole body moisturizer and the price is right - try it, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> SO GLAD TO HAVE IT BACK AFTER DOING WITHOUT ANY NIVIA FOR MANY YEARS. tHE BODY WASH IS NEW TO ME AND I&#x27;M&lt;br /&gt;LOV&#x27;N IT.</li>
            <li> I just started using this lotion again, and I don&#x27;t know why I stopped.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts throughout the day without feeling greasy.  Furthermore, I had a few dry patches on my ankle that would not go away for weeks and it&#x27;s mostly disappeared since I started using this lotion a few days ago.  I wish they sold a larger bottle, but I&#x27;m sticking with this product regardless.  I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because the scent, while pleasant to most people (reminiscent of baby powder), smells very artificial and chemically-influenced.  I&#x27;d go for an odor-free version.</li>
            <li> Best body lotion! Nothings beats this nivea lotion.</li>
            <li> Only lotion that works for my life..</li>
            <li> The best cream I&#x27;ve encountered for my body!!!&lt;br /&gt;It hydrates and stays on like no other. Also, it smells and feels great on your body.</li>
            <li> I tried every product I could find to put on my skin after a shower, or bath.&lt;br /&gt;I always started itching after the shower, because of whatever soap was used, didn&#x27;t seem to matter. believe me I tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;Then I was lucky enough to try this product. applied right after shower, no itching, hooray.&lt;br /&gt;make sure you pick the correct front panel because they have a lot of choices. only this one works.&lt;br /&gt;for anyone with skin :)</li>
            <li> this lotion is really thick but smooth, it looks and feels very greasy when you first put it on but it does really sink into the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff moisturizes very well.  It has really turned around my winter dry skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it smells like Raid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever.  I still use it because it has worked so well.</li>
            <li> i am a repeated customer of this product. I have really dry skin and this is  the only lotion that keeps my skin moist and healthy. I get a lot of attention about my legs when i use this lotion because it improves skin texture and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> OK but package ftoze twice.</li>
            <li> Have been using Nivea for a long time. It&#x27;s the best lotion for dry skin and deff helps keep the skin moisturized . Would deff. recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is the only lotion that works for my dry skin during NYC winters.  I have to order on Amazon because it is always sold out at the CVS down the street from me.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome lotion.  I use it daily and it keeps my skin soft and never dry.  I tan quite a bit and I use this after tanning so that my skin doesn&#x27;t look like leather.  I have used this for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed receiving this package. The package was well derived on date. Great!!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that my will use and we are unable to find it where else, so we she is so happy that we are able to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of handwashing in my job and I have dry skin to start with.  This compares to Eucerin cream for effectiveness, but is easier to put on in a hurry.  Also good as a facial lotion.</li>
            <li> This formula is very rich, so you have to rub it in really well or it leaves your skin feeling greasy.  Wonderful product with a great smell.</li>
