            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>While it was easy to apply, at times it came out &amp;#34;clumped&amp;#34; and appeared &amp;#34;dried-out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I guess my money isn&#x27;t good enogh now that I am older.</li>
            <li>love this discontinued color, so was pleased too buy several here.  </li>

            <li>I love the taupe color as I&#x27;m a blond and some shades tend to be too dark.</li>

            <li>Also, the product is advertised as &amp;#34;long-lasting, up to 16 hours&amp;#34; which is true only if you don&#x27;t sweat or &amp;#34;tear up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(I will miss it when the new ones are gone.)</li>
            <li>I am not dead yet.</li>

            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. I have allergies, and my eyes water in certain seasons.  This product stays put better than any other I&#x27;ve tried, and it washes off easily with soap and water.  I love the taupe color as I&#x27;m a blond and some shades tend to be too dark.</li>
            <li> The best color out there and stayed with me all day</li>
            <li> It makes my sight blurry and I never put it on the inside lid.  Also, I wanted a taupe color and this is not it. More cocoa and dark.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner, sad Revlon no longer makes.  Seller very prompt very happy</li>
            <li> I love this liner, its a shame they discontinued it...</li>
            <li> I use this product as an eyebrow pencil. It works the best of any I have ever used and the Taupe/Cocoa color is perfect for me. It&#x27;s also the only product where I have been able to get this color, and now I&#x27;m reading that&#x27;s it&#x27;s being discontinued. So disappointing. Now I will be trying dozens of different products and spending money trying to find something comparable. Why can&#x27;t companies just leave things alone.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed colorstay is a discontinued series of the line.  It does what it says.  It stays on unlike the other products that just wipe away.  I particularly like 208 cocoa color as is a very nice med brown with no red tone.  Please bring back the cocoa color.  I want more of this product</li>
            <li> love this discontinued color, so was pleased too buy several here.  wish revlon would reconsider.</li>
            <li> I actually use this for a brow pencil. I have very dark brown brows and this fills them in nicely without looking to harsh and unnatural. It also last all day. This shade is hard to in local stores so I was happy find it here with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t always get it at the store.This color goes with my complexion and I am so glad that you have it. Very good product.</li>
            <li> This was the wrong color. I thought I ordered cocoa but came in mauve. Used it anyway.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for, for months.</li>
            <li> I love anything Colorstay!  Have used this color for years and now they have discontinued it.....I&#x27;m so disappointed......will have to find something similar in another brand!</li>
            <li> Usually I am very pleased with Revlon products but this one is not up to their usual standards.  While it was easy to apply, at times it came out &amp;#34;clumped&amp;#34; and appeared &amp;#34;dried-out&amp;#34;.  Also, the product is advertised as &amp;#34;long-lasting, up to 16 hours&amp;#34; which is true only if you don&#x27;t sweat or &amp;#34;tear up&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t think I will order this again.</li>
            <li> This is my first order from this vendor.  I have used the eyeliner and love it.  My hope is it is fresh stock and not and cracks on me.  Wish me luck.  Take care.  lbs</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this, l bought a 10 year supply. Revelon makes it in Black now. They told me on the phone that they are reaching a different age group now. I am not dead yet. I guess my money isn&#x27;t good enogh now that I am older. Oh to be young again. That is not fair. We all age. Maybe some day  some cosmetic company will cater to older women that are also still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s discontinued!  Great eyeliner that stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the color I like is no longer being manufactured.  So thank you to Amazon for finding me this now rare product. (I will miss it when the new ones are gone.)</li>
