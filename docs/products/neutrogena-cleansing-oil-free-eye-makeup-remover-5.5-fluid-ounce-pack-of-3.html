            <li>I&#x27;ve been usngthis product for almost 3 years now, it&#x27;s cheap and good, my skin is super sensitive, the oil removers always make mu skin itchy, this one does not at all, and it wipes off the make up so clean, love it, and will continue using this product.</li>
            <li>I gave a bottle to my teenage granddaughter so she easily removes her eye makeup with a product that supports good health.</li>
            <li>Great seller and the product is as expected!</li>

            <li>I have used other products from neutrogena and was hoping to get a better quality product as advertised.</li>
            <li>She uses all sorts of makeup, including waterproof; this takes it all off with no irritation to her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I put a little on a cotton pad and wipe my eyes clean.</li>
            <li>Definitely would highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I love this eye makeup remover.  I have given up on any other brands.  This is just the best.  I always wear waterproof mascara and this removes it with ease.  No pulling or tugging.  Love it. HG eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This remains my favorite eye makeup remover. My eyes are incredible sensitive and I have problems with almost every remover out there. My eyes will sting, itch or water if I try to use anything but this. It&#x27;s incredibly gentle and never irritates my eyes. I use it on a cotton pad to remove makeup and then swipe the other side of the pad quickly under warm water and wipe my eye one last time. This removes the sort of &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; residue left by the remover. It works very well on even waterproof mascara and eyeliner, too.</li>

            <li> As usual... this is my only go-to eye makeup remover product.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else I like.  This takes off stubborn waterproof mascara well.  It has like an oil/water mixture you can see in the bottle.  Putting a small amount on a cotton ball does the trick..  No need to rub hard either.  I like buying this in bulk, because I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> great product, removes make up easily. no build up. arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Cleansing Oil-Free Eye Make up remover is truly one of the best eyeliner/mascara removers that I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just pour some on a cotton ball, soak it on my eyelids for 30seconds, and then wipe. Almost all of my eyeliner, comes off immediately afterwards.</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover ever! Won&#x27;t use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It was nice to receive them via the mail.</li>

            <li> Used this eye make up remover for years now. Very similar to some of the more expensive brands. Takes off the eye make up with ease.</li>

            <li> Great seller and the product is as expected! This is my favorite makeup remover and it does wonders. It&#x27;s comparable to the Clinique makeup remover but for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I abuy this product all the time in the local drug store.  I saved alot of money by buying it on Amazon.  Very pleased.</li>
