            <li>I love this soap and watch for it to be an add on.  </li>
            <li>I want more.</li>
            <li>Even maybe a chart on your site saying what everything is would make this so much better.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the variety, and the soap itself is what you hope goat milk soap will be.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived in cute purple goat box.</li>
            <li>Love this brand of soap.  </li>
            <li>Love Zum bars.</li>
            <li>Timely shipping, as described, Super nice would purchase again.</li>
            <li>it was worth it to find a scent I liked.</li>
            <li>Love the clean non slimy way it,leaves your skin feeling</li>
            <li>I always have a box available in the house.</li>
            <li>Great way to try all the different kinds.</li>
            <li>I had patchouli,oatmeal lavender (my favorite) charcoal,dragons blood,frankincense,and patchouli-orange.expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>Great deal, each bar is a different scent.</li>
            <li>Plus they are free trade and are philanthropists.</li>
            <li>Received these fine soaps quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>My soap was intact and the one in using now is great for my dry winter skin</li>
            <li>The bars start out with ridges that quickly disappear with use; they then stick to the soap holder.</li>
            <li>lol down side</li>
            <li>fun to try them all.</li>
            <li>Yes, the individual pieces are small, but the price is great compared to a full size bar from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>With all the chemicals my skin has become super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Cleared up blemishes on my face and has smoothed fine lines I was starting to notice.</li>
            <li>My work environment is very damaging to my skin.</li>
            <li>One bar was just too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sampler pack, so many different slivers of soap in various shapes and sizes.  </li>
            <li>the mini bars are marked what they are</li>
            <li>This soap I can use on my face  and it has transformed my skin to baby soft.</li>
            <li>Love the scents but the bars are very thin, they break apart the first time you use them.</li>
            <li>Was going to gift but will not due to condition.</li>
            <li>Add to that, there must be some sort of gluten cross contamination of the soap or in the original ingredients because both my husband and I have been having our typical gluten reactions on the days we shave with this soap and it gets into tiny cuts.  </li>
            <li>Really am enjoying this sample box of thin &amp;#34;leftovers&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li>Was listed as new and soaps were flaking outside the package, the box was torn at the corners and held together by a giant piece of tape.</li>
            <li>It all smells heavily of the mint and every bar smells exactly the same now.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this to try. My work environment is very damaging to my skin. I work mostly with acid, phosphate, and lime. With all the chemicals my skin has become super sensitive. I had luck with oatmeal soaps but wanted something that smelled nice(since I was a bath and body works gal for many years) I came across this and for the price it was worth it to find a scent I liked. Of course I like them all lol down side none are the mini bars are marked what they are so you have to look them up online. This soap I can use on my face  and it has transformed my skin to baby soft. Cleared up blemishes on my face and has smoothed fine lines I was starting to notice. I am in love with zum bars. I don&#x27;t think I will go anywhere else from now on.</li>
            <li> Love the scents but the bars are very thin, they break apart the first time you use them. Wish they were the sizevof regular soap bars.</li>
            <li> Very nice assortment.</li>
            <li> Yes, the individual pieces are small, but the price is great compared to a full size bar from Whole Foods. The scents are great and the soap is really moisturizing.</li>

            <li> My favorite bar soap!</li>
            <li> Really am enjoying this sample box of thin &amp;#34;leftovers&amp;#34; .  There were a couple minty bars that did tend to overpower the others, but I removed them from the box promptly. I&#x27;d buy this again..fun to try them all.</li>
            <li> The arrived in packaging as shown on the web site.  It&#x27;s a sampler pack, so many different slivers of soap in various shapes and sizes.  The soap has a nice rich lather to it and seems good.  I like the scent I am using now but the scents all seem to mix together, so it is hard to tell them apart individually for a reorder.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff came with box too</li>
            <li> Nice when they come out of the box,but don&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear well&amp;#34;. The bars start out with ridges that quickly disappear with use; they then stick to the soap holder.</li>

            <li> Very thin bars of soap.  I would also like them labeled.  I wanted to try various scents.  I have no idea what kind they are.</li>
            <li> This stuff is WONDERFUL!  Smells divine.  I want more.</li>
            <li> I received the package as it appears in the picture but it was pretty best up looking.

I&#x27;ll never stray from my 3 simple ingredient Kiss My Face Olive Oil soap again!</li>
            <li> Buy this stuff for your wife. She&#x27;ll love you even more!!</li>
            <li> I found the bars misrepresented in size.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, tremendous variety of different soaps, makes a great car deodorizer, and also as a soap. Received these fine soaps quickly from the seller. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of soap.  Great way to try all the different kinds.</li>
            <li> Greatest soap ever for sensitive skin.ALL sents are amazing.hard to decide what is my favorite.seller packed sample box of zum soaps wonderfully.soaps in sample box are different in every box.I had patchouli,oatmeal lavender (my favorite) charcoal,dragons blood,frankincense,and patchouli-orange.expensive but worth it.</li>
