            <li> I had double knee replacements, and this has been a very handy item for showering/bathing.  I feel like the stool is sturdy and safe.  I can sit on the edge of the tub, slide back onto the chair, and then turn my body and lift my legs to get in the tub.  I have a deep tub, so I let it fill while I \\&quot;shower\\&quot; and thus get to soak my legs, too.  It&#x27;s also great to use to sit on while at the sink.</li>
            <li> This chair works very well, in the bath tub.  I could use a narrower one but could not find one.  It is sturdy and I like the ability of raising it or lowering it to adjust to others.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and shower seat was exactly as described.  Easy to assemble and fit in tub just perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am 9 months pregnant and have been having a hard time showering without my legs going numb.  I bought this chair so that I can sit in the shower now and for after I have the baby.  This was so easy to set up and it is sturdy and I don&#x27;t worry about slipping in the shower.  My standup shower is small and I was worried when I was shopping for chairs that it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the shower but this one fits just fine.  It&#x27;s adjustable so I can have it at the perfect height for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Christmas present to my mother-in-law.      It is small enough to actually fit in a normal sized shower.  Most will fit right up to the edges which is very, very tight.  This one gives some ease.    The oval shape is so smart.  There are no corners that she has to be careful of.  She can slide to either side without maneuvereing around a corner.    The real surprise was how easy it was to put together.  My MIL put it together herself!!!  She is a somewhat frail 87 year old, 89 pound woman with no mechanical ability.  I can&#x27;t tell you how proud she was of herself for \\&quot;building\\&quot; it.    It truly is sturdy enough to comfortably handle a very heavy person.  A plus for my appearance conscious MIL was that it looked like it was made for an average person.     I would recommend this to anyone.  That is very high praise from me.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product. Lower price than local and adjustable.[[ASIN:B000KIJFH6 Carex Adjustable Bath and Shower Seat]]</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It fits the need very well. Many of the seats would not fit in the tub and this one is a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I bought this chair for my mother because she has bad knees. It fit perfect in her old bath tub. My mother is heavy weighing 234 pounds, so I was worried if the chair would be sturdy enough. It was plenty sturdy for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used this chair in the bath tub and have not had any problems at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this little stool for my mother to use in the shower. She wanted a back on hers so I changed it out in the tub. We still use it especially if she falls, I can scoot this under her hips to boost her up. Works well and is sturdy. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My uses for this seat.  Not just for shower, great for just sitting for tasks.  Light weight and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This shower seat worked well for me following knee replacement surgery.  I could adjust it to the perfect height, and it seemed very study.</li>
            <li> This seat fit in my bathtub.  At first, it worked well so I disposed of the packaging.  Then the legs began buckling.  They moved so that the seat is lopsided.  I am afraid to use it because I don&#x27;t want the seat to collapse while I am sitting on it.  I made sure the screws were tight each time.  I have since ordered another product from another vendor and another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> A great sturdy shower bench.  Easy to tighten wing bolts don&#x27;t require a screw driver. Angle of legs make a bigger &amp;#34;foot print&amp;#34; in the shower.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product. The screws keep coming loose. I don&#x27;t not like doing reviews but something happened to me so scary with this bench it I need to share. I was taking a shower and the bench started to dis level. I was on my own and it took me a good 15 mins to figure out a safe way to get out of the shower. I immediately bought a new one, similar to an old one that I replaced because it was already 7 years old and it was getting rusty. Mind you I purchased this in a pharmacy store a month ago. Today I dissembled it and it seems like one of the legs where fabricated crooked.</li>
            <li> We ordered the shower seat for my mother in law when she visited in April. It worked very well for her and  we kept it in our shower because it is handy to use when shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> Sturdy.  Sits well.  However a bit wide for average tub size width.</li>
            <li> Although this bench is considered safe for up to 300 lbs. at 220 lbs. I do not feel secure on it.  The leg screws keep coming loose and have to be checked and  tightened for every use.  For a double leg amputee, it is too lightweight for the moving around that must be done, and the seat has a deep lip in back which further reduces the seat size.  I would not recommend it for leg amputees.  Otherwise, it may work well, but I question the weight capacity of 300 lbs.</li>
            <li> My wife had a hip replacement and now uses&lt;br /&gt;this bathtub chair and it is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;We always use a rubber (Rubbermaid) tub-mat&lt;br /&gt;with it, to prevent slippage of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;Nice solid item and appears well built and&lt;br /&gt;should last a very long time. That seat&lt;br /&gt;is not wobbly or flexible. Very nice!</li>
