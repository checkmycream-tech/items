    <ol>
            <li>I never feel like it is goopy or oily, and I appreciate that they use the best of the best for ingredients.</li>
            <li>&quot; Moisturizer is awesome.</li>
            <li>I find it works best on damp skin.  </li>
            <li>Feels great, perfect weight/creaminess,</li>
            <li>Moisturizer is great, as described.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, great smelling and purer ingredients than Olay.</li>
            <li>Best of all, my skin looks amazing - dewy but not oily.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of keeping my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have issues with acne, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>sunscreen lol can&#x27;t describe...</li>
            <li>and then this protects very nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is not a summer product, but it&#x27;s very nice for winter.  </li>
            <li>I love this superb cream</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s a bit costly, but really good stuff.</li>
            <li>I was worried, given the expense of this, that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good match for my skin, but I decided to risk it because of its good EWG rating.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice cream and all the ingredients are healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I switched!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>This is a great, light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of the kind of paste you used in school growing up.</li>
            <li>so I kept rubbing it in until it disappeared and it feels nice and moisturized</li>
            <li>I use them as serums too before I use any kind of moisturizer (if I do use any moisturizer)</li>
            <li>the EWG site it was rated hazardous 0</li>
            <li>It went on so smoothly and lightly and felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, though, and the finish is very nice.  </li>
            <li>However, it is natural and this is the best thing about the cream</li>
            <li>Anyway we both love it, it really is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very bizarre.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, you can get Subscribe &amp; Save for an even better price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just as pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it for more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li>I love this face cream.  </li>
            <li>Well I washed my face and applied more this morning and for some reason it makes your face look really healthy.</li>
            <li>so that is mostly what made me purchase this.</li>
            <li>face looks alot better.</li>
            <li>Aside from the sheen my face does look more hydrated.</li>
            <li>more like, I don&#x27;t like how it applies to the skin.</li>
            <li>so that is mostly what made me purchase this.</li>

            <li>Fantastic moisturizer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;***UPDATE***After about 6 jars of this stuff, I continue to love it.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love wearing this on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Hoping it would be a good moisturizer I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>It is very rich, so  </li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing in the morning, and it&#x27;s chalk full of pure &#x3D;, good for you ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use a lighter coat in the morning and both powder and liquid make-up have gone on top just fine.  </li>
            <li>IDK what exactly is in this but on the EWG site it was rated hazardous 0</li>
            <li>, I might try another product next time though given its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: excellent Environmental Working Group rating, seems to work well, no weird smell</li>
            <li>I love that it feels clean and smells clean on my skin.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t test on animals, are light on fragrance, and they use glass containers which are easier to recycle.</li>
            <li>I can wear it with some light foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and the good news is that this does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find this product.</li>
            <li>The price does seem to fluctuate a fair amount, and I think it&#x27;s a good value at $30, given how long a jar lasts, but personally, I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay much more.</li>
            <li>since I started using All Things Pure, my skin has improved a fair amount: it is not flaky under my makeup anymore, and I have most definitely had fewer breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The smell is old; kind of rancid, but I attribute that to no additives.</li>
            <li>Luckily it doesn&#x27;t linger and goes away quickly after you apply.</li>
            <li>, soaks in quickly and skin looks refreshed after applying.  </li>
            <li>I am almost out of my first jar and am going to repurchase another!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer, while a little on the heavier side for summer, works great the rest of the year with my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It smells natural, like plants or something organic for the most part.</li>
            <li>People tell me I&#x27;m \\&quot;glowing.\\&quot; Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>used the whole bottle but did not see any significant results.</li>
            <li>so I guess that tells you something right?</li>
            <li>I guess great for day time but at night I want something super duper thick for these winter months.</li>
            <li>I guess great for day time but at night I want something super duper thick for these winter months.</li>
            <li>it is not greasy at all, is kind of strange at the first application cause</li>

            <li>The reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is simply that there&#x27;s nothing particularly outstanding about it.  </li>
            <li>I prefer this product line over Aveda&#x27;s because I like the scent better and it seems like a richer product for about the same price.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s really concentrated!</li>
            <li>I want something really creamy!</li>
            <li>I am almost out of my first jar and am going to repurchase another!on</li>
            <li>I want something really creamy!</li>
            <li>like I said earlier lol My face is also extremely dry and</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Their Crucial Moisture has a nice, clean smell but not hydrating enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this product back when I was pregnant for a more natural moisturizer to use on my face that wouldn&#x27;t harm my baby.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because of all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a type of sheen on my hands, pretty much like</li>
            <li>I have searched long and hard for the perfect organic moisturizer and this is it!.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend is using my Pure now</li>
            <li>It seems to have very high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>&quot; Moisturizer again my neck really cleared up.  </li>
            <li>My skin loves this cream, it made a real improvement.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need that much</li>
            <li>prefer no scent rather than too much.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m on an all-natural and organic kick after reading so much about toxic things in kids products.</li>
            <li>I really really like it.</li>
            <li>I spent a long time researching a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, I bring to the table sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>In both cases, it took around 2 weeks to rectify the problem by using special hydrating hypoallergenic face washes and moisturizes to get my face back to normal again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>While I truly wanted to like this product, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me - regardless of all thing pure or natural.  </li>
            <li>It is an ok cream, a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You do have to wash your make-up brushes a little more often though.  </li>
            <li>I will update the difference in my skin in a few weeks to see if it&#x27;s dramatically diff or better than the oils itself.</li>
            <li>I also found that if I am not going out right away, I can leave it on white and it will soon melt and blend into my skin .</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was too rich - making my skin feel coated and heavy.</li>
            <li>I have found my new face moisturizer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it seems to do much besides provide some basic moisture.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t really moisturize enough for me.</li>
            <li>I would frequently get compliments on my skin before, so I can&#x27;t wait to see how Bioelements changes my complexion and skin tone.</li>
            <li>This product is cheaper than the Calmitude moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it at night and it leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I just received this product today and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that my face is sensitive, alot of face moisturizers have chemicals and it either burns or stings my face</li>
            <li>It was safely and professionally packaged (at least 2 of the organic items I&#x27;ve ordered have not been) and arrived in a timely fashio.</li>
            <li>Two weeks ago, I had my first facial at a local spa.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, and relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if it really soaks in, or sits on the surface, due to the thickness.</li>
            <li>My hopes were not very high but this moisturizer really surprised me.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, oily in the T-zone, and dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li>One of the samples (she gave me a few samples each per product type) was for All Things Pure Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I guess I dipped a little too much as it literally looked like sunscreen with a white cast</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the positive reviews here. I have extremely sensitive skin and the good news is that this does not irritate my skin at all. I have also used it as eye cream with no eye irritation. It seems to have very high quality ingredients. As others have said, it goes on thick and white. If you want to blend it in, be prepared to rub a lot. I find it goes on easier on damp skin. I also found that if I am not going out right away, I can leave it on white and it will soon melt and blend into my skin . I can&#x27;t say it seems to do much besides provide some basic moisture. I wonder if it really soaks in, or sits on the surface, due to the thickness. I have very dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t really moisturize enough for me. Not sure I would buy it again.  I think I prefer Puristics for this type of product.</li>
            <li> This is supposedly an all natural product, but there is a bad, overwhelming &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; type of odor that I smell when I apply it to my face. I do not know which ingredient is creating this odor. Also, the cream is very difficult to rub in smoothly - very white and pasty look / feel on my face.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is great, as described.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s all natural, and relatively inexpensive.  A little bit of it goes a long way so the small jar will last a long time.  It smells nice.  It has an average consistency - not super light, but not super heavy.  Basically, it does it&#x27;s job.  The reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is simply that there&#x27;s nothing particularly outstanding about it.  That said, I will continue to buy it until and unless some other moisturizer comes along that wows me for a comparable price.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, great smelling and purer ingredients than Olay. I&#x27;m glad I switched!</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago, I had my first facial at a local spa. They used nothing but Bioelements products on my skin and provided me with samples. One of the samples (she gave me a few samples each per product type) was for All Things Pure Moisturizer. At first I thought it was too rich - making my skin feel coated and heavy. But now my face just feels....luscious and dewy. I would frequently get compliments on my skin before, so I can&#x27;t wait to see how Bioelements changes my complexion and skin tone. Buying Bioelements products are like having the spa at home. They don&#x27;t test on animals, are light on fragrance, and they use glass containers which are easier to recycle. On top of that, you can get Subscribe &amp; Save for an even better price. I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I used to use Aveda products for years and I have very sensitive skin. This product is cheaper than the Calmitude moisturizer for sensitive skin and I&#x27;m just as pleased with it. I prefer this product line over Aveda&#x27;s because I like the scent better and it seems like a richer product for about the same price.</li>
            <li> It is an ok cream, a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I used the whole bottle but did not see any significant results. However, it is natural and this is the best thing about the cream</li>
            <li> This moisturizer made my skin break out in a rash and stung when i applied it - i went to return and missed the policy by one day!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. It&#x27;s a little heavy so I would reccomend using it as a night moisturizer. My skin feels amazing in the morning, and it&#x27;s chalk full of pure &#x3D;, good for you ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have searched long and hard for the perfect organic moisturizer and this is it!.  Produced &amp;#34;cruelty free&amp;#34; as well.  It is very rich, so  a little goes a long way,  but  it sinks in.  It keeps my skin moisturized all day.  Best of all, my skin looks amazing - dewy but not oily.  I love this superb cream and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I have found my new face moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Pro: everything&lt;br /&gt;Con: cost</li>
            <li> This works very very well. I love that there are no harmful or questionably sourced ingredients. It does a great job of keeping my skin hydrated. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like the smell of it. Luckily it doesn&#x27;t linger and goes away quickly after you apply. The smell reminds me of the kind of paste you used in school growing up.</li>
            <li> After many purchases of mousterizers over the last couple of years in search for one that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals and doesn&#x27;t smell bad, I finally found a mouisterizer that I like 5 stars</li>
            <li> I use it at night and it leaves my skin soft.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Not a miracle cream, though.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer, while a little on the heavier side for summer, works great the rest of the year with my skin. I never feel like it is goopy or oily, and I appreciate that they use the best of the best for ingredients. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time researching a good moisturizer.  This is the one and without any oily residue. Can&#x27;t beat the wholesome ingredients!!!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Bioelements All Things \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; Moisturizer is awesome. I had radiation treatments on my neck and the salve that Doctors gave me helped a lot, but when I started using my \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; Moisturizer again my neck really cleared up.  The Doctor was shocked at how well my skin was responding, and asked me for the info on Pure.  Yes it&#x27;s a bit costly, but really good stuff. My girlfriend is using my Pure now and she doesn&#x27;t seem to be too worried about the cost, but why should she be, I&#x27;m the one buying it.  Anyway we both love it, it really is amazing stuff.  Use very little, it goes a long way.  So even though it&#x27;s costly, it lasts really long before running empty.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin is sensitive, oily in the T-zone, and dry everywhere else. This product soaks in almost immediately, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Every face cream or product I use usually makes my eyes water, despite their organic ingredients.  This product did not.  It is not too&lt;br /&gt;heavy, soaks in quickly and skin looks refreshed after applying.  I have combination skin and it is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream and all the ingredients are healthy. it is not greasy at all, is kind of strange at the first application cause it even feels a bit sticky. My skin loves this cream, it made a real improvement. I use it for more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li> The smell is old; kind of rancid, but I attribute that to no additives. It goes on heavy and slightly waxy. It absorbs quickly, though, and the finish is very nice.  There is no oily feel at all afterward, and you can tell your skin is well protected.  I find it works best on damp skin.  I use it after a hyarulonic / glycolic syrum to clarify my skin and then this protects very nicely.  This is not a summer product, but it&#x27;s very nice for winter.  I would recommend for dry skin repair.  BTW, I also am prone to hormonal acne and this has not exacerbated it at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light moisturizer. This moisturizer keeps my skin feeling silky smooth especially in this bitter cold weather.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream.  Feels great, perfect weight/creaminess, moisturizes well.  Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I bought this product back when I was pregnant for a more natural moisturizer to use on my face that wouldn&#x27;t harm my baby.  However, I found after only a day or two of use, that my entire face broke out in a hive-like rash in what appears to be an allergic reaction.  At the time, I just attributed it to my pregnancy hormones and stopped using the product all together.  Now, 8 months post postpartum I try using the product again, and again break out in a bumpy red rash that covers my entire face.  The rash consists of little bumps that are itchy and almost resembles a sunburn since my face ultimately ends up drying out and peeling afterwards.  Very bizarre.  In both cases, it took around 2 weeks to rectify the problem by using special hydrating hypoallergenic face washes and moisturizes to get my face back to normal again.  While I truly wanted to like this product, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me - regardless of all thing pure or natural.  Unfortunately, I have no idea which ingredient(s) in the product that is causing the allergic reaction.  I wish I had a way of finding out.  At any rate, if you&#x27;re prone to having allergies, you may want to do a small test patch on your skin before covering an entire area.  An entire face rash in not a pleasant thing to try to cover-up or get rid of.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this product. Hoping it would be a good moisturizer I started using it right away. I do like the way it feels when applied, but after a few days of use,  I noticed my face started breaking out. If you don&#x27;t have issues with acne, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer, I might try another product next time though given its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: excellent Environmental Working Group rating, seems to work well, no weird smell&lt;br /&gt;cons: expensive, hard to rub in</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and so far I like it. It smells natural, like plants or something organic for the most part. It applies similar to sunscreen kinda...You really don&#x27;t need that much cuz it&#x27;s really concentrated! I guess I dipped a little too much as it literally looked like sunscreen with a white cast so I kept rubbing it in until it disappeared and it feels nice and moisturized but like I said it feels almost similar to sunscreen in a way with that filmy feel and oilyness.Maybe it could be that I haven&#x27;t used moisturizer in a while...anyway that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it. I am used to using oils, I use EVOO and coconut oil on my face. I use them as serums too before I use any kind of moisturizer (if I do use any moisturizer) but I don&#x27;t have moisturizer that&#x27;s thick as this formula. I&#x27;ve been on a search for moisturizer on those foundation days since I cannot use oils as the makeup will slide. I will update the difference in my skin in a few weeks to see if it&#x27;s dramatically diff or better than the oils itself. Also I bought this for $28 or 29 last week and the price went up for some reason? I forgot to mention that my face is sensitive, alot of face moisturizers have chemicals and it either burns or stings my face but this felt like nothing except the feeling of applying sunscreen like I said earlier lol My face is also extremely dry and even the oils do not work overnight alot of the time as I wake up to a dry flakey face (only around the mouth area and in btwn my eyebrows where a unibrow should be)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*OVERNIGHT update*&lt;br /&gt;2/5/13&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the area around my mouth isn&#x27;t as dry as usual so I guess that tells you something right? Well I washed my face and applied more this morning and for some reason it makes your face look really healthy. it has a sheen to it...I even washed my hands and wiped my face again and there&#x27;s a type of sheen on my hands, pretty much like sunscreen lol can&#x27;t describe...IDK what exactly is in this but on the EWG site it was rated hazardous 0 so that is mostly what made me purchase this. I am comparing it to the rosey cheeks moisturizer by cocoon apothecary. The rosey cheeks is a really thick moisturizer but it sinks in but so thick that you can still feel it on your face (even when you touch). I am looking for something REALLY creamy and thick. This bioelements is not creamy but thick in a weird way, like I said, it&#x27;s concentrated. The smell reminds me of the california baby lotion (the one in a jar)just a tad. anyways, will update in a few weeks....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/21/13&lt;br /&gt;My face looks alot better. The sheen is from the shea. Aside from the sheen my face does look more hydrated. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the consistency of this...or more like, I don&#x27;t like how it applies to the skin. I want something really creamy! So creamy it&#x27;s almost heavy! I guess great for day time but at night I want something super duper thick for these winter months. I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase. It has gotten rid of the dryness around my mouth though, as I use it day and night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/7/14&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a lengthy review BUT long story short...I am almost out of my first jar and am going to repurchase another!on the EWG site it was rated hazardous 0 so that is mostly what made me purchase this.

            <li> Fantastic moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry and sensitive skin. It is not greasy and has no smell to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer no scent rather than too much. Their Crucial Moisture has a nice, clean smell but not hydrating enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I bring to the table sensitive, combination skin.  I was worried, given the expense of this, that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good match for my skin, but I decided to risk it because of its good EWG rating.  And I have to say, since I started using All Things Pure, my skin has improved a fair amount: it is not flaky under my makeup anymore, and I have most definitely had fewer breakouts.  My skin also seems to heal faster with the extra moisture.  I usually use a heavier coat at night and it does take a little time to rub in fully, but I don&#x27;t find this overly bothersome.  I use a lighter coat in the morning and both powder and liquid make-up have gone on top just fine.  You do have to wash your make-up brushes a little more often though.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any major shine, as some reviewers complained of, but it can have a bit of a dewey effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***After about 6 jars of this stuff, I continue to love it.  The price does seem to fluctuate a fair amount, and I think it&#x27;s a good value at $30, given how long a jar lasts, but personally, I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay much more.</li>
            <li> I love that it feels clean and smells clean on my skin. I combine this with my sunblock, and they emulsifier together with no problems. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m on an all-natural and organic kick after reading so much about toxic things in kids products. I decided to try some alternatives to my (very expensive) current face lotion and found this on EWG.org.  My hopes were not very high but this moisturizer really surprised me. It went on so smoothly and lightly and felt wonderful. There is no fragrance that I can detect  (although I generally like cucumber/ avocado type smells -- so this is not necessarily a good thing). I really really like it. I&#x27;ve only used it a few days now but its a pleasure putting on  - no greasy feeling at all -- just feels like it was immediately soaked up by my skin and left it feeling very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 40-something ... not sure it will do much about looking my age ..but it sure feels good. Time will tell. In the meantime - I recommend it. It was safely and professionally packaged (at least 2 of the organic items I&#x27;ve ordered have not been) and arrived in a timely fashio.</li>
            <li> The title for my review speaks for itself. Love, love, love wearing this on my face and neck. I can wear it with some light foundation and blush. People tell me I&#x27;m \\&quot;glowing.\\&quot; Worth every penny.</li>
