            <li>Good stuff, works awesome wth DermaZinc soap as well.</li>
            <li>Worked great for my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>and it has been great for me.</li>
            <li>It is still working great.</li>
            <li>I am a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>It gives me relief when I have flare ups, and is a great moisturizer to go under my makeup</li>
            <li>So happy that I came across this.</li>
            <li>Works great for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Barlean&#x27;s is a great brand for cod liver oil, fish oil, and flax seed oil which help a lot of skin problems.  </li>
            <li>Works great on dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li>I have seborrheic dermatitis and this works great for me and no fragrance to burn my skin.</li>
            <li>works  great  </li>
            <li>It is great for flaky skin around nose, cheeks, eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li>I think the lotion works great.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing!</li>
            <li>pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly depressed by my seborrheic dermatitis as it invaded most of my face.</li>
            <li>I bought and loved this cream before, so when I ran out, I bought it again....</li>
            <li>but once under control the derma zinc is good for maintenance</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t eradicate seborrhea 100%, but it does a good job of assisting.  </li>
            <li>Its effect is not immediate but has good results.</li>
            <li>jar is probably a lifetime supply for me, so value wise</li>
            <li>I never thought that there would be a good solution for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I think this cream is a good alternative to shampoos or soaps since you can leave it on all day instead of needing to rinse it off.</li>
            <li>This works really good on psoriasis</li>
            <li>, it smells much better than the Rx cream, and absorbs into his skin very nicely without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Love this product also, will also reorder again!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is magic for my seb/derm!</li>
            <li>so I did my own research and decided to try dermazinc ( which by the way NO dermatologist ever recommended ) and got amazing results.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li>price is kind of steep for a person searching for a seb.</li>
            <li>It is not oily, but like a nice lotion.  </li>
            <li>and it was nice to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but hoped it would work better than the hydrocortisone, but it has worked awesomely!!  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the Noble Formula soap that I also purchased.</li>
            <li>If you are suffering from seborrheic dermatitis, this is the most affordable and effective product you can purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.</li>
            <li>I could not stop this with skin creams I tried, but after using this for some time, I received excellent results and completely got rid of the problem.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and so far this has given me my best results.</li>
            <li>It works better than any kind of cream you would buy at the store.</li>
            <li>Washing my face and hair with H&amp;S was the most effective way to keep the explosions at bay, but I would still have an oily face with a reddish complexion.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for the psoriasis on my scalp and nearly makes the psoriasis on my elbows disappear.</li>
            <li>It provides a cooling sensation that is welcome if you&#x27;ve been scratching too much!</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer and mild control for sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>Good luck, and much sympathy/empathy to those who continue to struggle to find help !!</li>
            <li>and I have been able to maintain control with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a rash on my face for more that 20 years.  </li>
            <li>This product worked better to cure it than any of the others that I tried.</li>
            <li>I was having ok luck hiding it with lotion...</li>
            <li>With lofty reviews for this product, we were hoping for more.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of 50 or more creams I bought for my condition.</li>
            <li>I think it worked better then</li>
            <li>He was able to shave with no irritations.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels 100% better.</li>
            <li>(see Dr. Mercola for more info)  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>:  This method of using DZ Soap &amp; DZ Cream 2 times per day produced better results for me than the approx.</li>
            <li>price is more than fair&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>more flaking skin</li>
            <li>Just a zinc cream from the drug store is probably better.</li>
            <li>I thought I just needed to moisturise more and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Drasting improvement in his brow area and his nose area is getting better.</li>
            <li>, i an i did not feel safe using it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with Seborrhoeic dermatitis or some equivalent for many years.</li>
            <li>Listen, there&#x27;s some sort of magical witchcraft happening here</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wished it worked, but now it&#x27;s another bottle of something that goes in with the three dozen or more products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than lotion from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>glad  amazon could help</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s not a cure</li>
            <li>Brilliant researchers at Dermalogix somehow concocted a formula that effectively removes all my facial irritation and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>For many years I have used a zinc pyrithione based lotion for the outbreaks on my face.</li>
            <li>DermaZinc makes a soap that is much better than the cream.</li>
            <li>Will follow up and post more in about a week.</li>
            <li>I tried to find SkinZinc brand and it looks like they aren&#x27;t making it any more.....</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t begin to explain how much better my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>and I can function without worrying about the condition of my skin....love, love, love.</li>
            <li>Cream is very smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li>I needs to be used very often to do the good intended.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent product for those with dermatitis or other skin conditions.</li>
            <li>The cream spreads easily, absorbs well, and did not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>And this works fine under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased with this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I have been totally free from the flaking and itching ever since.</li>
            <li>I already am on a gluten and dairy free diet, which by the way is root cause of this problem.</li>
            <li>, I lightly put in in areas where I am prone to get flare ups.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>If you stop use of this product the blemishes come back almost immediately, I am happy that it works</li>
            <li>Tried a few over the counter products, but nothing seemed to solve the problem, turned to Amazon for an answer, and  I found it in Dermazinc :D</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Great for bug bites and minor skin abrasions.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, I was looking better.</li>
            <li>, the cream seemed hopeful and I was excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth trying out!</li>
            <li>the results are 100% worth it!  </li>
            <li>Having suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for years, and having spent hundreds on dermatologist visits and prescription creams, nothing made me happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true fan.</li>
            <li>Now that summer has kicked in full gear, it&#x27;s as if this cream has no effect.</li>
            <li>More recently I&#x27;ve been able to control and reduce it through a variety of  means.  </li>
            <li>Glad I read up about this and was able to find on amazon, our local drug stores did not have any Pyrithione Zinc products except in dandruff shampoos which he tried on his face but the shampoo made him break out.</li>
            <li>and I get super itchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very much like some kind of typical medicated cream which is not terrible, nor all that strong, either</li>
            <li>I went through so many products until I realised it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;normal&#x27; and went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed.  </li>
            <li>got the shampoo, and that is working great for me, no burning, even when it runs down my skin when rinsing.</li>
            <li>i  have found derma zinc to be as good if not better than most presciption drugs     as a physician  </li>
            <li>And since the dermatitis went away during the first week, it has not returned!  </li>
            <li>I originally wrote a review raving about this product about 2 months ago on the first day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may seem pricey, but the jar is rather large and filled to the brim.</li>
            <li>It took a few week and was stinging in the beginning, but now it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>BEST of all, it completely resolved all signs of eczema after using for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>kind- usually to healthy oils and omega 3 fatty acids.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still worth trying.</li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and my skin is more clear than it has been in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flaking skin followed by redness which would sometimes clear itself, but rarely for more than a day.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Yeah, sure it sorta worked, took about a week to clear up.</li>
            <li>It also seems safe to use near your eyes, unlike soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li>even though it is a bit pricey at $19 for a 4oz jar, its is soooooo worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Your experience may be different, but this is as my name says honest experience.</li>
            <li>This clears it right up without the need for steroid based creams.</li>
            <li>It works great but its not recommended for long term use as it is a steroid and it doesn&#x27;t prevent flare ups, just made go away quicker when I do get a flare up, and my flare ups were frequent, like a week off then a week on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any major changes using it so probably won&#x27;t get any more.  </li>
            <li>Used several prescriptions which did not help and cost hundreds of $$$$  Found this online and gave it a try and can&#x27;t say enough about how great it works.  </li>
            <li>Had a tube of Rx Xolegel (Ketoconazole) gel from the Dermatologist which helped a little but not as good as the Cortizone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the first couple of days I would apply once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it works better than the RX recommended</li>
            <li>but I searched forums first and found a link in a Reddit skin care post that mentioned this cream specifically.</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally found this stuff after searching--literally for more than a year--for something that would take care of my flaking, yet oily skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed a change after the first day using dermazinc.</li>
            <li>My hairline and scalp suffer a similar condition, and I&#x27;ve begun to use it there as well with a similar successful result.</li>
            <li>No smell, no residue, no weird feeling on the skin after.</li>
            <li>And throughout my teen life till now, my skin dries up real quick</li>
            <li>HAHA!</li>
            <li>, there are so many alternate ingredients that will preserve that are non parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>when i started using it consistently about 4 times a week it started to work on Seborrheic Dermatitis / Rosacea which mostly went away in about a week and has not came back yet for months.</li>
            <li>The cream does exactly what it says, it stopped my itching, stopped my flaking, and stopped my inflammation.</li>
            <li>It reduced my breakouts and overall my skin looks 80% better.</li>
            <li>I was advised of many  things and had limited success on my skin / hand eruptions untill I tried derma-  Zink.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps put the fire out and stops the intense itching and is better than a steroid for your health.  </li>
            <li>Upon first application it really burned.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, and was hoping it would be the answer to my extremely dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>Dandruff shampoos often contain this active ingredient this has but the fragrances are very strong.</li>
            <li>wasted money entirely, be sure to check expiration or ask before purchasing!</li>
            <li>Truly this stuff is amazing and is the only thing that actually works.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the cream is really flimsy.</li>
            <li>All I really needed was this.</li>
            <li>.. wish we found much sooner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>However, the real problem is an allergy, food or environmental, or deficiency of some</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Didnt do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t smell an odor (however, everything &amp;#34;technically&amp;#34; has an odor).  </li>
            <li>I can wear short sleeve shirts again and my wallet is not so light.</li>
            <li>It clears up the flakiness and irritation very well</li>
            <li>If you have flacky skin, this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>But now Since I bought this product, it really works and helps my itchiness.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product, if your body itches a lot.</li>
            <li>The cream soaks into your skin, works very well.</li>
            <li>It didnt do much for me.</li>
            <li>The itching, redness, and scaling have really improved.</li>
            <li>Really have worsening dermatitis (dandruff on my face...according to my Dr) on my face, head, beard, scalp...was getting mortifyingly embarassing.</li>
            <li>Didnt have much hope, as scrips and over the counter products</li>
            <li>This cream was to much for my face, maybe it works for others.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Bought reg product from other site and 100x better and won&#x27;t expire til 2014.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I have seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this and wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>I only use a small dab each time, so it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine, it was greasy and left his skin greasy as well, but it did clear up the flaking though not all the redness.</li>
            <li>I had been having mild SD flaking start up over the last 6-8 months on my face.</li>
            <li>the container is a decent size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>suffered with psoriasis for years  mainly plaque psoriasis of elbows   </li>
            <li>It actually made my skin more red and flakey and now I am having to find a product&lt;</li>
            <li>if you suffer from any seborrheic condition, I highly recommend this stuff</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone suffering from chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Within about 2-3 days of applying it 2-4 times a day, my SD went away by about 70% and it is progressively still getting better by a little here and there after another week&#x27;s sporadic use.</li>
            <li>, the peeling is gone, the redness has turned to a light pink.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and really helps to aleve the redness.  </li>
            <li>This pretty much used up the entire container</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review things I buy on amazon, but this stuff blew me away.</li>
            <li>It NEVER burns normally,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve visited quite a few dermatologist and tried many prescription creams and well as over the counter creams and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mark the star rating down because that&#x27;s not something easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;that will help erase the new damage done...</li>
            <li>This was the first over-the-counter product to offer total relief.</li>
            <li>Oh-- and the package came a week early!</li>
            <li>I am now in my 40&#x27;s, so I can say i&#x27;ve pretty much tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used prescription steroids which work beautifully, but long term are bad for you.</li>
            <li>Worked really well, and really fast to clear up my dry flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li>his skin is clear.</li>
            <li>and my face has never been this clear.</li>
            <li>Since my face is clear now and no signs of flaking, I apply just once a</li>
            <li>is clear</li>
            <li>I had been on topical steroids and anti-fungals, neither really worked for me but this stuff helped my skin, kept me clear of pealing or redness.  </li>
            <li>and  was not thinking clearly,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mainly I have spots between and around my eyebrows, on my cheeks near my noise, and around my sideburns where they meet my beard.</li>
            <li>My dandruff is completely gone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eczema since i was in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>try Dr. Bronner&#x27;s or Young Living.</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you are sensitive to lanolin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t to say that it is a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; product, but I either personally have a very adverse reaction to it, or there is something off about the container</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old now.</li>
            <li>I thought my face was red before(seb derm), but it was much brighter red(and inflamed) after using this product for 2 days.</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would be a good alternative to expensive prescriptions, but did not work for my needs.</li>
            <li>Highly frustrating, I surely had high hopes.</li>
            <li>This is a nice enough cream, but not a good one if you are looking to deliver a lot of zinc to your skin to heal a skin condition.</li>
            <li>I do have classic sebborhea with regular flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>I had a particularly intractable bout recently that was impervious to the variety of prescription and non prescription creams, shampoos and ointments</li>
            <li>Works very well on dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I did have success using apple cider vinegar though oddly.</li>
            <li>I let it sit a while, thinking it would quickly pass, but after a few minutes of a severe burning sensation I had to try to wash it off.</li>
            <li>Im not sure of the effects of this according to data, but I not only do not have any more problems, my skin is back to the way it was before over 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>After applying it twice the first day [once in the morning, once at night] I noticed that my skin was starting to get very dry.</li>
            <li>I did have a burning reaction when I applied it to an open area, but otherwise no other problem (and I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>and my skin just looks generally</li>
            <li>ordered this on a whim, and it worked, within a few days my face was calm again.</li>
            <li>Only thing that beats it in my opinion is steroid creams which knock it out completely.</li>
            <li>My dentist had a similar skin problem for 20 years and got rid of it by switching to natural products-</li>
            <li>BioKleen for all cleaning and laundry and natural soaps and shampoos that are essential oil based-</li>
            <li>have had Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD) on my face/around my nose for the bulk of my adult life, and saw multiple Dermatologists all prescribing creams, ointments, pads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a 2 days of using it, up 4 times a day, I noticed the red, itchy and flaky spots started appearing on my forehead and T-zone started getting worse and at this point I was recovering nicely from a recent flare-up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>After trying what felt like 100&#x27;s of different product to help with the psorasis on my legs, intense itching, dry skin, sores, etc.</li>
            <li>They have all concluded that this product works better than any other remedy they&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I usually use it during the flare ups as it tends to get rid of them fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>0.25% is a much lower concentration of zinc than other zinc preparations.  </li>
            <li>My husband started suffering from red and frequently flaking skin while in college and finally went to a dermatologist once he had graduated, got a job, and had health insurance.</li>
            <li>I think for the first couple of weeks, my face seemed to respond positively.&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts and dry red areas cleared up, but it was like if I missed even a SINGLE wash in the morning or at night, my face was breaking out in acne or rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to 2 dermatologists and a general practitioner, and was told the same thing, to use a steroid cream (prescription) and anti-fungal creams..</li>
            <li>Look down at your plate and really look at what you eat.</li>
            <li>Yet, lately my seborrheic dermatitis has been worse and none of the prescribed ointments were successful.</li>
            <li>my complexion back to the way it was before this whole mess started and no explosions to speak of yet.  </li>
            <li>I only ever use a tiny amount (less than a pea size for my whole face).</li>

            <li> Good stuff, works awesome wth DermaZinc soap as well.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> and it has been great for me.</li>
            <li> It is still working great.</li>
            <li> I am a happy customer.  </li>
            <li> It gives me relief when I have flare ups, and is a great moisturizer to go under my makeup</li>
            <li> So happy that I came across this.</li>
            <li> Works great for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Barlean&#x27;s is a great brand for cod liver oil, fish oil, and flax seed oil which help a lot of skin problems.  </li>
            <li> Works great on dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and this works great for me and no fragrance to burn my skin.</li>
            <li> works  great  </li>
            <li> It is great for flaky skin around nose, cheeks, eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> I think the lotion works great.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing!</li>
            <li> pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly depressed by my seborrheic dermatitis as it invaded most of my face.</li>
            <li> I bought and loved this cream before, so when I ran out, I bought it again....</li>
            <li> but once under control the derma zinc is good for maintenance</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t eradicate seborrhea 100%, but it does a good job of assisting.  </li>
            <li> Its effect is not immediate but has good results.</li>
            <li> jar is probably a lifetime supply for me, so value wise</li>
            <li> I never thought that there would be a good solution for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is a good alternative to shampoos or soaps since you can leave it on all day instead of needing to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> This works really good on psoriasis</li>
            <li> , it smells much better than the Rx cream, and absorbs into his skin very nicely without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this product also, will also reorder again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is magic for my seb/derm!</li>
            <li> so I did my own research and decided to try dermazinc ( which by the way NO dermatologist ever recommended ) and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li> price is kind of steep for a person searching for a seb.</li>
            <li> It is not oily, but like a nice lotion.  </li>
            <li> and it was nice to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but hoped it would work better than the hydrocortisone, but it has worked awesomely!!  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the Noble Formula soap that I also purchased.</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from seborrheic dermatitis, this is the most affordable and effective product you can purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.</li>
            <li> I could not stop this with skin creams I tried, but after using this for some time, I received excellent results and completely got rid of the problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and so far this has given me my best results.</li>
            <li> It works better than any kind of cream you would buy at the store.</li>
            <li> Washing my face and hair with H&amp;S was the most effective way to keep the explosions at bay, but I would still have an oily face with a reddish complexion.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for the psoriasis on my scalp and nearly makes the psoriasis on my elbows disappear.</li>
            <li> It provides a cooling sensation that is welcome if you&#x27;ve been scratching too much!</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer and mild control for sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> Good luck, and much sympathy/empathy to those who continue to struggle to find help !!</li>
            <li> and I have been able to maintain control with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rash on my face for more that 20 years.  </li>
            <li> This product worked better to cure it than any of the others that I tried.</li>
            <li> I was having ok luck hiding it with lotion...</li>
            <li> With lofty reviews for this product, we were hoping for more.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of 50 or more creams I bought for my condition.</li>
            <li> I think it worked better then</li>
            <li> He was able to shave with no irritations.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels 100% better.</li>
            <li> (see Dr. Mercola for more info)  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> :  This method of using DZ Soap &amp; DZ Cream 2 times per day produced better results for me than the approx.</li>
            <li> price is more than fair&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> more flaking skin</li>
            <li> Just a zinc cream from the drug store is probably better.</li>
            <li> I thought I just needed to moisturise more and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Drasting improvement in his brow area and his nose area is getting better.</li>
            <li> , i an i did not feel safe using it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with Seborrhoeic dermatitis or some equivalent for many years.</li>
            <li> Listen, there&#x27;s some sort of magical witchcraft happening here</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wished it worked, but now it&#x27;s another bottle of something that goes in with the three dozen or more products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than lotion from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> glad  amazon could help</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s not a cure</li>
            <li> Brilliant researchers at Dermalogix somehow concocted a formula that effectively removes all my facial irritation and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> For many years I have used a zinc pyrithione based lotion for the outbreaks on my face.</li>
            <li> DermaZinc makes a soap that is much better than the cream.</li>
            <li> Will follow up and post more in about a week.</li>
            <li> I tried to find SkinZinc brand and it looks like they aren&#x27;t making it any more.....</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t begin to explain how much better my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> and I can function without worrying about the condition of my skin....love, love, love.</li>
            <li> Cream is very smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li> I needs to be used very often to do the good intended.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent product for those with dermatitis or other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> The cream spreads easily, absorbs well, and did not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> And this works fine under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I have been totally free from the flaking and itching ever since.</li>
            <li> I already am on a gluten and dairy free diet, which by the way is root cause of this problem.</li>
            <li> , I lightly put in in areas where I am prone to get flare ups.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> If you stop use of this product the blemishes come back almost immediately, I am happy that it works</li>
            <li> Tried a few over the counter products, but nothing seemed to solve the problem, turned to Amazon for an answer, and  I found it in Dermazinc :D</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Great for bug bites and minor skin abrasions.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, I was looking better.</li>
            <li> , the cream seemed hopeful and I was excited.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth trying out!</li>
            <li> the results are 100% worth it!  </li>
            <li> Having suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for years, and having spent hundreds on dermatologist visits and prescription creams, nothing made me happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true fan.</li>
            <li> Now that summer has kicked in full gear, it&#x27;s as if this cream has no effect.</li>
            <li> More recently I&#x27;ve been able to control and reduce it through a variety of  means.  </li>
            <li> Glad I read up about this and was able to find on amazon, our local drug stores did not have any Pyrithione Zinc products except in dandruff shampoos which he tried on his face but the shampoo made him break out.</li>
            <li> and I get super itchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells very much like some kind of typical medicated cream which is not terrible, nor all that strong, either</li>
            <li> I went through so many products until I realised it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;normal&#x27; and went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed.  </li>
            <li> got the shampoo, and that is working great for me, no burning, even when it runs down my skin when rinsing.</li>
            <li> i  have found derma zinc to be as good if not better than most presciption drugs     as a physician  </li>
            <li> And since the dermatitis went away during the first week, it has not returned!  </li>
            <li> I originally wrote a review raving about this product about 2 months ago on the first day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may seem pricey, but the jar is rather large and filled to the brim.</li>
            <li> It took a few week and was stinging in the beginning, but now it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> BEST of all, it completely resolved all signs of eczema after using for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> kind- usually to healthy oils and omega 3 fatty acids.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still worth trying.</li>
            <li> Worth a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and my skin is more clear than it has been in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flaking skin followed by redness which would sometimes clear itself, but rarely for more than a day.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Yeah, sure it sorta worked, took about a week to clear up.</li>
            <li> It also seems safe to use near your eyes, unlike soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li> even though it is a bit pricey at $19 for a 4oz jar, its is soooooo worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Your experience may be different, but this is as my name says honest experience.</li>
            <li> This clears it right up without the need for steroid based creams.</li>
            <li> It works great but its not recommended for long term use as it is a steroid and it doesn&#x27;t prevent flare ups, just made go away quicker when I do get a flare up, and my flare ups were frequent, like a week off then a week on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any major changes using it so probably won&#x27;t get any more.  </li>
            <li> Used several prescriptions which did not help and cost hundreds of $$$$  Found this online and gave it a try and can&#x27;t say enough about how great it works.  </li>
            <li> Had a tube of Rx Xolegel (Ketoconazole) gel from the Dermatologist which helped a little but not as good as the Cortizone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the first couple of days I would apply once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it works better than the RX recommended</li>
            <li> but I searched forums first and found a link in a Reddit skin care post that mentioned this cream specifically.</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally found this stuff after searching--literally for more than a year--for something that would take care of my flaking, yet oily skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change after the first day using dermazinc.</li>
            <li> My hairline and scalp suffer a similar condition, and I&#x27;ve begun to use it there as well with a similar successful result.</li>
            <li> No smell, no residue, no weird feeling on the skin after.</li>
            <li> And throughout my teen life till now, my skin dries up real quick</li>
            <li> HAHA!</li>
            <li> , there are so many alternate ingredients that will preserve that are non parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> when i started using it consistently about 4 times a week it started to work on Seborrheic Dermatitis / Rosacea which mostly went away in about a week and has not came back yet for months.</li>
            <li> The cream does exactly what it says, it stopped my itching, stopped my flaking, and stopped my inflammation.</li>
            <li> It reduced my breakouts and overall my skin looks 80% better.</li>
            <li> I was advised of many  things and had limited success on my skin / hand eruptions untill I tried derma-  Zink.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps put the fire out and stops the intense itching and is better than a steroid for your health.  </li>
            <li> Upon first application it really burned.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, and was hoping it would be the answer to my extremely dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> Dandruff shampoos often contain this active ingredient this has but the fragrances are very strong.</li>
            <li> wasted money entirely, be sure to check expiration or ask before purchasing!</li>
            <li> Truly this stuff is amazing and is the only thing that actually works.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the cream is really flimsy.</li>
            <li> All I really needed was this.</li>
            <li> .. wish we found much sooner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> However, the real problem is an allergy, food or environmental, or deficiency of some</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Didnt do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t smell an odor (however, everything &amp;#34;technically&amp;#34; has an odor).  </li>
            <li> I can wear short sleeve shirts again and my wallet is not so light.</li>
            <li> It clears up the flakiness and irritation very well</li>
            <li> If you have flacky skin, this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> But now Since I bought this product, it really works and helps my itchiness.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product, if your body itches a lot.</li>
            <li> The cream soaks into your skin, works very well.</li>
            <li> It didnt do much for me.</li>
            <li> The itching, redness, and scaling have really improved.</li>
            <li> Really have worsening dermatitis (dandruff on my face...according to my Dr) on my face, head, beard, scalp...was getting mortifyingly embarassing.</li>
            <li> Didnt have much hope, as scrips and over the counter products</li>
            <li> This cream was to much for my face, maybe it works for others.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Bought reg product from other site and 100x better and won&#x27;t expire til 2014.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I have seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this and wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I only use a small dab each time, so it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine, it was greasy and left his skin greasy as well, but it did clear up the flaking though not all the redness.</li>
            <li> I had been having mild SD flaking start up over the last 6-8 months on my face.</li>
            <li> the container is a decent size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> suffered with psoriasis for years  mainly plaque psoriasis of elbows   </li>
            <li> It actually made my skin more red and flakey and now I am having to find a product&lt;</li>
            <li> if you suffer from any seborrheic condition, I highly recommend this stuff</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone suffering from chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Within about 2-3 days of applying it 2-4 times a day, my SD went away by about 70% and it is progressively still getting better by a little here and there after another week&#x27;s sporadic use.</li>
            <li> , the peeling is gone, the redness has turned to a light pink.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and really helps to aleve the redness.  </li>
            <li> This pretty much used up the entire container</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review things I buy on amazon, but this stuff blew me away.</li>
            <li> It NEVER burns normally,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve visited quite a few dermatologist and tried many prescription creams and well as over the counter creams and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mark the star rating down because that&#x27;s not something easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;that will help erase the new damage done...</li>
            <li> This was the first over-the-counter product to offer total relief.</li>
            <li> Oh-- and the package came a week early!</li>
            <li> I am now in my 40&#x27;s, so I can say i&#x27;ve pretty much tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used prescription steroids which work beautifully, but long term are bad for you.</li>
            <li> Worked really well, and really fast to clear up my dry flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li> his skin is clear.</li>
            <li> and my face has never been this clear.</li>
            <li> Since my face is clear now and no signs of flaking, I apply just once a</li>
            <li> is clear</li>
            <li> I had been on topical steroids and anti-fungals, neither really worked for me but this stuff helped my skin, kept me clear of pealing or redness.  </li>
            <li> and  was not thinking clearly,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mainly I have spots between and around my eyebrows, on my cheeks near my noise, and around my sideburns where they meet my beard.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is completely gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema since i was in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> try Dr. Bronner&#x27;s or Young Living.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you are sensitive to lanolin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t to say that it is a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; product, but I either personally have a very adverse reaction to it, or there is something off about the container</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old now.</li>
            <li> I thought my face was red before(seb derm), but it was much brighter red(and inflamed) after using this product for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would be a good alternative to expensive prescriptions, but did not work for my needs.</li>
            <li> Highly frustrating, I surely had high hopes.</li>
            <li> This is a nice enough cream, but not a good one if you are looking to deliver a lot of zinc to your skin to heal a skin condition.</li>
            <li> I do have classic sebborhea with regular flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> I had a particularly intractable bout recently that was impervious to the variety of prescription and non prescription creams, shampoos and ointments</li>
            <li> Works very well on dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I did have success using apple cider vinegar though oddly.</li>
            <li> I let it sit a while, thinking it would quickly pass, but after a few minutes of a severe burning sensation I had to try to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Im not sure of the effects of this according to data, but I not only do not have any more problems, my skin is back to the way it was before over 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> After applying it twice the first day [once in the morning, once at night] I noticed that my skin was starting to get very dry.</li>
            <li> I did have a burning reaction when I applied it to an open area, but otherwise no other problem (and I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> and my skin just looks generally</li>
            <li> ordered this on a whim, and it worked, within a few days my face was calm again.</li>
            <li> Only thing that beats it in my opinion is steroid creams which knock it out completely.</li>
            <li> My dentist had a similar skin problem for 20 years and got rid of it by switching to natural products-</li>
            <li> BioKleen for all cleaning and laundry and natural soaps and shampoos that are essential oil based-</li>
            <li> have had Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD) on my face/around my nose for the bulk of my adult life, and saw multiple Dermatologists all prescribing creams, ointments, pads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a 2 days of using it, up 4 times a day, I noticed the red, itchy and flaky spots started appearing on my forehead and T-zone started getting worse and at this point I was recovering nicely from a recent flare-up.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> After trying what felt like 100&#x27;s of different product to help with the psorasis on my legs, intense itching, dry skin, sores, etc.</li>
            <li> They have all concluded that this product works better than any other remedy they&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually use it during the flare ups as it tends to get rid of them fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> 0.25% is a much lower concentration of zinc than other zinc preparations.  </li>
            <li> My husband started suffering from red and frequently flaking skin while in college and finally went to a dermatologist once he had graduated, got a job, and had health insurance.</li>
            <li> I think for the first couple of weeks, my face seemed to respond positively.&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts and dry red areas cleared up, but it was like if I missed even a SINGLE wash in the morning or at night, my face was breaking out in acne or rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to 2 dermatologists and a general practitioner, and was told the same thing, to use a steroid cream (prescription) and anti-fungal creams..</li>
            <li> Look down at your plate and really look at what you eat.</li>
            <li> Yet, lately my seborrheic dermatitis has been worse and none of the prescribed ointments were successful.</li>
            <li> my complexion back to the way it was before this whole mess started and no explosions to speak of yet.  </li>
            <li> I only ever use a tiny amount (less than a pea size for my whole face).</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have tried several other solutions but never found anything that completely worked, give this a try.</li>
            <li> The jar popped out from the inner layer after the first time I used it, making it really hard to open and close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this has zinc in it and over long term is not going to cause potential harm to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has zero smell, is lighter than the heavy butter or paste consistencies I was trying in other anti-fungal solutions, and absolutely restored my face to the glory it was before seborrheic dermatitis ever appeared!  </li>
            <li> Cream blends fabulously in skin; however, if your skin condition is bad, you really need prescription strength to soothe skin itch and flare up.</li>
            <li> Now I just use it from time to time when I see my skin starting to dry up again.</li>
            <li> I dealt with red dry skin on face, and this has cleared it drastically.</li>
            <li> I purchased the zinc cream a few months back  and to my astonishment the redness and flaking have cleared completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, red, and flaky skin around my nose for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Desperation drive men to do many crazy things.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times per week and my face has remained clear for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: December 2012.</li>
            <li> Cancer is a big secret that the medical association wants to hide.</li>
            <li> I have long had Seborrheic dermatitis on my checks, and have always had to use prescription steroid creams to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I have had minor eczema on my hand for years.  </li>
            <li> Not completely..</li>
            <li> For what it does, I don&#x27;t mind paying the cost and the jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different face washes, vasiline, and cortizone creams with no real results.</li>
            <li> I have never been without a flareup this long (about 7 weeks now).  </li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I have a small patch of Seb Derm near my eye, which is why the usual prescribed treatment of washing with dandruff shampoo doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> You have to leave the shampoo on your face for a few minutes in order for the chemicals to penetrate and kill off the fungus that causes the dermatitis, but you can see why that would be problematic if your dermatitis is in a sensitive spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with psoriasis and for years used very expensive topical steroid creams and other topical ointments even laser treatments but never go better.</li>
            <li> In fact this stuff burns intensely right after applying it to my face and within an hour my face around my nose was peeling worse than ever.  </li>
            <li> contact, it makes my skin really red, which goes away after a couple of hours, but it clears up the other symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to the other product, and probably back to the dermatologist for me.</li>
            <li> cannot use them due to fear of cancer reports involving parabens and considering id be using this daily, it&#x27;s just too often to take the risk.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels a little irritated after initially applying; however, it goes away in a short duration-</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a sting, but far less than the other one I was using.</li>
            <li> do not feel I have an allergy to Dimethicone, as I used it on dry hands and elbows plenty of times with no</li>
            <li> By the end of the night my face was so dry and cracked that I had sheets of skin flaking off.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin problems that I believe are a &amp;#34;side effect&amp;#34; of diabetes.  </li>
            <li> I kept it, and waited a few weeks to give it a second try, but I had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> try it once 4 times a day and felt my face really harsh and itchy, I think there is no need to apply it that often, and dont conbine it with other stuff directly on the problem it will make your face RED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> occasionally when the area starts to look dry, probably every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was having a rough time with spots on my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> but in the last few weeks, it was getting WAY out of control.</li>
            <li> after that..within a few hours you can already see the redness starting to leave.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how the summer plays out.</li>
            <li> and I get a few red blemishes under my eyes,</li>
            <li> if you stop use it will come back in a few weeks not days.</li>
            <li> I also rotate two DHS shampoos (zinc and tar), as well as use dead sea mineral sulfer soap occasionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably spent $100s on creams to no avail.</li>
            <li> I bought it for dry flaky skin to help control it, but had no success with this product.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate when it flares up and try to get healed asap when my face is raw and red after exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again if needed but a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> There is a slight burning sensation when I applied it to my eczema inflamed skin..but only for a few seconds...</li>
            <li> used everyday, this cream will last you about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Purchased for itching and scaliness due to seborrheic dermatitis because I read that zinc is helpful for this condition.</li>
            <li> only have to use a small bit on the affected areas</li>
            <li> but I have used other products that will get rid of seborrheic dermatitis and</li>
            <li> No more flakes just a bit of redness, which is totally manageable with makeup.</li>
            <li> As the label suggests, I apply it several times per day, usually once in the morning and once in the evening.</li>
            <li> so i rotate other products with it to keep my skin guessing.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I bought this cream, which has the same active ingredient as shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders, and have been using it for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> product was one month from expiring and was not useful at all.</li>
            <li> and now I can control dermatitis appearing in average once every 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my face got wet, as soon as it dried it would get flaky.</li>
            <li> The cream has stopped the iching and my skin is a little less rough.</li>
            <li> When the ZNP bar got shut down, I ended up buying an assortment of products off of amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil production is way down</li>
            <li> In the past, ketoconazole seemed to help a little in the past, but never really cleared it up totally.  </li>
            <li> cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it very thick and hard to rub in, but I didn&#x27;t mind that so much.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount (a finger tip) each day now, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that expensive and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a candida sufferer and have had this problem for half a century.  </li>
            <li> I get much less scaling</li>
            <li> He was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and got an Rx for the typical creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the DermaZinc cream for three years now and it has made my life significantly less stressful.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 hrs I started to see a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> read the ingredients and other reviews before purchasing, and I really had high hopes for this cream, and so I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> they either would either have little or no effect.</li>
            <li> Now after using DermaZinc and a Tea tree face wash for a little over a month I&#x27;ve stopped using my prescription.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use the cream and there would be little flakes of skin stuck in it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I was given a prescription cream (edicil) that had little effect from a dermatologist years ago.</li>
            <li> Now I just put a little bit 1 time a week.</li>
            <li> and I suspect that it&#x27;s the Dimethicone since it forms a barrier to hold in moisture which also does little to help control the yeast</li>
            <li> Besides, dandruff shampoo on your face is a little harsh over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy going on, but it works.</li>
            <li> It might be a little heavy for acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Gel, worked for a little while but irritation persisted and I stopped after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I would expect that any product wouldn&#x27;t feel amazing if you put it on reddened, rashy skin, but this just hurt terribly and did nothing to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Heavy flaking, redness, etc.</li>
            <li> I used to until everything was cleared up, and a few days after.</li>
            <li> This has calmed the areas, even with just a few days use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a terrible problem with spontaneous cuts and irritated skin on my hands for years.  </li>
            <li> I went without it on/off a few times to see if it returned, and it always did.</li>
            <li> This actually makes my eczema condition worse.</li>
            <li> few words of warning.  </li>
            <li> also use the DermaZinc soap, but it&#x27;s not as helpful (I still use it everyday on my face though).  </li>
            <li> Flash forward a few years</li>
            <li> He started using it a few months ago</li>
            <li> Actually made it worse.  </li>
            <li> dermatitis actually spread and got worse.</li>
            <li> I posted a few pictures to show what my Perioral dermatitis looks like now.</li>
            <li> After using a Zinc based shampoo that cleared up my scalp very well, I looked for a cream with a similar zinc base.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after the rave reviews from others for treating Seborrhoeic Dermatitis and after trying several dozens of creams, ointments and other products, I was skeptical but gave it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, if you are on the fence and are tired of having a raw red face and all the flakes in your eye brows and beard, give this product a shot, you WON&#x27;T regret it!!</li>
            <li> Product actually made my skin worse not better.  </li>
            <li> And im very sorry to those who didnt find relief with this product (try it in a small area, at first).</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using it, however, my skin was unbelievably flaky.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhea and try everything I can find to try to slow it down and control it.  </li>
            <li> My skin used to feel itchy, flaky and raw almost all the time.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick but absorbs well with some rubbing and leaves skin with a slightly powdery finish.</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to work well, but it stings and burns so badly every time I apply that it brought tears to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I use small amount in my face every day and don&#x27;t have to worry about seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I thought I MIGHT have seborrheic dermatitis, but was never sure.</li>
            <li> This stuff does contain some heavier moisturizers--and It DOES contain a small amount of lanolin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using another product and having mixed results, and wanted something that would take away all the weird wrinkles the seb derm has given me.</li>
            <li> This stuff will destroy seborrheic dermatitis on your face!  </li>
            <li> I was getting flaking around the sides of my nose and face around the nose, a small area.</li>
            <li> No more flaking around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> No more flaking, his skin is even in tone</li>
            <li> and he has no more redness at all</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> For the past 5 years I&#x27;ve had an oily face that was prone to explosions of SD.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would work</li>
            <li> This has become my year round cream!</li>
            <li> It was embarrassing to say the least.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I splash my face with some cold water just to get the night off</li>
            <li> but I am trying to find an alternative since I am not too crazy about using Hydrocortisone for the long term.  </li>
            <li> Well it feels like that seriously.  </li>
            <li> worked but it have a bad effect on your skin in the long term.</li>
            <li> I  had to call in sick for a month from work, after hiding inside for so long and waiting patiently  for that cream  to give me some relief</li>
            <li> NO MORE FLAKING/REDNESS/SORES!!</li>
            <li> use this product on my chest, ankles, and sometimes behind my ears too if they ever start getting seborrhea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it did nothing but make my seb dermatitis worse.</li>
            <li> I was using cortizone, but it has side effects and you&#x27;re not suppose to use over the long term :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works for my annoying face.</li>
            <li> the manufacturer put in place to protect the cream was broken.</li>
            <li> I have never had this issue with red/rashy/dry skin, but it&#x27;s gotten worse and now even this cream doesn&#x27;t seem to have the impact it did before.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, possibly a bad lot.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Sorry about rant, but I feel like I have to tell everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks fo reading, even though I went off topic.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the cream burned and reddened my skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff for my facial SD.</li>
            <li> This time the cream had a sand-like texture and was very irritating.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> This was over two months ago and my face is still a terrible mess.</li>
            <li> Just bought this for my husband who suffers from seborrheic dermatitis, it is on his cheeks under his eyes, peeling under his eyebrows &amp; where his beard is.</li>
            <li> morning, I wash with the DZ Soap, rinse with cold water, &amp; then apply DZ Cream.  </li>
            <li> Those with the condition know it flares up when the place gets cold, even AC can set it</li>
            <li> The product I was using is very expensive, so I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> I have not had a bad flare up since I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> Instead it badly clogged my pores (something I&#x27;ve never had a problem with) and it took weeks to undo the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and it was getting so so bad and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> My face started to get swollen immediately, it burned so bad that I was in tears.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s embarrassing because everyone can see how bad your skin looks.</li>
            <li> The SD on my face was so bad at that time</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will have to return it because I&#x27;m just disgusted.</li>
            <li> One star because I was so disappointed to read this had parabens.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed but its a crap shoot with psoriasis and dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I wanted this cream to work so badly!</li>
            <li> When I have a flare up, it can be very painful.</li>
            <li> I have crazy skin in the winter- oily but flaky as a molting snake!!</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Basically like the awful pics you see when you do a Google image search for SD.</li>
            <li> I get acne on my body real bad, and I&#x27;ve used tons of creams to soothe my itchiness because I would scratch my acne</li>
            <li> I had horrible dermatitis on my face, noticed after just one day the difference.</li>
            <li> The cream burned and irritated my skin terribly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Helping with my husbands dermatitis</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Time will tell if it performs as described.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly and I like the product</li>
            <li> Love this product also, will also reorder again!</li>
            <li> Works very well on dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this has kept it under control for 2 years without needed Rx medications. I used the Rx to get it under control and I have been able to maintain control with this product. I did have a burning reaction when I applied it to an open area, but otherwise no other problem (and I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> pleasant to use. soothing. not greasy and not containing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my husband and it hasn&#x27;t gotten an outbreak ever since.&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy with the results it&#x27;s been over a month and his skin is clear.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for seborrheic dermatitis. I use small amount in my face every day and don&#x27;t have to worry about seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rash on my face for more that 20 years.  This product worked better to cure it than any of the others that I tried.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my Seborrheic dermatitis. It burnt very badly instantly.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my second week of using this and I am absolutely loving it. I was incredibly depressed by my seborrheic dermatitis as it invaded most of my face. In the first couple of days I would apply once in the morning and once at night. 2 weeks in and my face has never been this clear. I tried Lamasil Ultra and that stopped working after about a week. Since my face is clear now and no signs of flaking, I apply just once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is kind of steep for a person searching for a seb. derm. solution, but trust me, it works. God forbid this stuff stop working for me.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis 30 years ago. I was told back then that there was no cure. however, It could be treated. sine then I have been to 4 different dermatologist. they wrote me scripts for dozens of different treatments. they either would either have little or no effect. so I did my own research and decided to try dermazinc ( which by the way NO dermatologist ever recommended ) and got amazing results. if you suffer from any seborrheic condition, I highly recommend this stuff</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it works better than the RX recommended</li>
            <li> Worked great for my seborrheic dermatitis. I was having a rough time with spots on my eyes and forehead. After I switched to this cream + cetaphil cleaner twice a day, I got all cleared. It took a few week and was stinging in the beginning, but now it&#x27;s great. + it&#x27;s OTC, so it feels safer than ketoconazole (which stopped working for me anyway). I strongly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since January 2010 and it has been great for me. Nothing else worked on my dermatitis. I use it a few times per week and my face has remained clear for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: December 2012. It is still working great. If I stop using it my dermatitis comes back but once daily use keeps it under control This container last me about a year.</li>
            <li> After trying what felt like 100&#x27;s of different product to help with the psorasis on my legs, intense itching, dry skin, sores, etc. this cream has been a miracle for me.  Used several prescriptions which did not help and cost hundreds of $$$$  Found this online and gave it a try and can&#x27;t say enough about how great it works.  Use it after every shower and can put sunscreen over it.  It has taken about 2 months to produce results but it works.  I am a happy customer.  1 jar lasts about 1 month if you use it everyday and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Very low concentration of zinc.  0.25% is a much lower concentration of zinc than other zinc preparations.  This is a nice enough cream, but not a good one if you are looking to deliver a lot of zinc to your skin to heal a skin condition.</li>
            <li> Finally a cream to help with my sebohric dermatitis.  It gives me relief when I have flare ups, and is a great moisturizer to go under my makeup</li>
            <li> I had been having mild SD flaking start up over the last 6-8 months on my face. I was having ok luck hiding it with lotion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mainly I have spots between and around my eyebrows, on my cheeks near my noise, and around my sideburns where they meet my beard. It was manageable for a while but in the last few weeks, it was getting WAY out of control. Heavy flaking, redness, etc. Basically like the awful pics you see when you do a Google image search for SD. It was starting to draw comments from others and drive me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was debating going to a dermatologist (and I don&#x27;t have insurance) but I searched forums first and found a link in a Reddit skin care post that mentioned this cream specifically. So, I decided to give it a try. Within about 2-3 days of applying it 2-4 times a day, my SD went away by about 70% and it is progressively still getting better by a little here and there after another week&#x27;s sporadic use. You can&#x27;t tell I have it anymore and my skin just looks generally healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very much like some kind of typical medicated cream which is not terrible, nor all that strong, either but I don&#x27;t care for it. In spite of that, I&#x27;m still giving this 5 stars. Will buy again if needed but a little goes a long way and the container is a decent size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a couple weeks my facial SD went away entirely. A month or so after that, it felt like it might be coming back so I applied this cream again for a day or two and I have been totally free from the flaking and itching ever since. I&#x27;m super pleased with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for girlfriend who diligently used it four times a day a for a week. This pretty much used up the entire container and we noticed zero improvement. Sad. With lofty reviews for this product, we were hoping for more.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of 50 or more creams I bought for my condition. I have perioral dermatitis and was given antibiotics. After three weeks antibiotics did nothing. I already am on a gluten and dairy free diet, which by the way is root cause of this problem. They say it is from fluoride or chloride, but realistically it is from allergens. If you have any dermatitis change your diet. Then use this, and watch your dermatitis disappear. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I will recommend this to perfect strangers w dermatitis. We have all been lied to about food. My father died of cancer from gluten allergy. Cancer is a big secret that the medical association wants to hide. Look down at your plate and really look at what you eat. You are being poisoned by big corporations.  Sorry about rant, but I feel like I have to tell everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks fo reading, even though I went off topic.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and we bought this product based on the reviews and description.  He had some sort of reaction to it and broke out exacerbating his eczema...so please try it on a small area first if you are using it for eczema.</li>
            <li> Actually got rid of my &amp;#34;face dandruff&amp;#34;. Thank the Zinc Lord.</li>
            <li> I bought and loved this cream before, so when I ran out, I bought it again....This time the cream had a sand-like texture and was very irritating. Not sure why, possibly a bad lot.</li>
            <li> Purchased for itching and scaliness due to seborrheic dermatitis because I read that zinc is helpful for this condition. Sadly, the cream burned and reddened my skin. Lotrimin Ultra is actually clearing up the sd and I hope to return to my regular skincare regimen soon.</li>
            <li> Worked really well, and really fast to clear up my dry flaky skin on my face. I think it worked better then the prescription stuff my Dr. gave me, and cheaper. I used to until everything was cleared up, and a few days after. Now I just use it from time to time when I see my skin starting to dry up again. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I would give this a product a 10 if i could. My dandruff is completely gone and it even helps with my foot issues</li>
            <li> The packaging of the cream is really flimsy. The jar popped out from the inner layer after the first time I used it, making it really hard to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, cream inside works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On contact, it makes my skin really red, which goes away after a couple of hours, but it clears up the other symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for those people who can&#x27;t find ZNP bars and want a cream substitute. I like it better than the Noble Formula soap that I also purchased.</li>
            <li> I finally found this stuff after searching--literally for more than a year--for something that would take care of my flaking, yet oily skin. I thought I MIGHT have seborrheic dermatitis, but was never sure. I tried dandruff shampoo. Tried a multitude of exfoliators and enzymes. All I really needed was this. In a matter of a sheer TWO days of twice daily use my flaking totally disappeared. Have been using it for two weeks and have not had a problem with flaking skin since I started using it. It&#x27;s a basic moisturizer plus .25% zinc pyrithione. I was told the reason this works and dandruff shampoo doesn&#x27;t is because you leave this on your skin, but obviously have to rinse off shampoo.  Besides, dandruff shampoo on your face is a little harsh over time. It&#x27;s a little heavy going on, but it works. It totally disappears on the skin once it absorbs. It might be a little heavy for acne-prone skin but it&#x27;s still worth trying. This stuff does contain some heavier moisturizers--and It DOES contain a small amount of lanolin. I only ever use a tiny amount (less than a pea size for my whole face). I use this around my nose, upper lip, chin, under eye area and above my eyebrows. Wish I had heard about this two years ago. Godsend</li>
            <li> Just bought this for my husband who suffers from seborrheic dermatitis, it is on his cheeks under his eyes, peeling under his eyebrows &amp; where his beard is. So happy that I came across this. With in 3-4 days there was an incredible difference, the peeling is gone, the redness has turned to a light pink. He was able to shave with no irritations.  Using along with the DermaZinc bars of soap. He said with the amount needed it will last along time. Worth a try.. wish we found much sooner.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful.  Great for bug bites and minor skin abrasions.  Does not sting and has no perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Works great for seborrheic dermatitis. I usually use it during the flare ups as it tends to get rid of them fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my Seborrheic Dermatitis on my face.  In fact this stuff burns intensely right after applying it to my face and within an hour my face around my nose was peeling worse than ever.  I tried again to see if it was a fluke.  Again, burning and peeling.  Tried again... burning and peeling.  I will NOT be trying this again.  Horrible stuff for my facial SD.</li>
            <li> product was one month from expiring and was not useful at all. wasted money entirely, be sure to check expiration or ask before purchasing! Bought reg product from other site and 100x better and won&#x27;t expire til 2014. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have long had Seborrheic dermatitis on my checks, and have always had to use prescription steroid creams to keep it under control. Now after using DermaZinc and a Tea tree face wash for a little over a month I&#x27;ve stopped using my prescription. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I worry about skin atrophy with the use of steroids to control sehorbic dermatitis. Im not sure of the effects of this according to data, but I not only do not have any more problems, my skin is back to the way it was before over 15 years ago. Best thing that I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li> suffered with psoriasis for years  mainly plaque psoriasis of elbows   i  have found derma zinc to be as good if not better than most presciption drugs     as a physician  i have tried them all    may benefit from addition of clobetasol initially    but once under control the derma zinc is good for maintenance</li>
            <li> I have had minor eczema on my hand for years.  I have used prescription medications which would help but they seemed to all be oil-based and I didn&#x27;t like the feel or getting oily residue on clothes, etc.  I was given DermaZinc as a sample at a medical conference.  I LOVE it!  It is not oily, but like a nice lotion.  BEST of all, it completely resolved all signs of eczema after using for a few weeks.  Now I us it occasionally when the area starts to look dry, probably every few weeks.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Burns actually with no improvement.</li>
            <li> I am a candida sufferer and have had this problem for half a century.  More recently I&#x27;ve been able to control and reduce it through a variety of  means.  The downside was some of it migrated to my hands. I was advised of many  things and had limited success on my skin / hand eruptions untill I tried derma-  Zink. It worked like majic and cured my hands in one or two days. And it hasn&#x27;t  come back. Truly amazing! Did not help on feet however.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my psoriasis.  Was hoping it would be a good alternative to expensive prescriptions, but did not work for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have Seborrheic Dermatitis, so I tried this product twice a day for a month but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Totally turned my skin around! I&#x27;ve been using this on my face, hairline and neck. My skin used to feel itchy, flaky and raw almost all the time. My face looks and feels 100% better. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema since i was in my early 20&#x27;s. I am now in my 40&#x27;s, so I can say i&#x27;ve pretty much tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used prescription steroids which work beautifully, but long term are bad for you. I&#x27;ve tried lotions, creams..you name it. I learned about this product and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this cream twice a day. There is a slight burning sensation when I applied it to my eczema inflamed skin..but only for a few seconds...after that..within a few hours you can already see the redness starting to leave. Regular use has taken visible spots on my hairline and taken the red out.. Not completely..but dang close. Only thing that beats it in my opinion is steroid creams which knock it out completely. But this has zinc in it and over long term is not going to cause potential harm to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked for me so I gotta give it props.</li>
            <li> A miracle!  This has calmed the areas, even with just a few days use.  Not greasy, but has staying power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a terrible problem with spontaneous cuts and irritated skin on my hands for years.  Post-partum I also go psoriasis on the back of my neck.  An MD prescribed this cream for both of the problems.  It definitely helps put the fire out and stops the intense itching and is better than a steroid for your health.  However, the real problem is an allergy, food or environmental, or deficiency of some kind- usually to healthy oils and omega 3 fatty acids.  Throw out all of your vegetable oil (canola, soy and cottonseed) and switch to coconut, grapeseed, olive oils and butter. (see Dr. Mercola for more info)  Barlean&#x27;s is a great brand for cod liver oil, fish oil, and flax seed oil which help a lot of skin problems.  At this point I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m allergic to soaps and cleaners and any regular products my skin comes into contact with.  My dentist had a similar skin problem for 20 years and got rid of it by switching to natural products- BioKleen for all cleaning and laundry and natural soaps and shampoos that are essential oil based- try Dr. Bronner&#x27;s or Young Living.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years for my seborrheic dematitis. When I have a flare up, it can be very painful. This cream helps to keep the breakout to a minimum and if I should have one, it soothes the pain and helps it heal faster. I have to have this cream and it was nice to find it here on Amazon. I have not had a bad flare up since I started using this cream. For what it does, I don&#x27;t mind paying the cost and the jar lasts a long time. I don&#x27;t slather it on, I lightly put in in areas where I am prone to get flare ups.</li>
            <li> Was hopeful,  like others,  but it didn&#x27;t work for my SD.  Instead it badly clogged my pores (something I&#x27;ve never had a problem with) and it took weeks to undo the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody is different,  but after using this I did find products that worked for me.  I cleanse with an apple cider vinegar toner (Google it) and then put on a 2% salicylic acid.  My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> DermaZinc Cream &amp; also DermaZinc Soap helped me get rid of redness &amp; itching caused by &amp;#34;sebborheic dermatitis&amp;#34; (sp?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each morning, I wash with the DZ Soap, rinse with cold water, &amp; then apply DZ Cream.  I do the same each evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Result &#x3D; Red spots are gone or almost gone + itching is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  This method of using DZ Soap &amp; DZ Cream 2 times per day produced better results for me than the approx. 12 prescription medicine creams prescribed by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I have seborrheic dermatitis. I wanted this cream to work so badly! I&#x27;d been using another product and having mixed results, and wanted something that would take away all the weird wrinkles the seb derm has given me. Despite my breakout-prone skin, I decided to try this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it very thick and hard to rub in, but I didn&#x27;t mind that so much. Within a few days of using it, however, my skin was unbelievably flaky. I&#x27;d use the cream and there would be little flakes of skin stuck in it everywhere. It was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the other product, and probably back to the dermatologist for me. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I use this each week and this has reduced the flaking of skin a lot. I will use this each week until some day a cure is found.</li>
            <li> This stuff will destroy seborrheic dermatitis on your face!  I cannot say enough good things about this product!  It has zero smell, is lighter than the heavy butter or paste consistencies I was trying in other anti-fungal solutions, and absolutely restored my face to the glory it was before seborrheic dermatitis ever appeared!  If you are like me and have tried several other solutions but never found anything that completely worked, give this a try.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The cream has stopped the iching and my skin is a little less rough. I have been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This may read like an infomercial, but my experience with this cream has been nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD) on my face/around my nose for the bulk of my adult life, and saw multiple Dermatologists all prescribing creams, ointments, pads. Nothing ever seemed to work, and was getting frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this on a whim, and it worked, within a few days my face was calm again. I went without it on/off a few times to see if it returned, and it always did. I use a small amount (a finger tip) each day now, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have SD, give it a shot, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review things I buy on amazon, but this stuff blew me away. I have had flaky skin in between my eyebrows and on one side of my nose, as well as,  redness below my bottom lip. I&#x27;ve tried different face washes, vasiline, and cortizone creams with no real results. I noticed a change after the first day using dermazinc. I no longer have to deal with these embarrassing issues. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Having suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for years, and having spent hundreds on dermatologist visits and prescription creams, nothing made me happy with the results. I was perusing a forum and heard about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and my skin is more clear than it has been in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS-&lt;br /&gt;Odor free&lt;br /&gt;Not oily or greasy on the skin&lt;br /&gt;The price is more than fair&lt;br /&gt;I only have to use a small bit on the affected areas&lt;br /&gt;Skin is clear&lt;br /&gt;No more flaking skin&lt;br /&gt;No redness&lt;br /&gt;No burning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS-&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I passed along the recommendation to my family which also suffer from seborrheic dermatitis. They have all concluded that this product works better than any other remedy they&#x27;ve tried in the past. I&#x27;m a true fan. If you are suffering from seborrheic dermatitis, this is the most affordable and effective product you can purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.</li>
            <li> Didnt do much for me. Kinda disappointed but its a crap shoot with psoriasis and dermatitis. You have to find what works for you.</li>
            <li> This actually makes my eczema condition worse. Do not buy if you are sensitive to lanolin. Just a zinc cream from the drug store is probably better.</li>
            <li> I received a used product. The safety seal underneath the jar&#x27;s lid was lifted up halfway. Unfortunately, I will have to return it because I&#x27;m just disgusted.</li>
            <li> I have had seborrheic dermatitis since I was a teenager and it went undiagnosed for years.  I thought it was dandruff until it started affecting my face.  I thought I just needed to moisturise more and exfoliate. I went through so many products until I realised it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;normal&#x27; and went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed.  As with many dermatologists, they peddled their products they make in office which is expensive so I resorted to just living with it.  Exfoliate when it flares up and try to get healed asap when my face is raw and red after exfoliating.  Those with the condition know it flares up when the place gets cold, even AC can set it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggled for years till I found hydrocortisone.  It works great but its not recommended for long term use as it is a steroid and it doesn&#x27;t prevent flare ups, just made go away quicker when I do get a flare up, and my flare ups were frequent, like a week off then a week on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow to cut this review short, I found this product on amazon and decided to give it a shot.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but hoped it would work better than the hydrocortisone, but it has worked awesomely!!  I used it 3 times a day for about a week, and then once a day.  And since the dermatitis went away during the first week, it has not returned!  I have never been without a flareup this long (about 7 weeks now).  So, if you are on the fence and are tired of having a raw red face and all the flakes in your eye brows and beard, give this product a shot, you WON&#x27;T regret it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on what I heard from a Doctor about the problem had. I was getting flaking around the sides of my nose and face around the nose, a small area. I could not stop this with skin creams I tried, but after using this for some time, I received excellent results and completely got rid of the problem. Trust me, this stuff works and I would recommend trying it if you have this type of skin problem or any type of flaking of the skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use the ZNP bar along with Tea Tree cream for my seborrheic dermatitis on my face.  When the ZNP bar got shut down, I ended up buying an assortment of products off of amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this is the best product that I bought.  I really don&#x27;t smell an odor (however, everything &amp;#34;technically&amp;#34; has an odor).  I put it on in the morning before work, and it dries before I get to work (if not, I just finish rubbing it in).  However, if you have a beard, you&#x27;ll want to rub it in, wait, and then end up washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few words of warning.  Do not apply this after shaving; it burns like a mother.  It NEVER burns normally, but after shaving, it&#x27;s hell.  I didn&#x27;t mark the star rating down because that&#x27;s not something easily fixable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my chest, ankles, and sometimes behind my ears too if they ever start getting seborrhea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the DermaZinc soap, but it&#x27;s not as helpful (I still use it everyday on my face though).  I&#x27;d suggest using this, the soap, and whatever current product you&#x27;re using.  This won&#x27;t eradicate seborrhea 100%, but it does a good job of assisting.  It probably does 80-90% of the work.  If you&#x27;re torn between the soap and the cream, buy the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used everyday, this cream will last you about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This stuff totally worked!  I had been on topical steroids and anti-fungals, neither really worked for me but this stuff helped my skin, kept me clear of pealing or redness.  I have been using for about 1.5 years and about to order my second container.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle for me.  I was diagnosed with psoriasis and for years used very expensive topical steroid creams and other topical ointments even laser treatments but never go better. I think it turns out I am actually somewhat allergic to the steroids.  After using a Zinc based shampoo that cleared up my scalp very well, I looked for a cream with a similar zinc base.  I now use DermaZinc once a day on the affected areas and my skin is almost 100% cleared up.  I can wear short sleeve shirts again and my wallet is not so light.</li>
            <li> worked wonders.  Even the doctor was impressed.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product for those with dermatitis or other skin conditions. You cannot use it in irritated parts. Its effect is not immediate but has good results.</li>
            <li> My son with sebohhreic dermatitis on his face has been using this about a week along with Pyrithione Zinc soap. Drasting improvement in his brow area and his nose area is getting better. Glad I read up about this and was able to find on amazon, our local drug stores did not have any Pyrithione Zinc products except in dandruff shampoos which he tried on his face but the shampoo made him break out.</li>
            <li> I use this for seborrheic dermatitis around my nostrils and chin. It clears up the flakiness and irritation very well but the redness doesn&#x27;t seem to improve. I put on a generous amount before going to bed but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it when going out as it doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is probably a lifetime supply for me, so value wise it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t help with redness.</li>
            <li> this item had no safety seal on it. i had to trow it away because its a skin lotion, i an i did not feel safe using it.</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to work well, but it stings and burns so badly every time I apply that it brought tears to my eyes.  I do have classic sebborhea with regular flare-ups.  I would expect that any product wouldn&#x27;t feel amazing if you put it on reddened, rashy skin, but this just hurt terribly and did nothing to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; my skin either.  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It leaves my skin soft and really helps to aleve the redness.  I use it after the DermaZinc soap.</li>
            <li> I periodically suffer from seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp. I have scaling which drives me nuts. I had a particularly intractable bout recently that was impervious to the variety of prescription and non prescription creams, shampoos and ointments I have in my medicine cabinet. In desperation I went onto Amazon in search of a cure. This, my friends, is it. I applied this 4 times as instructed to the bothersome areas of my scalp and in one day, all scaling was gone. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I use this for the dermatitis on my face. It&#x27;s ok. It burns the skin a bit. I would rather use the Ultra Repair Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with Seborrhoeic dermatitis or some equivalent for many years. With constant redness On both sides of my nose, chin, cheeks, and eyebrows. Flaking skin followed by redness which would sometimes clear itself, but rarely for more than a day. Stress seems to be a trigger.I was given a prescription cream (edicil) that had little effect from a dermatologist years ago. I thought there was no way I was going to resolve this if the prescription drug didn&#x27;t work.I purchased the zinc cream a few months back  and to my astonishment the redness and flaking have cleared completely. I hesitate to say this because it&#x27;s been such a long-standing problem (7+ years). My hairline and scalp suffer a similar condition, and I&#x27;ve begun to use it there as well with a similar successful result. I am curious to see how the summer plays out. I believe that sweat may impact my condition in addition to stress,so I will reserve the miracle cure headline until the product can be vetted for all seasons!</li>
            <li> it helped with my seborrheic dermatitis. Now I just put a little bit 1 time a week.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;• Works great on dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;• None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;I had some red areas on my chest from seborrheic dermatitis.  This clears it right up without the need for steroid based creams.</li>
            <li> So this cream has helped my skin a lot. I have used it for a bought a month now and I see a difference with the amount of oil my skin produces. The oil production is way down and so are my breakouts. I get much less scaling and I don&#x27;t feel like I constantly need to wash my face. I will be using this product for a long long time. I have tried everything and so far this has given me my best results. I apply 2x a day. No smell, no residue, no weird feeling on the skin after.</li>
            <li> No more flaking around my nose and mouth. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> If you have flacky skin, this stuff really works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> My husband started suffering from red and frequently flaking skin while in college and finally went to a dermatologist once he had graduated, got a job, and had health insurance. He was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and got an Rx for the typical creams. It worked fine, it was greasy and left his skin greasy as well, but it did clear up the flaking though not all the redness. Flash forward a few years and I saw this product and read the reviews. I figured it was worth a try. He started using it a few months ago and we&#x27;re both amazed at the results. No more flaking, his skin is even in tone and he has no more redness at all, it smells much better than the Rx cream, and absorbs into his skin very nicely without that greasy feeling. We hope they make this product forever! Highly recommend this for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I never thought that there would be a good solution for seborrheic dermatitis. I&#x27;ve been to 2 dermatologists and a general practitioner, and was told the same thing, to use a steroid cream (prescription) and anti-fungal creams.. Yeah, sure it sorta worked, took about a week to clear up. Yet, lately my seborrheic dermatitis has been worse and none of the prescribed ointments were successful. So I reached out to Amazon Reviews and come upon this. Listen, there&#x27;s some sort of magical witchcraft happening here cause it cleared up my skin in a weekend. After the first use, I was looking better. Here it is, day 3 and I&#x27;m completely cleared up. This stuff is amazing. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and this works great for me and no fragrance to burn my skin. Dandruff shampoos often contain this active ingredient this has but the fragrances are very strong.</li>
            <li> I use this product and it is great! I use it for my seborrheic dermatitis on my face-and if I use dermazince I just don&#x27;t get it. In the beginning you do have to use it 1-2 times a day to resolve it-but then 3-4 times a week keeps it at bay.  It is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I bought this after the rave reviews from others for treating Seborrhoeic Dermatitis and after trying several dozens of creams, ointments and other products, I was skeptical but gave it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to this point, I have only found Cortizone-10 Plus Maximum Strength to be the only product that works but I am trying to find an alternative since I am not too crazy about using Hydrocortisone for the long term.  Had a tube of Rx Xolegel (Ketoconazole) gel from the Dermatologist which helped a little but not as good as the Cortizone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried Dead Sea Salt Gel, worked for a little while but irritation persisted and I stopped after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the DermaZinc, well once I read the ingredients and seeing Dimethicone was in it, this concerned me because almost every product I tried that contains it caused issues but I overlooked it and ordered anyways thinking maybe it will help the Zinc absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 2 days of using it, up 4 times a day, I noticed the red, itchy and flaky spots started appearing on my forehead and T-zone started getting worse and at this point I was recovering nicely from a recent flare-up.  So I stopped after the 2nd day thinking something is not agreeing with me and I suspect that it&#x27;s the Dimethicone since it forms a barrier to hold in moisture which also does little to help control the yeast issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel I have an allergy to Dimethicone, as I used it on dry hands and elbows plenty of times with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wished it worked, but now it&#x27;s another bottle of something that goes in with the three dozen or more products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, and was hoping it would be the answer to my extremely dry winter skin.  Upon first application it really burned. I let it sit a while, thinking it would quickly pass, but after a few minutes of a severe burning sensation I had to try to wash it off. I kept it, and waited a few weeks to give it a second try, but I had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I read the ingredients and other reviews before purchasing, and I really had high hopes for this cream, and so I&#x27;m very disappointed. This isn&#x27;t to say that it is a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; product, but I either personally have a very adverse reaction to it, or there is something off about the container I received.&lt;br /&gt;I got the shampoo, and that is working great for me, no burning, even when it runs down my skin when rinsing.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my perioral dermatitis.  Actually made it worse.  Opted to see my dermatologist and get a prescription medication</li>
            <li> I have had dermatitis problem since years now and tried dandruff shampoos and cortizone.&lt;br /&gt;Cortizone worked but it have a bad effect on your skin in the long term. So desseperately i searched and found this awesome cream, I apply it when having the problem 2 times a day. And when redness is just starting again, (in my case is now about 1 time every 2 months) I apply it once before sleeping. And thank heaven for this, it just works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try it once 4 times a day and felt my face really harsh and itchy, I think there is no need to apply it that often, and dont conbine it with other stuff directly on the problem it will make your face RED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower 2 times a day and try not to touch or scatch where the problem is and now I can control dermatitis appearing in average once every 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for years from chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis on my face and the only relief came from prescription creams and gels. This was the first over-the-counter product to offer total relief. Highly recommend it to anyone suffering from chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I used it and it did not make any changes to my condition (did not even took away the itching).  I visited the Doc and he gave me something stronger to use for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old now. And throughout my teen life till now, my skin dries up real quick and I get super itchy. I get acne on my body real bad, and I&#x27;ve used tons of creams to soothe my itchiness because I would scratch my acne and I would bleed and get spots. But now Since I bought this product, it really works and helps my itchiness. I stopped itching after using this product. It works better than any kind of cream you would buy at the store. I really recommend this product, if your body itches a lot. This product will stop your itchy problems away! HAHA! :) Good luck!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, works awesome wth DermaZinc soap as well. The Soap to take the flakes off, the cream to keep them off. The cream soaks into your skin, works very well. I recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and I get a few red blemishes under my eyes, when I used this it took about a week to make them go away about 90%.  If you stop use of this product the blemishes come back almost immediately, I am happy that it works but I have used other products that will get rid of seborrheic dermatitis and if you stop use it will come back in a few weeks not days.</li>
            <li> Cream blends fabulously in skin; however, if your skin condition is bad, you really need prescription strength to soothe skin itch and flare up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than lotion from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I thought my face was red before(seb derm), but it was much brighter red(and inflamed) after using this product for 2 days. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Product actually made my skin worse not better.  I know with an issue like Dermatitis each person may react differently&lt;br /&gt;but this product did not work for me.  It actually made my skin more red and flakey and now I am having to find a product&lt;br /&gt;that will help erase the new damage done...</li>
            <li> not what i thought it would do.my son was verry dissapointed..hade no resolts on his skin.[[ASIN:B0000ZHOH2 DermaZinc Cream - 4 oz]]</li>
            <li> I had horrible dermatitis on my face, noticed after just one day the difference. I&#x27;ve tried everything and it was getting so so bad and embarrassing. No more flakes just a bit of redness, which is totally manageable with makeup.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I would not want anyone to feel the pain that I felt after using this cream. I originally wrote a review raving about this product about 2 months ago on the first day. After applying it twice the first day [once in the morning, once at night] I noticed that my skin was starting to get very dry. I didn&#x27;t want to put anything else on it in fear of it interacting with the ingredients and stopping the product from working. On the second morning, I applied the cream like I did the day before. My face started to get swollen immediately, it burned so bad that I was in tears.  I tried to wash my face with water hoping to get the cream off but the burning did not subside and lasted for over 3 hours. My seb. dermatitis actually spread and got worse. By the end of the night my face was so dry and cracked that I had sheets of skin flaking off. This was over two months ago and my face is still a terrible mess. I wish I would have never used this product. A lot of the reviews on here are saying that the product worked for them but it did nothing but make my seb dermatitis worse. I really had high hopes for this and wanted it to work. I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board because I still have not found anything that works for me.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on this product!!! I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis on my face, it&#x27;s embarrassing because everyone can see how bad your skin looks. I was using cortizone, but it has side effects and you&#x27;re not suppose to use over the long term :( Tried a few over the counter products, but nothing seemed to solve the problem, turned to Amazon for an answer, and  I found it in Dermazinc :D I started using it and within a couple of days I already noticed a significance difference in the appearance and health of my skin. The cream spreads easily, absorbs well, and did not irritate my eyes. I have nothing negative to say about this product, it was worth every penny and I will be buying it regularly from now on, by the way I looked for the product at the local stores around me and nobody cares it, so thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> works  great  glad  amazon could help</li>
            <li> It didnt do much for me. I bought it for dry flaky skin to help control it, but had no success with this product. I did have success using apple cider vinegar though oddly.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me. It burns my skin, no change in my condition. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> So everyone always says they have tried every product until they find the one that works.  Well it feels like that seriously.  For the past 5 years I&#x27;ve had an oily face that was prone to explosions of SD.  It was embarrassing to say the least.  I&#x27;ve used loads of different moisturizers, creams, shampoos, treatments.  Washing my face and hair with H&amp;S was the most effective way to keep the explosions at bay, but I would still have an oily face with a reddish complexion.  well this is the best treatment I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not a cure but there is no cure.  I apply this to my face at night after my shower.  The next morning I splash my face with some cold water just to get the night off and that is it.  My skin is not oily at all.  my complexion back to the way it was before this whole mess started and no explosions to speak of yet.  All I can say is I wish I would have tried this product 5 years ago.  So give it a try.  It&#x27;s really not that expensive and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I could not find anything at the store for for facial seb. dermatitis.  It is great for flaky skin around nose, cheeks, eyebrows, etc. I tried all kinds of lotion but to no avail nothing helped. When my face got wet, as soon as it dried it would get flaky. Very frustrating.  This worked by the second day of using it.  I don&#x27;t even use t daily and it has worked.  In the past, ketoconazole seemed to help a little in the past, but never really cleared it up totally.  This has worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the DermaZinc cream for three years now and it has made my life significantly less stressful.  Brilliant researchers at Dermalogix somehow concocted a formula that effectively removes all my facial irritation and blemishes.  Kudos to them!  I apply it every morning after showering and let it sink in for a while before heading out.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works for my annoying face.</li>
            <li> I have a small patch of Seb Derm near my eye, which is why the usual prescribed treatment of washing with dandruff shampoo doesn&#x27;t really work for me. You have to leave the shampoo on your face for a few minutes in order for the chemicals to penetrate and kill off the fungus that causes the dermatitis, but you can see why that would be problematic if your dermatitis is in a sensitive spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this cream, which has the same active ingredient as shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders, and have been using it for the past two weeks. As the label suggests, I apply it several times per day, usually once in the morning and once in the evening. The cream is thick but absorbs well with some rubbing and leaves skin with a slightly powdery finish. It is unscented and doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to water. My dermatitis is about 75% cleared up. The itching, redness, and scaling have really improved. The patch is still there, but not as noticeable. It still flares up during humid weather, however, so the cream isn&#x27;t a cure, just a way to control it.  And this works fine under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may seem pricey, but the jar is rather large and filled to the brim. I only use a small dab each time, so it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.  I think this cream is a good alternative to shampoos or soaps since you can leave it on all day instead of needing to rinse it off. It also seems safe to use near your eyes, unlike soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin problems that I believe are a &amp;#34;side effect&amp;#34; of diabetes.  This cream works well to relieve itch and scaly or flaky skin.  It provides a cooling sensation that is welcome if you&#x27;ve been scratching too much!</li>
            <li> Hey guys. I must say...this stuff worked for me. Really have worsening dermatitis (dandruff on my face...according to my Dr) on my face, head, beard, scalp...was getting mortifyingly embarassing. I use this stuff a couple times a week when i get out of the shower on my face, head, neck, beard. I even use it as a hair gel and leave it in my hair/scalp all day...NO MORE FLAKING/REDNESS/SORES!! Didnt have much hope, as scrips and over the counter products didnt work for me. It has 98% cleared everything up ! Hope it lasts ! Yes, i can see it stinging and reddening some peoples skin temporarily (although it didnt mine). And im very sorry to those who didnt find relief with this product (try it in a small area, at first). But i must say...even though it is a bit pricey at $19 for a 4oz jar, its is soooooo worth it to me. I dont have to go to work looking like i have herpes or somthing !! I also rotate two DHS shampoos (zinc and tar), as well as use dead sea mineral sulfer soap occasionally. You gotta keep this auto-immune flare ups on their toes and rotate your ammo !! That said, this product worked alone, without additional products. But i know my skin...it is sneaky !! ...so i rotate other products with it to keep my skin guessing. Good luck, and much sympathy/empathy to those who continue to struggle to find help !!</li>
            <li> The seal was opened a tiny bit when I took off the cap, but I didn&#x27;t feel like going through the process of exchanging. I think the lotion works great.</li>
            <li> When I received this jar the seal  the manufacturer put in place to protect the cream was broken. It looked as if someone used a porton of it and sent the rest to me. The SD on my face was so bad at that time I  had to call in sick for a month from work, after hiding inside for so long and waiting patiently  for that cream  to give me some relief, I was to enbarased and  was not thinking clearly,  that desperation drove me to still put some on my face that is when my face started to burn I had to wash it off and tash the jar. Desperation drive men to do many crazy things.Your experience may be different, but this is as my name says honest experience.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer and mild control for sun damaged skin.  I needs to be used very often to do the good intended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, red, and flaky skin around my nose for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve probably spent $100s on creams to no avail. I read the reviews for this product and took a gamble on. It cleared up my redness in 3 days. It was a sigh of relief. Highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> One star because I was so disappointed to read this had parabens. Parabens are a preservative for creams, etc&lt;br /&gt;But, there are so many alternate ingredients that will preserve that are non parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use them due to fear of cancer reports involving parabens and considering id be using this daily, it&#x27;s just too often to take the risk.  Other than that, the cream seemed hopeful and I was excited.</li>
            <li> When you use this cream along with the DermaZinc soap you will see results almost instantly.  The cream has worked wonders on my friend&#x27;s face. It&#x27;s totally worth trying out!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for the psoriasis on my scalp and nearly makes the psoriasis on my elbows disappear. But as with all psoriasis products, I have to keep purchasing it because it never goes away.</li>
            <li> For many years I have used a zinc pyrithione based lotion for the outbreaks on my face. The product I was using is very expensive, so I decided to try this one. It works the same for about a third of the price. It does have a bit of a sting, but far less than the other one I was using. I put up with the sting, because it does the job. I don&#x27;t need to use it daily, once or twice a week works for me. It is not oily, which I like, because I use it on my hairline. When I have an outbreak it gives immediate relief. Oh-- and the package came a week early!</li>
            <li> Simple... Nothing has worked, until I found this. I dealt with red dry skin on face, and this has cleared it drastically.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would work but it does.  I use it on my face and my scalp.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift to work on a skin condition. She hasn&#x27;t told me how well it works but have faith in this product.</li>
            <li> This works really good on psoriasis</li>
            <li> DermaZinc makes a soap that is much better than the cream. The cream burned and irritated my skin terribly. This cream was to much for my face, maybe it works for others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any major changes using it so probably won&#x27;t get any more.  It may require a longer term usage to get results but that&#x27;s just a guess.</li>
            <li> when i started using it consistently about 4 times a week it started to work on Seborrheic Dermatitis / Rosacea which mostly went away in about a week and has not came back yet for months.</li>
            <li> Bought this yesterday and used it almost immediately. After about 2 hrs I started to see a slight improvement. I posted a few pictures to show what my Perioral dermatitis looks like now. Will follow up and post more in about a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the Psoriasin facial wash. I think for the first couple of weeks, my face seemed to respond positively.&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts and dry red areas cleared up, but it was like if I missed even a SINGLE wash in the morning or at night, my face was breaking out in acne or rash. Now that summer has kicked in full gear, it&#x27;s as if this cream has no effect. I have never had this issue with red/rashy/dry skin, but it&#x27;s gotten worse and now even this cream doesn&#x27;t seem to have the impact it did before. Like my skin grew resistant to it over time or something. Highly frustrating, I surely had high hopes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic for my seb/derm!</li>
            <li> I have crazy skin in the winter- oily but flaky as a molting snake!! Found DermaZinc cream and soap and thought I&#x27;d give a try. Simply put - It works. The cream is not oily at all but hydrates and reduces the redness from my inflamed skin like a champ! I can use it all over my face, neck and chest with no oily residue or break outs as well. This has become my year round cream!</li>
            <li> I tried to find SkinZinc brand and it looks like they aren&#x27;t making it any more.....I ordered this one and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before. Works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  Skin feels a little irritated after initially applying; however, it goes away in a short duration- the results are 100% worth it!  I use 2 times per week and it keeps my sebborheic dermatitis under control.  I no longer deal with the itchy, spotty, flakiness that I once routinely dealt with.  Truly this stuff is amazing and is the only thing that actually works.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Seborrhoeic dermatitis on my forehead. I&#x27;ve visited quite a few dermatologist and tried many prescription creams and well as over the counter creams and nothing worked. I purchased this cream over 3 weeks ago and I can&#x27;t begin to explain how much better my skin feels and looks. The cream does exactly what it says, it stopped my itching, stopped my flaking, and stopped my inflammation. It reduced my breakouts and overall my skin looks 80% better. I know there is no cure for SD, but this cream does a wonderful job of keeping all the pesky symptoms of SD at bay and I can function without worrying about the condition of my skin....love, love, love.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhea and try everything I can find to try to slow it down and control it.  This cream exacerbates the situation because it is so drying, the last thing you need.</li>
            <li> Am trying this to deal with psoriasis. Won&#x27;t know benefit until this winter. Cream is very smooth and light on skin.</li>
