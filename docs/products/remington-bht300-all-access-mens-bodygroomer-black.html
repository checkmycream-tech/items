            <li>This body groomer doesn&#x27;t do as good job as Philips and that is why it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds a charge well, and and is basically a good groomer.</li>
            <li>Good afternoon, has not even reached my article</li>
            <li>Its made with good texture, And looks like the display.</li>
            <li>Remington products itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a nice replica of Philips body groomer.</li>
            <li>used this product for everything from shaving hair for wound dressings, to doing my own legs.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be okay.</li>
            <li>Could use more power.</li>

            <li>Despite Elvis&#x27; claims, lots of women don&#x27;t want a teddy bear to love them tender with a hunka hunka burnin love.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this body shaver for a year, and have been mostly using it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>(Ladies, I love this one!)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>This item is OK....</li>
            <li>Remington a good name and this item proves it.</li>
            <li>could be made better.</li>
            <li>i still thinking that shave with regular shaver is the best way...</li>
            <li>you have to take care, but is better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Body groomer by far one of the best decision I made and keeps me smooth skin smooth looking sexy.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver portion is pretty good, but I have gripes with the &#x27;trimmer&#x27; part.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good for hair.</li>
            <li>Really not the best shaver.</li>
            <li>works fine under water.</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with it to be honest, especially given the price.</li>
            <li>Like more products, which buyers may purchase for the first time, it will take a while to experience to really know how to use it in a way most effective.  </li>
            <li>only bright side is that it cuts more hair at a time than my Philips/Norelco Body Groomer...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, and with shorter hair or stubble doesn&#x27;t even need hair loosened from it.</li>
            <li>Just smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and rinses clean under water.</li>
            <li>Easy clean too.</li>
            <li>I love this machine it comes with 3 guards, cleaning brush charging cord and a full charge ready for use and it is soo Great that i odered a second one for my brother :)</li>
            <li>Electric shaver like this, required to pass more times over your body and start to heat the head, and let me tell you, this head when is hot..</li>
            <li>clean shaven in no time.</li>
            <li>You can also use it on your face to trim your beard or shave clean, and that&#x27;s just versatility.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good or getting a complete shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after doing some research, and seeing it for a good discount at a local closeout dept store.</li>
            <li>Someone claimed it worked well on his legs, and I tried it out for a laugh, and so help me if it doesn&#x27;t get my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The Remington BHT300 seemed to work fine when I first used it about 10 months ago.</li>
            <li>recommend it if you&#x27;re not too hairy and need a super close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The people who designed this thing were nice enough to give it a removable shaver foil and trimmer head, then forgot to produce that part as an easily replaceable part available in large quantities.</li>
            <li>If it lasts awhile it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>With this price it came with, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought about one every year for the last 4 years and they work great to trim my hairy chest, stomach and back (about once a week).</li>
            <li>Bear in mind, it&#x27;s sparse or a light fuzz, but a guy gets self conscious about these things.    </li>
            <li>but it is nothing more than a simple shaver.</li>
            <li>but I find this much better than the basic norelco body groomer, which dulled much faster,</li>
            <li>For being around $25 I guess it&#x27;s no big deal, but it&#x27;s a shame to have to throw away an otherwise fully functioning electronic shaver just because of an easily replaceable part (when</li>
            <li>But all of my pass products from Remington cuts good and last long.  </li>
            <li>However, one important thing to realize is that there are no replacement cartridges available for it, which I thought was odd.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my Philips body groomer, which did the job very efficiently.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable for my usage though.</li>
            <li>But this one here is a shocker, I was very Disapointed</li>
            <li>Did not end up using it too much.</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>This one is half the price and is much better.</li>
            <li>It does the job, more or less.</li>
            <li>Search a little more before buying this product.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and lasts a long while.</li>
            <li>Once the trimmer blade breaks you have to buy a new groomer.</li>
            <li>first it actually could cut through hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a super hairy guy, but I have fuzz on my arms and legs, some hair on the top of my back, and on my chest and tummy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but I won&#x27;t be surprised if it performs well there.</li>
            <li>If you just want to trim your hair, or do a little \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; or shave it all off, this is a good little shaver for your money, and I really hope this serves me for a long time.</li>
            <li>Well, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, since I&#x27;ve had electric shavers in the past, including Remington &amp; Braun brands, and they have only served to disappoint me, in terms of closeness, compared to a razor.</li>
            <li>Great tough little shaver, and holds a charge like</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have to contour totally against the skin, because it cuts close enough that you don&#x27;t worry, and can easily cut it shorter with the trimmer or shaver with a little maneuvering.</li>
            <li>So far, there have been no cuts, scratches, or battery failures when properly used.  </li>
            <li>And sometimes barely cuts.  </li>

            <li> And sometimes barely cuts.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the battery doesn&#x27;t charge enough (after 14 hours plugged) or the blades are of very low quality so instead of cutting hair, this product mostly pulls it and irritates the skin.  </li>
            <li> but It would take to long to use this product.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t like shaving, because of all the mess from shaving cream, plus the dripping water, the nicks, and the constantly having to do it every day.</li>
            <li> It cuts very very slow so be aware.</li>
            <li> Once the razor has become dull, or if it breaks for whatever reason, you&#x27;ll need to buy a new one (unless you&#x27;re in warranty and complain).</li>
            <li> But the only down fall about it, is that you can&#x27;t buy replacement blades for it.</li>
            <li> Now with almost a full battery all it does is randomly cuts hair and then randomly rips it out making for a less than comfortable</li>
            <li> Sure after a few months you have to slow down as the blades dull</li>
            <li> However, from the first time I used it, it has been a constant disappointment time after time.  </li>
            <li> Blades so sharp they scratch as they cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep two of these now, the dulled one for the nether regions I don&#x27;t want to accidentally cut, and the other for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy and bought it to trim down my underarms and nether regions and to replace my Remington Rotary.</li>
            <li> Not real good in tight places like your upper lip.</li>
            <li> In some areas, like behind the leg muscles, it can miss, but this could be due too having the ability for a person to see right behind themselves.  </li>
            <li> I relied on the previous reviews to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> I was suspicious of the quality of something priced less than its competition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend a razor that is a little nicer.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s childish.)</li>
            <li> It has quite a few accessories that all add to its value.</li>
            <li> Also could cause injury when used on mole, bump or uneven skin.</li>
            <li> At least they never seem to want this hound dog.</li>
            <li> Never own a body shaver</li>
            <li> , why I do not know which really sucks</li>
            <li> But this Bodygroomer cuts very slow.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower but imagine that in those circumstances its performance is probably even worse.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> It does the job, but has a tendency to rip hairs out, which is painful.</li>
            <li> &gt;:(</li>
            <li> Am I disappointed with this product?</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets a bad rap on here!</li>

            <li> One of the best you can purchase!</li>
            <li> I have both the similar Philips brand and this one. This one is half the price and is much better.</li>
            <li> I relied on the previous reviews to purchase this product.  However, from the first time I used it, it has been a constant disappointment time after time.  It seems that the battery doesn&#x27;t charge enough (after 14 hours plugged) or the blades are of very low quality so instead of cutting hair, this product mostly pulls it and irritates the skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower but imagine that in those circumstances its performance is probably even worse.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product and regret having bought it.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and it seems to be okay. Could use more power. If it lasts awhile it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing some research, and seeing it for a good discount at a local closeout dept store. Well, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, since I&#x27;ve had electric shavers in the past, including Remington &amp; Braun brands, and they have only served to disappoint me, in terms of closeness, compared to a razor. I&#x27;m not a super hairy guy, but I have fuzz on my arms and legs, some hair on the top of my back, and on my chest and tummy. (I like that word, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s childish.) The dual clippers work great for getting and area clean shaven in no time. If you just want to trim the hair in an area, the device comes with three different combs to use, that cover the shaver part. You can also use it on your face to trim your beard or shave clean, and that&#x27;s just versatility. Plus, since it&#x27;s rechargeable, I don&#x27;t have to keep putting in batteries. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but I won&#x27;t be surprised if it performs well there. I actually don&#x27;t like shaving, because of all the mess from shaving cream, plus the dripping water, the nicks, and the constantly having to do it every day. And shaving some of my body hair is a pain, even though I love not having hair on places like my shoulders. Bear in mind, it&#x27;s sparse or a light fuzz, but a guy gets self conscious about these things.    Someone claimed it worked well on his legs, and I tried it out for a laugh, and so help me if it doesn&#x27;t get my skin smooth. It doesn&#x27;t contour perfectly to your body, but that&#x27;s okay. Those rotary models that are supposed to contour only end up tugging on my hairs and leaving them standing. This one doesn&#x27;t have to contour totally against the skin, because it cuts close enough that you don&#x27;t worry, and can easily cut it shorter with the trimmer or shaver with a little maneuvering. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and with shorter hair or stubble doesn&#x27;t even need hair loosened from it. And the best part about it all is no irritation, impacted follicles, or shaving cream. Just smooth skin. I don&#x27;t want to be like a mannequin, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to not feel like such a bear all the time. Despite Elvis&#x27; claims, lots of women don&#x27;t want a teddy bear to love them tender with a hunka hunka burnin love. At least they never seem to want this hound dog. Anyway, that&#x27;s alright, anyway you do. If you just want to trim your hair, or do a little \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; or shave it all off, this is a good little shaver for your money, and I really hope this serves me for a long time.</li>
            <li> Blades so sharp they scratch as they cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades often grab skin and cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bright side is that it cuts more hair at a time than my Philips/Norelco Body Groomer...but that thing NEVER cut me OR scratched me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you don&#x27;t mind bleeding.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am impress with the body shaver I invest in. Remington products itself is amazing. Never own a body shaver always did the razor thing, why I do not know which really sucks take to much time and harsh on the body. Body groomer by far one of the best decision I made and keeps me smooth skin smooth looking sexy. Anyone hesitating about purchasing this product you should not be. One of the best if not the best</li>
            <li> This Remington Bht30 bodygroomer works good with shaving parts of the body.  Like more products, which buyers may purchase for the first time, it will take a while to experience to really know how to use it in a way most effective.  In some areas, like behind the leg muscles, it can miss, but this could be due too having the ability for a person to see right behind themselves.  So far, there have been no cuts, scratches, or battery failures when properly used.  With this price it came with, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Remington Bht300 bodygroomer does a good job of removing body hair. Good value for the price. Easy to use and rinses clean under water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a replacement to my Norelco body groomer, since the foil keeps falling out.&lt;br /&gt;This is not it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cut me twice!  &gt;:(</li>
            <li> This is a nice replica of Philips body groomer. I bought it to replace my Philips body groomer, which did the job very efficiently. I would give Philips 5 stars but I had to take off one star for durability. This body groomer doesn&#x27;t do as good job as Philips and that is why it is cheaper. If you want a better version of this product then spend 10 bucks more and buy Philips. I have already used this so I won&#x27;t be returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this body shaver for a year, and have been mostly using it in the shower.  It does a pretty good or getting a complete shave.  For a hairy guy like it, I have to use it once a week for maintenance.  For the price, it&#x27;s a very good deal.</li>
            <li> It does the job, more or less. The foil shaver portion is pretty good, but I have gripes with the &#x27;trimmer&#x27; part. The guides/teeth of the trimmer are way too wide, and they get caught in my pores and make me bleed here and there, mainly near my collar bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge well, and and is basically a good groomer. However, one important thing to realize is that there are no replacement cartridges available for it, which I thought was odd. Once the razor has become dull, or if it breaks for whatever reason, you&#x27;ll need to buy a new one (unless you&#x27;re in warranty and complain). For being around $25 I guess it&#x27;s no big deal, but it&#x27;s a shame to have to throw away an otherwise fully functioning electronic shaver just because of an easily replaceable part (when it exists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it if you&#x27;re not too hairy and need a super close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good body groomer. But the only down fall about it, is that you can&#x27;t buy replacement blades for it. Once the trimmer blade breaks you have to buy a new groomer.</li>
            <li> This unit does recharge. Please let me know what.  It did work for couple of weeks then stop working, because does not recharge.</li>
            <li> Works great ,no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Great tough little shaver, and holds a charge like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product for everything from shaving hair for wound dressings, to doing my own legs. (Ladies, I love this one!)&lt;br /&gt; Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> The battery on this razor isn&#x27;t very good. Used for about 10 min charged it and it never worked again. I&#x27;d recommend a razor that is a little nicer.</li>
            <li> Good afternoon, has not even reached my article</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy and bought it to trim down my underarms and nether regions and to replace my Remington Rotary. It works pretty good for hair. Not real good in tight places like your upper lip. Still have to use another razor or blade for that. Price was reasonable for my usage though.</li>
            <li> This item is OK.... Really not the best shaver. Doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;m  needing it to get. Search a little more before buying this product.</li>
            <li> The Remington BHT300 seemed to work fine when I first used it about 10 months ago. I was suspicious of the quality of something priced less than its competition. Then my suspicions came back each time I used it after the 1st time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it actually could cut through hair. Now with almost a full battery all it does is randomly cuts hair and then randomly rips it out making for a less than comfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who designed this thing were nice enough to give it a removable shaver foil and trimmer head, then forgot to produce that part as an easily replaceable part available in large quantities. Am I disappointed with this product? You bet I am!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of remiongton products.  But this Bodygroomer cuts very slow. And sometimes barely cuts.  Its made with good texture, And looks like the display. but It would take to long to use this product. It cuts very very slow so be aware. I would not recommend this to anybody. But all of my pass products from Remington cuts good and last long.  But this one here is a shocker, I was very Disapointed</li>
            <li> this groomer works great. It has quite a few accessories that all add to its value. Remington a good name and this item proves it.</li>
            <li> I love this machine it comes with 3 guards, cleaning brush charging cord and a full charge ready for use and it is soo Great that i odered a second one for my brother :)</li>
            <li> It does the job, but has a tendency to rip hairs out, which is painful. Did not end up using it too much.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets a bad rap on here! I&#x27;ve bought about one every year for the last 4 years and they work great to trim my hairy chest, stomach and back (about once a week). Sure after a few months you have to slow down as the blades dull but I find this much better than the basic norelco body groomer, which dulled much faster, tended to have the replacement blades overpriced and falling out anyways (and it was great at blood letting my collarbones). I keep two of these now, the dulled one for the nether regions I don&#x27;t want to accidentally cut, and the other for the rest of my body. Pretty happy with it to be honest, especially given the price.</li>
            <li> its alright for the price. As others have said, it does pull out hair and needs to be run over skin multiple times. Also could cause injury when used on mole, bump or uneven skin. works fine under water. could be made better.</li>
            <li> I expected more. but it is nothing more than a simple shaver. I use to shave my body and my balls are the big problem... and trust me, after this... i still thinking that shave with regular shaver is the best way... you have to take care, but is better. Electric shaver like this, required to pass more times over your body and start to heat the head, and let me tell you, this head when is hot.. AYAYAYAY... you do not want to feel it over you balls!!... it feels like &amp;#34;Chili pepper in to your eyes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby and then used it myself and I love it. Close shave with out the hurt. Charges quickly and lasts a long while. Easy clean too.</li>
