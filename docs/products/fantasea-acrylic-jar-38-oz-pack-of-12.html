            <li>They fit the bill.</li>
            <li>3/8 oz (Pack of 12)]] proved to be a bit elusive, mostly because we weren&#x27;t searching with the right words (\\&quot;jar\\&quot;</li>

            <li>Andrew colored half the balm with a bit of lipstick and left half without color, and both looked nice in these cute little jars.</li>
            <li>I could see these being fine for normal everyday use if you just wanted a smaller container to store moisturizer or something</li>
            <li>I brought four with me and only filled them up halfway, screwed them on extra tight and everything, and after my flight I opened my makeup pouch to see that literally all four of them had leaked.</li>

            <li> My son made lip balm as holiday gifts this year. He got the recipe from the book [[ASIN:0760338183 Simple Gifts: 50 Little Luxuries to Craft, Sew, Cook &amp; Knit]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had everything he needed to make his gifts, but finding these little [[ASIN:B000VHTU6C Fantasea Acrylic Jar 3/8 oz (Pack of 12)]] proved to be a bit elusive, mostly because we weren&#x27;t searching with the right words (\\&quot;jar\\&quot; would have resulted in better hits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipe Andrew was using called for 1/2 ounce jars, these are 3/8th ounce jars, and they were not only \\&quot;close enough\\&quot;, they were perfect: cute, just the right size, easy to work with and individually packaged. The lid screws on tight enough that ladies need have no fear of having the lid come off in their purse. Gentlemen, the same for in your pant&#x27;s pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom is perfectly clear, so it&#x27;s easy to see your product inside. Andrew colored half the balm with a bit of lipstick and left half without color, and both looked nice in these cute little jars. The balm recipe called for sterilizing the containers, and they took the boiling bath with no complaints or damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;d purchase these again, with solid confidence in the quality of product we were getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our four star (instead of five) is for the company shipping them -- they charged us DOUBLE the shipping price because we ordered two dozen, effectively doubling our price per jar. A package of 12 jars is so light that the shipping fee for one bag of jars would have easily covered shipping and handling 2 packages of a dozen jars per package. That said, we couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere locally, so we were delighted that Amazon once again came to the rescue, despite the selling company&#x27;s decision to add to the profit margin through shipping fees.</li>
            <li> Nice little jars. They stay closed, although I wouldn&#x27;t carry pills in them in my purse. Great for sorting small items.</li>
            <li> I used these for homemade lip balm. They filled nicely and do not seem to leak. Look nice!</li>
            <li> Love these containers. Great size and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> These jars work well, but I realized after I started to fill them (I use them for sample skincare products) the black lids are pretty unappealing. Good quality otherwise. Screw on easily and are sturdy. If they have them with clear lids I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> I made sugar lip scrubs for Christmas Gifts and these pots worked perfectly!  They look professional and even have a beveled lip perfect for putting a label on it.  The only issue I had was my order was short by 2 so they refunded me the difference for the two I was missing.  Great Amazon customer service as usual.</li>
            <li> These little jars come in handy for so many things. Herbs and spices. Lip balm and Lotion. Love them!</li>
            <li> great jars for a great price!  These are PERFECT for lip balm!!</li>
            <li> Used these to make homemade lip gloss at my daughters birthday party, perfect size!</li>
            <li> I bought these containers to make lip balm for my daughter&#x27;s 8th birthday spa party.  They were the perfect size!</li>
            <li> Great quality for price. I used for home made lip gloss. Great size for taking small amounts of cosmetics when traveling.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. They came packed really well and as quickly as it was said it should. They are durable and easy to fill.</li>
            <li> I really like this little acrylic jars. I make lip balm and often use them for those. I also use them for samples of my body butter and several other products. They are sturdy and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them coming loose or anything. I also like the raised lip on the lid. It makes it easy to add a circle label.</li>
            <li> Missing product, only received 10 out of 12. Beside that,  it was a ok product, just want my partial credit</li>
            <li> Just as described and also good value.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these which I used for lip balm I made for the girls at my wedding. Strong and not feeling cheap. Yet very cheap in price.</li>
            <li> These little jars are great for storing what&#x27;s left of concealers, lipsticks, etc. If you are like me and hate to waste expensive makeup, you will love these.</li>
            <li> These are HORRIBLE! I bought these for my facial creams since I didn&#x27;t want to check luggage at the airport. I brought four with me and only filled them up halfway, screwed them on extra tight and everything, and after my flight I opened my makeup pouch to see that literally all four of them had leaked. I could see these being fine for normal everyday use if you just wanted a smaller container to store moisturizer or something (although these are reeeeally tiny) but definitely not for travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making lop gloss with my daughter who had the perfect recipe. Perfect size.</li>
            <li> These jars fit my need perfectly. Not only for samples but for my EO case studies as well. I shop for price and quality and these were the best I could find on Amazon. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I love working in small patches and this was exactly what I was looking for at the time. They fit the bill.</li>
