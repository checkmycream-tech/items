            <li>This is a wonderful brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>For a blowdrying novices, this is a great brush.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Bio Ionic dryer for years and the brush is just as great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and I love the way my hair looks after using it.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>but I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to find this at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes!  </li>
            <li>Whoever designed this liked pain.</li>
            <li>great tool worth the price</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works like magic.  </li>
            <li>:)  A must for taming unruly hair.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone who touches my hair gives me that instant \\&quot;wow\\&quot; response, and it feels great to have my hair looking the way I always wanted it to look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my favorite brush and I loved how my hair looked and felt after blowing it dry using this brush.</li>
            <li>I think this brush is worth its weight in gold!  </li>
            <li>And my hair ends up full of static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first one is about 4 years old and still looks brand new and the bristles are still great.</li>
            <li>I own a small version of the Bio Ionic blue wave (square) brushes and I think it&#x27;s a great brush - it&#x27;s easy to handle</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in the roll brush, but styles out really shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>So much so that I ordered one for my mom and one for my friend as gifts after the first time I used</li>
            <li>Was a great medium sized brush to add fullness to my medium lengthen thin, semi-frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a fantastic brush—my naturally curly hair has never been so smooth and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush seems decent as it has not broken yet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush for a few years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>and that usually gives me a good enough grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have another, smaller, brush of the same brand, same kind, and it melted too.</li>
            <li>I purchased the extra large (I know it says Large in the description of this post</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super long hair, though,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for years and just had to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;EVERY claim the product marketing makes, it fulfills with so much ease of use, I can barely believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I agree that the smooth handle can be a little bit of a pain, I just focus my thumb and index finger on the textured part of the handle</li>
            <li>My main issue is that my hair is long and often it gets VERY tangles in the brush.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy hair and ordered the large size.</li>
            <li>too large for my short hair, I should have bought a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would give this brush 5 stars, except that as other reviewers have mentioned, the handle is pretty slippery.</li>
            <li>I like the Bio Ionic large round conditioning brush but with the long length of my hair and for straightening I wish I had ordered the xtra large.</li>

            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to blow it out), but for those with long hair, do consider the reviews mentioning the handle.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and sometimes brushes tangle my hair, but the Bio Ionic is smooth and never tangles my hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommed this brush to other people.</li>
            <li> , condition (avoiding the roots), and apply a small amount of Argan Oil product to my hair (avoiding the roots) and blow dry in sections with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My  hair feels healthier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> for my long, thick hair, and it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give the XL round brush a try</li>
            <li> Wow, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Not only is the grip slippery but the diameter of the handle is very small making it very difficult to hold on to the brush without exerting a lot of force with my hand.</li>
            <li> It is literally painful to dry my shoulder length, relatively thin hair.</li>
            <li> of my friends recommended this brush after my failed attempts with [very expensive, high-end] flat irons and NOTHING does what this brush does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too thin, so it hurts my hand to grip it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize that, sorry!)</li>
            <li> I would feel bad using it on my pets.  </li>
            <li> I probably would not buy it again, although I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible.  </li>

            <li> This brush is terrible.  I would feel bad using it on my pets.  Whoever designed this liked pain.</li>
            <li> For a blowdrying novices, this is a great brush. It is light and easy to handle. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I&#x27;ve used this brush for a few years now and love it.  My hair is very thin and sometimes brushes tangle my hair, but the Bio Ionic is smooth and never tangles my hair.</li>
            <li> Its not same quantity when I&#x27;ve bought at beauty supply. It doesn&#x27;t hold the hair as the one I bought.</li>
            <li> too large for my short hair, I should have bought a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also bought the miso brush , no improvement</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush.  It smooths the hair and makes it silky feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Bio Ionic dryer for years and the brush is just as great.  My  hair feels healthier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I own a small version of the Bio Ionic blue wave (square) brushes and I think it&#x27;s a great brush - it&#x27;s easy to handle and it glides through my hair. I thought I&#x27;d give the XL round brush a try and I regret doing so. I had read the review in which the reviewer presented the challenges associated with the slippery grip and I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal. Wow, was I wrong. Not only is the grip slippery but the diameter of the handle is very small making it very difficult to hold on to the brush without exerting a lot of force with my hand. It is literally painful to dry my shoulder length, relatively thin hair. And my hair ends up full of static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review on a product before - I have never felt compelled to - but this was such a poorly designed product that is now not returnable, and I felt it important to let others know what they&#x27;re getting into before they make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I would give this brush 5 stars, except that as other reviewers have mentioned, the handle is pretty slippery. It&#x27;s a bit too thin, so it hurts my hand to grip it. I don&#x27;t have super long hair, though, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal (it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to blow it out), but for those with long hair, do consider the reviews mentioning the handle. Other than that, it&#x27;s a fantastic brush—my naturally curly hair has never been so smooth and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for years and just had to purchase a new one.  It&#x27;s awsome!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> While I agree that the smooth handle can be a little bit of a pain, I just focus my thumb and index finger on the textured part of the handle and that usually gives me a good enough grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here goes - I think this brush is worth its weight in gold!  I purchased the extra large (I know it says Large in the description of this post but I didn&#x27;t realize that, sorry!) for my long, thick hair, and it works like a charm.  So much so that I ordered one for my mom and one for my friend as gifts after the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends recommended this brush after my failed attempts with [very expensive, high-end] flat irons and NOTHING does what this brush does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERY claim the product marketing makes, it fulfills with so much ease of use, I can barely believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who touches my hair gives me that instant \\&quot;wow\\&quot; response, and it feels great to have my hair looking the way I always wanted it to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to do is wash (focusing on the roots), condition (avoiding the roots), and apply a small amount of Argan Oil product to my hair (avoiding the roots) and blow dry in sections with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like magic.  I don&#x27;t even know what else to say.  If you have any questions about my personal experience with this product, definitely reach out to me.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite brush and I loved how my hair looked and felt after blowing it dry using this brush. But I have to give only 3 stars because it melted at the handle and is not usable. I have another, smaller, brush of the same brand, same kind, and it melted too. In the same spot.  Bummed</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair and ordered the large size. It&#x27;s perfect and I love the way my hair looks after using it. I would definitely recommed this brush to other people.</li>
            <li> I have another one that I purchased at a hair salon, it was much more expensive but I loved it.  I was very excited to find this at a great price.  The first one is about 4 years old and still looks brand new and the bristles are still great.</li>
            <li> great tool worth the price</li>
            <li> Was a great medium sized brush to add fullness to my medium lengthen thin, semi-frizzy hair.  The brush was heavy enough to straighten my hair and it dried quickly. Am going to purchase the largest brush as well.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush seems decent as it has not broken yet. My main issue is that my hair is long and often it gets VERY tangles in the brush. I probably would not buy it again, although I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  Still use them daily for blow outs in my shop.  :)  A must for taming unruly hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second Bio Ionic brush I have purchased.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it. Hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in the roll brush, but styles out really shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the Bio Ionic large round conditioning brush but with the long length of my hair and for straightening I wish I had ordered the xtra large.</li>
