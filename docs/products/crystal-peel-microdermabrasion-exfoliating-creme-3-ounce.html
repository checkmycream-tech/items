            <li>I use it once a week to get a great deep clean and polished look.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>This is such a good product I took the time to write a review.  </li>
            <li>This is a really fine exfoliator that makes the skin super smooth and ready to absorb moisturizer and serums.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fine with this, but you won&#x27;t believe how much smoother your skin is after you wash your face with the creme.  </li>
            <li>It will have your skin looking awakened and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have found it is great for ingrown hairs from plucking, those gross blemishes that form under the skin, and general debris.  </li>
            <li>the price is cheap for the high quality</li>
            <li>, skins feel very soft and light afterward.  </li>
            <li>its great, my dark spoots are gone and i feel young and fresh</li>
            <li>If you truly want to see the difference it makes, wash your face first with soap.</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th or 5th bottle, but it seems like the price is higher each time I make a purchase.</li>
            <li>Made my skin soft and silky and does a great job of exfoliating dead skin sells.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for everyone !</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>my re-order means it really works.</li>
            <li>feel it works as well as a professional microdermabrasion treatment...and a lot cheaper!!!</li>
            <li>Long term it keeps things even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried a few, I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>i get used to crystal peel at clinic , but this is give me the same results with low price ,,, i use it with vitamine c mask to let my face get healthy ,,, its good for large pores , the appearnce of skin but doent do any thing for scars,, i ve crazy scars</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this product when I was getting a microderm at a professional clinic.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt baby soft after .</li>
            <li>and I dealt directly with the girl in NYC for wholesale orders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>This is expensive, but the crystals are so small, it seems like a great product and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>you first use the creme go gentle because it really is abrasive in a positive way, but may be a little harsh until your skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see major results yet</li>
            <li>The soy soap adds an added softness to my skin that I feel this type of product (not just this one, the exfoliating type in general) lacks.  </li>

            <li> My skin does feel dry after use, but it doesn&#x27;t flake or get irritated.  </li>

            <li> Noticed lately that my skin needed a WAKE</li>
            <li> I think it is helping my skin rather than irritating it.</li>

            <li> I use this about 3 times/wk for a soft beautiful healthy glow, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and the results are outstanding. I highly recommend this for everyone !</li>
            <li> This is such a good product I took the time to write a review.  Something I seldom do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this product when I was getting a microderm at a professional clinic.  The technician said I might like the Crystal Peel for in between.  My skin has never been smoother.  Over time (like 2-4 months) you will even notice you also get fewer blackheads and your pores get smaller.  When I started using crystal peel, i was having a problem with sun screen clogging my pores. Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use the creme go gentle because it really is abrasive in a positive way, but may be a little harsh until your skin gets used to it. If you truly want to see the difference it makes, wash your face first with soap. My skin feels fine with this, but you won&#x27;t believe how much smoother your skin is after you wash your face with the creme.  Added benefit it is a 3 oz tube so it travels.</li>
            <li> Much better than drugstore scrubs! Effective yet gentle. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone. Effects wear off in 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser.  I use it once a week to get a great deep clean and polished look.  I also don&#x27;t use it alone.  I apply and work this product in then use a good soy bar soap, suds it up in my hands and wash over the top of the applied product.  I then wash off gently with a warm washcloth.  The soy soap adds an added softness to my skin that I feel this type of product (not just this one, the exfoliating type in general) lacks.  Of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a few, I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Crystal Peel by a superb aesthetician and have used it for several years.  It makes my skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time today and it is freaking awesome. It will have your skin looking awakened and fresh. My skin felt baby soft after . It definitely helped with getting rid of that dead skin and had my skin looking polished</li>
            <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t see major results yet (I have used a couple of times).  I did see an immediate improvement from the Oshi Clay Mask I ordered and would have to recommend that product over this if you are looking for a great pore product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and I use it 1-2 times a week to remove dead skins, skins feel very soft and light afterward.  Highly recommended, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> its great, my dark spoots are gone and i feel young and fresh&lt;br /&gt;and the price is cheap for the high quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the honor to meet the Founder of this company back when I lived in Hollywood, CA- during a SkinCare Convention.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issues with my skin- with enlarged pores; minor breakouts; etc... I have oily/combination skin. My husband has dry/combination skin... We use this exfoliant once a week. And the results are amazing... You can see the difference in your skin&#x27;s appearance after just one use!.. My husband loves it before he shaves. And it helps with a closer shave- as well as- have gotten rid of his skin irration.</li>
            <li> Its amazing , i love i love it💜💜 i get used to crystal peel at clinic , but this is give me the same results with low price ,,, i use it with vitamine c mask to let my face get healthy ,,, its good for large pores , the appearnce of skin but doent do any thing for scars,, i ve crazy scars but i dont care lol</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth and soft. Great beauty aid. I will purchase again when I run out. Helps with acne and lines too,</li>
            <li> I worked for a dermatologist years ago before I retired.Noticed lately that my skin needed a WAKE UP.&lt;br /&gt; We sold Crystal Peel in the office and I dealt directly with the girl in NYC for wholesale orders.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t know if I would find it but of course AMAZON had it...this stuff is great. LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;I feel it works as well as a professional microdermabrasion treatment...and a lot cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> This is expensive, but the crystals are so small, it seems like a great product and well worth the money.  Totally different feel that the drugstore scrubs.  I think it is helping my skin rather than irritating it.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product.  I have found it is great for ingrown hairs from plucking, those gross blemishes that form under the skin, and general debris.  My skin does feel dry after use, but it doesn&#x27;t flake or get irritated.  Long term it keeps things even and smooth.  I am a bit fickle and tend to want to try the newest thing, so my re-order means it really works.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is my 4th or 5th bottle, but it seems like the price is higher each time I make a purchase. $42 for this small bottle seems a little steep.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this product before, but I was looking for an exfoliating crème and was swayed by customer reviews.  I am so glad I purchased.  Made my skin soft and silky and does a great job of exfoliating dead skin sells.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It leaves my face smooth and feeling really clean. The best part it&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> This is a really fine exfoliator that makes the skin super smooth and ready to absorb moisturizer and serums.  It is the best I have used.</li>
