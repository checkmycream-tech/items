            <li>It wasn&#x27;t greasy or anything, but it wasn&#x27;t good either.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent of this lotion but found that it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I was hoping it would be.  </li>
            <li>Smells good...</li>
            <li>Loved the scent, loved texture, and loved the bottle size.  </li>
            <li>I already love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s so I knew this would be great.</li>

            <li>Im going to buy this product again for sure!</li>
            <li>the cherry on top, this lotion isn&#x27;t cancer in a bottle like all of the commercial-popular lotions!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Definitely glad that I made the switch to Dr. Bronners!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is too potent and doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great lavender smell, not too strong.</li>
            <li>I find that some product lines will have amazing products and others I dont.</li>
            <li>It smells great, goes on smoothly, and is refreshing.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when you fist put it on</li>
            <li>So nice to know this lotion is non-toxic.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent as well,  kind of like coconut to me.</li>
            <li>but was nice as a body lotion.  </li>
            <li>If you love lavender and good vream, then this is for you.</li>
            <li>So to each it&#x27;s own, I just wanted to share my feedback on it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the lotion is nice to have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because of the nice dispenser and lavender smell.</li>
            <li>smells pretty dang amazing!!</li>
            <li>particular scent (lavender and coconut) also isn&#x27;t the best..</li>
            <li>Super light and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It has received many favorable reviews, but I honestly don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li>I bought it hoping the good reviews were accurate.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better in the natural lines, and I won&#x27;t use the ones with toxic chemicals, so this one seems like the best.</li>
            <li>picky what I put on my skin, this is a clean nice product...smells nice</li>
            <li>love this lotion smiles great, goes on easy and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Great lotion with pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this lotion because I am trying to rid my household of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I probably will not buy this lotion again mostly because I do not prefer the scent.</li>
            <li>I love their soap but found the lotion smelled like alcohol and was sticky, I would not buy it again but remain a fan of Dr Bronner products.</li>
            <li>Love that it is not poisoning my body.  </li>
            <li>Smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>Product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>When I received it the top was coming off and the lotion had spilled out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with Dr.</li>
            <li>I heard great things about them, especially their fair trade and the no animal testing part, and it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li>A soap, if get the water mixture correct, can be used for anything from body wash to hair wash to washing laundry and more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this and using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this and using it.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell(huge fan of lavender)</li>
            <li>This is ironic, since the selling bullet points proudly point out:</li>
            <li>that almost prevented me from buying this lovely lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would love to reapply often because of its lovely smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I LOVE SHOPPING</li>
            <li>This lotion smells okay</li>
            <li>and it just dries on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li>The scent wears off after a while though :)</li>
            <li>I love everything about this lotion.</li>
            <li>Still one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, lotions, everything.</li>
            <li>Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap on my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t post many reviews, but felt I should on this.</li>
            <li>Not awful, but not pleasant.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells okay</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I guess I like it. :)</li>
            <li>and  will purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love it for my body</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s from Bronner&#x27;s (so it has all the lovely CSR).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell but the lotion does not take the dryness away from my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and lotion</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The lotion smells wonderful, and my skin feels super soft after I put it on :)</li>
            <li>People who enjoy the smell of lavender will love this.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li>It soaks into  your skin easily and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Safe, gets a ten on good guide, silky, smooth, absorbs quickly, smells lovely!</li>
            <li>If the seller did a better job, I give this the full five stars.</li>
            <li>ideal for dry, chapped hands.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells nice and I like the organic ingredients, but that&#x27;s where the positive statements end.</li>
            <li>Its a lightly scented lotion that feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a light lavender smell, but there is no coconut smell at all.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, but the lotion leaves your hands really greasy after</li>
            <li>Light, non-greasy lotion.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>Light emulsion cools and refreshes.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s worth it for sure</li>
            <li>I currently have Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Bar Soap and the Peppermint Body Wash in addition to this lotion and all of the products are great.</li>
            <li>, I put a light layer on during the day and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>Light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to your skin.</li>
            <li>Very light, lovely scent, leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light and fresh and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first bottle and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed at all</li>
            <li>The smell is great, smooth texture but unfortunately not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It moisturizing relatively well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It is especially great for those with normal or slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>Found it at Whole Foods for $7.99 and have not been able to find it for that price since.  </li>
            <li>A true lavender smell that lasts on your skin...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to those who love strong natural scents.</li>
            <li>It is best to use just a very small amount at a time or you will get a greasy after feel.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very surprised at the good reviews as this did more visable damage to my skin than commercial lotions with chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>My favorite natural product!!</li>
            <li>At first it seems kind of sticky but as soon as it dries it&#x27;s so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs better than other lotions I have, and it feels really nice and softening instead of greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many conventional, pre-made beauty products because of all the chemicals, I&#x27;ve been making my own.</li>
            <li>My new favorite</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I have a little bit of acne and oily skin and my face looks more healthy ever time i apply it!</li>
            <li>Smells great, very soft, but tiny bottle and rolls into pieces when rubbing into skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better than when I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better than when I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $10 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy over it, but it does the job,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved all of the other Dr. Bronner products I&#x27;ve used (bar soap, liquid soap), but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin right away, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>That is right, you can use it on your hair too.</li>
            <li>but is very strong scent left on your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic and I assume good for your skin as compared to other more commercial products.</li>
            <li>If the seller did a better job, I give this the full five stars.a huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn&#x27;t go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new.</li>
            <li>I bought the lavender coconut lotion and putting it on gives a nice cool subtle feeling like light peppermint.  </li>
            <li>I just love the fact this company follows the same values as I do.</li>
            <li>I think thid product smells funny</li>
            <li>Thus, one bottle will last a while, making the $10 price tag more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to buy this!</li>
            <li>Not my personal favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and almost have used up my 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li>Non greasy, will heal dry skin and good for sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose a lavender scent - and I am sensitive to scents - but it smells nice, natural, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering after you rub it in.</li>
            <li>The smell is also a big turn off for me, however I use it as a &amp;#34;FOOT LOTION&amp;#34; and it actually works pretty good on my feet.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is organic, so that&#x60;s great, but I would like a bigger bottle and other scents:)</li>
            <li>Knowing that this has no harmful chemicals and doing a much better job than the big names really impresses me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite different from the natural lotions and my own homemade coconut/shea butter one I&#x27;ve been using, but it does work.</li>
            <li>The smell, which I thought I&#x27;d love, is a bit strange.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner products, but this lotion is strange.  </li>
            <li>On top of all that and more, this company serves the country by giving 40% of its revenue to charities, schools or other public facilities to improve them.</li>
            <li>you feels super soft</li>
            <li>Not 100% pure organic if it contains ethanol.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>Or, I can just use the lotion and smell fresh and clean all day long.  </li>
            <li>I actually thought this would be an amazing product to use on my face, especially since I use Dr.</li>
            <li>It is very watery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>This really helps my sore hands &amp; feet.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are so simple, organic and natural.</li>
            <li>Useless as anything other than a very light scent and should be marketed more honestly.</li>
            <li>....find better lotions lip balms in other lines</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m crazy since all the other people are happy and giving out high ratings, but this just isn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful and is easy to apply (not too thick or thin).</li>
            <li>Between my own tiny half an inch trim - you say 1/2 an inch to a salon lady and you&#x27;ll geta huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn&#x27;t go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new.</li>
            <li>I also love it that just one pump of lotion coats half my body.</li>
            <li>However, I may have put it on my face 2 or 3 times and although it&#x27;s light (which I like) after a while my face felt really dry.</li>
            <li>Now if they make this lotion with a mild sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have the carcinogenic oxybenzone ingredient, it would be the ultimate skin care product!</li>
            <li>The first time i try this product i felt  in love with  the smell and the way it leaves my skin so moist and firm!</li>
            <li>highly recomend this cream</li>
            <li>I think the failing ingredient in this product is the high alcohol content.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>ok a little too liquid for me</li>
            <li>products aren&#x27;t just good for animals, people, environment and the wallet (a little goes a long way and a gallon bottle of their soap lasts for 6 months or so).</li>
            <li>The texture is not thick nor runny.</li>
            <li>It was too much for my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>I can only use it as I&#x27;m going to bed, and even then, in the morning, I feel the shower rinsing slippery residue away, like it never even absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very thin and seems to contain a great deal of oil as there is always a layer of oil remaining on my skin.</li>
            <li>so when I needed a new lotion I thought I&#x27;d try this one.</li>
            <li>It feels good when you first put it on, but a few minutes later I question whether or not I really even did.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and isn&#x27;t too thick like a lot of other creams</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Smells divine and makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and more importantly, it&#x27;s not full of icky chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have spent years and years applying so many beauty products to my skin and enough is enough!  </li>
            <li>As far as the lotion itself I have not tried it yet because I have not decided what I am going to put it in</li>
            <li>I know everyone is all about natural products.</li>
            <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t say that it is, but I think it&#x27;s a natural assumption from the name.</li>
            <li>As we all should know, we should use both lotions and oils on our skin as far as moisturizing goes.</li>
            <li>Maybe the customers who are left with a greasy residue used too much lotion.</li>
            <li>but I really missed regular lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to steer away from more conventional lotions with mass amounts of unknown chemicals, but this did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I ordered from this particular seller and received an open bottle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular lotion to try a different blend</li>
            <li>I like it because it goes right into the skin and is nourishing as well due to the use of coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>i sometimes use a little bit and apply it on my hair and then the next day shower and leaves my hair super moist!</li>
            <li>So far the orange is winning but the coconut is not that far behind.</li>
            <li>I would never buy this again and actually regret buying it in the first place due to the high price.</li>
            <li>However, it is such a light lotion that people with very dry skin have to use more than usual, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long; otherwise we&#x27;d definitely give it 5 stars for scent, feel, worry-free ingredients, and overall value.</li>
            <li>It is made of deeply moisturizing natural oils that make my skin feel like silk for hours.</li>
            <li>It takes very little to hydrate and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and you only need a little to go a long ways!</li>
            <li>These sellers even have the audacity to argue with the buyer over things that the buyer have clear evidence, beyond substantial (actual photos and such).</li>
            <li>My hair would feel worse after using those big top name brands at drug stores and such.</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY dry and VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>It is kind of runny; too thin to squirt into your hands without it running down the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin with a small dewy glow (like it looks moisturized!).</li>
            <li>I was going back over the ingredients and while I didn&#x27;t see alcohol on the list of ingredients, another part of the endlessly printed label (anyone familiar with the product will know what I mean) indicates that organic grain alcohol \\&quot;is used as a natural preservative\\&quot;.  </li>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t greasy or anything, but it wasn&#x27;t good either.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this lotion but found that it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I was hoping it would be.  </li>
            <li> Smells good...</li>
            <li> Loved the scent, loved texture, and loved the bottle size.  </li>
            <li> I already love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s so I knew this would be great.</li>

            <li> Im going to buy this product again for sure!</li>
            <li> the cherry on top, this lotion isn&#x27;t cancer in a bottle like all of the commercial-popular lotions!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Definitely glad that I made the switch to Dr. Bronners!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is too potent and doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great lavender smell, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I find that some product lines will have amazing products and others I dont.</li>
            <li> It smells great, goes on smoothly, and is refreshing.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice when you fist put it on</li>
            <li> So nice to know this lotion is non-toxic.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent as well,  kind of like coconut to me.</li>
            <li> but was nice as a body lotion.  </li>
            <li> If you love lavender and good vream, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> So to each it&#x27;s own, I just wanted to share my feedback on it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the lotion is nice to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because of the nice dispenser and lavender smell.</li>
            <li> smells pretty dang amazing!!</li>
            <li> particular scent (lavender and coconut) also isn&#x27;t the best..</li>
            <li> Super light and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It has received many favorable reviews, but I honestly don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> I bought it hoping the good reviews were accurate.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better in the natural lines, and I won&#x27;t use the ones with toxic chemicals, so this one seems like the best.</li>
            <li> picky what I put on my skin, this is a clean nice product...smells nice</li>
            <li> love this lotion smiles great, goes on easy and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Great lotion with pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this lotion because I am trying to rid my household of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I probably will not buy this lotion again mostly because I do not prefer the scent.</li>
            <li> I love their soap but found the lotion smelled like alcohol and was sticky, I would not buy it again but remain a fan of Dr Bronner products.</li>
            <li> Love that it is not poisoning my body.  </li>
            <li> Smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> Product itself is ok.</li>
            <li> When I received it the top was coming off and the lotion had spilled out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with Dr.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about them, especially their fair trade and the no animal testing part, and it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> A soap, if get the water mixture correct, can be used for anything from body wash to hair wash to washing laundry and more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this and using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this and using it.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell(huge fan of lavender)</li>
            <li> This is ironic, since the selling bullet points proudly point out:</li>
            <li> that almost prevented me from buying this lovely lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would love to reapply often because of its lovely smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I LOVE SHOPPING</li>
            <li> This lotion smells okay</li>
            <li> and it just dries on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> The scent wears off after a while though :)</li>
            <li> I love everything about this lotion.</li>
            <li> Still one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, lotions, everything.</li>
            <li> Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t post many reviews, but felt I should on this.</li>
            <li> Not awful, but not pleasant.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells okay</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I guess I like it. :)</li>
            <li> and  will purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love it for my body</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s from Bronner&#x27;s (so it has all the lovely CSR).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell but the lotion does not take the dryness away from my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it is ok.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and lotion</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The lotion smells wonderful, and my skin feels super soft after I put it on :)</li>
            <li> People who enjoy the smell of lavender will love this.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> It soaks into  your skin easily and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Safe, gets a ten on good guide, silky, smooth, absorbs quickly, smells lovely!</li>
            <li> If the seller did a better job, I give this the full five stars.</li>
            <li> ideal for dry, chapped hands.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells nice and I like the organic ingredients, but that&#x27;s where the positive statements end.</li>
            <li> Its a lightly scented lotion that feels really smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a light lavender smell, but there is no coconut smell at all.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, but the lotion leaves your hands really greasy after</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy lotion.  </li>
            <li> Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> Light emulsion cools and refreshes.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s worth it for sure</li>
            <li> I currently have Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Bar Soap and the Peppermint Body Wash in addition to this lotion and all of the products are great.</li>
            <li> , I put a light layer on during the day and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> Light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to your skin.</li>
            <li> Very light, lovely scent, leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light and fresh and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first bottle and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed at all</li>
            <li> The smell is great, smooth texture but unfortunately not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It moisturizing relatively well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It is especially great for those with normal or slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Found it at Whole Foods for $7.99 and have not been able to find it for that price since.  </li>
            <li> A true lavender smell that lasts on your skin...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to those who love strong natural scents.</li>
            <li> It is best to use just a very small amount at a time or you will get a greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at the good reviews as this did more visable damage to my skin than commercial lotions with chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural product!!</li>
            <li> At first it seems kind of sticky but as soon as it dries it&#x27;s so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs better than other lotions I have, and it feels really nice and softening instead of greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many conventional, pre-made beauty products because of all the chemicals, I&#x27;ve been making my own.</li>
            <li> My new favorite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of acne and oily skin and my face looks more healthy ever time i apply it!</li>
            <li> Smells great, very soft, but tiny bottle and rolls into pieces when rubbing into skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better than when I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better than when I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $10 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy over it, but it does the job,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved all of the other Dr. Bronner products I&#x27;ve used (bar soap, liquid soap), but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> It soaks into my skin right away, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> That is right, you can use it on your hair too.</li>
            <li> but is very strong scent left on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and I assume good for your skin as compared to other more commercial products.</li>
            <li> If the seller did a better job, I give this the full five stars.a huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn&#x27;t go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new.</li>
            <li> I bought the lavender coconut lotion and putting it on gives a nice cool subtle feeling like light peppermint.  </li>
            <li> I just love the fact this company follows the same values as I do.</li>
            <li> I think thid product smells funny</li>
            <li> Thus, one bottle will last a while, making the $10 price tag more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to buy this!</li>
            <li> Not my personal favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and almost have used up my 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li> Non greasy, will heal dry skin and good for sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose a lavender scent - and I am sensitive to scents - but it smells nice, natural, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering after you rub it in.</li>
            <li> The smell is also a big turn off for me, however I use it as a &amp;#34;FOOT LOTION&amp;#34; and it actually works pretty good on my feet.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is organic, so that&#x60;s great, but I would like a bigger bottle and other scents:)</li>
            <li> Knowing that this has no harmful chemicals and doing a much better job than the big names really impresses me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite different from the natural lotions and my own homemade coconut/shea butter one I&#x27;ve been using, but it does work.</li>
            <li> The smell, which I thought I&#x27;d love, is a bit strange.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner products, but this lotion is strange.  </li>
            <li> On top of all that and more, this company serves the country by giving 40% of its revenue to charities, schools or other public facilities to improve them.</li>
            <li> you feels super soft</li>
            <li> Not 100% pure organic if it contains ethanol.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> Or, I can just use the lotion and smell fresh and clean all day long.  </li>
            <li> I actually thought this would be an amazing product to use on my face, especially since I use Dr.</li>
            <li> It is very watery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> This really helps my sore hands &amp; feet.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are so simple, organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Useless as anything other than a very light scent and should be marketed more honestly.</li>
            <li> ....find better lotions lip balms in other lines</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m crazy since all the other people are happy and giving out high ratings, but this just isn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and is easy to apply (not too thick or thin).</li>
            <li> Between my own tiny half an inch trim - you say 1/2 an inch to a salon lady and you&#x27;ll geta huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn&#x27;t go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new.</li>
            <li> I also love it that just one pump of lotion coats half my body.</li>
            <li> However, I may have put it on my face 2 or 3 times and although it&#x27;s light (which I like) after a while my face felt really dry.</li>
            <li> Now if they make this lotion with a mild sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have the carcinogenic oxybenzone ingredient, it would be the ultimate skin care product!</li>
            <li> The first time i try this product i felt  in love with  the smell and the way it leaves my skin so moist and firm!</li>
            <li> highly recomend this cream</li>
            <li> I think the failing ingredient in this product is the high alcohol content.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ok a little too liquid for me</li>
            <li> products aren&#x27;t just good for animals, people, environment and the wallet (a little goes a long way and a gallon bottle of their soap lasts for 6 months or so).</li>
            <li> The texture is not thick nor runny.</li>
            <li> It was too much for my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> I can only use it as I&#x27;m going to bed, and even then, in the morning, I feel the shower rinsing slippery residue away, like it never even absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very thin and seems to contain a great deal of oil as there is always a layer of oil remaining on my skin.</li>
            <li> so when I needed a new lotion I thought I&#x27;d try this one.</li>
            <li> It feels good when you first put it on, but a few minutes later I question whether or not I really even did.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and isn&#x27;t too thick like a lot of other creams</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Smells divine and makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and more importantly, it&#x27;s not full of icky chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have spent years and years applying so many beauty products to my skin and enough is enough!  </li>
            <li> As far as the lotion itself I have not tried it yet because I have not decided what I am going to put it in</li>
            <li> I know everyone is all about natural products.</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t say that it is, but I think it&#x27;s a natural assumption from the name.</li>
            <li> As we all should know, we should use both lotions and oils on our skin as far as moisturizing goes.</li>
            <li> Maybe the customers who are left with a greasy residue used too much lotion.</li>
            <li> but I really missed regular lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to steer away from more conventional lotions with mass amounts of unknown chemicals, but this did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I ordered from this particular seller and received an open bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular lotion to try a different blend</li>
            <li> I like it because it goes right into the skin and is nourishing as well due to the use of coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> i sometimes use a little bit and apply it on my hair and then the next day shower and leaves my hair super moist!</li>
            <li> So far the orange is winning but the coconut is not that far behind.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again and actually regret buying it in the first place due to the high price.</li>
            <li> However, it is such a light lotion that people with very dry skin have to use more than usual, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long; otherwise we&#x27;d definitely give it 5 stars for scent, feel, worry-free ingredients, and overall value.</li>
            <li> It is made of deeply moisturizing natural oils that make my skin feel like silk for hours.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to hydrate and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and you only need a little to go a long ways!</li>
            <li> These sellers even have the audacity to argue with the buyer over things that the buyer have clear evidence, beyond substantial (actual photos and such).</li>
            <li> My hair would feel worse after using those big top name brands at drug stores and such.</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY dry and VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> It is kind of runny; too thin to squirt into your hands without it running down the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin with a small dewy glow (like it looks moisturized!).</li>
            <li> I was going back over the ingredients and while I didn&#x27;t see alcohol on the list of ingredients, another part of the endlessly printed label (anyone familiar with the product will know what I mean) indicates that organic grain alcohol \\&quot;is used as a natural preservative\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself just kind of sits on the surface of my skin and after a few days, it left my hands worse off than when I started.  </li>
            <li> A single pump, about a quarter size amount, is enough to cover my whole 4ft 10inch body, and a small tiny pump, nickel size amount, is enough to use on my hair, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have to constantly reapply it, especially to my hands, and they&#x27;re still dry.</li>
            <li> I did used a tiny amount of Wild Growth Hair Oil (white and green bottle) in my hair before applying this over.</li>
            <li> I did used a tiny amount of Wild Growth Hair Oil (white and green bottle) in my hair before applying this over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and you won&#x27;t find an organic lotion at this price!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> (note some dry skin is an allergy).(my second scent choice)</li>
            <li> The consistency is runny, and my skin is dry again before the day is over, especially in areas that get rubbed by clothing.</li>
            <li> On the nights with the BP, I feel my skin is a little tight after I put on the lotion, but that&#x27;s really just because BP is so drying.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is that it contains alcohol, which makes it dry before it sinks in sometimes.</li>
            <li> Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost it doesn&#x27;t relieve that dry skin feeling</li>
            <li> This is the thing that works for my dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m careful how I use it to make it lasts as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The seller taped the box and the plastic wrap, but not the nozzle of the bottle to prevent loose cap.</li>
            <li> My skin is not left tight or dry.</li>
            <li> If you have very very dry skin like mine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thinner than regular lotion and it smells like REAL lavender, not fake Glade/whatever crap.</li>
            <li> Even so-called colorists are shocked at how healthy even my ends are.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The cap was very loose.</li>
            <li> Got rid of my problem skin fast and no more issues on my hands, due to harsh chemicals from other cleaning brands.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my body minus my face.</li>
            <li> It has a thin consistency, but it feels very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Thin &amp; greasy, doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well</li>
            <li> I like the lotion, although it is a bit thinner than I expected it.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money if you need deep, long-lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> The amount of lotion that needs to be used is MINIMAL with the few different oils that are in this lotion.</li>
            <li> Normally, as dry as my skin is, I typically need to apply 3 or 4 coats of lotion.  </li>
            <li> I think I would like it in a less dry season; it doesn&#x27;t give you that lotion feel that even non-greasy lotions give you.</li>
            <li> Granted, a little goes a long way, but still I paid for 8oz of the stuff not 6oz.</li>
            <li> Granted, a little goes a long way, but still I paid for 8oz of the stuff not 6oz.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, just like the Dr. Bronner soaps.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronners, but I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Adds another layer to the other Dr Bronner lavender products.</li>
            <li> and it is extremely liquidy.  </li>
            <li> unlike some lavender lotions that have a funky, fake smell.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell this is a qualtiy lotion when you first apply it to your skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion can not be slathered on like other lotions.</li>
            <li> my face, I use benzoyl peroxide to deal with acne, and I use that every other night and use this lotion every night.</li>
            <li> The reason why I chose this product is because it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals like the other lotions have.  </li>
            <li> I had used other products from big name hair companies and my hair either gets very dry, fuzzy, oily, dull looking or my hair color alters dramatically.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how it has a 3.7 average rating or whatever it is.</li>
            <li> (it is happening everywhere, in fact)... but service and courtesy towards customers has gone down dramatically.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand disliked it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never read such ridiculous reviews...</li>
            <li> Typically I order the orange Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion.  </li>
            <li> but makes my skin really tight and itchy.</li>
            <li> Granted my hair is at shoulder length for some hair strands and just slightly at the collarbone for other strands, I do have tons of hair strands (in a small ponytail I have an inch thickness).</li>
            <li> was very disappointed, and still looking for the right natural hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> When i would shower the night after it was slick like it never absorbed.</li>
            <li> The product has a heavy scent of coconut and lavendar.</li>
            <li> One of the few lotions without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just dried out again (or</li>
            <li> Makes me feel one bundle of dried sage away from being a hippie.</li>
            <li> I can dress immediately with no oily residue to get on clothes, and the scent is not so heavy that it prevents me from using a perfume if I wish.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t discolor the hair nor make it dull as other lotions do.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to because this lotion is thick and creamy, but sticky &amp; goopy, too.</li>
            <li> That soap is multipurpose and a small amount is all one needs.</li>
            <li> No more ashy, scaly elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> No more ashy, scaly elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total fake out.</li>
            <li> It is not too thick and contains no chemicals or harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars due to the poor delivery and execution of the seller.</li>
            <li> Decided it is never too late to purify.</li>
            <li> It does not feel thick nor does it fee watery.  </li>
            <li> It is not amazing.</li>
            <li> I recently threw away all of my other lotions because I learned that they had hidden chemicals in them and that the companies had very bad child labor policies - but not Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li> It seems very thin and watered down with alcohol or something.</li>
            <li> this chemical up not a good one.</li>
            <li> This lotion only requires one application which really shocked</li>
            <li> It does hydrate your skin, but it leaves behind a sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and runny and was oozing around the pump bottom as well.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> and it dried out my skin badly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the result for the low score was the horrible delivery service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the result for the low score was the horrible delivery service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry, Dr. Bronner, this one&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> It breaks my heart to have to say this, but I&#x27;m not impressed!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking lavender like a baby nighttime lotion, you&#x27;re wrong!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I do dislike it.  </li>
            <li> Hated the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the packaging and shipping.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Pathetic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get those nasty side effects after using Bronner&#x27;s All-One lotion for the body.</li>
            <li> It is a terrible consistency and isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a lightly scented lotion that feels really smooth. It soaks into my skin right away, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this lotion because I am trying to rid my household of chemicals.  It has a light lavender smell, but there is no coconut smell at all.  It does hydrate your skin, but it leaves behind a sticky feeling.  I probably will not buy this lotion again mostly because I do not prefer the scent.</li>
            <li> Not 100% pure organic if it contains ethanol.&lt;br /&gt;Look this chemical up not a good one.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion! It is silky smooth and you only need a little to go a long ways! I use daily! Also a Great company to support!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this lotion.  I was disappointed because I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products.  It&#x27;s nice when you fist put it on but it rubs off like flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but the lotion leaves your hands really greasy after</li>
            <li> I love their soap but found the lotion smelled like alcohol and was sticky, I would not buy it again but remain a fan of Dr Bronner products.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells horrible. It is very watery. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This lotion deserves 5 stars.  It does not feel thick nor does it fee watery.  It has a perfect nice mix to it that feels good putting it on your skin.  Knowing that this has no harmful chemicals and doing a much better job than the big names really impresses me.  I bought the lavender coconut lotion and putting it on gives a nice cool subtle feeling like light peppermint.  This maybe my only lotion from now on.  I put it all over my body including my face.  Now if they make this lotion with a mild sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have the carcinogenic oxybenzone ingredient, it would be the ultimate skin care product!</li>
            <li> I recently threw away all of my other lotions because I learned that they had hidden chemicals in them and that the companies had very bad child labor policies - but not Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!!! The lotion smells wonderful, and my skin feels super soft after I put it on :) No toxic chemicals, no child labor...good stuff!</li>
            <li> but makes my skin really tight and itchy. It seems very thin and watered down with alcohol or something. Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy lotion.  Pleasant smell - not overpowering.  Love that it is not poisoning my body.  I have spent years and years applying so many beauty products to my skin and enough is enough!  Decided it is never too late to purify.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and isn&#x27;t too thick like a lot of other creams</li>
            <li> My favorite natural product!! Smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> Pros: It&#x27;s organic and I assume good for your skin as compared to other more commercial products. It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s watery and leaves a sticky feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again based on the sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s products.  So I decided to try this.  The smell is great, smooth texture but unfortunately not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> picky what I put on my skin, this is a clean nice product...smells nice</li>
            <li> The first time i try this product i felt  in love with  the smell and the way it leaves my skin so moist and firm! I have a little bit of acne and oily skin and my face looks more healthy ever time i apply it! highly recomend this cream i sometimes use a little bit and apply it on my hair and then the next day shower and leaves my hair super moist! Im going to buy this product again for sure!</li>
            <li> I already love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s so I knew this would be great. It&#x27;s light and more importantly, it&#x27;s not full of icky chemicals. I feel good putting it on my skin and it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Smells great, very soft, but tiny bottle and rolls into pieces when rubbing into skin. Overall, it is organic, so that&#x60;s great, but I would like a bigger bottle and other scents:)</li>
            <li> The lotion leaked during shipping. The pump does not work so I will have to put it in another container. As far as the lotion itself I have not tried it yet because I have not decided what I am going to put it in</li>
            <li> So nice to know this lotion is non-toxic. It is a bit watery though.</li>
            <li> Product itself is ok. When I received it the top was coming off and the lotion had spilled out. I was very disappointed in the packaging and shipping.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars due to the poor delivery and execution of the seller. I ordered from this particular seller and received an open bottle. The seller taped the box and the plastic wrap, but not the nozzle of the bottle to prevent loose cap. The cap was very loose. The seller didn&#x27;t even bother tightening the nozzle. Pathetic. Now I only got 6oz of the stuff instead of 8oz. I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I don&#x27;t know what is happening with Amazon and places like it (it is happening everywhere, in fact)... but service and courtesy towards customers has gone down dramatically. Seriously! It&#x27;s like these people don&#x27;t care for their work or something. If you can&#x27;t do it well, don&#x27;t do it at all. Let those who truly care have the job. These sellers even have the audacity to argue with the buyer over things that the buyer have clear evidence, beyond substantial (actual photos and such). I could go on, but lets get with how great this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with Dr.Bronner&#x27;s products. I heard great things about them, especially their fair trade and the no animal testing part, and it is made in the USA. Wow! Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has it all. A soap, if get the water mixture correct, can be used for anything from body wash to hair wash to washing laundry and more. A washing conditioner (haven&#x27;t tried it yet but will). Lotions of all sorts. I just love the fact this company follows the same values as I do. I think testing on animals for cosmetics is irrational. Treatment of employees should be mindful and respect, with dignity and fair pay. The product made in the USA that has ingredients I can read and know (I could make it at home). On top of all that and more, this company serves the country by giving 40% of its revenue to charities, schools or other public facilities to improve them. Putting money back into the people who use and support their brand. How awesome is that!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products aren&#x27;t just good for animals, people, environment and the wallet (a little goes a long way and a gallon bottle of their soap lasts for 6 months or so). I tried their soap and it&#x27;s awesome. Got rid of my problem skin fast and no more issues on my hands, due to harsh chemicals from other cleaning brands. That soap is multipurpose and a small amount is all one needs. This lotion is no exception. A single pump, about a quarter size amount, is enough to cover my whole 4ft 10inch body, and a small tiny pump, nickel size amount, is enough to use on my hair, especially at the ends. That is right, you can use it on your hair too. I figured since this stuff is basically made of the same stuff as Bronner&#x27;s Hair Lotion, I told myself after a shower, &amp;#34;Why not the hair?&amp;#34; A tiny amount is all I need. Granted my hair is at shoulder length for some hair strands and just slightly at the collarbone for other strands, I do have tons of hair strands (in a small ponytail I have an inch thickness). I have bleached out silver blonde hair, which I retouch the roots once month to every two months. This product doesn&#x27;t discolor the hair nor make it dull as other lotions do. I think it&#x27;s the oils within the product that add shine to the hair strands. My hair feels like hair after using this. I had used other products from big name hair companies and my hair either gets very dry, fuzzy, oily, dull looking or my hair color alters dramatically. My hair would feel worse after using those big top name brands at drug stores and such. I don&#x27;t get those nasty side effects after using Bronner&#x27;s All-One lotion for the body. After two weeks my hair feels thicker and healthier, even at the ends. WHAT!? Even so-called colorists are shocked at how healthy even my ends are. It is beneficial for these people to convince people to come to their place and fix the damage by chopping your hair off and recoloring it, so you can spend over $100 for their &amp;#34;kind&amp;#34; serve. Between my own tiny half an inch trim - you say 1/2 an inch to a salon lady and you&#x27;ll geta huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn&#x27;t go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new. Please keep in mind I did used a tiny amount of Wild Growth Hair Oil (white and green bottle) in my hair before applying this over. I&#x27;m so glad to have found this and using it. My skin seems to like it too. No more ashy, scaly elbows and knees. My skin looks and feels better than when I was 15 years old. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the result for the low score was the horrible delivery service. Granted, a little goes a long way, but still I paid for 8oz of the stuff not 6oz. If the seller did a better job, I give this the full five stars.a huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn&#x27;t go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new.

            <li> This is quite possibly the greasiest lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can only use it as I&#x27;m going to bed, and even then, in the morning, I feel the shower rinsing slippery residue away, like it never even absorbed into the skin.  I love Dr. Bronners, but I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this lotion.</li>
            <li> not enough of an odor...will look for another brand</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thin. It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this lotion and I love the smell(huge fan of lavender) but it is just way way too sticky! It is the most uncomfortable feeling for about 5 minutes when I rub it into my hands. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defect bottle but after two months now of trying to give it a chance I am officially throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I think Dr. Bronner must have been bought out by a larger company.  This is not the quality I&#x27;ve come to associate with the brand.  The lotion itself just kind of sits on the surface of my skin and after a few days, it left my hands worse off than when I started.  I was going back over the ingredients and while I didn&#x27;t see alcohol on the list of ingredients, another part of the endlessly printed label (anyone familiar with the product will know what I mean) indicates that organic grain alcohol \\&quot;is used as a natural preservative\\&quot;.  This is ironic, since the selling bullet points proudly point out: \\&quot;No synthetic ingredients or preservatives.\\&quot;  So, I guess it&#x27;s technically correct that there&#x27;s no synthetic preservative in the product, just organic preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Dr. Bronner, this one&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> I like all the Dr Bronner&#x27;s products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oils in the lotion, but do not yes it on the face as it will clog your pores. But as a scalp, hair moisturizer or body lotion....it&#x27;s terrific</li>
            <li> Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion. Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on. Try this and you will see the difference, moist skin at last. (note some dry skin is an allergy).(my second scent choice)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never read such ridiculous reviews...that almost prevented me from buying this lovely lotion.  It is made of deeply moisturizing natural oils that make my skin feel like silk for hours. I would love to reapply often because of its lovely smell and texture. Iit leaves no stickiness or rub off.  This is truly a fair trade, organic product that I will feel proud to buy.</li>
            <li> I find that some product lines will have amazing products and others I dont.Never just like one line..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love dr bronners soaps but dont like his lotions or lip balms....find better lotions lip balms in other lines&lt;br /&gt; I LOVE SHOPPING</li>
            <li> This lotion smells okay and I was excited to use it.  I will not use it again ever!!!  I put some on my arms and legs before going out to an event and noticed on the way there that the lotion was clumping a bit and sloughing off.  It made me look like I had dandruff all over.  Would NOT recommend this product ever to anyone! yuck!</li>
            <li> I know everyone is all about natural products. I think thid product smells funny and it just dries on top of my skin. When i would shower the night after it was slick like it never absorbed.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, but it&#x27;s not a moisturizer. I know it doesn&#x27;t say that it is, but I think it&#x27;s a natural assumption from the name. Useless as anything other than a very light scent and should be marketed more honestly.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and smells amazing! I also love it that just one pump of lotion coats half my body. Thus, one bottle will last a while, making the $10 price tag more tolerable.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle and love it. Very light, lovely scent, leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. As we all should know, we should use both lotions and oils on our skin as far as moisturizing goes. The product has a heavy scent of coconut and lavendar. Others will definitely notice.  I use this all over my body minus my face. I would recommend this to those who love strong natural scents. The texture is not thick nor runny.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this before. I&#x27;m really pleased. I will continue to buy! The lavender is great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so great! I don&#x27;t see how it has a 3.7 average rating or whatever it is. It has a thin consistency, but it feels very moisturizing. On the skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin with a small dewy glow (like it looks moisturized!). I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent. If you&#x27;re thinking lavender like a baby nighttime lotion, you&#x27;re wrong! I think this is a literal lavender scent, and I don&#x27;t smell any coconut, personally. The scent wears off after a while though :).And the cherry on top, this lotion isn&#x27;t cancer in a bottle like all of the commercial-popular lotions! Just try it and see!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this lotion. Super light and smells delicious. Awesome ingredients too.</li>
            <li> Thin &amp; greasy, doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! At first it seems kind of sticky but as soon as it dries it&#x27;s so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for summer or for those who don&#x27;t like to feel any residue from lotions or oils on thir skin.  It has a nice scent as well,  kind of like coconut to me.</li>
            <li> Quality value great organic lavender. Light emulsion cools and refreshes. Adds another layer to the other Dr Bronner lavender products.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, will heal dry skin and good for sensitive skin as well.  Found it at Whole Foods for $7.99 and have not been able to find it for that price since.  I am sold on it.  One of the few lotions without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is a terrible consistency and isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> Not fond of the smell and it is extremely liquidy.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Too watery and left my skin feeling &#x27;crackly&#x27; . Does not seem to hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this.  Loved the scent, loved texture, and loved the bottle size.  I on the other hand disliked it.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I do dislike it.  Hated the scent.  Too runny for my choice,  but was nice as a body lotion.  It was too much for my sensitive face.  Won&#x27;t buy again since we&#x27;re looking for a lotion everyone can use.</li>
            <li> I had bought it before. Still one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and is easy to apply (not too thick or thin). The lavender scent also helps to repel ticks. It is especially great for those with normal or slightly dry skin. However, it is such a light lotion that people with very dry skin have to use more than usual, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long; otherwise we&#x27;d definitely give it 5 stars for scent, feel, worry-free ingredients, and overall value.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, lotions, everything.</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY dry and VERY sensitive so it&#x27;s a struggle trying to find products that provide enough hydration while not creating a reaction on my fussy skin!  This lotion is AMAZING!  A true lavender smell that lasts on your skin...unlike some lavender lotions that have a funky, fake smell.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell this is a qualtiy lotion when you first apply it to your skin.  It takes very little to hydrate and absorbs quickly.  Normally, as dry as my skin is, I typically need to apply 3 or 4 coats of lotion.  This lotion only requires one application which really shocked me!&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY drawback for me is the price.  Yes, it&#x27;s worth it for sure but I&#x27;m careful how I use it to make it lasts as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;You can watch Dr. Bonner&#x27;s website for monthly specials as this lotion pops up once in awhile for a discount.  Otherwise, Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive on this.</li>
            <li> Wow! I got this as a gift and I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose a lavender scent - and I am sensitive to scents - but it smells nice, natural, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering after you rub it in. This lotion absorbs better than other lotions I have, and it feels really nice and softening instead of greasy.</li>
            <li> ok a little too liquid for me</li>
            <li> If you love lavender and good vream, then this is for you. ideal for dry, chapped hands.Recommended.</li>
            <li> smells pretty dang amazing!!</li>
            <li> I feel that of the few negative reviews on this product, most are coming from people who may be used to mass produced &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; such as the ones sold at Wal-Mart. This lotion is awesome! I currently have Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Bar Soap and the Peppermint Body Wash in addition to this lotion and all of the products are great. The amount of lotion that needs to be used is MINIMAL with the few different oils that are in this lotion. Maybe the customers who are left with a greasy residue used too much lotion. This lotion can not be slathered on like other lotions. A little goes a long way, just like the Dr. Bronner soaps. There is ethanol in this lotion, but it is organic and non GMO and it is used as a preservative. I don&#x27;t even notice it. My skin is not left tight or dry. I also do not smell ethanol. Definitely glad that I made the switch to Dr. Bronners!</li>
            <li> I actually thought this would be an amazing product to use on my face, especially since I use Dr.Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap on my face. However, I may have put it on my face 2 or 3 times and although it&#x27;s light (which I like) after a while my face felt really dry. The smell is also a big turn off for me, however I use it as a &amp;#34;FOOT LOTION&amp;#34; and it actually works pretty good on my feet. I know it doesn&#x27;t do the same thing for everybody so I&#x27;m not going to say, &amp;#34;Hey, don&#x27;t get this product it drys out your face&amp;#34;, because in actuality it drys out MY face. So to each it&#x27;s own, I just wanted to share my feedback on it.</li>
            <li> Extremely good product-great scent-light but nice..made my hands feel wonderful! Will be a repeat customer . Have already let others know about this great lotion!</li>
            <li> love this lotion smiles great, goes on easy and absorbs into skin quickly. leaves you feels super soft</li>
            <li> It breaks my heart to have to say this, but I&#x27;m not impressed! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m crazy since all the other people are happy and giving out high ratings, but this just isn&#x27;t good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost it doesn&#x27;t relieve that dry skin feeling you get when you need to moisturize. It&#x27;s a total fake out. It feels good when you first put it on, but a few minutes later I question whether or not I really even did. One look at my greasy hands, or seeing a greasy fingerprint on something around the house, and I&#x27;m reminded that I definitely did put it on and I&#x27;m just dried out again (or should I say still?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular scent (lavender and coconut) also isn&#x27;t the best.. The fragrance is too potent and doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to steer away from more conventional lotions with mass amounts of unknown chemicals, but this did not meet my expectations. I&#x27;ve loved all of the other Dr. Bronner products I&#x27;ve used (bar soap, liquid soap), but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough to combat the wintertime. I have to constantly reapply it, especially to my hands, and they&#x27;re still dry. I think I would like it in a less dry season; it doesn&#x27;t give you that lotion feel that even non-greasy lotions give you. It&#x27;s made to feel like you&#x27;ve put nothing on your skin, it just disappears. It is good for my face and neck though, I put a light layer on during the day and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products so when I needed a new lotion I thought I&#x27;d try this one. The product has a wonderful smell and it is all organic, and fair trade, which is awesome. I didn&#x27;t find the product itself to be all that moisturizing though. It wasn&#x27;t greasy or anything, but it wasn&#x27;t good either. It actually caused me to break out in eczema on the back of my hands. I think the failing ingredient in this product is the high alcohol content. The product has real potential, it just needs a reformulation. I&#x27;ll stick to my aveeno for now.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this lotion but found that it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I was hoping it would be.  Or as creamy.  I prefer the creaminess of goat&#x27;s milk lotion.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion, although it is a bit thinner than I expected it.  It moisturizing relatively well and has a pleasant smell. People who enjoy the smell of lavender will love this. I love that the ingredients are so simple, organic and natural. That is enough reason for me to continue using. It is best to use just a very small amount at a time or you will get a greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t post many reviews, but felt I should on this. It has received many favorable reviews, but I honestly don&#x27;t know why. I bought it hoping the good reviews were accurate.  Here is my take.&lt;br /&gt;* It is kind of runny; too thin to squirt into your hands without it running down the sides.&lt;br /&gt;* The smell, which I thought I&#x27;d love, is a bit strange. Not awful, but not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;* Even after rubbing it in well, within a short time I can feel dryness again. Almost like I never applied lotion.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s sticky. Doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed, and still looking for the right natural hand and body lotion. This is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and makes my skin feel so soft! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I like this. It is not amazing. It is very thin and seems to contain a great deal of oil as there is always a layer of oil remaining on my skin.</li>
            <li> A miracle product.  I love this, and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This really helps my sore hands &amp; feet.</li>
            <li> Love it! Safe, gets a ten on good guide, silky, smooth, absorbs quickly, smells lovely! Organic and fair trade! My new favorite</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many conventional, pre-made beauty products because of all the chemicals, I&#x27;ve been making my own. I was using coconut oil or olive oil as moisturizer but I really missed regular lotion. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but it&#x27;s so expensive I stayed away. I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to buy this! It&#x27;s worth the $10 a bottle. It&#x27;s a bit thinner than regular lotion and it smells like REAL lavender, not fake Glade/whatever crap. I love the smell. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and easy to put on. It dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy. I use this sparingly on my baby and my husband puts it on his tattoos. If you&#x27;re trying to avoid chemicals and need a lotion, this fits the bill!</li>
            <li> Light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to your skin. Smells okay but is very strong scent left on your skin.</li>
            <li> Too drying. Not enough moisture for me.</li>
            <li> Love it. I keep this in the kitchen and it cuts through greasy hands without drying and splitting my hands.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to because this lotion is thick and creamy, but sticky &amp; goopy, too. It&#x27;s quite different from the natural lotions and my own homemade coconut/shea butter one I&#x27;ve been using, but it does work. I use the castile soap for a lot of things in this house, so I thought I&#x27;d try their lotion. I am not crazy over it, but it does the job, so I guess I like it. :)</li>
            <li> It smells great, goes on smoothly, and is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not disappointed at all and  will purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> I use this as lotion and for my hair. Not my personal favorite scent. Always like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s though.</li>
            <li> No problems with ordering procedure.  I love the product.</li>
            <li> I smelled the alcohol as soon as I used this product and it dried out my skin badly. I could almost watch my skin crack and peel. It&#x27;s thin and runny and was oozing around the pump bottom as well. I am very surprised at the good reviews as this did more visable damage to my skin than commercial lotions with chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and almost have used up my 2nd bottle.  It&#x27;s long lasting and you won&#x27;t find an organic lotion at this price!!!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion with pure ingredients. The only flaw is that it contains alcohol, which makes it dry before it sinks in sometimes. I like to use it on my face as a tightener, but I need to use a lot of it on my arms and hands to overcome dryness. I haven&#x27;t found anything better in the natural lines, and I won&#x27;t use the ones with toxic chemicals, so this one seems like the best.</li>
            <li> I love it for my body and I love that it&#x27;s from Bronner&#x27;s (so it has all the lovely CSR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face, I use benzoyl peroxide to deal with acne, and I use that every other night and use this lotion every night. On the nights with the BP, I feel my skin is a little tight after I put on the lotion, but that&#x27;s really just because BP is so drying. I don&#x27;t have any problems with dryness, though, nor do I have any problems with it worsening my acne, so that&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The reason why I chose this product is because it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals like the other lotions have.  I love the smell but the lotion does not take the dryness away from my skin.  I had to use another lotion in order to get the satisfaction of taking the dryness out of my skin.  Otherwise the lotion is nice to have.</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin. Not at all greasy. Just wish it was scentless.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells nice and I like the organic ingredients, but that&#x27;s where the positive statements end. The consistency is runny, and my skin is dry again before the day is over, especially in areas that get rubbed by clothing. A waste of money if you need deep, long-lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> Great lavender smell, not too strong. It soaks into  your skin easily and is not greasy. I am always trying to find the perfect hand lotion and I think I have.</li>
            <li> Typically I order the orange Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotion.  I ordered this particular lotion to try a different blend and it is ok.  I might purchase this again.  So far the orange is winning but the coconut is not that far behind.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner products, but this lotion is strange.  It feels and smells like conditioner instead of lotion.  I would never buy this again and actually regret buying it in the first place due to the high price. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because of the nice dispenser and lavender smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and lotion</li>
            <li> Lite, moisturous.  Smells good... even to me and can&#x27;t stand perfume. Makes me feel one bundle of dried sage away from being a hippie.</li>
            <li> This is the thing that works for my dry flaky skin. Once applied it absorbs immediately. It keeps the skin moisturized for 2 days !!!!! If you have very very dry skin like mine you should get this</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My son got me this for Mom&#x27;s day and I love it.  It is reminiscent of days gone by when I used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s on him as a child.  The lotion is light and fresh and easy to apply. It is not too thick and contains no chemicals or harsh ingredients. I like it because it goes right into the skin and is nourishing as well due to the use of coconut oil.  I can dress immediately with no oily residue to get on clothes, and the scent is not so heavy that it prevents me from using a perfume if I wish.  Or, I can just use the lotion and smell fresh and clean all day long.  Highly recommend.</li>
