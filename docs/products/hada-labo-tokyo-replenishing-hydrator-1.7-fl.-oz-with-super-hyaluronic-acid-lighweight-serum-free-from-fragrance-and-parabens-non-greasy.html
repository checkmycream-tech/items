            <li>For the money, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>Best product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>Awesome sauce.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s moisturizes wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>For the price point, these products are very, very good.  </li>
            <li>Great under immuderm.</li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>do not wear make up anymore, but one of the things most impressive to me about this product was the claim that it can be used any time, even over make up, to bring a burst of hydration to your skin.  </li>
            <li>a good &amp; affordable (not gonna break the bank) hyaluronic acid product.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It might be a good product during the summer.</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and does a very good job of keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is very lovely to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; into the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you!  </li>
            <li>This is now officially my favorite moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer and has done exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li>and I remembered testing something with HA in it and loving it</li>
            <li>and it just feels so good, and helps re moisturize after mineral makeup and gives a dewy glow (love that).</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a serum than a moisturizer -  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for those of you who want a product that works and is not heavy.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was given a deluxe sample of this product and was not expecting much from it.</li>
            <li>plus makes my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li>The acids replenish the skin without being harsh and I can honestly say that I love this product!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin fresh, dewy, luminous and most of all, very well moisturized.</li>
            <li>It goes on super light and soaked really well into my skin.</li>
            <li>As far as this particular product, Replenishing Hydrator, I use it under my moisturizer and it seems to perform better that way....</li>
            <li>Light (almost watery) and clear</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I find them as good if not better than the much pricier Dr. Ci labo.  </li>
            <li>It really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really think it has improved my skin.  </li>
            <li>But this is the beginning of winter with much lowr humidity on the air.</li>
            <li>It feels like water and did absolutely NOTHING when I put it on my face or rubbed my hands together</li>
            <li>I think this is a counterfeit product I don&#x27;t think this is the real stuff at all...</li>
            <li>Using it on my face, neck, decollatage and hands - it&#x27;s worked very well.  </li>
            <li>But for less extreme climates with more reasonable levels of humidity, this should work great for any dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as noted in some other reviews, the pump of the product does dispense quite a lot - more than I have needed with any use, even spreading it to my neck etc.  </li>
            <li>Glowing reviews, and a 19 year old daughter who gushed about how much she would like to try this product, convinced me to order and try something I didn&#x27;t even think</li>
            <li>Left my skin even more dry than before I started using it.</li>
            <li>I read it&#x27;s possible in very dry climates it might not work because there may be more moisture in your skin than the environment around you-</li>
            <li>This and the hada labo foaming face wash are my new favorites.  </li>
            <li>product actually really surprised me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear liquid moisturizer, almost watery.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian and my skin seems to really like Asian skincare products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance and there is none which I like.</li>
            <li>I have oily acne/clog prone skin that is sensitive and dehydrated (which causes an over oil production).</li>
            <li>Half a pump is generally plenty, which makes using this product just slightly less easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>IF you are on the fence, it&#x27;s definitely worth jumping down onto the side of &amp;#34;go for it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I definitely can see that this would be so, as it applies easily, required no &amp;#34;massaging in&amp;#34; and takes but a few moments to soak in and/or no longer be wet.  </li>
            <li>I have dry combo and sensitive skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For the price point, these products are very, very good.  I find them as good if not better than the much pricier Dr. Ci labo.  As far as this particular product, Replenishing Hydrator, I use it under my moisturizer and it seems to perform better that way....even on my hands.  The eye cream is fantastic. Cannot believe how inexpensive this line is.....I am Caucasian and my skin seems to really like Asian skincare products.  I am a fan of Hada Labo now!</li>
            <li> I was given a deluxe sample of this product and was not expecting much from it. I had not heard a lot about this brand and honestly I am getting sick of products being hyped up when they are not that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually really surprised me! A little goes a long way and my sample lasted forever. It goes on super light and soaked really well into my skin. After using it for about a month I got a couple of comments about my glowing skin when I was not wearing make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for those of you who want a product that works and is not heavy. The acids replenish the skin without being harsh and I can honestly say that I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is now officially my favorite moisturizer!  Light (almost watery) and clear, this formula delivers!  It leaves your skin fresh, dewy, luminous and most of all, very well moisturized.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is the best.  It really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and does a very good job of keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Left my skin even more dry than before I started using it.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good &amp; affordable (not gonna break the bank) hyaluronic acid product. My skin is very dry and I remembered testing something with HA in it and loving it so my skin has just been begging me to find something like that again. I finally feel relief from the dryness. I used it over my mineral makeup and it just feels so good, and helps re moisturize after mineral makeup and gives a dewy glow (love that). I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance and there is none which I like. It is watery, and gel/serum like, the consistency I wanted. It doesn&#x27;t leave me any feeling of residue or stickiness. I&#x27;ve read a lot about HA, and learned it is water-loving and is attracted to other water molecules. I read it&#x27;s possible in very dry climates it might not work because there may be more moisture in your skin than the environment around you- so it could possibly draw that moisture out/to the surface where it can evaporate, leaving skin drier. I would recommend Argan oil or jojoba oil or a mix for such dry climates. It&#x27;s worked to keep my skin moisturized and glowing in dry desert environments before. But for less extreme climates with more reasonable levels of humidity, this should work great for any dry skin. I love this product. Found at Walgreens actually, under $20. Like $17? Awesome sauce.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all. It was a thin watery substance that felt weird on my face. I returned it. I prefer a cooling thicker cream to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an additional moisturizer to repair the moisture barrier of my skin. I have oily acne/clog prone skin that is sensitive and dehydrated (which causes an over oil production). This is an excellent moisturizer and has done exactly what I hoped it would do. It&#x27;s a clear liquid moisturizer, almost watery. It is very lovely to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; into the skin. This product has repair my moisture barrier and is usually the only moisturizer I use. I occationally on very dry days include Rohto Hadalabo Shirojyun Albutin as an extra boost of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the surface redness on my facial skin is much less than it used to be before I introduced this hada labo hydrator and the Rohto Hadalabo Milk in my routine. These are a MUST for me. Your experience my differ based on your skin type and skin type needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight. I have dry combo and sensitive skin. This hydrator can moisturize my skin in the day time during summer. I apply a gel cream whenever I need extra moisture at night.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s more like a serum than a moisturizer -  it&#x27;s thin and watery but it&#x27;s moisturizes wonderfully.  My skin gets that tight feeling if I don&#x27;t moisturize,  and this prevents that plus makes my skin super smooth.  No breakouts,  and I really think it has improved my skin.  Some moisturizers are too thick and I feel oily during the day but I don&#x27;t get that with this.  I think it&#x27;s hyaluronic acid that&#x27;s the secret.  This and the hada labo foaming face wash are my new favorites.  And I am 46 and like e in dry Colorado.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive department store brands,  and this is cheaper and better.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer. Good price. I love it</li>
            <li> Not at all hydrating for me. My skin actually feels dry after applying. But this is the beginning of winter with much lowr humidity on the air. It might be a good product during the summer. At this point I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is the real product because it doesn&#x27;t do anything- not even get &amp;#34;sticky/tacky&amp;#34; when you pour some in your hands and rub them together. It feels like water and did absolutely NOTHING when I put it on my face or rubbed my hands together DIDNT MOISTURIZE IN THE LEAST I used it for a week and zero... I think this is a counterfeit product I don&#x27;t think this is the real stuff at all...</li>
            <li> No wonder one is sold every two seconds in Japan.  Great under immuderm.</li>
            <li> Glowing reviews, and a 19 year old daughter who gushed about how much she would like to try this product, convinced me to order and try something I didn&#x27;t even think I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lives up to expectations, but I draw the line at miracle product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear make up anymore, but one of the things most impressive to me about this product was the claim that it can be used any time, even over make up, to bring a burst of hydration to your skin.  I definitely can see that this would be so, as it applies easily, required no &amp;#34;massaging in&amp;#34; and takes but a few moments to soak in and/or no longer be wet.  All that is left behind is a soft rose-petal like feel to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as noted in some other reviews, the pump of the product does dispense quite a lot - more than I have needed with any use, even spreading it to my neck etc.  Half a pump is generally plenty, which makes using this product just slightly less easy and quick.  There is not a strong fragrance, and has not ever irritated my sensitive skin or extremely sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is a keeper, with my only negative feeling about it being the amount of product per pump.  IF you are on the fence, it&#x27;s definitely worth jumping down onto the side of &amp;#34;go for it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you!  This has as much or more hyaluronic acid as expensive US brands.  Using it on my face, neck, decollatage and hands - it&#x27;s worked very well.  I recently purchased the &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; version on this product &amp; I recommend it as well.</li>
